Dean M.Kelley, director for religious liberty of the National Council ofChurches. ``It sort of Elmer Gantry'd all of us.''   Bakker was convicted Thursday on 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy. But before his resignation 2{ years ago, he had riddena wave of success, building a single television station the PTLsatellite network and a multimillion-dollar empire.   His crowning achievement was to be the Heritage USA Christiantheme park, but instead it led to his downfall. He was convicted offleecing followers of $3.7 million by overselling time shares athis ministry's resort hotels.   Religion observers were divided Thursday over the impact of theBakker affair, which has drawn substantial media attention sinceMarch 1987, when Bakker resigned as PTL president after confessingto a sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Church leaders at the Assemblies of God, which defrocked Bakkerin May 1987, declined to comment on the fallen evangelist'sconviction.   ``The church did what it had to do in 1987 and we feel we haveput that behind us and we are going on with the business of thechurch,'' said Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman for the 2.5million-member denomination.   The church last month established a 10-year Decade of Harvestprogram to evangelize 5 million people, open 5,000 new churches andtrain 20,000 new ministers.   James M. Wall, editor of The Christian Century, a liberalProtestant publication, said Bakker ``was using religion to sellhis product. I never have felt that it was religion on trial here.''   While the element of religion may have heightened publicinterest in the case, Wall said, ``It just means that theinstitution of religion, like the institution of law, theinstitution of medicine, has people in it that are going to takeadvantage of their profession to cheat the public.''   Others said the Bakker affair left more permanent scars.   ``The significance is that, unfortunately, it has disenchantedmany Americans with religious broadcasting in general,'' said theRev. Robert Dugan, director of public affairs for the NationalAssociation of Evangelicals.   But Dugan said Bakker's conviction may provide an opportunityfor religious groups to put the episode behind them.   ``If he had managed to get off the hook, it probably would haveleft the public with some doubts,'' Dugan said.   Though he compared Bakker to Gantry, the title character inSinclair Lewis' novel about a fallen evangelist, Kelley said henever thought Bakker was a charlatan.   ``I think that it has elements of tragedy about it in the sensethat he was, maybe still is, a very gifted personality,'' Kelleysaid.   The evangelist, could receive up to 120 years in prison and $5million in fines at sentencing Oct. 24, may have just beenoverwhelmed by the fiscal demands of his empire, according toKelley.   ``I guess it was kind of like juggling cannonballs, and he mayhave been distracted by some mundane temptations, and they camethrough the floor and brought down the house, as it were.''</TEXT></DOC>
