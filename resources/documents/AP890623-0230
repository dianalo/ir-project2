The projects range from four hotel-casinos to a downtown officebuilding and a massive golf course and resort development.   More than 380,000 Japanese tourists are expected to visit LasVegas this year, vs. about 300,000 in 1988. That is not lost on someof Japan's leading economic players.   ``More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeleswill also come to Las Vegas,'' said Yoshi Morichika, who is headingup a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japaneserecreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.   The project, in nearby Henderson, will include 45 holes of golf,2,700 condominiums, apartments and luxury homes, a dozen tenniscourts, a tennis stadium and a 700-room hotel.   Cosmo World has projects in Japan, Europe, Hawaii, Los Angeles,San Francisco and Tucson. It added Las Vegas to the list ``becausethe land is not expensive, yet, and there is a huge volume ofJapanese tourists here,'' Morichika said in an interview.   Jane Wilson, who handles international marketing for the LasVegas Convention and Visitors Authority, says Japanese tourism hasbeen increasing at about 20 percent a year, and is expected to jumpabout 27 percent this year.   ``If they come to the West Coast, we're going to get them,'' shesaid. ``In their culture, they want to go where a city is knownworldwide, where there are a lot of things to do such as shows,shopping, sightseeing, et cetera.''   The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estateprices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the cityare proving a magnet for Japanese investors. The Nevada DevelopmentAuthority says Las Vegas is the sixth-fastest growing metropolitanarea in the United States.   Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million bythe time it's completed in 1993.   Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hoteland Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-storyhigh-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtownLas Vegas. The cost, when completed in 1991, will be about $120million.   A group of Japanese investors have agreed to help Orlando, Fla.developer Bob Snow finance a $130 million dining and entertainmentcomplex known as Winchester Station. Snow is seeking a new site forthe project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked atselling their property.   Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe, who owns more than 30arcades in Tokyo, has invested $30 million in the Park Hotel indowntown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based SigmaGames, a gaming equipment maker.   Millionaire Ginji Yasuda has invested more than $120 million inthe Aladdin Hotel.   The move by the Japanese into the sophisticated gaming industryhas not been smooth.   Yasuda, a high-rolling gambler before he bought the Aladdin, hasexperienced financial problems at the resort in recent months,forcing him to dig for sources to pay back taxes and some suppliers.   However, one top Nevada gaming source, who asked not to beidentified, said Yasuda's license was up for reconsideration earlierthis year and would not have been continued ``if he had not beenable to meet his gaming obligations.''   The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressedproperties and kept them open ``and any stride forward is a positivesign.''   The Dunes and Aladdin had been operating under bankruptcyprotection for years before they were purchased by Nangaku andYasuda. The Park, the former Holiday Inn downtown, had been closedfor five years before it was refurbished and opened by Manabe.   Mike Rumbolz, former Gaming Control Board chairman who now headsDonald Trump's efforts to enter Nevada gaming, said the Japanesewere hampered because they bought distressed properties thatcouldn't make it under American expertise.   Sukeaki Izumi, who owns five hotels in Japan and Guam, recentlypurchased another closed property, the former Treasury Hotel, whichhe has renamed the San Remo. Izumi, who looked at properties inHawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, hascommitted $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel.   Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager ofthe Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanesecompany, in part, ``because the housing market is so strong here.''   Representatives of the company began looking for land in late1987 and selected a site 10 minutes south of the Las Vegas Strip.   Work on the Cosmo World project is scheduled to start in thefirst quarter of 1990. Several major hotel chains have expressed aninterest in running the resort, Morichika said.   Izumi, a millionaire industrialist, became involved in the hotelbusiness six years ago when he bought a property in Osaka.   He switched his focus here, he said, because the city wassmaller, the cost of living was lower, real estate prices were moreattractive, and he liked the way of life.   Izumi moved to Las Vegas in December and plans to run the SanRemo personally. The 324-room European-style property is scheduledto reopen July 1. Izumi has plans for a $30 million 16-story,340-room tower next year, followed by a second tower and expansionof the casino.   When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorneypredicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.   They did.   ``This area is very attractive to the Japanese businessman,''Izumi said. ``There is no other city like Las Vegas in the world.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday June 26</NOTE></DOC>
