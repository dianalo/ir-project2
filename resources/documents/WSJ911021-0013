The five-story museum was built between 1916 and 1926 bythe Japanese, who brutally occupied Korea for four decadesuntil the end of World War II. They placed the museumdirectly in front of the Korean king's palace, a move that,in addition to being insulting, is thought by some to havedisturbed natural energy flows and saddled Korea with 75years of bad luck.</LP><TEXT>   The government now wants the museum destroyed. But it'smore than simply another example of Korean resentment towardJapan, whose cars, movies, music and magazines all are bannedhere. Seoul wants the offending building razed to helpcounter the growing interest among many young Koreans inthings Japanese.   To Koreans, there seem to be two Japans, one evil, onealluring. Museums and television dramas regularly depictscenes of Japanese raping, torturing and murdering Koreans.&quot;It's comparable to certain countries' hatred for the Nazis,&quot;says Kim Jin Moo, a senior official at the Ministry ofCulture.   But at the same time, Japanese culture is increasinglyappealing. Korean students are flocking to Japanese languagelessons, while Japanese music and magazines are smuggled intoKorea and sold openly. Sales of satellite dishes to pull inJapanese TV programs shot up so quickly that the Koreangovernment asked Tokyo to change a broadcast satellite'sorbit, rendering most dishes ineffective.   There also is a growing infatuation with Japaneseproducts, which has implications for U.S. businesses. Thehottest restaurant concept, for example, isn't American fastfood, but &quot;robatayaki,&quot; which features Japanese-style grilledfood. &quot;It is now part of the Korean youth culture,&quot; says KangChang Min, who has seen 30 such establishments pop up in hisSeoul neighborhood.   U.S. cigarette makers, meanwhile, were surprised whenJapanese Mild 7 cigarettes quickly grabbed 16% of foreignmarket share after Korea reluctantly allowed imports ofJapanese tobacco. &quot;It is the same as the way the rest of theworld bought Marlboro to show they were like Americans,&quot; saysa U.S. cigarette executive. &quot;Koreans put Mild 7 on theirtables to show they want to be Japanese.&quot;   Trendiness aside, disputes between Japan and Korea couldhurt many other U.S. industries hoping to sell in Korea.Seoul is considering postponing a planned 1993 liberalizationof retail and distribution markets out of fear that Japaneseproducts will pour in. A similar concern about Japanese moneykept Korea's financial markets closed to foreigners foryears.   Korea's ill feelings toward Japan are fueled by fears thatTokyo will become a growing force in the region as the U.S.scales down its military presence. Seoul also is worriedabout Japanese economic domination. Korea is expected tocarry a $9 billion trade deficit with Japan this year, whichwould be almost 30% wider than last year's level. Koreanindustry, once thought to be a strong competitor againstJapanese goods, is slipping further behind because of a lackof technology and quality control.   Aware of Koreans' complex feelings, Japanese keep a lowprofile. &quot;We try to solve problems in the spirit ofcooperation and compromise,&quot; says Japan's ambassador toSeoul, Kenichi Yanagi. Trade disputes are raised, butquietly. Overall, he says, &quot;Relations are the most cordialand friendly they have been in years.&quot;   Although the ambassador denies it, Japanese diplomats sayTokyo plans to become more assertive. It is consideringcomplaining to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeabout anti-Japanese trade discrimination. One sign of change:Japan joined the U.S. in a GATT complaint against a recentKorean finding that Japanese and U.S. companies were guiltyof dumping low-priced chemicals.   Amid the swirl of contradictory feelings, the NationalMuseum has become the focus of the Korea-Japan issue. In atelevised debate over the museum's future, Kim Chung Dong, aprofessor of architecture, was criticized after arguing tosave the building. &quot;Tearing it down doesn't erase history,&quot;he said. &quot;By looking at it you can remember what happened. Wecan show the Japanese what happened.&quot;   An emotional debate ensued. &quot;They asked me what country Iwas from,&quot; Mr. Kim recalls. &quot;They said I wasn't a patriot,that I wasn't a Korean. Then later I got threatening phonecalls.&quot;   But tearing down the massive granite museum would beexpensive, to the tune of perhaps $200 million. The Koreansalready spent $150 million on another museum, south of Seoul,which was built to memorialize the terrors of Japan'soccupation.   That museum, the Independence Hall, offers an unrelentingparade of Japanese atrocities. Giant pictures depict massmurders as well as the &quot;comfort girls,&quot; who served asprostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Among the many dioramasare scenes showing a half-naked woman being tortured with hotmetal, a Japanese shoving steel rods into a man's head andKoreans buried up to their necks in the sand as a samuraihacks off their heads.   &quot;We could have shown worse,&quot; says Shin Hyun Ok, themuseum's public relations director. Japanese officials havevisited the museum privately and say, off-the-record, thatthey find it horrifying. But they raise no objection.   &quot;It is a fact and we want to pass these facts on down tofuture generations,&quot; says Han Young Soo, secretary-general ofthe Independence Hall. &quot;The exhibitions are just the tip ofthe iceberg.&quot;   His opinion on the National Museum building? &quot;Tear itdown]&quot; he says. &quot;The Japanese had a reason for putting itwhere they did. They haven't changed, so I can't trust theJapanese.&quot;   As for the future of Japan-Korea relations, things may oneday improve. &quot;Even though the Japanese invaded us, they aredeveloped now and we can learn many good things from them,&quot;says 13-year-old Yoo Han Bihn.</TEXT></DOC>
