But the reductions, which would replace much of the610,000 barrels a day the U.S. bought from Iraq and Kuwait,rely heavily on voluntary cooperation from industry, localgovernments and consumers.</LP><TEXT>   The plan, which puts inflating automobile tires at the topof its list of energy-saving measures, steers clear ofmandating consumer behavior and of the most controversialmeans of reducing the use of foreign oil, such as opening upan Alaska wilderness area to oil drilling or tighteningfuel-economy standards for new cars.   &quot;It sounds good, but it's marginal and it doesn't go farenough,&quot; said Eli Bergman, head of the non-profit policygroup Americans for Energy Independence.   The measures announced by the Energy Department envisionthat by the end of the year domestic energy supplies can beincreased 270,000 barrels a day and demand can be reduced280,000 barrels a day. Energy Secretary James Watkins saidmuch of the savings could be made within 90 days, quicklyreplacing the equivalent of 400,000 barrels of imported oil.   Mr. Watkins called the steps &quot;prudent&quot; but said there isno energy crisis. &quot;Today's supplies are adequate,&quot; he toldreporters.   He said the plan, which comes two weeks after Iraq shockedworld oil markets by invading Kuwait, is only the firstinstallment of steps under consideration by energy officialsand the White House. More could come as soon as two weeks, hesaid.   Officials reiterated the White House's stand that there isno need to dip into the government's Strategic PetroleumReserve, and they expressed confidence that other nationswill pump enough extra oil to make up for embargoed Kuwaitiand Iraqi oil.   Still, officials called on U.S. consumers to do their partto head off an oil shortage by making a few simple changes indriving practices.   Inflating tires on vehicles to the proper pressure wouldimprove gasoline mileage and save 100,000 barrels of oil aday. Surveys show about half of drivers' tires areunderinflated.   The government is also urging drivers to do morecar-pooling and van-pooling, saving 90,000 barrels a day withonly 20% more ride-sharing; observe speed limits to save50,000 barrels a day; and drive the most energy-efficient carif there's a choice. If one out of five two-car families inthe U.S. drove the car that gets the higher gasoline mileage,the U.S. would save 40,000 barrels of oil a day, thegovernment said.   &quot;It's the kind of things that are not really asking you toturn off your air-conditioning or turn off your heat inwinter, but simple things that can have an impact,&quot; saidDeputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore.   On the supply side, officials said that British PetroleumCo., Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. have agreed toboost production by 50,000 barrels a day from the North Slopeof Alaska, where they already produce 1.8 million barrels aday. Those producers also said that an expansion projectunder way in the Alaska oil fields can be counted on to boostproduction a further 90,000 barrels a day starting inNovember and as much as 140,000 barrels a day in six months.   The government will increase its production from U.S.naval petroleum reserves by 5,000 barrels a day by October,Mr. Watkins said.   But the bulk of measures the government is counting on toreplace Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil in the short term -- a total of215,000 barrels under its plan -- aren't guaranteed tosucceed.   The Energy Department, as reported earlier, will mediate aCalifornia dispute that is keeping 200 million to 300 millionbarrels of oil locked under the ocean floor. Mr. Watkins saidtop-level officials of Chevron Corp. &quot;are encouraging ourcoming in and acting as a facilitator&quot; between oil producersand Santa Barbara County officials.   Mr. Watkins said he hopes that the dispute over the PointArguello project can be resolved within six months and thatthe three completed offshore oil platforms, which have beensitting idle for 2 1/2 years, can be pumping 75,000 barrels aday by year end. They eventually could produce as much as100,000 barrels a day. The oil is caught up in a controversyover whether to move it by tanker or pipeline to refineries130 miles down the coast.   The Energy Department is ordering all its vehiclesswitched to gasohol -- a blend of gasoline and 10% alcoholfuel -- and other government agencies will be approached tomake the switch. The department is urging producers ofethanol, an alcohol fuel, to produce at full capacity. Thedepartment isn't taking any other steps to mandate wider useof gasohol, but is counting on increased usage to replace10,000 barrels of oil a day.   The government said it also intends to work with theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utilitycommissions to remove obstacles and possibly increasepipeline capacity to allow more industries to switch from oilto more plentiful natural gas. They are banking on the shiftto offset 100,000 barrels a day of foreign oil. Somedual-fuel plants have already switched.   Officials also are counting on persuading oil-producingstates to relax regulations on &quot;allowables&quot; that restrictcertain well production, for an extra 30,000 barrels a day.   &quot;It's wildly optimistic,&quot; said Ed Rothschild, head of aWashington lobbying group on consumer and labor issues. &quot;Ifyou want to talk about where the oil is and where you can getimmediate access to it, it's in the Strategic PetroleumReserve. It was designed for this purpose and it ought to beused for this purpose.&quot;   The Energy Department also urged independent oil producersto increase production. But Mr. Watkins said he doesn'tanticipate a reversal in declining U.S. oil drilling unlessoil prices of about $25 a barrel persist for six months or soand give drillers the incentive to make long-terminvestments.</TEXT></DOC>
