Images of bits in a Co-alloy thin-film diskand of laser-written bits in a TbFe film were taken with a magnetizedtip tilted at 45{sup 0} with respect to the surface normal. In both casesthe asymmetric part of the image of a domain is interpreted in termsof gradients in the in-plane component of the magnetic field. The bitswritten in the Co-alloy disk were decorated with small magnetized particles,allowing identification of the domain boundaries and the asymmetric componentof the force microscope image due to in-plane magnetization.</TEXT></DOC>
