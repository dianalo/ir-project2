Guenther, the Army's program executive officerfor communications systems, told the vendors at the conference, &quot;You must beupgrade-oriented because we don't have the money for new programs.&quot;andM;Braving the CrunchandM;The Air Force is also feeling the crunch.andP;  The service's software procurementis expected to cost as much as $3 billion over the next few years, officialshave said.andP;  But recent Pentagon personnel reduction proposals could reducethe beed for off-the-shelf packages within the service's Logistics andSystems Commands, if staff is cut by the recommended 15,000.andM;Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Robert H. Ludwig, commander of Air Force Communications Command,earlier this year predicted that neither the Desktop III or SMSCRC contractsare likely to generate the amount of business that Desktop II did.andM;Another factor is the attempt to initiate standard policies and architecturesto stretch the value of ADP dollars.andP;  The moves are causing what one Armyofficial called &quot;cultural trauma&quot; for local commanders who are used to havingalmost complete control over ADP purchases.andM;But some industry executives disagree that lack of funding is DOD's biggestproblem.andM;&quot;As the implicit manager for our defense industrial base, DOD has done anextraordinarily bad job,&quot; said Robert J. Hermann, vice president for scienceand technology at United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn.andM;Government program managers are not given a free hand to develop systems, hesaid, and procurement restrictions prevent most defense contractors fromattracting investment or being able to use commercially the results ofresearch and development they conduct for DOD contracts.andM;&quot;Funding is not the biggest problem,&quot; Hermann said.andP;  &quot;It is likely that ifthere was a reasonable environment for doing business the average defensecompany would make more money even if in the future the budget is smaller.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
