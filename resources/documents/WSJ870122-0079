The Big Board said short interest fell 12%, or 56,181,731 shares, to 409,286,890 shares. A month earlier, the figure was 465,468,621. A year ago, short interest was 266,578,847.    The record for short interest on the Big Board, recorded in the month ended Nov. 15, was 469.1 million shares.    The American Stock Exchange said short interest fell 0.09%, or 25,388 shares, to 27,632,052 shares, compared with the adjusted 27,657,440 shares reported last month. A year earlier, Amex short interest was 28,169,919 shares. Amex short interest reached a record 37.2 million shares for the month ended July 15.    A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock. While a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.    The seller in a short sale expects a price decline that would enable the purchase of an equal number of shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven't been purchased for return to lenders.    Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.    In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company's stock is to be exchanged for that of another, or for a new issue, in a proposed merger. The profit opportunity arises when the stocks sell at disparate prices.    An arbitrager may make a per-share profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.    The largest volume increase by far was Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., whose increase of 6.5 million shares dwarfed that of the second-largest volume increase, British Gas PLC. British Gas, which headed the volume list the previous month, saw short interest in its stock rise 1.6 million shares for the most recent month.    The largest volume decrease was recorded by Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc., whose short interest dropped 2.8 million shares.    Analysts saw this month's short interest decline -- the second month in a row short interest fell on both exchanges -- as a significant indication of bullish sentiment in the stock market. &quot;The pendulum is swinging in favor of the bulls,&quot; said Philip Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn. He said short interest indicators &quot;haven't been this bullish since August of 1982.&quot;    The Big Board short interest ratio in the latest period was 2.58 times average daily trading volume, compared with the previous month's 2.95. Adjusted to remove issues that are subject to arbitrage and examining those issues that are fully &quot;at risk,&quot; the ratio for the period through mid-January dropped to 1.73 times average daily trading volume, compared with 1.78 last month. The adjusted ratio is designed to reflect the degree of pessimism in the short interest figures.    Among the issues ranking high on this month's short interest list were some energy companies, utilities and financial companies.    The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-January or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-December.
