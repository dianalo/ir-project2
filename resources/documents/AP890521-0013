Student dissent has been gathering strength since senior leaderDeng Xiaoping took power and initiated his policies of reform inthe late 1970s.   The first open challenge to the government came in the DemocracyWall movement of 1978-79. The movement was so named becauseprotesters wrote posters demanding freedom and complaining about awide range of social ills and tacked them to a wall in westernBeijing.   Deng, seeking to wrest power held by leftists left over from the1966-76 Cultural Revolution, allowed the movement as long as itfocused on the wrongs of the past. When criticisms began to hitcloser to home, he cracked down.   Dozens of dissidents were arrested, including Wei Jingsheng, whowas sentenced to 15 years in prison for counterrevolutionaryactivities. Wei remains behind bars.   The harsh measures effectively muffled democratic dissent forabout five years. During the 1980s, students occasionally launchedprotests on their abysmal living conditions, the presence offactories and army troops on campuses, and crime, but they stayedaway from political issues.   In December 1984, for example, 5,000 Beijing University studentsmarched on the university president's home to complain aboutunheated dormitories and an 11 p.m. lights-out policy.   Dissent took a political turn in September 1985 when 1,000students congregated at Tiananmen Square to condemn what they saidwas Japan's ``economic invasion'' of China.   The authorities, disturbed when students shifted fromcriticizing Japan to talking about rising food prices andgovernment corruption, launched a propaganda campaign that stifledthe unrest.   But a little more than a year later, in December 1986, thestudents rose up again. In demonstrations and protests that spreadto dozens of cities, students demanded greater campus autonomy,less bureaucratic control over their lives and a more democraticsociety.   Tens of thousands flooded the streets of Shanghai. Beijingstudents staged all-night marches to Tiananmen Square.   The demonstrations ran their course in a month, and thegovernment responded with a chilling campaign against ``bourgeoisliberalization,'' or the attraction to Western liberal thinking.   Three leading intellectuals, including astrophysicist FangLizhi, were purged from the Communist Party for allegedly fomentingthe unrest, and Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,regarded as sympathetic to the students, was ousted by partyconservatives.   The pro-democracy movement again went underground.   It surfaced in June 1988 when 1,000 Beijing University studentsmarched to Tiananmen Square to protest the slaying of a fellowstudent by a gang of ruffians. Activists took advantage of thestudent anger to put up posters denouncing official corruption anddemanding democratic reforms.   The current explosion of protest was triggered by the deathApril 15 of former party chief Hu. Students took to the streets tomourn the man they feel was wronged by the party, but moreimportantly, to express again all they felt was wrong with China'spolitical system.   Mass protests have not been confined to students in the pastdecade.   Farmers have protested pollution and official profiteering;unemployed youth have marched for jobs; and people sent to thecountryside during the Cultural Revolution have demanded to beallowed to return to their city homes.   Tibetans seeking independence from China have protestedviolently three times since October 1987, and the minority Uyghursof far western China have demonstrated against nuclear testing intheir region.   This month, 2,500 Chinese Moslems, emboldened by thepro-democracy demonstrators, marched through the streets of Beijingto demand the banning of a Chinese book they said blasphemed theirreligion. It was banned.</TEXT></DOC>
