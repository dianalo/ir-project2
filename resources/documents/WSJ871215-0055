Terms of the agreement were changed from those announced when the company said it would buy the commuter airline in October, lowering the price of the deal.    Under the final agreement, Florida Express holders will receive one share of Braniff convertible preferred stock for each share of Florida Express. The company said the stated value of the convertible stock is $2.25. With about 7.5 million Florida Express shares outstanding, the transaction is valued at about $17 million.    Earlier, the companies had agreed in principle that each Florida Express share would be exchanged for one-sixth of a Braniff common share and one share of convertible stock. That deal was valued at about $20 million. The new agreement is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Florida Express shareholders.    The Pritzker family of Chicago owns 94% of Braniff's voting stock outstanding through its closely held Dalfort Corp., a Dallas-based aviation-services and smokeless-tobacco concern. Florida Express flies to 17 cities in Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and the Bahamas from its Orlando hub. </TEXT></DOC>
