Bribery and price-fixing scandals in the late 1970s were followed by massive 1980s losses in energy services. Last year, the New Orleans company took a $285 million hit on $1 billion in bonds by selling when prices hit bottom just before the market crash.    What more could go wrong?    McDermott's latest fiasco occurred in its trading unit, which had annual revenue of $1.2 billion but racked up $50 million in operating losses in the past two years. The company took another $27.4 million loss after deciding this spring to dispose of the operation.    Now there is a rumor the total losses from trading could grow even bigger before the unit is finally disposed of. Company officials deny it, and most analysts believe them. But the episode highlights McDermott's propensity for mishaps outside its two main businesses of marine construction and power plants.    Oil-service stock analyst James Carroll of PaineWebber says the trading unit &quot;has been a nightmare, a disaster.&quot; But based on the losses disclosed to date, he says, it is only &quot;a minor problem, compared to their other problems.&quot;    Spending $800 million on new marine-construction equipment after the oil boom faded made McDermott &quot;the biggest, highest-cost producer,&quot; Mr. Carroll says. &quot;They made a big bet on higher oil prices that has just failed to pan out.&quot;    Analysts expect losses for both the current fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, and the next, and say the main thing propping up the stock is its annual dividend of $1.80, a yield of 9.8%. Without it, they say, the stock could fall far enough to attract raiders to asset values some put at more than $30 a share. The stock closed Friday at 18 3/8. A group led by oil-patch buccaneer Harold Simmons took a 5.4% stake last spring, but quickly retreated when the company, which is incorporated in Panama, pointed out that he hadn't complied with Panamanian rules in buying the shares.    Some analysts are hopeful about a recent management change. Last week, a new chairman and chief executive officer, Robert Howson, took over from James Cunningham, who had held the jobs for nine years.    Suzanne L. Cook, oil-service analyst at Merrill Lynch, says the offshore oil-service industry is in the early stages of turning around. She says McDermott could gain new platform work if stricter safety standards are imposed in the wake of last month's North Sea disaster. And it is a subcontractor on the planned construction of 40 chemical plants in the Soviet Union.    &quot;To me, the story is the management transition and the turn in the business,&quot; Mrs. Cook says. &quot;McDermott is closer to pulling out of it than it has been in a long time. Particularly considering the 9.8% dividend yield, I think it's going to be a very good performing stock from here into 1989.&quot;    Some analysts have predicted a dividend cut for years, and many still dislike the stock.    Elizabeth Peek of Wertheim Schroder doubled her estimate of the current-year loss to $55 million last week, after the latest quarter's results were worse than expected in marine construction. She says the company should cut the dividend and put the money into new barges. She is neutral on the stock, as she believes any rebound in marine construction will be limited.    McDermott launched the trading operation in 1984 by paying $81 million for Coutinho, Caro andamp; Co. of Hamburg, West Germany. The idea was to buy raw materials such as steel more cheaply, and provide a barter mechanism for some customers in less-developed nations without easy access to hard currency.    Some analysts say McDermott wanted to act like a big Japanese trading company. It certainly paid big money. Karel Thyssen, the trading unit president, was paid $337,182 last year.    John Lynott, executive vice president, says McDermott did buy foreign steel through the unit, but &quot;other things happened&quot; to produce losses, such as steel prices falling. &quot;Volumes dropped in world markets,&quot; he says. &quot;Margins became very tight.&quot;    Mr. Lynott says the main reason McDermott discontinued the operation is that the company wants to &quot;focus on our primary businesses.&quot; He says that is why McDermott also is selling its insulating products group and seamless tubing operations -- not to support the dividend, as some analysts contend.    Philip Meyer of Dillon Read says McDermott's annual depreciation charges of $140 million easily cover the dividend. He recommends the stock for the dividend, the chance marine construction alone can earn $10 a share annually in five years, and the &quot;wild card&quot; of possible restructuring -- &quot;either internal or external.&quot;    ---   McDermott International   (NYSE; Symbol: MDR    Business: Marine construction, power plants -    Year ended March 31, 1988:     Revenue: $2.35 billion     Net loss: $261.8 million    First quarter, June 30, 1988:     Net loss: $33.9 million vs. $17.8 million*    Average daily trading volume:     412,758 shares**    Common shares outstanding: 37.2 million   *1987 figure restated to reflect discontinued operations.    **High volume due to dividend yield. </TEXT></DOC>
