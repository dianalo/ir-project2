Douglas A. Johnson, chairman of Action for CorporateAccountability, called for a resumption of the boycott at a newsconference, arguing that Nestle has failed to live up to theagreements it signed in 1984 that ended the original action.   This time, said Johnson, the group is expanding the boycott toAmerican Home Products, which it said is the second largestdistributor of infant formula in developing nations.   While urging an across-the-board boycott of the two companies'products, protest leaders are asking their followers to focus ontwo products from each company: Nestle's Taster' Choice InstantCoffee and Carnation Coffee-mate Non-Diary Creamer, and AmericanHome Products' Anacin and Advil across-the-counter pain relievers.   Action for Corporate Accountability accused both companies ofviolating at least the spirit _ and by Johnson's interpretation,also the letter _ of the World Health Organization and UNICEF Codeof Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.   The code _ which Nestle agreed to as a condition of ending theearlier protest _ permits donations or sales of formula fordistribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes, and saysthe formula may not be used for sales promotion.   At issue is whether the formula distributors effectively causethe babies to become hooked on formula within days of birth bymaking their product available for free at hospitals and otherfacilities.   Johnson's group, based in Minneapolis, says it is immoral formanufacturers to encourage the formula's use in powdered form inThird World countries where most mothers don't have the money,education or sanitary facilities to mix it properly.   The group says that thousands of Third World babies drink frombottles filled with drastically understrength formula that does notgive them the nutrients they need or infects them with germs.   Boycott leaders said the companies' actions have undercut thepremise that mothers' milk is best, especially for Third Worldbabies. Representatives of both firms denied the assertion.   Illness often occurs when the mothers take their babies home,Dr. R.K. Anand, a pediatrician from Bombay, India, said at the newsconference.   ``In the hands of the poor, the feeding bottle often becomes apassport to death for the young child,'' said Anand.   The physician said that bottle feeding kills large numbers ofbabies in India and other developing countries.   ``Even poor mothers can produce enough breastmilk for theirbabies for at least the first four months of life,'' he said.``Restraining on the aggressive marketing of infant formula isessential.   Janice Mantell, executive director of Action for CorporateAccountability, estimated that about $6 billion in infant formulais sold worldwide each year, half of it in developing countries.She said Nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of that $3 billionmarket and American Home Products about 20 percent.   Nestle, which is based in Switzerland, and the New York-basedAmerican Home Products are huge conglomerates with extensiveholdings and product lines.   Nestle's better known products, besides candy, include Libby'scanned vegetables and juices, Lean Cuisine diet food and theStouffer Hotel Co., which has more than two dozen hotels andresorts in the United States.   American Home sells Today Condoms, Preparation H, Dristan anddozens of over-the-counter drugs, and food products ranging fromChef Boyardee Pizzas to Jiffy Pop Popcorn.   A Washington spokesman for Nestle, Thad Jackson, insisted thatthe company is in ``total compliance'' with national andinternational codes. He also denied that the company is dumpinginfant formula in foreign hospitals and said it never gives theproduct directly to mothers.   ``We do not dump supplies in hospitals,'' said Jackson. ``Weonly supply materials at their request, and in appropriateamounts.''   He said if the supplies requested by the hospitals fordistribution seems ``excessive then we contact the hospital.''   Carol Emerling, a spokewoman for American Home Products, said,``This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate theWHO code _ and we flat out deny it.''   Ms. Emerling said the company believes that breast-feeding isbest for infants.   ``But every infant who is not receiving breast milk has theright to the best alternative available. That alternative is ascientifically formulated infant formula that is as close to breastmilk as man can make it. And that is what our infant formulaproducts are.''</TEXT></DOC>
