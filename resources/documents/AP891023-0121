Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accused Mrs. Thatcher ofignoring a cherished British tradition, ``fair play,'' when sheissued a dissenting statement against plans by the 49-nationCommonwealth to pressure South Africa on reform.   ``The price of Commonwealth membership is loyalty,'' Mulroneytold her as the presidents and prime ministers of ex-coloniesgathered round the conference table in closed session Monday, thesecond-last day of the weeklong summit.   Australia's Bob Hawke said: ``This is not the way businessshould be done.''   Mrs. Thatcher responded that she was ``astounded and utterlyappalled'' at the attacks and owed the other leaders ``noexplanation whatsoever.'   The anger provoked by what was a matter of procedure, notsubstance, reflected the deep frustration in the largely ThirdWorld organization over what its sees as Mrs. Thatcher's constantobstruction of the fight against apartheid.   South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 under threat of beingthrown out because of its apartheid policy, which denies the blackmajority the vote. Britain, a major South African trading partner,argues sanctions hurt the black majority and increase whiteresistance to change.   South Africa's deeply hostile black southern African neighbors,mostly Commonwealth members, also continue trading because theydepend economically on South Africa.   Mrs. Thatcher has refused to impose most of a list of 11non-binding Commonwealth embargoes against South Africa, includingbans on air links, new investment, and imports of agriculturalproducts, iron, steel, coal and urnanium. It was drawn up in 1986after Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the other white foundingmembers joined the effort.   The new South Africa declaration was drafted by 10 foreignministers after 17 hours of tough negotiations. British ForeignSecretary John Major argued that moves toward reform by SouthAfrica's new president, F.W. de Klerk, made sanctions especiallyinappropriate now.   Everyone compromised a bit _ the British agreed that currentembargoes should not be lifted and African nations held off demandsfor new trade sanctions. The final document called for tighterfinancial pressure, but that other sanctions would be consideredonly if the white-led government fails to take measures dismantlingapartheid in the next six months.   The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that theCommonwealth call on international banks to restrict South Africantrade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to makeit more difficult for South Africa to get credits.   They all signed on Sunday, with Mrs. Thatcher personallyproposing its adoption. She didn't mention that within an hourshe'd be releasing a five-page statement setting out her objectionsto sanctions and crediting the South African government with``important and positive changes.''   It was this tactic that angered Hawke and Mulroney, the mainauthors of the report.   ``Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' Mulroney said,speaking to reporters. ``You sign a deal at 5 o'clock and repudiateit at six ... (saying) by the way, what I signed really doesn'treflect all my views.''   ``I think it's despicable,'' said Zimbabwe President RobertMugabe, whose country, however, is among those that has continuedtrading with neighboring South Africa. ``What turns out to be themajority view should bind us all _ that's how democratic systemswork.''   On the environment, the Commonwealth issued a declarationSaturday calling for assurances that poor countries are not blamedfor problems beyond their control nor shortchanged in the fightagainst global pollution.   Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said industrializedcountries in the West cause most pollution while poor countries areasked to stop cutting down trees and take other measures to protectthe environment.   ``The deserts of the world can be made to bloom if the richcountries are prepared to spend money to draw up underground waterand plant trees instead of just building golf courses'' inCalifornia deserts, he said, without elaborating.   Referring to fears that pollution-caused global warming couldmelt polar ice and raise sea levels, Maldives President MaumoonAbdul Gayoom said his Indian Ocean island nation was willing tohost the Commonwealth summit in the year 2050 but might have to doit underwater.</TEXT></DOC>
