The target of their wrath? Their own employer, Kidder Peabody.    Since October's minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes.    But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market. The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards. Program trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace. The evidence indicates that program trading didn't, in fact, cause the market's sharp fall on Oct. 13, though it may have exacerbated it.    On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges. These are the main proponents of program trading.    Defending their ramparts are Wall Street's Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange's listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks.    So far, Wall Street's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle, successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors.    The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading.    Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days. A few, such as giant Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients.    The Old Guard's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based, in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake. Some, such as traditional money manager Neuberger andamp; Berman, have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators &quot;stop the numbers racket on Wall Street.&quot;    Big Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading.    Charles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received &quot;countless&quot; letters offering support. &quot;They said universally, without a single exception: Don't even compromise. Kill it,&quot; he says.    Wall Street's New Guard isn't likely to take all this lying down for long, however. Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable. Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them. What's more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it.    Even some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard. Last week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders' organization, surrendered. He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines, rather than people. He said the exchange is &quot;headed for a real crisis&quot; if program trading isn't curbed.    &quot;I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino,&quot; Mr. Bradley wrote.    The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations, causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee. At Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm's program traders a few floors away. Corporations like Contel denounce program trading, yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders.    The Big Board -- the nation's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives. Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs. But the Big Board's leadership -- over the specialists' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock &quot;basket&quot; product designed to facilitate program trading. &quot;A lot of people would like to go back to 1970,&quot; before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week. &quot;I would like to go back to 1970. But we are not going back to 1970.&quot;    Again and again, program-trading's critics raise the &quot;casino&quot; theme. They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation's free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. &quot;The public didn't come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that,&quot; says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm.    The program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry. Critics like Mr. Murray &quot;are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman,&quot; says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. &quot;Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection.&quot;    For all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading. Like other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets.    That divergence is what stock index traders seek. When it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit.    Such program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds. A program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000. To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find.    The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise. &quot;If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds,&quot; says Larry Zicklin, managing partner at Neuberger andamp; Berman.    But many experts and traders say that program trading isn't the main reason for stock-market gyrations. &quot;I have not seen one iota of evidence&quot; to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject. Says the Big Board's Mr. Phelan, &quot;Volatility is greater than program trading.&quot;    The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had. While program trades swiftly kicked in, a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible. Susan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring &quot;the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility.&quot; Many arbs are &quot;overleveraged,&quot; she says, and they &quot;have to sell when things look like they fall apart.&quot;    Like virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years. Take the traditional money managers, or &quot;stock pickers,&quot; as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys. Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $100 they manage for big institutional investors, and higher fees for smaller investors. Yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with, much less beat, the returns of standard benchmarks like the Sandamp;P 500.    Not surprisingly, old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the Sandamp;P 500. The indexers charge only a few pennies per $100 managed. Today, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds.    The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms. These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks. The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell.    And they believe the Big Board, under Mr. Phelan, has abandoned their interest. The son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets.    Meanwhile, specialists' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility. &quot;When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go&quot; on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there. &quot;The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone&quot; as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends.    No one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation's stockbrokers. They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market's swings since then. &quot;Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death,&quot; says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore. Stockbrokers' business and pay has been falling. Last year, the average broker earned $71,309, 24% lower than in 1987.    Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket. Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 often don't even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp. &quot;Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs? Oh, you're in the paper business,&quot; is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he's gotten from his big institutional shareholders.    By this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily trading volume. Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc. But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard, particularly against index arbitrage. The indexers' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die. &quot;There's a lynch-mob psychology right now,&quot; says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm. &quot;Wall Street's cash cow has been gored, but I don't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem.&quot;    Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up. For example, stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982, and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched. Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s. Now, on a good day, Chicago's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock.    Now the stage is set for the battle to play out. The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress. Program traders' &quot;power to create total panic is so great that they can't be allowed to have their way,&quot; says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. &quot;We have to have a system that says to those largest investors: `Sit down] You will not panic, you will not put the financial system in jeopardy.'&quot;    But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon. Many people, including the Big Board, think that it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle. The Big Board's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn't being considered, Big Board officials say.    &quot;You're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks,&quot; says Vanderbilt's Prof. Stoll. &quot;Program trading is here to stay, and computers are here to stay, and we just need to understand it.&quot;    Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't.    One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the &quot;good-faith&quot; payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks. Currently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative. Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins.    Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active. Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say.    Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an &quot;uptick rule&quot;a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers. The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price.    But in 1986, program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations, to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets. A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably. Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the &quot;pricing efficiency&quot; of the futures and stock markets.    ---   James A.
