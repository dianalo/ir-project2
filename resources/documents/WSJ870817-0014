The Tampa, Fla.-based home builder and building materials concern agreed late Wednesday to be acquired in a leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. for $60 a share, or $2.44 billion. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Jim Walter shares closed Friday at $60.50, up 62.5 cents, on volume of 1,670,900 shares.    The agreement came despite higher bids for the company by PaineWebber, a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc. Jack Perkowski, director of investment banking at PaineWebber, said Friday that the New York-based firm was &quot;examining all of our options.&quot;    He said, however, that PaineWebber couldn't make a hostile bid for Jim Walter without violating a confidentiality agreement PaineWebber had signed, prohibiting such action. Although it is unlikely, the Jim Walter board could waive that part of the agreement.    As previously reported, PaineWebber said it had proposed to acquire Jim Walter for $69 a share, or $2.8 billion. That bid consisted of $60 in cash, $5 in subordinated debt securities and $4 in equity securities.    PaineWebber said it temporarily withdrew the bid Wednesday after James Walter, chairman, and several other Jim Walter managers told PaineWebber that the buy-out bid was too aggressive and that Jim Walter management wouldn't participate.    PaineWebber then made a bid, along with Jasper, Ala.-based Drummond Co., of $62 a share -- $52 in cash and $10 in securities -- or $2.52 billion.    Under its definitive buy-out pact, Kohlberg Kravis, a New York investment concern that specializes in leveraged buy-outs, will begin a tender offer by Wednesday for all of the Jim Walter shares outstanding.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
