 We attribute this ability to the expert's intelligence.andP;  Weexpect, for example, a physician to diagnose our state of health based on afew simple and sometimes inaccurate observations.andP;  Computers don't have theseskills; most of us would never expect a program to complete its computationssuccessfully when the computer's required data isn't available or might notbe accurate.andP;  A goal of intelligent expert software is to provide a systemwith the human capability to make competent decisions with uncertain data.andM;Input data can be &quot;uncertain&quot; in several ways.andP;  Required data may be missing;if available, it may be unreliable due to measurement error; or it mayrepresent merely the user's &quot;best guess.&quot;andP;  Data may also be uncertain when itis the result of multiple conflicting measurements.andP;  Finally, therepresentation of the data may be imprecise.andM;While these sources of uncertainty affect the nature of the input data, theexpert-system rules themselves may also be uncertain; they may represent thebest guesses of experts and may not be appropriate in all situations.andP;  Suchrules usually include imprecise terms such as possible, plausible, probable,likely, or suspected.andP;  For example, a rule in a medical diagnostic systemcould be:andM;IF symptom A is present and symptom B is present THEN disease A is probable.andM;Similarly, these two rules could be part of a homicide expert system designedto determine if a suspect had the opportunity to commit the crime:andM;RULE 1: If the suspect was last seen with the victim Then the suspect hadopportunity RULE 2: If the suspect whereabouts were unknown at the time ofthe crime Then the suspect had opportunityandM;Both rules are presented with equal strength, yet appear to be fundamentallydifferent.andP;  Rule 1 determines that the suspect had opportunity if they werethe last person seen with the victim.andP;  Rule 2, however, assigns opportunityto the suspect simply due to lack of an alibi.andP;  None of us would like to beconvicted of a crime simply on the basis of Rule 2; the expert system shouldreflect that Rule 1 is stronger evidence.andM;The attempt to add an uncertainty-management capability to an expert systemraises three issues: how to represent uncertain data, combine two or morepieces of uncertain data, and draw inferences using uncertain data.andM;A POSSIBLE APPROACHandM;The Dempster-Shafer belief calculus is designed to function as amathermatical theory of evidence.andP;  The calculus assigns a number between 0-1to represent the degree of support a body of evidence provides for aproposition.andP;  In this way, the calculus resembles Bayesian probability but ismore general.andP;  Probability theory requires that the probability of theoccurrence of an event, P(A), and the probability that the event will notoccur, P(~ A), sum to one.andP;  In practice, our belief in both may be zero.andM;For example, if a detective at a homicide scene was asked for his degree ofbelief that the butler did it, he may respond with a zero.andP;  The samedetective may also express a zero belief in the proposition that the butleris not the culprit.andP;  In this case, the detective is really saying that hedoesn't have any information one way or the other.andM;While such a belief assignment makes sense in terms of our experience, anyprobability assignment would have to be too rigid.andP;  For example, if thedetective assigned a probability of zero to the proposition that the butlerdid it, he's also assigning a probability of one to the proposition that thebutler didn't do it, whether intended or not.andP;  The butler may be comfortablewith that conclusion, but it doesn't reflect the detective's real sense ofindecision.andP;  From the detective's standpoint, this belief assignmentindicates that the facts are incomplete so a conclusion can't be reached.andP;  Onthe other hand, the probability assignment forces a conclusion--the butler isinnocent.andM;The starting point for the Dempster-Shafer belief calculus is the definitionof a belief function.andP;  We begin with a set of possible events that will beassigned belief values reflecting how strongly we believe a certain event tobe true.andP;  For example, four people are in a locked room: Bob, Jim, Sally, andKaren.andP;  Suddenly the lights go out.andP;  Less than a minute later, the lightscome on and Bob, Jim, and Sally discover that Karen has been stabbed.andO;Inspector D.S.andP;  Checkit arrives on the scene and brilliantly deduces that oneof three possible events must be true:andM;Bob is quilty Jim is guilty Sally is guiltyandM;Call these events B, J, and S.andP;  In terms of the belief calculus, the set ofpossible events is the set E = {B, J, S}.andP;  The belief function, however, isnot defined over this set; instead, it's defined over the power set of E, andthe power set of a set is the set of all subsets of the set.andP;  To solve ourcrime, Inspector Checkit constructs the power set of E (notationally thepower set of a set E is often given by [2.sup.E]) that contains the eightelements: {[phi], {B}, {J}, {S}, {B,J}, {B,S}, {J,S}, {B,J,S} where [Phi] isthe empty set that is a subset of every set.andP;  Inspector Checkit could expressa level of belief over every element of this power set.andP;  For example, he maysuspect both that Bob is guilty and that either Bob or Sally are theculprits.andM;In general, then, a belief function (Bel) maps the power set of events intothe range [0, 1].andP;  The notation used for a belief function is:andM;[Bel:[2.sup.E]right arrow[0, 1]]andM;In addition, the belief function must satisfy these three conditions:andM;1.andP;  Bel([Phi]) = 0andM;2.andP;  Bel(E) = 1andM;3.andP;  For every positive integer n and every collection [A.sub.1], ...andP;  ,andO;[A.sub.n] of subsets of E, the following is true:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;Condition 3 is easier to work with than it seems; it provides a constraintover the method of building up a belief for a set of events.andP;  The method wewill use to calculate belief functions will automatically satisfy all threeconditions, so don't worry about condition 3's details for now.andP;  In fact, ifInspector Checkit assigned a belief value to the conclusion that Bob isguilty (given by Bel-({Bob})) and a belief value of Bel ({Sally}) to theconclusion that Sally is guilty, then condition 3 simply states that:andM;Bel({Bob}) + Bel(%Sally}) [is less than or equal to] Bel({Bob, Sally}).andM;In other words, condition 3 requires that Inspector Checkit's belief that thetrue identity of the murderer is in the set {Bob, Sally} can be no less thanthe sum of his individual belief in the guilt of Bob and Sally.andM;We'll assume that after some investigation our inspector is able to assignprobability masses (see sidebar) to all possible scenarios.andP;  Specifically, heassigns the masses in the following manner:andM;Event  MassandM;Bob is guilty, {B}  .1 Jim is guilty, {J}  .2 Sally is guilty, {S}  .1 EitherBob or Jim is guilty, {B,J} .1 Either Bob or Sally is guilty, {B,S}  .1Either Jim or Sally is guilty, {J,S}  .3 One of the three is guilty, {B,J,S} .1andM;Notice two things about the probability mass assignments: first, theprobability mass is not the same thing as a probability, because, forexample, we know that the probability one of the three is guilty is one, butthe mass assigned to the alternative {B,J,S} is only .1.andP;  Second, theprobability masses sum to one as required.andP;  Using the probability massessupplied by Inspector Checkit, we can determine his degree of belief: &quot;Bob isguilty&quot; is .1 since the set {B} has no proper subsets.andP;  The same is true for&quot;Sally is guilty&quot; (.1) and &quot;Jim is guilty&quot; (.2).andP;  However, to determine thedegree that Inspector Checkit believes the guilty party is in the set {Bob,Jim}, we use the relationship between the probability masses and the measureof belief:andM;Bel({B, J}) = m({b}) + m({j} + m({B, J}) = .1 + .2 + .1 = .4andM;Determintion of Inspector Checkit's degree of belief over all the subsets ofsuspects is shown in Table 1.andM;You may be tempted simply to use the table of belief values.andP;  This temptationmust be resisted because at this point these values only give us adistribution of the uncertainty over the set of possible events; they do notgive us a certain answer.andP;  Our hope is that as more evidence is generated,the belief-value distribution will begin to indicate a specific solution orat least a small subset containing the solution.andP;  For now, Table 1 simplyindicates that perhaps Jim is a good suspect since all the subsets ofalternatives that contain Jim have higher belief values than equivalentsubsets without him.andM;USING BELIEF VALUESandM;Certain features of belief values are particularly useful.andP;  For example, anysubset A with a non-zero mass (m(A) [is greater than] 0) is called a &quot;focalelement&quot; of the belief function.andP;  The union of all the focal elements iscalled the &quot;core&quot; of the belief function; it consists of all the elementsthat make some contribution to the overall belief.andP;  Besides using belieffunctions to represent degrees of belief and ignorance, they can also be usedto represent different levels of uncertainty.andP;  For example, the belief thatthe correct answer is in set A is certain and precise if:andM;1.andP;  m(A) = 1andM;2.andP;  m(B) = 0 if B [is not equal to] AandM;3.andP;  A is a singleton subset of S (A contains only one element).andM;That is, if all the probability mass is assigned to a single element, nouncertainty in the belief exists.andP;  If Inspector Checkit assigned aprobability mass of one to the set {J} and zero to all the others, it wouldindicate that the Inspector is certain that Jim is guilty.andP;  On the otherhand, a belief that the answer in subset A is certain and imprecise if:andM;1.andP;  m(A) = 0andM;2.andP;  m(B) = 0 if B [is not equal to] AandM;3.andP;  A contains more than one element.andM;This represents a situation in which Inspector Checkit might assign aprobability mass of one to the set {J, S} and zero to all other subsets.andP;  Inthis case, the inspector is certain that the killer is either Jim or Sallybut unable to determine precisely which of them committed the crime.andO;Finally, a belief is said to be consonant if the evidence is such that thefocal elements form a nested sequence of the form:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;In this case, the evidence is consistent.andP;  For example, the Inspector wouldhave a consonant belief if he assigned the probability masses as shown inTable 2.andP;  For this case the nested sequence of focal elements is:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;DEMPSTER'S RULEandM;While the belief values thus far display some interesting characteristics,they would not be very useful as an approach to uncertainty measurement if itwere not for Dempster's rule of combination.andP;  Dempster's rule allows severalcombined belief functions to form a single belief function.andP;  From InspectorCheckit's viewpoint, when he first arrives on the scene, he may formulate abelief function for the guilt of the suspects based on their whereabouts atthe time the body was discovered.andP;  At some later time, the Inspector may readthe will; based on the information in the will alone, he may generate anotherbelief function.andP;  Now he needs a method to generate a composite belieffunction based on both pieces of evidence (the will and the suspect'swhereabouts).andP;  In fact, as he gathers additional evidence, he would like tocontinue to refine his belief function until he is ready to name themurderer.andP;  He can accomplish this using Dempster's rule.andM;Dempster's rule of combination begins with two or more belief functions, eachdefined over the same set of possible events but based on different evidence.andO;Using the probability masses for these distinct belief functions, itgenerates a composite probability mass that may be used to calculate acomposite belief function.andP;  The easiest way to understand the operation ofDempster's rule is to consider a picture of the probability mass.andP;  Becausethe probability masses for a given body of evidence must sum to one, theyserve to divide up the unit interval [0,1] into different sized segments.andO;Each segment represents the amount of mass assigned to its representativesubset:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;For Inspector Checkit's original probability mass assignment, the segmentedpicture looks like:andM;Probability mass for subset:andM;Given a second probability mass assignment defined over the same set ofpossibilities but based on different evidence, it would produce a differentset of segments of the unit interval.andP;  A pictorial view of the approach ofDempster's rule of combination for two sets of probability masses is formedby placing the unit-interval segments created by each mass assignment atright angles to each other, forming a square.andP;  The individual segmentsassociated with each set of probability-mass assignments partitions thesquare into a set of rectangles, as shown in Figure 1.andP;  The area of eachrectangle (determined by the product of the respective probability massesforming the rectangle) becomes a measure of the probability mass associatedwith the intersection of the subsets whose probability mass formed therectangle.andP;  For example, if Inspector Checkit examines the will and, based onwhat he finds, generates a new set of probability masses as given:andM;[m.sub.w]({B})= .2 [m.sub.W]({J})= .1 [m.sub.w]({SB})= .05 [m.sub.W]({BJ})=.3 [m.sub.w]({BS})= .05 [m.sub.w]({JS})= .1 [m.sub.w]({BJS})= .2andM;then the combination of this probability mass set with the originalprobability mass assignment will be those shown in Figure 2.andM;Dempster's rule adds up the selected areas and normalizes the resulting sumto produce a new probability mass.andP;  Hence, it provides an expression for thecalculation of the new probability mass that represents the combinedevidence's effect.andP;  (The mathematical expression for this operation is shownin Equation 1.)andP;  Of course, the normalization term in the denominator cannotbe zero.andP;  In other words:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;This term represents the amount of probability mass distributed among subsetsthat have empty intersections (subsets that have nothing in common).andP;  If thisterm evaluates to one, that evaluation indicates that all the probabilitymass for each individual belief is assigned to subsets with emptyintersections.andP;  In other words, the two individual beliefs have nothing incommon; they're totally contradictory and combining them into a single beliefis unfeasible.andP;  Besides the requirement that this normalization term be lessthen one, it should also be noted that this term is independent of the subsetA used in Equation 1.andP;  Hence, this term need be determined only once and canbe used repeatedly in the calculation of combined beliefs.andM;Equation 1 can be used to combine Inspector Checkit's two independentassessments of guilt into a single belief function.andP;  The process begins bycalculating the normalization term in the equation, to verify it is less thanone and use it in all subsequent calculations.andP;  This term can be determinedby adding up those areas in Figure 2 formed by contradictory subsets (thosewith empty intersections).andP;  These areas are highlighted in Figure 3; itshould be clear that the constant term in the denominator of Equation 1 is 1- .245, or .755, which meets the requirement that it be less than one.andM;To find the level of belief Inspector Checkit will give to subset {B} (basedon the evidence), we need to calculate the value for the numerator ofEquation 1.andP;  The calculation is done visually in Figure 4, which highlightsall the subset intersections equaling {B}.andP;  The sum of the weights in thehighlighted areas is .17, so by Equation 1, the probability mass assigned tosubset {B} by the combined evidence is .17/.755 = .225.andP;  The complete set ofnew probability masses and the corresponding belief values are shown in Table3.andP;  From this set of belief values, Sally becomes Inspector Checkit's primesuspect.andM;A Turbo Pascal program on the AI EXPERT Bulletin Board System implementsDempster's rule of combination.andP;  It prompts you for the initial probabilitymasses for each belief set and combines them into a single set of probabilitymasses.andP;  This version is limited to belief expressed over a set of no morethan four alternatives; however, a larger system could be processed bychanging the constant definition of maxn.andM;Dempster-ShaferandM;Belief CalculusandM;Bayesian probabilities are actually just a special case of belief functions;hence, the Dempster-Shafer belief calculus serves as a natural generalizationof probability concepts.andP;  However, because the belief calculus is broader inscope, it can be used to represent features of uncertainty that are difficultor impossible to represent using probability concepts.andP;  For example, thebelief calculus provides a natural way to represent ignorance about asituation.andP;  Ignorance, despite its negative connotation, really means that wehave no evidence with which to form an opinion.andP;  Therefore, a belief functionthat represents a state of ignorance (called a vacuous belief function) isgiven by:andM;0 if A [is not equal to] Bel(A)= 1 if A=EandM;The vacuous belief function indicates that while we know the correct answeris somewhere in the total set of possibilities, we have no similar beliefabout any subset of the total set of possibilities.andP;  Thus, belief functionsallow us to draw a distinction between lack of belief (ignorance), using thevacuous belief function, and disbelief, which specifies a low-belief valuefor a set of possible outcomes.andM;The goal of the Dempster-Shafer belief calculus is to generate values for abelief function in an application.andP;  Rather than asking users to assign valuesto belief functions defined over a set of alternatives (which would not bevery useful since it would be difficult for users to assign values tomaintain a belief function's three requirements), values are built from basicprobability assignments that can be determined by users.andM;A basic probability assignment is a function, m, from the power set of theset of alternatives into the range [0,1].andP;  In this sense, it looks like abelief function; however, the only requirements for the basic probabilityassignment are:andM;1.andP;  m([phi])=0 [Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;Condition 1 ensures that no probability assignment is made to the empty set,while condition 2 ensures that the sum of the probability assignments overall subsets is one.andP;  m(A) is sometimes called the &quot;basic probability numberof subset A&quot; or the &quot;probability mass of subset A.&quot;andP;  The relatinship betweenthe probability masses assigned to the subsets of the set of possible eventsand the belief value assigned to each subset is given by:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;That is, the belief in a subset A is the sum of the probability mass m(B)assigned to all proper subsets B of A.andM;Richard Spillman holds a Ph.D in electrical engineering from Utah StateUniversity.andP;
