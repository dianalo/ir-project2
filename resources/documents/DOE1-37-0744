The aim of futurestudies will be to predict the breakthrough behavior of waterworks filtersin the same way as discussed here. This seems to be fairly simple ifthe filters are working with adsorption only. If, in addition, biologicalprocesses occur in a filter (as is generally observed), these processeshave to be taken into account because an additional mechanism existsfor removal of organic substances in the activated carbon filter. Investigationsin a new research program will also need to consider the influence ofozone on biodegradation. Use of the methods already discussed, can helpto optimize existing plants, as well as a proper control of the efficiencyof the regeneration processes.</TEXT></DOC>
