This isanother in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press onthe economic, social and political turbulence that has turned SouthAmerica into a continent in crisis.</TEXT><NOTE>By KEVIN NOBLET</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South America's social and politicalfabric, loosely woven at the best of times, is fraying in thesemost difficult times.   From bloody protests in Venezuela to disruptive strikes inBrazil to spreading guerrilla influence in Peru and Colombia, thesymptoms of widespread discontent are making themselvesdramatically evident in this year of crucial elections in a halfdozen countries. Wracked by crushing indebtedness and recession forseven years, the continent that began the 1980s in the flush of ademocratic rennaissance is ending the decade weary and frustrated.   Few foresee doom, but many warn of a deepening gloom that couldbecome politically explosive.   ``The misery, the depressing conditions of life, the lack offood, housing, health, training, education, and jobs create aculture dish that can be exploited by `ultras' and extremists ofwhatever tendency,'' Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin recentlywarned in Buenos Aires.   President Jose Sarney of Brazil sees extremists on the leftgaining ground.   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because thesolution it has presented do not attend national problems,'' hesaid in an interview with The Associated Press in late March. ``Weoffer pessimistic solutions, and the parties of the left optimisticones.''   In 16 days in May, three countries _ Paraguay, Bolivia andArgentina _ will elect new presidents. Three others _ Uruguay,Brazil and Chile _ will do so by year's end.   It should be a time of renewal and democratic reaffirmation, butthere's no sense of celebration. At best, there's a feeling ofhaving held off defeat.   ``The democracies, one way or another, have managed tosurvive,'' said Jose Joaquin Brunner, academic coordinator at theSantiago-based Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences.   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said the simplefact that elections were being held is a sign that all is not bad.   ``It wasn't a given that the new democracies were going tobecome strong quickly.''   He added, however, that the combination of tender democraticinstitutions and an economic crisis ``is a very explosive mixture.''   Since 1978, a by-and-large moderate political leadership hasdirected the transition from military dictatorship to democracy inEcuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. It has takenthe unpopular path of austerity, curbing imports and limitingspending on public services, in wrestling with South America'sforeign debt of $277 billion.   The social cost has been high. Public hospitals and schools areunderstaffed and in disrepair, their paint peeling and theirequipment antiquated or simply broken down. Overworkedstate-hospital doctors in Brazil make the equivalent of about $130a month; in Peru about half that. University professors commonlyhold two or three jobs to make a subsistence wage in mostcountries. High-paying employment is hard to find, and stories ofarchitects and physicists driving taxis now are common.   Even in Venezuela, whose oil wealth kept it immune to theeconomic ailments afflicting its neighbors, real wages are slumpingdramatically and there is a growing shortage of basic consumergoods, with supermarket shelves empty for the first time in 30years.   It was an increase in bus fares and the prices of some basicconsumer needs that set thousands to rioting across Venezuela inlate February; by official count 276 people were killed andthousands injured, but unofficial accounts put the death toll at300 to 500.   The political cost of the economic and social unrest in SouthAmerica overall is likely to be seen in the upcoming elections.Incumbent leaders and their parties are behind in the polls inseveral countries, including Argentina and Bolivia. PresidentsSarney of Brazil and Alan Garcia of Peru are beseiged by critics.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
