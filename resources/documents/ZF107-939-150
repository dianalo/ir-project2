 One year in the making, the system is now inoperational control of Hydrohs data centre, the largest of its kind inCanada.andM;The factors leading up to Hydro 's decision to automate can be traced back to1985, when both operations and job scheduling were the responsibility ofHydro's console room operators.andM;In an effort to enhance systems availability, a job scheduling package wasimplemented, which resulted in a split of Hydro's operations staff into twodistinct groups: a Job Scheduling team to oversee the new job schedulingsystem, and an Operations group to maintain console operations.andM;According to Claude Sylvestre, Hydro's manager of data processing, it soonbecame apparent that without any job scheduling responsibiliities, theOperations the Operations group was mainly left with a surveillance job todo.andM;An exhaustive study of the console room operators' role was conducted, andthe results confirmed Sylvestre's original observations: 75 per cent of theoperator's time was devoted to routine console surveillance; 10 per cent toad hoc requests from systems users; 10 per cent to scheduled activities; andfive per cent to recovery activities, the majority of which involveddispatching the appropriate technical personnel.andM;&quot;In essence,&quot; says Sylvestre, &quot;our operators were spending most of their timewatching the systems consoles, waiting for something out of the ordinary tohappen.&quot;andM;Sylvestre and his management team sensed a vicious cycle of personnelturnovers and retraining in the making.andP;  &quot;When people get bored with theirjobs, they leave for more challenging employment elsewhere.andP;  When they do,we're forced to find and train new operators, and their lack of on-the-jobexperience can lead to serious systems reliability problems.&quot;andP;  Wishing toavoid such a situation, Hydro's data centre management began to seek asolution.andM;During a trip to IBM's facilities in the U.S.andP;  in the summer of 1986, Hydrorepresentatives were informed that automated operations (AO) would be one ofthe most dominant forces in the world of information systems throughout the1990s.andP;  Hydro's data centre management, operations group and technicalsupport team were convinced that AO was the long-term solution they soughtand, in the third quarter of the same year, they set out to make it areality.andM;Meeting challengesandM;The first challenge was to establish clear-cut automation guidelines andobjectives.andP;  Hydro's primary goal was to enhance its existing resources, andfurther improve systems availability by maintaining centralized control overJES3 operations, without interfering with the controlled systems themselves.andO;Existing software could not be altered by or for the automation process,which meant Hydro's solution would have to be &quot;external&quot; from the mainframesthemselves.andM;Hydro also wanted to improve message processing by limiting the number ofevents that would have to be processed (i.e.andP;  only important messages wouldbe filtered through to the automation mechanisms).andP;  Additionally, to enhancerecovery time, Hydro wanted the ability to treat problems as close to theirpoint of origin as possible.andM;Last, but of equal priority, all of the above had to be accomplished withoutany personnel layoffs.andM;After establishing their corporate policy on AO, Hydro immediately faced twomajor hurdles: first, an organizational framework to accommodate AO had to beestablished within their unionized data centre; second, since the necessarytechnology was not yet available in a comprehensive, ready-to-use &quot;package&quot;,it had to be developed in-house.andM;One of the first issues to be addressed was the fate of the operators.andO;Management presented the union with its detailed study and, together, theyexamined all facets of the situation.andP;  Management gave the union assurancesthat even though AO would eventually render the operators' jobs obsolete,suitable transfer within the organization would be carried out, and nolayoffs would occur.andP;  Satisfied that union personnel would not be replaced bynon-union staff, and that the operators' livelihoods were not in jeopardy,the union worked closely with management to develop a strategy that worked.andM;It was decided that the Operations group woudl contribute to the automationprocess during the development and implementation phase by assumingresponsibility for the &quot;job-specific&quot; areas of organizational restructuring.andM;Faced with one of their greatest career challenges, the Operations groupresearched and developed a new organizational structure for an automated,centrally controlled data centre.andM;Under the new order, scheduled activities would be automated, and be overseenby Job Schedulers; user requests, when not handled through automatedprocedures, would be dealt with by personnel at a Network Help Desk;surveillance and, where possible, recovery functions would also be automated,and would be the responsibility of the Technical Support staff.andM;As the new organizational structure was being developed, Hydro's TechnicalSupport group was facing its own unique set of challenges.andP;  To transformautomated console operations into a reality using existing resources, anappropriate &quot;platform of technology&quot; had to be developed to bridge thenecessary software components together into a cohesive, interactive system.andO;The process began in the fourth quarter of 1986, and stretched the limits ofboth the technical staff assigned to the project, as well as the technologythat was available at the time.andM;In keeping with Hydro's policy of automating without altering existingoperations software, the Technical Support group opted to use an automatedconsole management software package, and the existing job scheduling systemto automate scheduled activities and console operations.andP;  IBM PS/2microcomputers and software developed in-house were chosen as the best meansto externally monitor and control their mainframe environment.andM;This external automation mechanism, which came to be known as MECO (MainframeExternal Control of Operations), was originally conceived to assume thesurveillance function of the console room operators.andP;  The concept wasexpanded to encompass the operator's role of dispatching technical supportstaff when intervention was required to resolve severe problems.andP;  The abilityto handle operational activities such as restarting subsystems in backup modewas also built into the MECO design.andM;Although the basic automation platform seemed feasible from a theoreticalstandpoint, a broad range of technical issues had to be resolved to make itfunctional.andM;Most importantly, the three major components of the platform -- jobscheduling, message processing, and MECO itself -- had to be effectivelylinked together, and integrated with Hydro's mainframes to complement theirinternal automation mechanisms.andM;The message processing software was programmed to work in conjunction withMECO to carry out the desired operations, surveillance and recoveryfunctions.andM;Links were also established to give MECO the ability to alert technicalpersonnel when human intervention was required.andP;  A similar programmed&quot;bridge&quot; between the job scheduling software and MECO was also developed.andM;In august of 1987, the groundword for the new system was completed, and aprototype was designed and tested.andP;  By September, development and productionof Version 1.0 was initiated.andM;The systems's first real test came in January of 1988, when it was used in&quot;Adviser&quot; mode.andP;  The system's performance was logged and verified againstestablished procedures, and was deemed a tremendous success.andP;  In February ofthe same year, the recommended organizational restructuring was put intoeffect, and Hydro's automated console operations were put into &quot;Action&quot; mode.andM;Claude Sylvestre gives the system high marks: &quot;Initialization time was 40 percent faster, and down time is substantially reduced because problems areimmediately detected, and acted upon in a consistent manner.andP;  Our personnelare finding their jobs more fulfilling, because now they're planningoperations activity, not simply reacting to situations as they arise.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
