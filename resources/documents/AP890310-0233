Their action added tension to the crisis over the formation of anew government by Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi.   Leaders of some of Sudan's political parties and trade unions, inan effort to force Madi to resign, announced Friday they would notconsult with the prime minister.   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the oppositionleaders, after a five-hour meeting, decided to send an ultimatum toMahdi insisting he step down within 24 hours. They did not say whatthey would do if Mahdi refused.   Representatives from Mahdi's Umma Party and the National IslamicFront, which is a partner in the coalition Cabinet, did not attendthe meeing. There was no immediate reaction to the ultimatum fromMahdi.   Last month the army demanded that Mahdi and the Umma party opennegotiations with other groups to form a broad-based Cabinet thatwould arrange a peace agreement with the rebels of the People'sLiberation Army and end the 6-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.   The army on Thursday repeated its demand. Western diplomats saidthe army action implied the threat of a military takeover, butsenior generals did not appear ready to move against Mahdi.   The dispute began in January when the Democratic Unionist Party,the second largest party in Parliament, quit Mahdi's governmentbecause he refused to endorse a proposed peace agreement theDemocratic Unionists had worked out with the People's LiberationArmy on Nov. 16.   One of the clauses in that agreement calls for the suspension ofIslamic laws, a condition rejected by the National Islamic Front.   About 850 graduate students took part in the march protestingregulations requiring language examinations before possibleemployment in the public sector.   Police stood guard Friday night outside the building where thehunger strikers began their fast. The government promised to respondwithin a day to the protesters' demand that the the language testsbe ended.   Faddlallah Ali Fadl, minister of administrative reform, said thetests were to screen graduates for available positions but theprotesters claimed they were designed to reduce employment.   In a similar protest last year students set fire to a governmentemployment office.</TEXT></DOC>
