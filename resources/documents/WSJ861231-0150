She hopes.    For the last month, Ms. Wilson, an escrow officer for a title company in Boulder, Colo., has worked 12- and 13-hour days on more than 100 property closings, double the usual number. On Christmas Eve she was doing paperwork until 8 p.m.    Her grinch: All those property buyers and sellers rushing to close transactions before the new tax law, and its higher tax on capital gains, takes effect tomorrow. &quot;Let's pray this doesn't happen next year because I don't know how many human beings can stand up to that type of pressure,&quot; Ms. Wilson says, typing and talking on the phone at the same time.    She has had lots of late-night company, if that's any solace. Starting tomorrow, individual income-tax rates will drop, the capital-gains-tax rate will rise and many deductions will end -- creating a bevy of new tax strategies. And that has propelled individuals and companies to run to their lawyers, accountants, stock brokers and car dealers, in search of last-minute deals.    Some liken the last few weeks to a war -- albeit a profitable one. &quot;My biggest job is to patch (the employees) up and send them out to the trenches,&quot; says Charles P. Sidwa, who heads the personal financial-planning group at accountants Coopers and Lybrand.    But there have been casualties, he adds. Two accountants in the 20-member group quit recently because of the pressure.    'In 10 years this by far is the worst,&quot; Mr. Sidwa says. He says that in the last month almost all 1,800 clients -- mostly executives of major corporations -- called him seeking advice on such questions as whether to sell investments, defer compensation or accelerate deductions this year.    Edward Ajootian, an Arthur Young andamp; Co. tax manager in Providence, R.I., notes that the April 15 rush is like a leisurely vacation compared with the last few days. &quot;April 15 is really overplayed,&quot; he says. &quot;You give it your best shot and then when there's three days left you push the panic button and file for extensions and go off skiing. But the way they did it with this law you fall off the cliff Dec. 31. You have to sell a business before; otherwise you can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars&quot; in extra taxes.    As for his own workload, he says: &quot;I'm ashamed to admit it, but I even snuck in a little work on Christmas evening. I don't want to sound blasphemous but. . . .&quot;    It's not just the major accounting firms that are busy. &quot;We've never been through anything like this,&quot; says Gary Kasnett, senior partner at the Bethesda, Md., accounting firm of Kasnett, Yalom and Levine.    Mr. Kasnett says the firm is working chiefly on cases involving charitable contributions; deferrals of income into future years; and settlements with the Internal Revenue Service. (The law restricts interest deductibility on back taxes.)    Similarly, December is always busy for tax attorneys, but &quot;this is the worst one I've seen in probably ten years,&quot; says George Luscomb, a partner at the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown andamp; Platt. For the past three weeks, Mayer Brown attorneys have been working &quot;seven days a week, 15 to 16 hours a day,&quot; Mr. Luscomb says.    Probably the busiest of all have been real-estate attorneys. &quot;There was a full house here&quot; the day after Christmas, says Lorraine Mancini, an associate at the New York law firm of Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn andamp; Berman, and exhausted lawyers have been catching naps on office couches. A couple of months ago, in anticipation of the year-end crunch, senior partners at Robinson Silverman announced that employees would be receiving large salary boosts in December. &quot;They told us, 'You're going to be working like mad. That's the bad news,'&quot; Ms. Mancini recalls. &quot;'And the good news is, you're going to be getting a big raise.'&quot;    At the Washington law firm of Ginsburg, Feldman andamp; Bress, &quot;the deals are coming in by the hour,&quot; says associate N. Linda Goldstein. &quot;It's a complete zoo. The tax partner here, Mike Sanders, keeps running down the hall -- 'Got another deal! Got another deal!'&quot; Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, had to be in Silver Spring, Md., at 8 a.m. Christmas morning to look at some property that is scheduled to close this morning. As for tonight, he says glumly, &quot;We're probably going to be working very late.&quot;    The frenetic level of activity heightens tension. At one recent New York City real-estate closing, a title lawyer &quot;snapped and totally lost it&quot; after three hours of having documents thrust at him, according to another lawyer present. Screaming obscenities, the man reportedly picked up a can of pencils and began throwing them like darts at the seller. &quot;Thank God we hadn't ordered in pizza,&quot; sighs the witness. &quot;It would have been all over the walls.&quot;    Stock-brokerage firms have also seen a surge in business as individuals realized they had only a few days left to sell their stock before the top capital-gains rate increases to 28% from 20%. Discount brokers are among the busiest. &quot;It's been all hell breaking loose,&quot; says James Andrews, manager of the Phoenix, Ariz., office of Charles Schwab andamp; Co. Last week, investors were lined up three and four deep in the lobby, he says.    To take advantage of the sales-tax deduction, which ends tomorrow, more people are also scurrying to buy cars, according to some dealers. At Park Avenue BMW in Maywood, N.J., &quot;We sold five cars on Saturday and Sunday,&quot; compared with two or three normally, says Roy Sommerhalter, president. &quot;We have our cleanup people working I don't know how late to get cars delivered.&quot;    Still, perhaps the toughest times are had by those who have to leave the office for a while. At Commercial Settlements Inc., a Washington, D.C., title insurance company, partner Stuart Levin returned to his office at 5:30 one recent afternoon after being out all day. He discovered 53 phone messages awaiting him. &quot;Make no mistake. December's always crazy,&quot; Mr. Levin says. &quot;The new tax law has pushed it right into insanity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
