The university's board of trustees said it had regretfullyaccepted Zinser's resignation and would resume its search for a newpresident.   Gallaudet Board Chairman Jane Bassett Spilman called theresignation a tragic loss to the university.   ``We selected Dr. Zinser as president in recognition of hersuperior academic, administrative and research skills. Herstrengths and accomplishments were precisely in those areas mostcritical for the growth of the university,'' Spilman said.   On Thursday, students capped the fourth day of protests bydeclaring Zinser _ is not deaf and does not know sign language _unelcome on campus and vowing to keep her out.   Jerry Covell, a leader of the protests, hailed the resignation,but said early Friday that students were still angry with Spilman,who had resisted the push to oust Zinser, who is vice chancellorfor academic affairs at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro.   ``We are glad that she resigned but we are still waiting forSpilman,'' Covell said.   In submitting her resignation shortly after midnight, Zinseremphasized her concern that the very governance of Gallaudet hadbeen called into question by the week's events.   The campus was virtually shut down for four days while a largemajority of the 124-year-old institution's 2,200 studentsprotested. The students had attracted members of Congress andpresidential candidates to their cause.   Zinser had been named to head the university, the nation's onlyliberal arts college for the deaf, on Sunday.   ``I accepted the presidency when the board and I agreed that myvalues, talents and experiences were well suited to the growth ofGallaudet University in the higher education community as well asthe deaf community. This remains the challenge for the future ofGallaudet,'' Zinser said in a statement released through a publicrelations firm.   She said her decision to resign was reached ``with greatdifficulty as I came to understand how deeply some see the socialstature of deaf persons reflected in the presidency of thisuniversity.''   Students on Thursday threatened to seize the president's campushouse and office if Zinser made her way past students blockingentrances to the school. The doors to the administration buildingwere chained shut, and no administrators were seen on campus.   In other action on Thursday, one of the two deaf finalists forthe school presidency withdrew his support for Zinser and said hewould back the student protesters.   A day earlier, I. King Jordan, dean of the school's college ofarts and sciences, had said he was supporting Zinser ``for the goodof the school.'' But Jordan told a student rally on Thursday thathe could no longer support the new leader.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is a member of Gallaudet's boardof trustees, said in a statement Thursday he suggested to Zinserthat in the next few days she consult with the faculty, students,staff and alumni ``to experience the passion with which they viewthe appointment of hearing president.''   ``The time is long overdue for Gallaudet University to have adeaf president,'' Bonior said. ``The university has for generationsbeen an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deafeducation.   ``The question before us is _ How long will it be able tosustain this important role without a deaf president?''   Earlier, in an interview with The Washington Post, Bonior saidhe told Zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardizedif she refuses to leave the post she was named to Sunday night.   About 75 percent of the school's $76 million operating budgetcomes from federal funds. The rest comes from tuition and grants.   Meanwhile, the House Education and Labor subcommittee on selecteducation, which oversees Gallaudet's budget, scheduled hearingsfor Tuesday on the controversy over the president and the makeup ofthe board of trustees.   Zinser had said Wednesday she was assuming her post immediatelyinstead of waiting until the original July starting date.   She also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes,and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if theprotests, which have been peaceful so far, took a violent turn.   Besides calling for Zinser's ouster, the students want Spilman'sresignation, and a deaf majority on the 20-member trustees board,which now has four deaf members.   As Zinser attempted to start her job, support for the protestersgrew.   Late Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jacksonissued a statement supporting the students, and called onGallaudet's board of trustees to ``resolve this dispute equitably.   ``The problem is not that the students do not hear. The problemis that the hearing world does not listen,'' Jackson said.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., another Democratic presidentialhopeful, on Thursday called for Zinser's resignation.   Simon, a longtime member of the Senate Labor and Human Resourcessubcommittee on the handicapped, which has jurisdiction overfunding for Gallaudet, said Zinser's appointment was a ``slap inthe face to the entire purpose of the university.''   Vince Dollard, a spokesman for the National Technical Institutefor the Deaf, in Rochester, N.Y., said two buses and several cars,carrying at least 100 students from the school, were to leave atmidnight for Washington to join the Gallaudet protest.   A rally was held on the Rochester campus in support of GallaudetThursday afternoon.   In addition, some East Coast leaders of the National Associationof the Deaf, a 20,000-member deaf rights group based in SilverSpring, Md., were planning to gather in Washington on Friday,spokesman Fred Weiner said.   And activist Abbie Hoffman, who lectures to universities onstudent protests, said, ``What's happening at Gallaudet isobviously right there in the front,'' he said, ``and they're goingto win their battle.''   He said he has urged members of three electronic bulletin-boardnetworks, with a total of 16,000 members, to support the students'efforts by tying up Gallaudet's switchboards with calls of supportfor the students.</TEXT></DOC>
