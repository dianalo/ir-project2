Gorbachev also told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that he hopedForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would continue to work withhim, despite his Dec. 20 announcement he was resigning.   ``I consider him one of my closest comrades, and there were nodifferences in opinions or views,'' Gorbachev said.   The Supreme Soviet is to consider Shevardnadze's resignation onJan. 8. Meanwhile, Gorbachev said, ``I told him to continue hiswork.''   The aim of an Asian summit would be to demilitarize the regionand create a ``stabilized, neighborly and cooperative zone,''Gorbachev said in the interview in Moscow on Friday with thenationally circulated Japanese newspaper.   ``Such a meeting could not be considered without theparticipation of the United States, Canada, Australia and NewZealand,'' Gorbachev said.   On unification of the divided Korean peninsula, Gorbachev saidthat only North and South Koreans have the right to decide stepsthat can lead to that.   But ``the Soviet Union is ready to participate in anyinternational framework of cooperation and guarantee ifnecessary,'' he said.   Gorbachev urged the Japanese government to end its policy oflinking all issues between the two countries to its demand forreturn of the Soviet-held islands just off Japan's northern coast.   He said the time has come for both nations to advance towardconclusion of a peace treaty to World War II.   Gorbachev is to become the first Soviet leader to visit Japan inApril.
