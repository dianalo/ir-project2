Liu Xiangdong told reporters said China had a trade surplusequivalent to $2.29 billion in the first half of 1989. Customsfigures issued earlier this month, which cover a broader range oftransactions, showed a large deficit.   ``Our statistics indicate that the balance of foreign trade isgood. The payment ability of China's foreign trade is no problem,''said Liu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade.   He granted that stagnant exports and rising imports couldproduce a deficit in the second half, and said joint ventures forwhich contracts had not yet been signed could suffer. Many foreignbusinessmen fled China after the army put down the studentdemonstrations in June.   ``I think some foreign businessmen are worried about thesituation, so we will have to wait and see for some time,'' Liusaid.   His comments conflicted with earlier government reports of adeficit trade balance and speculation about an impending shortageof foreign exchange that would cast doubt on China's ability to pay.   The State Statistical Bureau issued customs figures earlier thatshowed a $5.79 billion trade deficit for the first six months, upfrom $1.22 billion in the first half of 1988.   A report on the customs statistics by the official Xinhua newsagency quoted Chinese analysts as saying the deficit could reach$10 billion by year's end.   Liu's statistics showed exports at $19.76 billion in the firstsix month, virtually unchanged from the same period last year, andimports of $17.47 billion, an increase 11.8 percent.   Unlike those from the ministry, customs figures include importsof raw materials for processing and such some non-trade financialtransfers.   China has borrowed $33.1 billion from abroad in the past 10years and another $12.1 billion has entered the country in directforeign investment. The government has sought in the past year tocurb excessive borrowing.   One reason for confidence in China's ability to repay is thatmore than 70 percent of the outstanding debt bears medium or lowinterest rates, Liu said. He said the average annual debt-servicerate _ the ratio of repayment to total export earnings _ remainsbelow 10 percent, compared with rates in other countries of 20percent to 25 percent. The debt burden will rise substantially inthe next few years, however, as loan principal comes due forrepayment.   China has said it will apply for $500 million in new loans fromthe World Bank by early next year, but the climate does not seemreceptive. After the crackdown, the bank postponed consideration of$780.2 million in loans for which the Chinese already had applied.   The bank, the main source of aid to developing countries, isunder pressure from the United States and other Western nations tostop new loans because of China's harsh action against dissent.   Most lenders to China have frozen aid or postponed considerationof new loans, and Liu said his government was prepared to dowithout further assistance if necessary.   ``We would like to develop economic relations with all countries... and utilize loans from those countries, but we will not accepttheir using those loans as a condition to interfere in China'sinternal affairs,'' he said.   He said China is committed to an open policy on trade and thenumber of Chinese companies authorized to conduct foreign tradewill be reduced from the current 5,000 to make the system moreefficient.   ``Businessmen in both foreign and Chinese enterprises havecomplained a lot about confusion in management of foreign trade,''Liu said. ``In the future, we will be very strict in approvingthose companies.''</TEXT></DOC>
