She obviously regarded it as treachery todrink a French product and asked why I wanted it. I explainedit was because it was naturally fizzy. She replied that thebubbles were artificially added. We then started arguingabout whether the bubbles in Perrier were natural or not. . .   A free marketeer would be horrified at her nationalisticinstincts. But as always there was a shrewd judgmentunderlying them. British people are not going to be motivatedto be enterprising and accept painful economic changes inpursuit of the vision of a free market, but they may do so ifthey are told it is because we have to compete with theFrench and the Germans. Maybe we are like schoolchildren whocan only be motivated by the desire to be top of the class(or competing with foreigners) and not by the abstract ideaof being well educated (the true equivalent of prosperity).</TEXT></DOC>
