The spokesman, Lt. Col. John Chapla, said, ``The grounding wasordered following confirmation that a part that does not conform tothe Army's manufacturing standards may have been installed in somehelicopters.''   He said the part, known as a universal control lever, is acomponent of the system in UH1H, UH1V and UH1D series helicoptersthat enables the pilot to control the aircraft.   ``Army analysis indicated that the part showed hydrogenembrittlement, a defect that leaves the part subject to potentialfailure,'' Chapla said. ``Failure of the part could cause loss ofcontrol of the aircraft.''   The spokesman said the U.S. Army has about 3,000 UH1H Hueys aswell as 400 to 500 UH1V helicopters specially equipped for medicalevacuation.   The UH1Ds have been provided to other countries, and Chapla saidthe Army was advising foreign governments that they also should begrounded. He said he did not have information on how manyhelicopters of that model were involved.   Chapla said two other Huey helicopter models, the UH1C and UH1M,were not affected by the grounding order.</TEXT></DOC>
