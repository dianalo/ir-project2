Capt. Barry D. Bomier, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, saidthe problem with the so-called Stinger-RMP is considered relativelyminor despite the delay in taking deliveries from the GeneralDynamics Corp., the missile's producer.   Bomier said testing of a ``fixed'' version of the new missile isunder way, and ``We don't expect it to take much longer.''   ``We expect the problem that we have can be resolved withmodifications to the (computer) software (in the guidancesystem),'' he said.   ``But the Army is not going to accept that missile until it cando what we expect it to do and what is written into our contract.''   General Dynamics acknowledged through its Washington officeMonday there had been a problem with the Stinger-RMP and that itwas working with the Army to correct it.   But Jim Gilkerson, a spokesman for General Dynamics' ValleySystems Division in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., where the missile ismade, refused Monday to discuss when the new round of testing mightbe completed and deliveries started.   The Stinger, renowned for its performance in Afghanistan whereit helped U.S.-backed resistance fighters overcome Soviet airpower, is a shoulder-fired missile for use against airplanes orhelicopters.   The basic Stinger, delivered to the Army in 1979, is aheat-seeking missile and can be fooled by some types of flares. TheStinger-RMP is designed to overcome that problem with a moresophisticated guidance system.   The ``RMP'' in the name stands for reprogrammablemicro-processor. The new missile features removable computersoftware that can be updated to compensate for new types of flaresor threats as they develop.   The problem that General Dynamics is working to correct surfacedduring final testing of the new missile and involves the missile'sfailure to ignore certain types of flares when they are ejectedfrom a hovering helicopter.   Army and corporate officials decline to elaborate further _citing security classifications _ but stress the problem crops uponly in one situation and that even with the one flaw, theStinger-RMP is a much more effective weapon that the basic Stinger.   ``The weapon works,'' Bomier said. ``The problem involves onlyone target under certain selected conditions. We haven't stoppedbuying the missile. We just haven't accepted it yet.''   The Army has awarded two contracts to General Dynamics for theStinger-RMP. They total about $900 million and call for delivery ofabout 23,000 of the missiles through May 1991.   In the meantime, the older models of the missile still are beingused.   General Dynamics continues to produce the new missile while thefix is developed for the computer software and it is warehousingthem in the interim. Bomier said the company is paying the cost ofstorage.</TEXT></DOC>
