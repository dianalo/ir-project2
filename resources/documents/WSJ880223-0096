Industry officials and analysts, gathered at the Personal Computer Forum this week, say that growth in demand will moderate this year and that manufacturing capacity will increase enough to meet demand.    In addition, International Business Machines Corp. is talking of pricing its products more aggressively, which would force others to follow. IBM also is pressing its dealers to move more of its machines, another incentive to trim prices. The changes in the marketplace and the IBM moves won't mean plummeting prices, but they should push the industry back toward its historical pattern of 15% to 20% price cuts each year.    The industry has abandoned the caution that reigned briefly after last October's stock market crash, and expects robust sales growth of 20% to 25% this year. Albeit heady, that is still down from last year's extraordinary sales gains of 30% to 40%. Supply, meanwhile, will be ample, because all of the computer makers insist they can grow faster than the industry as a whole -- while the other guy bears the brunt of the slowdown.    Accordingly, manufacturers last year began adding capacity that now is coming on line. IBM, for instance, says it should catch up with demand by the end of the first quarter, and Compaq Computer Corp. says it will catch up with demand by then for all but its most powerful products.    Prices didn't fall last year, largely because parts shortages limited the availability of many machines. Some of those shortages will continue this year. In particular, they will involve high-capacity memory chips and the most powerful version of the Intel Corp. 80386 chip, which does the processing in high-end, IBM-compatible personal computers. (The Intel shortage is controversial; many here say Intel should follow the historical practice of licensing another company to produce the chip.) But those shortages should ease as the year progresses.    In addition, IBM, which has been heavily discounting parts of its latest PC line, has indicated it will put very low prices on some products it will bring out this year. IBM said last week, for instance, that by roughly year end, it will have a product at the price of its entry-level Model 25 but that contains the central processor used in its Models 50 and 60, which are the middle of its line and cost far more than the Model 25.    IBM also is raising the quotas that its dealers must sell to get the maximum discount. Analysts expect the move will force IBM dealers to discount the machines' prices or sell them through the so-called gray market, which consists of dealers who sell IBM products without authorization from the company and who discount the prices sharply.    While it isn't clear how much this will help IBM increase its market share, Michele Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said she thinks that even competitors as big as clone maker Leading Edge Products Inc. will face pressure. David Norman, chairman of Businessland Inc., a big chain of dealers, said in an interview before this week's conference that the big companies like IBM and Compaq are pushing other companies' products off his shelves.    &quot;We can't continue to carry the number of products we carry,&quot; Mr. Norman said. &quot;There's a big effort under way to reduce that number.&quot;    Participants at the conference generally said this will be a transition year for the industry. Clones of IBM's latest line of personal computers will reach the market this year, and various companies will introduce high-end personal computers using an Intel processor that is 25% faster than the current top of the line, but the hardware introductions this year will be far less significant than those made last year.    There will be some major software announcements, people here said, but the software companies also will be spending a lot of time this week and in coming months making the alliances that will produce, over the next couple of years, software that lets members of work groups better coordinate things with each other. Many said that software for groups will provide the next major spurt of growth for the industry.    &quot;If you run around and talk to the software companies, this is a really exciting time,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, publisher of the P.C. Letter, an industry newsletter. &quot;This is when the design decisions are being made and the bets are being placed. There is a real sense of discovery out there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
