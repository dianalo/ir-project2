After the high court's announcement, independent counselLawrence Walsh said he will proceed with an elaborate anddifficult hearing that the appeals court said is required todetermine whether witness statements were influenced by Mr.North's congressional appearance.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. North was convicted in May 1989 of altering anddestroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity,and aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress. Theformer Reagan administration national security aide receiveda suspended jail sentence, was fined $150,000 and was orderedto perform 1,200 hours of community service.   In May 1990, the appeals court vacated all of theconvictions, ruling that his grand jury indictment and trialmay have been affected by testimony from witnesses whorefreshed their memories by listening to Mr. North'scongressional testimony. Congress granted Mr. North immunityfrom having his congressional testimony used against him inthe prosecution.   The appeals court ordered the trial judge to hold ahearing to sort out the statements of witnesses, both at thetrial and before the grand jury, to determine the source foreach piece of evidence and whether each statement wastainted. The appeals court said the trial judge must reviewthe testimony &quot;witness-by-witness; if necessary . . .line-by-line and item-by-item.&quot;   If the independent counsel persuades District JudgeGerhard Gesell that no tainted testimony affected the trialor grand jury proceedings on a given conviction, the judgecould in effect reinstate the conviction.   But if Judge Gesell becomes convinced that testimony wastainted, he will have to throw out the conviction -- andmaybe the indictment, too. Mr. Walsh then could try toprosecute Mr. North again, but it would be very difficult toreconstruct the entire case after so much time has elapsedand with new limits on what the witnesses may say.   Criminal law experts generally agree it will be tough forthe independent prosecutor to prove to the trial judge thatno improper use was made of Mr. North's congressionaltestimony. However, Judge Gesell already held a hearing toascertain whether any tainted evidence was used, and althoughthe appeals court said a much more detailed review isrequired, Judge Gesell could decide that he was right thefirst time.   The federal appeals court also reversed on separategrounds Mr. North's conviction for destroying documents,faulting the judge's instructions to the jury. That reversalwasn't appealed to the Supreme Court.   The high court also refused to hear an appeal by Mr. Northcontesting other aspects of the trial and the appeals court'sdecision.</TEXT></DOC>
