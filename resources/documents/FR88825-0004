This is the size standard which was utilized over the December9, 1985, to November 3, 1986 period. The $9.5 million size standard whichhas been utilized since November 3, 1986, resulted from an order from theDistrict Court for the District of Columbia dated November 3, 1986, settingaside the then current dredging size standard of $13.5 million, but restoringthe previous size standard of $9.5 million spending SBA's completion ofa review of the remanded rulemaking effort. SBA has now completed its reviewas directed by the Court order and is restoring the size standard of $13.5million which SBA has determined to be the appropriate size standard forthe dredging industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Robert N.

In its place SBA is promulgating thisfinal rule which better describes factors involved in the decision process.On November 3, 1986, the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia declared invalid the SBA's size standard for the dredging industryand remanded the administrative record of the rulemaking to the Agencyfor further consideration. The Court recognized that the previous sizestandard for the dredging industry of $9.5 million was not challenged andremained in effect pending SBA's completion of its review of the issuesraised in the remanded rulemaking record. The Court cited SBA's failureto consider regional size standards, after first recognizing the presenceof regional differences in structure and in procurement patterns, as sufficientcause in itself to invalidate the size standard.In addition, on October 15, 1986 Congress passed the National Defense AuthorizationAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 99-661). Section 921 of this Act contained a mandatethat SBA review the size standard of certain industries including dredging.The purpose of the review was to ensure that small business set-asidesaccounted for no more than approximately 30 percent of the total Federalcontract dollar value for those industries. If SBA were to find as a resultof its review that the 30 percent threshold was exceeded for any industryunder review, the Agency was required to reduce the size standard for thatindustry accordingly.The Act also authorized SBA to further divide industry categories whenit received evidence that such division is warranted due to special capitalneeds, or special labor, or geographic requirements, or to recognize anew industry. New size standard would then be established for these newindustry categories.The Act, moreover, provided three prerequisites which Congress consideredmust all be present in order for segmentation on a regional basis to occurin an industry. These three prerequisites are: (1) The Government musttypically designate the area where work for such contracts is to be performed;(2) Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domesticmarket for such goods and services; and (3) Due to the fixed location offacilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it isunreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outsideof the general areas where such concerns are located.Using these three prerequisites, SBA examined the question as to whetherthe dredging industry merited segmentation of its size standard in an AdvancedNotice of Proposed Rulemaking which was published on March 17, 1987 (52FR 8261). This notice explored the possibility of segmenting the industryfor light and heavy projects for the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast,West Coast, and Great Lakes regions.A majority of those commenting on this notice did not support segmentedsize standard for dredging. The comments included one dredging firm andone association that favored the concept of a regional standard, whilefour firms, two associations, and the U.S. Corps of Engineers were opposed.The respondents raised several concerns regarding the proposed segmentation.The most important issue from the standpoint of complying with the legislation,however, opposed the idea of segmented size standards based on the natureof competition within the industry. In particular, several respondentsargued that dredges are mobile, and therefore, the statutory prerequisitethat competition could not be expected from outside the region was notmet.As a result of these comments, SBA examined the question further. Specifically,it requested the views of the Army Corps of Engineers, the agency responsiblefor the great majority of Federal procurement activities in this industry.The Corps responded by stating its view that this third requirement forsegmentation was not present and, that therefore, the concept of segmentationshould not be applied to the dredging industry. SBA also reviewed availabledata sources to determine whether there is a pattern of dredging firmsoperating in more than one region of the Nation. It found, for example,a pattern in which both large and small firms in the industry often operatein more than one region of the Nation. Of the 40 most active firms in theindustry during the 1980-83 period, for example, 17 firms operated to asignificant degree in more than one region of the Nation. These 17 firmsinclude both large and small firms. As a whole they were responsible foralmost 55 percent of all Federal dredging contracts.Moreover, during the April-June 1988 period in which drought conditionsprevailed throughout the upper Midwest, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineersconsidered mobilizing dredgers from the Eastern seaboard to meet the threatto transportation on the Mississippi.It concluded that dredgers from as far away as New York State could provideassistance. This study thus provides evidence that dredging competitionacross regions is not simply limited to adjacent regions, but also appliesto noncontiguous, geographically separated regions as well. Thus thereis strong evidence for the view that competition does occur across regionsand that firms in the activity of dredging are not inherently limited inoperations to one region of the country. After careful review of this issue, SBA concluded that the third statutoryrequirement for geographic or regional segmentation was not present inthe dredging industry. Accordingly, it did not propose segmented size standardsfor this industry in its Proposed Rule of December 17, 1987 (52 FR 47937)and does not recommend segmented size standards in this Final Rule. This process in which SBA in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking firstsolicited public response to the concept of regional size standards, andthen rejected the idea after appropriate review in a proposed rule fulfillsthe Court's requirement that the SBA seriously consider the viability ofregional size standards in the dredging industry prior to making a decisionon the proper size standard(s). SBA in this Final Rule is, therefore, focusingits attention on a nationally structured size standard. Specifically, itis reinstituting the $13.5 million size standard in preference to the presentsize standard of $9.5 million which was restored by Court Order. The decision to move to a size standard of $13.5 million which was madeduring 1985 was based on a number of factors relating to the industry structureof the dredging industry. Some of these factors cannot be updated becausethe data at that time were obtained through a special survey of dredgingfirms which was costly and time consuming. However, some information ispresently available from the Corps of Engineers, and therefore, SBA hasevaluated whether the industry has changed significantly since the 1985decision. In the final dredging size standard rule of November 8, 1985, (50 FR 46418),SBA based it's recommendation to raise the size standard in dredging onsix factors. These are: concentration ratio (percent of Federal procurementdollars received by the four largest firms in the industry), average firmsize, cost increases over time, the proportion of firms defined as small,the average size of Federal contracts, and the proportion of Federal contractdollars received by small firms. Of the six variables in question, foursupported a higher size standard than the present $9.5 million. These fourwere average firm size, cost increases over time, the proportion of firmsdefined as small, and the average size of contracts. The remaining twofactors_the concentration ratio and the proportion of contract dollarsreceived by large firms_provided ambiguous results. In reviewing more recent data, SBA was only able to gather informationon the concentration ratio (proportion of sales in the industry generatedby the four largest firms in the industry), the average size of Federalcontract, and the proportion of contract dollars received by small firms.In general, SBA views high indexes for both the concentration ratio andaverage size of contract as indicators that an industry's size standardshould be relatively high. Conversely, it views a relative low proportionof contract dollars awarded to small firms as an indicator that an industry'ssize standard might be too low. In this case, SBA wanted to compare thesituation in the dredging industry during 1987 with the situation in theearlier period to assure itself that a need continued for a higher sizestandard. Data for FY 1987 are compared with the 1980-83 data in the followingtable:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,10</C> <H1>Factor</H1><H1>FY 1980-83</H1><H1>FY 1987</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Concentration Ratio (percent of Federal contracts awarded the 4 largestfirms in industry)<D>\1\ 26%</D><D>63%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average Size of Total Federal Contracts<D>\2\ 1.60M</D><D>1.69M</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proportion of Federal Dollars Awarded Small Firms<D>\2\ 35.3%</D><D>15.8%</D><F>\1\ Average over 1980-83 period. ($9.5 million size standard in effect)</F><F>\2\ 1983 data. ($9.5 million size standard in effect)</F></ITAG></ITAG>These statistics indicate that the situation in the dredging industry involvesa greater concentration of economic activity among a few large firms inthe dredging industry than occurred in 1983. There is a need to restorethe previous size standard of $13.5 million based on the fact that fourvery large firms received almost two-thirds of Federal dredging contractdollars, while firms defined as small (less than $9.5 million in grossannual receipts) received only 16 percent of all Federal dredging contractdollars. These low percentages for small firms in the industry also indicatethat there is little likelihood that the 30 percent set-aside thresholdincorporated in section 921 of Pub. L. 99-661 would be exceeded by a restorationof the $13.5 million size standard. Based on these considerations and the fact that SBA has extensively consideredregional size standards in the dredging industry as directed by Court Order,SBA is restoring the national size standard of $13.5 milion for dredgingas appropriate for the reasons described in the published rule change in1985 (50 FR 46418) and due to the results of the analysis of more currentdata. This regulation is promulgated as a final rule without prior notice andopportunity to comment in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b). Because SBAhas already received and considered public comment on both the issue ofgeographical distribution (see 52 FR 8261 and 52 FR 47937), and the sizestandard increase (see 50 FR 46418 and 49 FR 47412), it is not in the publicinterest to delay the rule further in order to receive further public comment.<ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance With Executive Order 12291, Regulatory Flexibility Act,and Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>SBA certifies that this regulation is a major rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291. Over the fiscal year 1987 period, annual Federal outlays fordredging activities exceeded $340 million. Thus the annual economic effectcriteria of $100 million used to measure a major rule change could be exceededas a result of this rule. Potentially, any firm in the industry could beaffected in the future by a higher size standard, since the eligibilityof a firm could impact on its competitive situation for any set-aside contractand on the decision whether or not to set-aside a contract. This regulation,however, is not likely to result in a major increase in costs, or prices,or in significant adverse effects on the United States economy. This regulation is unlikely, however, to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. (There are no known firms currentlyactive in the dredging industry in the $9.5 to $13.5 million range andonly five firms are estimated to be in the $7.0 to $9.5 million range.)Therefore, in compliance with Executive Order 12291, SBA offers this finalregulatory impact analysis. SBA has considered regulatory action in thisinstance in response to intense public comment on the size standard inthis particular industry. The purpose of this final rule is to update thesize standard for the dredging industry, which has remained at the samelevel as 1974, to reflect both inflation and changes in industry structureover a 14-year time period. This final rule change is authorized by section3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)), which mandates thatSBA define small business concerns on an industry-by-industry basis. The dredging industry is comprised of approximately 250 companies of which70 participated in the Federal procurement process during fiscal year 1987.Of these firms, however, only five would likely be significantly affectedby a higher size standard. These are firms whose annual receipts usuallyfall in the $7.0 to $9.5 million range. Clearly, a higher size standardwould remove a major constraining factor on expansion for these five firms.Assuming these five firms are capable of and choose to expand into the$9.5 to $13.5 million range, other firms could be affected by the new highersize standard. There could be some additional competition for contracts,since these five firms could bid for more contracts without exceeding thenew size standard limitation of $13.5 million. Similarly, the competitionfor unrestricted contracts could be expected to be enhanced, since smallfirms would be less concerned that winning a contract would push them overthe size standard. In addition, Federal contracting officials would beable to set aside some additional contracts, and thus a slightly higherproportion of contract dollars would probably be set aside. Although morecontracts will probably be set aside, SBA considers it highly unlikelythat the set-aside percentage would exceed 30 percent given the low incidenceof set-asides in this industry during 1987 (10 percent), and the fact thatonly five firms are estimated to be in the $7.0 to $9.5 million range.Overall, anyone of the 250 firms active in the dredging industry mightbe affected by the increased size standard if it were to bid on a dredgingprocurement that was set aside for small business, or if the higher sizestandard freed small firms to bid on unrestricted contracts. The net benefitsof this rule change, therefore, are a closer relationship between the sizestandard and the industry structure and an easing of constraints on expansionfor firms within the industry. In deciding that a size standard of $13.5 million most accurately reflectsthe current dredging industry, SBA also considered the alternatives ofraising the size standard above $13.5 million, lowering it below $9.5 million,or maintaining it at $9.5 million. SBA rejected raising the standard abovethe $13.5 million level because of the concern that a higher size standardthan $13.5 million would more likely result in a set-aside plus 8(a) percentageof Federal contracting in the industry which exceeds the 30 percent levelprohibited by Public Law 99-661. Lowering the size standard was rejectedbecause of the industry's dominance by large firms, the relatively largesize of contracts in the industry, and the inflationary trends since 1974when the $9.5 million size standard was established. Thus there are nosignificant alternatives which would accomplish the stated objectives ofminimizing the economic impact on small firms. SBA certifies that there are no relevant Federal rules which would duplicate,overlap, or conflict with this Final Rule. SBA also certifies that thisregulation contains no reporting or recordkeeping requirements which aresubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C., Chapter 35. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 121 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government procurement, Governmentproperty, Grant programs_business, Loan programs_business, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Small business.
