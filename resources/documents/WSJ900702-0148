The requirements take effect Aug. 20. For paint already onstore shelves, the National Paint and Coatings Association isworking with manufacturers to place labels indicating thatany interior paint containing more than 200 parts per millionof mercury should be used only outside. While EPA officialsrecommended at a briefing that consumers avoid paints withmercury, the officials said consumers could safely use upexisting interior paint with less than 200 parts per millionof mercury as long as they ventilate thoroughly and minimizeexposure of children.</LP><TEXT>   Mercury is in 25% to 30% of all indoor latex paint to keepit from spoiling while in the can. It's in about 20% to 35%of all exterior latex paint to prevent mildew. Oil-basedpaint doesn't contain mercury. Linda Fisher, an assistant EPAadministrator, said the industry will bear about $40 millionto $50 million in costs of reformulating paint, withadditional expense possible for manufacturers unable to selltheir existing stocks. For consumers, paint prices are likelyto rise about 1%.   In a statement Friday, the paint association said it wouldcooperate with the EPA, even though the association doesn'tbelieve &quot;there is any scientific evidence to give consumersany cause for alarm about use of interior products currentlyon the market.&quot;   The EPA became concerned about mercury in paint when afour-year-old Michigan boy last year came down with a rareform of poisoning, after paint containing mercury was used inhis home. Symptoms of this childhood mercury poisoninginclude severe pain in the extremities, sweating and a rapidheart beat. Other symptoms include slight tremors of thehands, short-term memory loss and headaches.   EPA officials urged people who have painted recently witha mercury-containing paint to ventilate the area thoroughly.The agency released a list of paint manufacturers that usemercury and companies that don't. Consumers who want to knowwhether a specific paint contains mercury can call1-800-858-7378, a toll-free number at the National PesticideTelecommunication Network.   The agency said it believes that the mercury concentrationin air decreases within a few days after painting, but thatlower concentrations may be present for months. Peoplewishing to dispose of paint containing mercury should consultcommunity hazardous-waste programs or local governments forthe proper ways to do so. Mercury shouldn't be poured downdrains, or into any bodies of water, since it is toxic tomany species, the EPA said.   The EPA action results from a voluntary agreement workedout with the companies that produce mercury for use inpaints. These companies are continuing to provide data thatthe EPA will use to determine whether further action iswarranted for outdoor paint, or for such products asspackling and joint compounds, which also contain mercury.   Most pesticide uses of mercury were banned in 1976. At thetime, the agency allowed mercury's continued use in paintbecause good alternatives weren't available.</TEXT></DOC>
