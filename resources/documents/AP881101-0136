(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Guards used high-pressure water hoses today tobreak down barricades put up by prisoners demanding better treatmentfor homosexual inmates at the Oregon State Correctional Institution.   The 19 prisoners were placed in segregation units after theuprising ended this morning, prison spokesman Robey Eldridge said.No one was injured, he said.   ``We used water hoses to force inmates away from the barricadesagainst the wall,'' Eldridge said. ``At that point, we were able toenter through the doors and take charge of the situation.'' He saidit took ``about 20 minutes of sustained water pressure'' to get theprisoners to back away from the barricades.   The prison, located just east of here, was designed to house 476inmates but had a record 1,065 prisoners today.   A specially trained group of eight prison guards was assisted byabout 40 other guards in quieting the disturbance, Eldridge said.Except for the water, no force was used, he said.   The prisoners had presented a list of seven demands, includingmore equality and better-paying jobs for homosexual prisoners.   The barricades were erected in Unit 2, a dayroom that had beenconverted into a dormitory, Eldridge said. A guard on patrol outsidethe dormitory noticed about 2:30 a.m. that a light inside the unithad been broken.   Nothing was done about the light, Eldridge said, but at 5:18a.m., a note was slipped under the door to the guards saying,``There are people in here who want no part in this but we have nochoice but to keep quiet and just stay uninvolved.''   Guards investigated further and found that the inmates had usedbunk beds to barricade the door and would not let anyone inside,Eldridge said.   About 6:30 a.m., the special guard unit began using thehigh-pressure hoses to force the prisoners away from the barricadesand into corners of the dormitory.   The meaning of some of the demands was unclear, Eldridge said,but at any rate prison officials had no intention of meeting them.He said complaints are considered only when prisoners go throughproper channels.   There had been no prior allegations of discrimination againsthomosexuals at the prison, he said, adding that the fact thatsomeone wrote a note mentioning the subject doesn't such complaintsare widespread.   ``I'm not saying this is a homosexual disturbance,'' Eldridgesaid.   He said there are about 60 openly declared homosexual inmates inthe institution.</TEXT></DOC>
