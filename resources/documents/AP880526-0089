Dr. Livingston Wong, chief of St. Francis Medical Center'stransplant team, and two unidentified doctors _ a cardiologist anda kidney specialist from the Philippines _ saw Marcos on Sunday athis home here, KHON said Wednesday.   The station gave no sources for the report.   Wong refused to comment on the report. Marcos spokesman GemmoTrinidad said he knew nothing about the reported visit.   Marcos, 70, remained in guarded condition Wednesday night in theintensive care unit at the medical center, Trinidad said. Earlierin the day, Marcos' physician, Dr. Derek Pang, ruled out thepossibility of a heart attack, Trindidad said.   More tests were ordered for today to determine if a lung ailmentcaused the chest pains that led Marcos to enter the hospitalTuesday night, he said.   Marcos' staff stationed guards in the intensive care unit and atevery entrance to the hospital.   Marcos wife, Imelda, said in a radio interview aired in Manilathat the former president is suffering because he has not beenallowed to return home.   Tomas Gomez, Philippine consul general to Hawaii, dismissed thepains as an attempt on the part of Marcos to return to his homelandfor the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May4 at the age of 95.   ``I think these are charades. These chest pains are notsubstantiated medically,'' Gomez said. ``The problem I have withMr. Marcos is you never know when he's telling the truth.''   President Corazon Aquino, saying Marcos continues to pose athreat the national security of the Philippines, has refused tolift the ban on his return, which she imposed in 1986 after he fledinto exile here.   Marcos' quest to return home drew support from severalPhilippine politicians.   ``This is going to create another problem if (Marcos) comes homein a box,'' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda. ``Now is the time for thegovernment to act to allow him to return.''</TEXT></DOC>
