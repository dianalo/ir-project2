(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Gang's All HereandM;Someday, perhaps, next to every freestanding computer or network station willsit an affordable laser printer with the intelligence to recognize the natureof the data coming in and to produce the appropriate output on demand.andO;Meanwhile, even the dumbest laser printers are so expensive that they arealmost always shared.andP;  Because they are not necessary or appropriate for alljobs, we look for ways to share them only among those users who really needthem.andM;The ideal multiprinter system would give access to any number of printers forany number of users.andP;  Preferably, the system would have the ability tomanipulate print queues and to set default devices, access priorities andwork-groups and so on.andP;  All this would be accomplished transparent to theusers and at high speed; users would have complete control over printerfunctions and features.andM;But in the microcomputer world, printers have generally been conceived of assingle-user products.andP;  Manufacturers have traditionally supplied standardserial/parallel connections and a set of proprietary control codes and leftany remaining connectivity matters up to others.andP;  The increasing number andcomplexity of networks and other multiuser installations, however, hasgenerated new demands on manufacturers' products.andM;Laser printing needsandM;Aware of this trend, Hewlett-Packard Co. has formed a Network PrinterOperation to look at the needs of shared and remote printing.andP;  The goal, saysits product manager, George Mulhern, should be to make remote printing aseasy as if the printer were on the user's desk.andM;Two of the more important concerns Mulhern identified are the need forgreater speed (to move more data) and for a bidirectional I/O channel (toallow the printer to communicate more about its condition back to thecomputer).andP;  &quot;Wouldn't it be nice,&quot; he asked, &quot;if you could interact with aprinter that is attached at the end of a long line that is running at10M-bits-per-second network speeds?&quot;andM;Mike Sukihara, vice president of printer and display products at Qume Corp.,andO;painted a similar picture of the goals for manufacturers of high-endproducts: serve more users, faster; establish a standard set ofprinter-control language extensions; improve the mechanics and remote controlof paper-handling.andP;  &quot;If we're going to go into the network environment as anindustry,&quot; Sukihara said, &quot;these are some of the things we have to thinkabout.&quot;andP;  Eventually, he foresees a printer with a direct network connection,for example Ethernet, able to handle buffering and spooling with its ownprocessor and rigid disk.andM;According to John Ervin, executive director of marketing at QMS Inc., whetherthe capacity is inside or outside the printer, there is a need forintelligent data-stream parsing.andP;  The user shouldn't have to worry about whatis in the job or what the printer will do with it.andP;  QMS' efforts are aimed ata situation where, &quot;Just print it,&quot; is all you need to say to the system.andM;However, current technology often requires third-party solutions to achieveconvenient remote printer sharing and control.andP;  Pete Peterson, whose company,Digital Products Inc., manufactures sophisticated peripheral-sharingequipment, says, &quot;Such products should provide access to all printerfeatures, be easy to install and support and be fast enough to easebottlenecks caused by graphics printing.&quot;andP;  Local area networks, he pointsout, don't provide solutions to these problems.andP;  In any case, Peterson, likeother suppliers of hardware, views LANs as unnecessary and too expensive formost printer-sharing situations.andM;Network bluesandM;Even when LANs are employed, sharing printers can still get complicated.andO;Large installations running Novell Inc.'s Netware 2.15, for example, oftenchafe at the limit of five system printers, either because they must adddifferent kinds of printers or because print traffic has increased.andM;Office layout can also present a problem.andP;  While the server should be out ofthe way in a secure area, printers must be accessible and widely distributed.andO;Parallel connections make it difficult to place system printers too far awayfrom the server, and extra printers attached to workstations are availableonly to those workstations.andP;  Novell has announced improved printer supportfor Netware 386, but meanwhile current installations must search forsolutions to this distribution problem.andM;The Bankers Systems Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of business forms andsoftware products for the finance industry, runs several different kinds ofsystems in its print-intensive business.andP;  Its graphics department hastransparent, built-in access to printers anywhere on their Sun MicrosystemsInc.andP;  TOPS network.andP;  The network consists of a half-dozen Macintoshes and twoPCs.andM;A pop-up menu directs a print job to whichever device is &quot;published&quot; asavailable from among two Applewriters, a Data Products PostScript printer andtwo RIP (raster image processor) boxes connected to Linotronics typesetters.andO;For a small network of this type, an out-of-the-box solution is adequate.andM;On the other hand, the software products department features a linked pair ofNovell networks running a dozen laser printers that are distributedthroughout a large office complex.andP;  The department solved the problem ofaccessing the large number of scattered printers by using an add-on program.andO;Only two of the system printers are connected to a server; the remainder areattached to various workstations on both networks.andM;But any printer on a logged-in station is available to any other user via PSPrint, a utility from Brightwork Software.andP;  This utility directs data to adesignated device on the network rather than to one of the server's printerports.andM;Workers generally print to a machine in their area by popping up the PS Printwindow and sending the job to the appropriate queue.andP;  Using a pop-up menu,the system administrator can check printer and queue status, assignpriorities, and so on.andM;LANSpool from LAN Systems Inc. addresses the same problem.andP;  James Rosen, vicepresident of the company's network products group, says that LANSpool, as aVAP (value-added process), is more tightly integrated into Netware than itscompetitors.andP;  Also, by employing Novell's SPX (sequenced packet exchange)protocol, true peer-to-peer communication is achieved with printers attachedto workstations.andP;  Unlike PS Print, LANSpool will access any printer whosehost is turned on.andM;In addition to converting station printers into system resources, LANSpoolcan turn an ordinary PC into a print server that controls as many as sevenother printers.andP;  All these printers are accessible by all users, allowingsystem designers to set up a printer room away from the file server.andM;Smaller systems have their own problems.andP;  One of the challenges facing themanager of a growing system is choosing the method of printer-sharing thatmatches his company or departmental needs, organization and budget.andM;A network is not cost-effective for simple peripheral-sharing.andP;  Multiportmanual switches are clearly inadequate.andP;  The in-between solution is for somesort of automatic data switch.andM;Multiple laser printers, perhaps with different functions and abilities, andlocated in different locations, must be shared according to whose workrequires a given kind of device.andP;  Users and printers are grouped so that,say, only the desktop-publishing and graphic-design workers have access toPostScript machines, while correspondence goes to page printers.andM;When there are multiple machines of a class, print jobs should automaticallygo to the first available machine rather than simply queuing at one.andP;  In theinterest of flexibility, any computer should be able to access any printer.andM;Smart-box solutionandM;For this niche between simple device switches and full-fledged networks,manufacturers of data switches have developed smart boxes with &quot;sub-LAN&quot;capabilities (a coinage and trademark of Digital Products).andP;  As the marketinglanguage indicates, these products go beyond scanning switches and buffers byoffering various combinations of the features previously listed.andM;For installations where application sharing isn't needed, this kind ofsolution can provide 80 percent of network functionality at 20 percent to 25percent of the cost of product, installation and support, according toDigital Products marketing specialist Suzanne Diaz.andP;  Even networks canbenefit, either by unloading all or part of the printing from the system, orby setting up a hardware connection for those users who need access only toperipherals and not the full network.andP;  In an extension of this sub-LANapproach, some manufacturers offer file-copying and E-mail functions.andM;The key requirements for this class of product include flexibility andcontrol of I/O direction.andP;  Any one of several incoming jobs should besoftware-directable to any one of several output ports; buffer space shouldbe dynamically allocated rather than statically partitioned.andM;Other desirable features include: automatic two-way serial-parallelconversion; hardware configuration by software; user-definable defaultsettings for each station; job-control functions; descriptive names fordestination ports; high-speed data transmission; multiple methods ofaddressing and controlling ports in addition to any proprietary controlprogram; administrative, maintenance and security functions.andM;The more expensive the unit, generally, the more features and flexibilitysuch as more ports, bigger buffers, higher serial rates, more intelligenceand programmability and better control over printers and queues.andP;  (Forpurposes of cost-per-port comparisons, the standard smart box configurationwill assume a megabyte of buffer.)andM;For small installations, Fifth Generation Systems Inc.'s Logical Connectionand Quadram Corp.'s Microfazer VI are basic units that have respectablepower.andP;  Both are chainable buffered switches (256K bytes to 1M byte) andoffer serial and parallel ports.andM;The Microfazer VI comes with six serial ports or four serial ports and twoparallel ports (any port can function as input or output).andP;  LogicalConnection's four serial ports are configurable for input or output, but itsfour parallel ports are fixed at two in and two out.andP;  Both use configurationprograms for initial settings and pop-up programs for printer selection.andM;Because of the logical Connection's two extra ports, more devices can beconnected (as many as six computers to two parallel ports), even though twoof the ports are fixed as output.andP;  The Microfazer's programmable I/O gives ita bit more flexibility.andP;  At $995 for a megabyte of buffer, the LogicalConnection's $124 per port is dramatically less expensive than the $1,227Microfazer's $204 per port.andM;Under software controlandM;A 10-port (six serial ports and four parallel ports) device called the modelSL is supplied by Buffalo Products.andP;  It features a top transmission speed of38.4K baud, internal throughput of 6,000 characters per second (cps),automatic two-way serial-parallel conversion, a top buffer size of 4M bytesand chaining.andP;  All the SL's functions are under software control.andM;The menu-driven installation program sets the port assignments andcharacteristics, including RS232C parameters for the serial ports (rates of75 baud to 38.4K baud, parity, handshaking, 7 or 8 bits) and builds theconfiguration for the pop-up user-menu program.andP;  The user menu can be run aseither a transient program or resident program.andP;  In the latter case, it takes15K bytes of system memory in text mode or 25K bytes in graphics mode (thegraphics version will even pop-up over and restore Ventura Publisher screens,according to Buffalo spokesman Rick Stanza).andP;  From the pop-up menu, a usercan accept a default or &quot;last-used&quot; printer or choose another and pause,redirect or clear data from his channel.andM;In the supervisor mode, the computer connected to Port 5 can reconfigure theSL and perform administrative jobs such as providing the channel names thatappear on user menus, changing timeout values, assigning passwords and so on.andO;With a base price of $500 and a flat charge of $100 per 256K bytes of buffer,the SL's 1M-byte model has by far the strongest cost/performance ratio of $90per port.andM;Many ports availableandM;The Rose Electronics' MasterSwitch series offers a wide range of numbers andtypes of ports.andP;  Standard (MS) models have five ports or nine ports, alleither serial or parallel.andP;  Universal (U) models have three ports, six portsor nine ports that are individually programmable as serial or parallel.andO;Networking (N) models have combinations of five ports (four serial, oneparallel), nine ports (eight serial, one parallel), 13 ports (12 serial, oneparallel) and 17 ports (16 serial, one parallel).andP;  All models come with abuffer of 64K bytes, upgradable from 256K bytes to 4M bytes, and MasterLinksoftware.andM;Top serial speed is ordinarily 19.2K baud, but n models with MasterNetsoftware will run 115.2K baud.andP;  (The N-series/MasterNet software combinationalso has sub-LAN capacities.)andM;Otherwise, MasterSwitch units have all the hardware features of the BuffaloSL and somewhat more extensive software control.andP;  The customizable MasterLinkprogram, which runs in resident mode or transient mode, can direct print jobsto named devices, query printer status or send a dozen other standardcommands to the MasterSwitch unit.andM;Submenus report job status and allow a given job to be cancelled, suspendedor released and permit hardware reconfiguration.andP;  Alternately, controlstrings (all of which are ASCII) can be sent from the MasterLink's terminalemulator, via batch files or initialization strings sent by an applicationprogram (e.g.andP;  Lotus or WordPerfect) or Novell Netware processes.andM;Peter Macourek of Rose Electronics points out that a MasterSwitch canco-exist with a network or UNIX system or any system that supplies standardserial output.andP;  Adding a unit to a Novell file server and adjusting thePrintdef setup for its port allows users to get around the Netwarefive-printer limit while permitting use of the server for print-spooling.andO;That same MasterSwitch, attached to non-networked computers, can also giveusers outside the system access to the system printers connected to theMasterSwitch.andM;Beyond printer-sharingandM;Calling itself &quot;the sub-LAN company,&quot; Digital Products offers two families ofProducts.andP;  The NetCommander (NC) Sub-LAN units, like Rose's MasterSwitch, cancombine with software to offer capabilities beyond printer-sharing, includingautomatic backup, file-sharing and transfer.andP;  Its PrintDirector seriesincludes models in two ranges: &quot;printer management&quot; (PDMS) and &quot;printersharing&quot; (PD-6, PD-10 and PD-16) products.andP;  The PDMS models offer eightports, 10 ports or 16 ports in various combinations, 256K bytes to 4M bytesof buffer and 4,000 cps throughput.andP;  Its PD models offer six ports, 10 portsor 16 ports, 256K bytes to 2M bytes of buffer and 2,000 cps throughput.andM;Digital Products' software allows extensive control of printer capabilities.andO;The SmallPop program for the PD models is similar to that of BigPop (auser-friendly pop-up menu for accessing printer features) for the NC and PDMSseries.andP;  A configuration program includes a library of printer features (fivemakes, including Hewlett-Packard and QMS laser printers, for SmallPop; 150makes for BigPop).andP;  Thus, for each model, a menu of features allows the userto select the features that will be set or initialized when that menu item ischosen.andP;  &quot;Printegration&quot; or &quot;JetTalk&quot; (the name is in transition) is astring-translator for the NC and PDMS models.andP;  It provides configurabledriver support for text-enhancement features that are available in a printerbut not supported by an application.andM;In dealing with the LaserJet and its compatibles, JetTalk eliminates havingto learn the details of Hewlett-Packard's Page Control Language.andP;  The latestaddition to JetTalk is support of the LaserJet's overlay capacity, in which aform or image--such as a letterhead--is loaded into the printer memory andmerged with the text at print time.andP;  Up to 32 overlay descriptions can beplaced on the pop-up menu and sent to the printer at will.andP;  Digital Productswill prepare images for loading at $400 per page.andM;Modular approachandM;The Applied Creative Technology Inc. Systemizer Plus distributes, rather thancentralizes, printer access, buffering and job processing.andP;  It gives eachuser a box with two ports (one serial port and one parallel port,I/O-switchable in hardware), 64K bytes to 1M byte of buffer and a connectionto one or two other Systemizers.andM;Computers and printers are connected to Systemizers by the conventionalports.andP;  Up to 31 boxes can be chained (with up to 1,200 feet of wire run) viafour-conductor RJ11 plugs and these boxes can communicate at up to 19.2Kbaud.andP;  Each Systemizer on the chain has a unique address (set by dual in-linepackage--DIP--switches inside the unit), so any device connected to a box isaccessible from any other device.andP;  This is the basis of Systemizer printersharing as well as its sub-LAN capacities (file copying and optional E-mail).andM;Once the Systemizer is configured (by a script sent from the host computer),it is operated by 12 front-panel switches.andP;  Four of these switches areprogrammable from the host computer to accept input, route it to theappropriate destination Systemizer (where it will generally be printed),translate data strings, etc.andP;  Status messages take the form of LEDs thatlight and blink in various patterns.andM;While front-panel switches and lights seem primitive compared to pop-up menusand verbal status messages, they are reasonably simple to use.andP;  And it isstill possible to control the Systemizer by sending command strings in batchfiles, document headers or any other means that addresses the host computer'soutput port.andM;Since it is manually controlled, the Systemizer must be within reach of theoperator.andP;  This, and the decision about where to place printers, will affectwhether to use the serial port or the parallel port for computer output andwill affect wiring layout.andM;The modular nature of this approach allows considerable flexibility.andP;  Unitsin a Systemizer network can be set to a standard configuration (for example,default to a common printer or scan a group of printers for the firstavailable printer), or they can be customized to suit the individual user (apersonal default printer, a special printer-setup script), or any combinationof standard and custom configuration.andP;  Any defaults can be overridden byselecting a different destination, and destinations not included in the eightaccessible by keypad can be addressed by a command string.andM;Any modular hardware system is necessarily going to cost more per user than acentralized system.andP;  The Systemizer's base price of $399 with no buffer RAMmakes it nearly twice as expensive per port than the next highest multiportunit with a megabyte of buffer.andP;  A 1M-byte Systemizer Plus lists at $748.andO;Applied Creative Technology argues that not every user needs a large buffer.andO;And that by decentralizing hardware and buffering the whole network, thesystem is far more flexible and less vulnerable to breakdown.andM;One site where Systemizers have been accepted as cost-effective is NorthwestAirlines, which uses about 200 of them at their headquarters.andP;  In his workenvironment, says PC manager Paul Howe, groups are spread out and printersare likely to change or move around.andP;  The Systemizer's cost-per-user wasoffset by simplicity of installation, reliability and ease of use--they arecompletely transparent to the user.andP;  Work groups averaging six people oreight people, of up to 14 people, are spread out over Howe's building.andP;  Thewire-run for Howe's group is over 300 feet with one station locateddiagonally across the building from the rest.andM;The PrintLink from QMS is an intelligent print server, essentially adedicated PC/AT-class computer (12.5-MHz 80286 CPU, 512K bytes, 20M-bytesrigid disk, monitor and keyboard) that features a proprietary operatingsystem.andP;  PrintLink connects directly to Ethernet TCP/IP and givessimultaneous access for seven users to as many as three printers.andM;At $3,250 plus $995 for the three-port Option 903, this isn't the solutionfor the small office.andP;  And, in fact, QMS generally sells the PrintLink alongwith, and as a gateway to, one of their high-end laser printers such as the22-page-per-minute, $5,995 Lasergrafix 2200.andM;Its standard Ethernet connection, speed and multitasking capabilities makethe PrintLink especially useful with UNIX.andP;  Optional software allowsPrintLink to communicate with VAX/VMS and DECnet environments.andM;Russell Letson is owner of Microcomputer Consulting, a company that providessoftware and hardware documentation services.andP;  Letson has written for suchmagazines as Sextant and Business Computer Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
