Nitrogen gas was used to produce a continuous ion-beam currentdensity of N/sub 2//sup +/ ions equal to 100 {mu}A cm/sup -2/. Fibresamples which are anisotropic were exposed to the ion beam for varioustime intervals. Empirical formulae are suggested for the measured variationof optical properties with time of exposure. The wavelength dependenceof refractive indices of the irradiated fibres was studied interferometrically.Illustrations are given by microinterferograms.</TEXT></DOC>
