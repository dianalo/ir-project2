Chief executive Frederick Joseph outlined the status of Drexel'scrisis in a memorandum to the staff last week. Copies were leaked tothe Wall Street Journal and New York Times, and sources familiarwith the letter confirmed the contents of the memo today.   A guilty plea would mark a stunning turnaround for Drexel, whichvowed to fight accusations of securities fraud that arose afterspeculator Ivan F. Boesky implicated the firm in a plea bargain hereached with the government.   Boesky, who had extensive dealings with Drexel, paid a record$100 million in fines and penalties for insider trading and is nowserving a three-year prison term for conspiracy to lie to theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   Drexel was named in a SEC civil securities fraud complaint nearlythree months ago, and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani has beensupervising a grand jury investigation of the firm.   ``In recent weeks, we have had discussions with the governmentwhich are now reaching a crucial stage,'' Joseph told employees inthe memo.   If Drexel does not agree to settlement terms with Giuliani, thememo read, ``we believe that he intends to indict the firm (as wellas certain of our employees,) and to include in such an indictmentso-called racketeering charges.''   Conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law, which originally was intended to combat drugpushers and pimps, would taint Drexel as a criminal enterprise andcould entail crippling fines.   ``If we settle, we can put this constant attack on the firmbehind us,'' Joseph said in the memo. ``But to do so will require aguilty plea. We believe, however, that the U.S. attorney would notaccept a settlement from Drexel unless it exceeds Boesky'ssettlement.''   He estimated that as a result of the investigation, the firmalready had lost $1.5 billion in potential revenues, spent $175million in direct legal expenses and provided 1.5 million pages ofgovernment-requested documents.   Joseph said any settlement likely would involve what he called a``substantial dollar amount and a guilty plea by the firm, as wellas other conditions.''   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment. Officials atGiuliani's office also declined to comment, in accordance with theirpractice of confidentiality about criminal investigations.   The Journal, quoting sources it did not identify, said Drexel wasleaning more toward a settlement because of several recentdevelopments, notably subpoenas to Drexel attorneys from Giuliani'soffice and his attempts to compel cooperation from a senior employeeto substantiate the government's case.   The Journal quoted sources as saying Drexel officials also fearedthey would lose business if the company was branded a racketeer.</TEXT></DOC>
