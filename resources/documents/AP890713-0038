Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly said Wednesday itwould be an ``exaggeration'' to say an official dialogue between thetwo sides is taking place. But he added there is ``classifiedreporting about contacts'' between the two sides that he woulddiscuss only in a closed-door session.   Israeli officials vehemently denied any contacts with the PLO.   Kelly's statement came in an appearance before a congressionalpanel in which he also said hard-liners in Israel are damagingprospects for elections in the occupied territories. He deniedIsraeli radio reports that the United States is trying to interferein Israel's affairs.   Asked about the six-month-old diplomatic talks between the PLOand the U.S., Kelly said they have yielded no tangible results andthat the talks wouldn't go on forever.   In Israel, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, and Danny Naveh, spokesman for Foreign Minister Moshe Arensdenied to Israeli radio that Israel had had contacts with the PLO.``There are no, and there will be no, contacts with the PLO,'' Navehwas quoted as saying.   Kelly also was asked about PLO comments on last week's attack onan Israeli bus in which 14 civilians were killed. He said U.S.Ambassador Robert Pelletreau was instructed last week to ``bring upshort'' Bassam Abu Sharif, the PLO spokesman who labeled the attacka legitimate part of Palestinian resistance efforts.   Yasser Arafat, in an interview with Hearst News Service, saidWednesday he regretted the loss of life and denied any PLOinvolvement.   ``It is painful for me to witness the loss of all these civilianlives,'' Arafat said in the interview.   Kelly, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs subcommitteeon Europe and the Middle East, denied that next week's high-levelState Department mission to Israel was aimed at persuading theparties in the coalition government to stay together.   He said the delegation, whose participants and schedule were notyet final, would discuss future prospects for Israeli-Palestiniannegotiations.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the subcommittee chairman, noted newsreports that the Bush administration was signaling Israeli leadersthat it hopes the Labor Party will not leave the coalitiongovernment, and Hamilton said it was ``rather extraordinary for theUnited States to inject itself into domestic politics.''   Kelly said he was ``a little distressed at that interpretation ofthe trip,'' which he said is only for the purpose of having ``ahealthy exchange'' about prospects for peace.   ``It is not up to us to try to stage-manage domestic politics inIsrael. ... We're not going to have a public position on an issuelike that.''   He said the United States still regards Israeli policy assupporting the concept of elections among the 1.7 millionPalestinians under Israel's occupation in the West Bank and GazaStrip. That is ``the operative and legally binding basis for theIsraeli government to proceed,'' he said.   Limits that hard-liners imposed on the election proposal at aLikud Party conference last week ``did not advance the process,''Kelly said. ``If they became government policy ... that would makeit more difficult. But we do not believe the final act has beenplayed.''</TEXT></DOC>
