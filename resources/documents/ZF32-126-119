(Systems Design Life Cycle)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Kizior, Ronald J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Rapid iterative methodologies are available that speed up thecyclical process of computer-based management information systems.andO;The Systems Design Life Cycle (SDLC) approach should not bedisregarded, however it should be considered with flexibility inmind.andP;  New methodologies include joint application design (JAD),prototyping, integrated CASE tools, and application generatortools.andP;  SDLC was never intended to be used in a tight andrestrictive manner, and should be thought of as a base.andP;  Designersshould consider taking a flexible course of action within the SDLCframework.andP;  SDLC can be broken down into phases that can be aguide to be molded according to existing resources.andP;  Perhaps inthe future, systems can be designed to fit the people who will beusing them, rather than training the users to match the system.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     System DesignInformation SystemsInformation Resources ManagementImplementationCase StudyUser InterfaceProject ManagementMethodsProject Life Cycle.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
