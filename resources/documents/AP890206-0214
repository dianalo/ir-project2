Bobby Joe Stuckey takes over hisfather's television evengelism empire in HBO's ``Glory, Glory'' andis soon up to his halo in trouble, just like...well, some recentheadline-makers.   But Richard Thomas, who stars as Bobby Joe, insists that thescript for the 3{-hour musical comedy was written long before Jimand Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart became household names.   ``The script's been around for a while,'' says Thomas,best-remembered as John Boy on the TV series ``The Waltons.'' ``Wefilmed it last summer in Toronto. It more or less started as anexamination of the phenomenon of television evangelism.''   The story originated in 1981 with co-executive producer BonnyDore, who had worked briefly with evangelist Oral Roberts inpolishing his broadcasts.   ``If I felt the film was taking cheap shots at someone's faith Inever would have done it,'' Thomas says. At the center, Stuckey is aman of true faith but he's been seduced into straying. He can speakfor the importance of spirituality, but all institutions are subjectto compromise and corruption.''   The movie, directed by Lindsay Anderson (``The Whales ofAugust,'' ``O Lucky Man'') will premiere on Sunday.   Bobby Joe is a biblical scholar totally lacking in the starquality his father used to turn his little church into a televisionempire. He's earnest but dull, and the ratings start to tumble. Indesperation, he turns to a down-and-out rock singer who becomes thecharismatic Sister Ruth. The ratings and the donations reachunprecedented levels with Sister Ruth.   But behind the altar, unknown to Bobby Joe, she's leading a lifeof Sodom and Gamorrah. He's deeply in love with her, and when itcomes crashing down he's the candidate for a pillar of salt.   Ellen Greene stars as Sister Ruth, Winston Rekert as aninvestigative reporter, James Whitmore as a church elder and BarryMorse as Bobby Joe's father, the Rev. Dan Stuckey.   ``When they called me they said the part was for a nice,clean-cut preacher,'' Thomas says. ``Some things you do becausethey're radically different from what you've done before. Some youdo because they're familiar. This was familiar, but I liked the wayit was written. It's satire without taking cheap shots.   ``He compromises himself with this woman, and before he knows ithe's trapped in a web of deceit and conspiracy.''   In February, Thomas goes to the Hartford Stage in Connecticut for``Peer Gynt.'' He will appear in a new translation of Henrik Ibsen'sseven-hour play, which will be presented over two nights. Thesix-week run will keep him there until May.   ``I played `Hamlet' there in 1987,'' Thomas says. ``That'sShakespeare's longest play and this is a thousand lines longer than`Hamlet.' Many people consider the play to be Ibsen's masterpiece.''   Thomas spends much of his time teaching classes at collegesacross the country.   ``And, with any luck, I'll get another TV movie or two,'' hesays. ``That's how it works out. I don't have the most expensivehabits. A TV movie will take care of my expenses so I can do theaterand teach. Then when I'm at home it's a full-time job for my wifeand I to look after four kids.''   Thomas left ``The Waltons'' in 1977. The immensely popular seriesthat ran on CBS from 1972-81 was based on Earl Hamner'sreminiscences about his boyhood in Virginia, in 1977.   ``I'd love it if we had a reunion show,'' Thomas says, ``but onlyEarl could write it. He's a sly fox with a deliciously wicked senseof humor. He's as much a country bumpkin as Donald Trump.''   As for another series, Thomas says he would certainly considerit. ``But a series takes up so much of your time it would have to besomething I absolutely loved,'' he says. ``I prefer plays, but I'man actor. The material comes first. If it's right I'll go anywhereand work in any medium.   ``I have been lucky as an actor. I've always gotten work. I'venever had to wait by the phone. Too many actors regard the theateras some place you go to stretch, as though it was an aerobics class.Or they say it's their duty to go back, as though it were anobligation like having tea with a maiden aunt. When people see me ina film they see my work. But when they see me on stage they see mework.''   Thomas recently observed 30 years as a professional actor. Hemade his debut in 1958 at the age of 7 in ``Sunrise at Campobello.''He played the youngest of Franklin Roosevelt's children, John. Thatsame year he made his television debut in ``A Christmas Tree'' forthe Hallmark Hall of Fame.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 19</NOTE></DOC>
