(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the tourist seasonunder way, superintendents of the National Park Service convened anextraordinary meeting today on how to safeguard America's naturalheritage and were told to ``stand up for your park's resources.''   The four-day conference at Jackson Lake Lodge, the first of itskind in 12 years, was called by National Park Service DirectorWilliam Penn Mott. All 341 superintendents were invited to thegathering in the shadow of the Grand Teton.   ``If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parksare no longer islands,'' said Mott. ``I am asking you to stand upfor your park's resources. ... We cannot expect someone else to dothat for us. We must be willing to do that ourselves.''   The director said coming together in ``this beautiful place willrenew our creativity, replenish the strength of our commitment, andunite us in meeting the wonderful and awesome challenges ahead.''   Mott described the National Park system as the storehouse ofAmerica's greatest treasures, but added, ``there are, however, someominous `cracks' in the storehouse.''   Although Mott did not single out specific threats to thenational parks, increasing pressures include commercial andresidential development along park boundaries, timbering, oildrilling, and pollution of park resources.   Several sessions during the next few days will focus on thosethreats and ways park superintendents will try to deal with them.   Mott said the Park Service must ``reach out to and work withadjacent landowners and land managing agencies to let them know thepotential impacts of their actions on park resources. ... We mustreach out into the surrounding communities ... and work withgovernment agencies and the private sector to resolve problemsbefore they reach crisis stage.   ``That is our challenge as we move into the 21st century,'' saidMott.   In a morning news conference, Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn.,chairman of the House Subcommiteee on National Parks and PublicLands, advocated reorganization of the park service to give itsdirector a more independent role.   Vento has introduced a bill calling for presidential appointmentof the director and confirmation by the Senate for a fixed term.Vento said such a move would ``free the director to be anadvocate'' and remove him from the political arena.   The meeting comes on the brink of summer, as many national parksand recreation areas gear up for record crowds. It is also thelatest chapter in the continuing controversy over the nation'sofficially preserved natural heritage.   ``This is not a regional or headquarters agenda, this conferenceis by and for the superintendents,'' said George Berklacy, chief ofpublic affairs for the park service.   ``I think it is a very serious, professional thing that theyhave done'' in holding the conference, said T. Destry Jarvis, vicepresident of the National Parks and Conservation Association, aWashington-based non-profit citizens group.   ``I think it's very important that the National Park Serviceenhance the notion that this is a single service, with a singlepurpose,'' said Jarvis, who planned to attend the meeting as anobserver. ``I'm sure they will get a lot of business done thatwould not occur if they weren't together.''   ``It is in the best interest of the country,'' said SteveWhitney of the Wilderness Society, adding that the superintendents``shouldn't wait another decade for another one.''   The National Park system includes 49 full-fledged national parksand 292 other units, including national recreation areas andnational seashore areas, encompassing 77 million acres.   Last week, the Wilderness Society issued a report calling on thefederal government to move all hotels and other concessions out ofthe parks.   The report also identified what the environmental organizationdeemed were the 10 most endangered parks, among them Yellowstone.   The National Parks and Conservation Association also recentlyissued a report, compiled during three years, that recommended a$50 million annual increase in the park service's budget just tofix a backlog of resource management problems.   The Park Service itself issued a 1980 report to Congress on the``State of the Parks'' that identified more than 4,000 individualthreats.   A recent General Accounting Office survey concluded that theagency had an unmet need of $1.9 billion for maintenance andcapital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year. ``Because ofadvanced, continuing deterioration, some of these assets may belost permanently,'' the study said.   The Reagan administration has proposed a Park Service budget of$779 million for the next fiscal year.   One conference session deals solely with the federal budgetprocess and the Park Service.   The tab for the meeting is estimated at $600,000, said Berklacy.He noted that this year's regional and zone superintendents'meetings, which cost about $300,000 in all, have been cancelled.</TEXT></DOC>
