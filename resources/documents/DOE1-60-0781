The communities of Afroamerican ancestry spread along theAtlantic coast of Central America and on the Caribbean Islands providean opportunity to evaluate the interplay of such phenomena in the naturalhistory of a human population and their relative importance in the determinationof its genetic structure. These Afroamerican communities are thoughtto be the result of a complex process of admixture involving, to an extentwhich varies from one community to another, various African peoples,mostly from central and western Africa, Europeans and American Indians.The present paper reports the results of the analysis of historical records,demography and genetic structure of the Afroamerican population inhabitingthe Atlantic coast of Nicaragua, in an attempt to reconstruct the patternsthat have led to the present-day population and to estimate the relativeethnic contributions to its gene pool.</TEXT></DOC>
