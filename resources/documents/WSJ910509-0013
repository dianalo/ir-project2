In a procedural victory for consumer advocates and adefeat for big business, senators voted 63-35 for a so-calledcloture petition, which limits further debate on theantitrust bill. A vote on the measure itself is expectedtoday.</LP><TEXT>   The threat of a Republican filibuster in the Senate haseffectively killed the measure in each of the past two years.The House has approved similar legislation in the past and isexpected to do so again in the coming months.   President Bush is expected to veto the price-fixing billif it reaches his desk. It isn't clear whether proponents inthe Senate have enough votes to override a veto.   Today, Sen. Hank Brown (R., Colo.) is expected to push amodified version of the antitrust measure originallysponsored by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio). Consumeradvocates have called passage of the Metzenbaum bill theirtop priority, contending that the legislation could saveshoppers as much as $20 billion a year. Sen. Metzenbaum hasindicated that he will accept the Brown alternative, whichwas designed to address some of the objections from themanufacturers' lobby. The modified measure would still codifythat price-fixing by manufacturers and retailers isautomatically illegal.   Both measures would make it easier for discount retailersand the government to bring antitrust suits allegingresale-price maintenance. The measures would reduce theevidentiary requirements imposed on parties bringing suchsuits.</TEXT></DOC>
