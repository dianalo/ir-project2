In more than a dozen cases pending around the nation,lawyers are using what they are calling the &quot;Prozac defense&quot;in an effort to prove that their clients should not be heldlegally responsible for their crimes.</LP><TEXT>   The trials are the latest development in a controversyover Prozac that first emerged last summer when a Prozac userclaimed the drug had caused her to attempt suicide. More than50 civil suits related to violence allegedly induced byProzac are currently pending against Indianapolis-basedLilly. Among the more noted of these suits is the one filedby the son of Joseph Wesbecker, who entered a Louisville,Ky., printing plant in 1989 and killed eight people andwounded 12 before killing himself. Mr. Wesbecker, on medicalleave from the plant, was on Prozac for five weeks prior tothe shooting.   A spokesman for Lilly says that scientific data fromclinical trials involving more than 25,000 individuals doesnot support the idea that the widely used Prozac causesviolent behavior. But in the murder cases, Lilly will have tosit on the sidelines -- and thus won't be able to defend itsproduct -- because it is not a party to the criminallitigation.   Prosecutors who have watched the emergence of the Prozacdefense have urged the courts not to consider it untilscientists conclusively determine whether there is a causallink between violent behavior and use of the drug. Still,defense lawyers contend that to protect the legal rights ofcriminal defendants lawyers must be allowed to use the Prozacdefense.   &quot;As a defense lawyer, I don't have to prove that Prozaccaused the murder. I just have to raise a reasonable doubtthat my client acted voluntarily and that without the drugthe violence would not have occurred,&quot; says Alan D. Boyack, aSt. George, Utah, lawyer whose client allegedly committedmurder while on Prozac.   Two recent rulings indicate that some judges are beginningto allow evidence regarding Prozac to be presented incriminal cases. Last week, a state judge in Susanville,Calif., ruled that Douglas Cecrle, who is on trial forallegedly beating his estranged wife to death, can presentthe Prozac defense to the jury.   Last October, Circuit Court Judge William A. Lewis ofMarion, Ill., sentenced a man who killed his father to fouryears' probation after learning the father had been takingProzac. The man had pleaded guilty to the killing, whichoccurred after the father attacked him. While the case isunusual because the victim, rather than the defendant tookthe drug, Judge Lewis says he decided to be lenient becausehe was convinced that the drug caused the father's violence.   Prosecutors have questioned the use of the Prozac defensebecause many of the defendants used other prescription drugsin addition to Prozac at the time of their alleged crimes.They have also argued that it is virtually impossible todemonstrate that Prozac, rather than the defendant'sunderlying mental state, was at fault.   At the first &quot;Prozac defense&quot; trial, held in Norwalk,Calif., in November, a jury convicted Mildred Johnson ofvoluntary manslaughter in the shooting of her husband. Ms.Johnson, 74 years old, faces up to 13 years in prison whenshe is sentenced in April.   Felipa R. Richland, a Los Angeles attorney for Ms.Johnson, says that the jurors refused to convict Ms. Johnsonof the most serious charges because they believed she wassuffering from the side effects of Prozac. Ms. Richland hasasked the court to grant a new trial.   Linda Chilstrom, the prosecutor, says the jury sympathizedwith Ms. Johnson because of her advanced age, not because sheused Prozac. &quot;The jury didn't buy it. If this is going to bea valid legal defense, it has to be medically proven. So farit hasn't been,&quot; says Ms. Chilstrom, a deputy districtattorney in Los Angeles.   The legal controversy appears to be due in part toProzac's remarkable success. First released in 1987, it is byfar the bestselling drug for depression. Sales doubled in1990 to $760 million and are expected to be at least $1billion this year. Mental-health providers praise Prozac'sability to relieve recurrent and severe depressions withoutcausing the side effects that hamper the use of otheranti-depressant drugs.   But critics of Prozac charge that its widespread usageincreases the chances that some users will react abnormally.One such critic is the Church of Scientology, which has ahistory of deploring the use of psychiatric drugs and is nowrecommending that Prozac be removed from the marketaltogether.   It isn't lost on Lilly that the Church of Scientology iscollecting data relating to cases involving the Prozacdefense. One such case is that of 33-year-old Kevin Callahan,who began taking Prozac in January 1990. Immediately after hebegan taking the drug, Mr. Callahan says, his wife noticed anew irritability in his behavior. Mr. Callahan says that hebegan to feel &quot;hostile.&quot; He says that he and his wife pointedout the new behavior and feelings to his psychiatrist, who,he says, increased the dosage.   Last March, Mr. Callahan came home after an evening at therace track, grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed his wife inthe throat and back. She survived. Charged with attemptedmurder, Mr. Callahan is now awaiting trial. He says he has noprior history of violent behavior. He blames his action onProzac.   The prosecutor declines to comment because the case ispending. But he and other prosecutors in these cases willlikely lean heavily on Food and Drug Administrationstatements that so far there's no evidence of acause-and-effect relationship between Prozac and suicidal orhomicidal behavior. &quot;There are few potent drugs that don'thave risks, some of which are life threatening. Our judgmentis that it is in the public interest to have the drugavailable on the market,&quot; says Paul Leber, the head of theFDA's division of neuropharmocological products.   Some defense lawyers concede that, under thecircumstances, proving the Prozac defense will be an uphillbattle. Kelly Thompson Jr., a Bowling Green, Ky., lawyer,says he is convinced that Prozac caused his client to shootthe physician who prescribed her the drug. But a juryconvicted her last December of attempted murder. &quot;It's hardfor a jury to accept a theoretical defense like this,&quot; hesays, &quot;when the cold facts are she shot him.&quot;   Even so, the civil lawsuits regarding Prozac, and perhapsthe emergence of the Prozac defense, have had &quot;a dramaticimpact on the performance of Lilly's stock,&quot; says RonaldNordmann, a senior drug analyst with Paine Webber Inc. Sincelast July, Lilly's stock has fallen from a high of $90.375 ashare to as low as $69 last month, he says. Yesterday itclosed at $76.125, up 37.5 cents.   ---   Michael Waldholz in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
