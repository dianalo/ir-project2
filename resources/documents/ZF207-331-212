The law can be arather blunt instrument with which to attack a hacker whose virus has causeddamage in a computer system.andP;  Among the kinds of damage that can be caused bycomputer viruses are the following: destroyed programs or data, lostcomputing time, the cost of system cleanup, and the cost of installing newsecurity measures to guard against a recurrence of the virus, just to name afew.andP;  The more extensive and expensive the damage is, the more appealing (atleast initially) will be the prospect of a lawsuit to seek compensation forthe losses incurred.andP;  But even when the damage done is considerable,sometimes it may not be worthwhile to bring a lawsuit against the hackerwhose virus has damaged the system.andP;  Careful thought should be given tomaking a realistic appraisal of the chances for a meaningful, beneficialoutcome to the case before a lawsuit is filed.andM;This appraisal must take into account the significant legal-theory andpractical difficulties with bringing a lawsuit as a way of dealing with theharm caused by a hacker's virus.andP;  This column will discuss both kinds ofdifficulties.andP;  A brief synopsis of each type of problem may be helpful beforegoing into detail about each.andP;  The legal theory problem is essentially this:There may not yet be a law on the books or clearly applicable legalprecedents that can readily be used to establish a right to legal relief incomputer virus situations.andP;  The law has lots of experience with lawsuitsclaiming a right to compensation for damage to persons or to tangibleproperty.andP;  But questions may arise if someone seeks to adapt or extend legalrules to the more intangible nature of electronically stored information.andO;The practical difficulties with using the law to get some remedy for harmcaused by a hacker's virus can be even more daunting than the legal theoryproblems.andP;  Chief among the practical difficulties is the fact that thelawsuit alone can cost more than can ever be recovered from thehacker-defendant.andM;To understand the nature of the legal theory problems with suing a hacker fordamage caused by his or her virus, it may help to understand a few basicthings about how the law works.andP;  One is that the law has often evolved todeal with new situations, and evolution of this sort is more likely whenfairness seems to require it.andP;  Another is that the law generally recognizesonly already established categories of legal claims, and each of thecategories of legal claims has its own particular pattern to it, which mustbe matched in order to win a lawsuit based on it.andP;  While judges are sometimeswilling to stretch the legal category a little to reach a fair result, theyare rarely willing to create entirely new categories of law or stretch anexisting category to the breaking point.andP;  Because of this, much of whatlawyers do is pattern-matching and arguing by analogy: taking a given set offacts relevant to a client's circumstances, sorting through various possiblecategories of legal claims to determine which of them might apply to thefacts at hand, and then developing arguments to show that this case matchesthe pattern of this legal category or is analogous to it.andM;Whenever there is no specific law passed by the legislature to deal with aspecific issue, such as damages caused by computer viruses, lawyers look tomore general categories of legal claims to try to find one that matches aparticular client's situation.andP;  &quot;Tort&quot; is the name used by lawyers to referto a category of lawsuits that aim to get money damages to compensate aninjured party for harm caused by another person's wrongful conduct.andP;  Sometorts are intentional (libel, for example, or fraud).andP;  Some areunintentional.andP;  (Negligence is a good example of this type of lawsuit.)andP;  Theharm caused by the wrongful conduct may be to the victim's person (as wheresomeone's negligence causes the victim to break a leg) or property (as wherea negligent driver smashes into another car, causing it to be &quot;totaled&quot;), ormay be more purely economic losses (as where the victim has to incur theexpense of renting another car after his or her car has been destroyed by anegligent driver).andP;  In general, tort law permits a victim to recover moneydamages for all three types of injuries so long as they are reasonablyforeseeable by the person who causes them.andP;  (Some economic losses, however,are too remote to be recoverable.)andM;Among the categories of traditional torts that might be worth considering asthe basis of a lawsuit seeking compensation for losses caused by a computervirus is the law of trespass.andP;  Though we ordinarily think of trespass inconnection with unlawful entry onto another's land, the tort of trespassapplies to more situations than this.andP;  Intentional interference withsomeone's use of his or her property can be a trespass as well.andP;  A potentialproblem with the use of trespass for computer virus situations, however,might be in persuading a judge to conceive of a virus as a physical invasionof a computer system.andP;  A defendant might argue that he or she was in anotherstate and never came anywhere near the plaintiff's computer system to showthat the trespass pattern had not been established.andP;  The plaintiff would haveto counter by arguing that the virus physically invaded the system, and wasan extension of the defendant who was responsible for planting it.andM;Another tort to consider would be the law of conversion.andP;  Someone whounlawfully &quot;converts&quot; someone else's property to his or her own use in amanner that interferes with the ability of the rightful owner to make use ofit can be sued for damages by the rightful owner.andP;  (Conversion is the tortpattern that can be used to recover damages for theft; theft itself is moreof a criminal law term.)andP;  As with trespass, the law of conversion is moreused to dealing with interferences with use of tangible items of property,such as a car.andP;  But there would seem to be a good argument that when a virusties up the computing resources of a firm or university, it is even more aconversion of the computing facility than if some component of the system(such as a terminal) was physically removed from the premises.andM;Even if a claim, such as conversion, could be established to get damages forlost computer time, that wouldn't necessarily cover all of the kinds oflosses that might have been caused by the virus.andP;  Suppose, for example, thata virus invaded individual accounts in a computer system and sent outlibelous messages masquerading as messages from the account's owner orexposed on a computer bulletin board all of the account owner's computer mailmessages.andP;  Libel would be a separate tort for a separate kind of injury.andO;Similarly, a claim might be made for invasion of privacy and intentionalmisrepresentation to get damages for injuries resulting from these aspects ofthe virus as well.andM;So far we have been talking mostly about intentional torts.andP;  A hacker mightthink that he or she could not be found liable for an intentional tortbecause he or she did not intend to cause the specific harm that resultedfrom the virus, but that is not how tort law works.andP;  All that is generallynecessary to establish an intentional tort is that the person intended to dothe conduct that caused the harm, and that the harm was of a sort that theperson knew or should have known would be reasonably certain to happen as aconsequence of his or her actions.andP;  Still, some hackers might think that ifthe harm from their viruses was accidental, as when an &quot;experiment&quot; goesawry, they might not be legally responsible for the harm.andP;  That is not so.andO;The law of negligence allows victims of accidental injury to sue to obtaincompensation for losses caused by another's negligence.andM;Negligence might be a more difficult legal claim to win in a computer viruscase because it may be unclear exactly who had what responsibilities towardwhom under the circumstances.andP;  In general, someone can be sued for damagesresulting from negligence when he or she has a duty to act in accordance witha standard of care appropriate to the circumstances, and fails to act inaccordance with that standard of care in a particular situation.andP;  Standardsof care are often not codified anywhere, but depend on an assessment of whata reasonable person would do in the same set of circumstances.andP;  A programmer,for example, would seem to have a duty to act with reasonable care in writingprograms to run on a computing system and a duty not to impose unreasonablerisks of harm on others by his or her programming.andP;  But the owner of thecomputing system would also have a duty of care to create reasonablesafeguards against unauthorized access to the computing system or to someparts of the computer system because the penchant of hackers to seekunauthorized entry is well-known in the computing community.andP;  The focus in anegligence lawsuit, then, might not be just on what the hacker did, but onwhat the injured party did to guard against injury of this sort.andM;Sometimes legislatures pass special laws to deal with new situations such ascomputer viruses.andP;  If a legislature was to consider passing a law to provideremedies for damages caused by computer viruses, there would be a number ofdifferent kinds of approaches it could take to formulate such a law.andP;  It is atricker task than one might initially suppose to draft a law with a fineenough mesh to catch the fish one is seeking to catch without creating a meshso fine that one catches too many other fish, including many that one doesn'twant to catch.andM;Different legislative approaches have different pros and cons.andP;  Probably thebest of these approaches, from a plaintiff's standpoint, would be that whichfocuses on unauthorized entry or abuse of access privileges because it limitsthe issue of wrongful conduct by the defendant to access privileges,something that may be relatively easy to prove.andP;  Intentional disruption ofnormal functioning would be a somewhat more demanding standard, but wouldstill reach a wide array of virus-related conduct.andP;  A law requiring proof ofdamage to data or programs would, again from a plaintiff's standpoint, beless desirable because it would have stiffer proof requirements and would notreach viruses that merely disrupted functioning without destroying data orprograms.andP;  The problem of crafting the right law to cover the right problem(and only the right problem) is yet another aspect of the legal theoryproblems posed by computer viruses.andM;Apart from the difficulties with fitting computer virus situations inexisting legal categories or devising new legal categories to reach computerviruses, there are a set of practical difficulties that should be consideredbefore undertaking legal pursuit of hackers whose viruses cause damage tocomputer systems.andM;Perhaps the most important set of practical difficulties with suing a hackerfor virus damages is that which concerns the legal remedy one canrealistically get if one wins.andP;  That is, even if a lawyer is able to identifyan appropriate legal claim that can be effectively maintained against ahacker, and even assuming the lawyer can surmount the considerableevidentiary problems that might be associated with winning such a lawsuit,the critically important question which must be answered before any lawsuitis begun is what will one realistically be able to recover if one wins.andM;There are three sets of issues of concern here.andP;  One set relates to the costsof bringing and prosecuting the lawsuit.andP;  Lawsuits don't come cheap (and notall of the expenses are due to high attorney fees).andP;  Another relates to theamount of damages or other cost recoveries that can be obtained if one winsthe lawsuit.andP;  It's fairly rare to be able to get an award of attorney's feesor punitive damages, for example, but a lawsuit becomes more attractive as anoption if these remedies are available.andP;  Also, where the virus has spread toa number of different computer systems on a network, for example, thecollective damage done by the hacker may be substantial, but the damage toany one entity within the network system may be sufficiently small that,again, it may not be economically feasible to maintain individual lawsuitsand the collectivity may not have sufficiently uniform interests to support asingle lawsuit on behalf of all network members.andM;But the third and most significant concern will most often be the ability ofthe defendant to write a good check to pay the damages that might be awardedin a judgment.andP;  Having a judgment for one million dollars won't do you anygood if it cost you $10,000 to get it and the defendant's only asset is aused computer with a market value of $500.andP;  In such an instance, you might aswell have cut your losses and not brought the lawsuit in the first place.andO;Lawyers refer to defendants of this sort as &quot;judgment-proof.&quot;andM;While these comments might suggest that no lawsuit should ever be broughtagainst a young hacker unless he or she has recently come into a majorinheritance, it is worth pointing out the law does allow someone who hasobtained a judgment against another person to renew the judgment periodicallyto await &quot;executing&quot; on it until the hacker has gotten a well-paying job orsome other major asset which can be seized to satisfy the judgment.andP;  If onehas enough patience and enough confidence in the hacker's future (or a strongenough desire for revenge against the hacker), there may be a way to get somecompensation eventually from the defendant.andM;Proof problems may also plague any effort to bring a successful lawsuit fordamages against a computer hacker.andP;  Few lawsuits are easy to prove, but thosethat involve live witnesses and paper records are likely to be easier thanthose involving a shadowy trail of electronic signals through a computersystem, especially when an effort is made to disguise the identity of theperson responsible for the virus and the guilty person has not confessed hisor her responsibility.andP;  Log files, for example, are constantly truncated oroverwritten, so that whatever evidence might once have existed with which totrack down who was logged onto a system when the virus was planted may haveceased to exist.andM;Causation issues too can become very murky when part of the damage is due toan unexpected way in which the virus program interacted with some other partsof the system.andP;  And even proving the extent of damages can be difficult.andP;  Ifthe system crashes as a result of the virus, it may be possible to estimatethe value of the lost computing time.andP;  If specific programs with anestablished market value are destroyed, the value of the program may be easyto prove.andP;  But much of the damage caused by a virus may be more elusive toestablish.andP;  Can one, for example, recover damages for economic lossesattributable to delayed processing, for lost accounts receivable whencomputerized data files are erased and no backup paper record was kept of thetransactions?andP;  Or can one recover for the cost of designing new securityprocedures so that the system is better protected against viruses of thissort?andP;  All in all, proof issues can be especially vexing in a computer viruscase.andM;In thinking about the role of the law in dealing with computer virussituations, it is worth considering whether hackers are the sorts of peoplelikely to be deterred from computer virus activities by fear of lawsuits formoney damages.andP;  Criminal prosecution is likely to be a more powerful legaldeterrent to a hacker than a civil suit is.andP;  But even criminal liability maybe sufficiently remote a prospect that a hacker would be unlikely to foregoan experiment involving a virus because of it.andP;  In some cases, the prospectof criminal liability may even add zest to the risk-taking that is involvedin putting a virus in a system.andM;Probably more important than new laws or criminal prosecutions in deterringhackers from virus-related conduct would be a stronger and more effectiveethical code among computer professional and better internal policies atprivate firms, universities, and governmental institutions to regulate usageof computing resources.andP;  If hackers cannot win the admiration of theircolleagues when they succeed at their clever stunts, they may be less likelyto do them in the first place.andP;  And if owners of computer facilities makeclear (and vigorously enforce) rules about what is acceptable andunacceptable conduct when using the system, this too may cut down on theincidence of virus experiments.andM;Still, if these measures do not succeed in stopping all computer viruses,there is probably a way to use the law to seek some remedy for damages causedby a hacker's virus.andP;  The law may not be the most precisely sharpenedinstrument with which to strike back at a hacker for damages caused bycomputer viruses, but sometimes blunt instruments do an adequate job, andsometimes lawsuits for damages from viruses will be worth the effort ofbringing them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
