William Proxmire criticized the financing of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.'s proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of G. Heileman Brewing Co.    &quot;I'm afraid we're headed for another buy, strip and sell catastrophe,&quot; said the Wisconsin Democrat, who is sponsoring a bill to affirm the rights of states to strengthen their anti-takeover laws. The Wisconsin Legislature will meet today in special session to consider such a law, which might help the La Crosse, Wis.-based brewer maintain its independence.    A source close to the Perth, Australia-based Bond said the company doesn't plan to sell Heileman assets to help pay for it. Bond has said it is financing the bid with corporate funds, a $700 million bank facility and a loan of as much as $450 million from Salomon Brothers Holding Co. Bond's offer is equal to $38 a share. The company said it owns 4.9% of Heileman's 31.8 million shares outstanding.    Heileman, the fourth-largest U.S. brewer, has asked shareholders to refrain from tendering shares for the time being. The company is seeking advice from Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and has promised a formal response by Friday.    In a news release, Mr. Proxmire said he is &quot;concerned&quot; about &quot;unusual trading activity in Heileman stock during the month of August.&quot; An aide said the senator asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate. He said volume in Heileman stock, typically about 100,000 shares a day, soared to the 400,000-to-800,000 range on several days in August. </TEXT></DOC>
