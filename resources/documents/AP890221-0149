Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the Palestine LiberationOrganization's ruling 15-man Executive Committee, also accusedWashington of stalling in a dialogue with the PLO to gain time forIsrael to crush a 14-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``Washington is pushing Moscow into an unconditional resumptionof ties with Israel, offering in return only promises of a widerSoviet role in the Middle East,'' he said in an interview from thePLO's headquarters in Tunis.   ``We don't believe the Soviets will fall into this trap,'' hesaid.   Abed-Rabbo made his comments as Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze was visiting Middle East capitals in a major initiativeto break the stalemate in the Middle East peace effort and assertMoscow's influence in the region.   Shevardnadze's 10-day, five-nation tour, the highest-rankingSoviet mission in the region in nearly 20 years, underlined Moscow'sincreasing credibility in Arab world following its militarywithdrawal from Afghanistan and its efforts to moderate the PLO'spolicies.   Abed-Rabbo said PLO chief Yasser Arafat would ask Shevardnadzeabout the possible restoration of Israeli-Soviet ties _ broken afterthe 1967 Middle East war _ in a meeting Wednesday in Cairo.   ``We believe any resumption of Soviet-Israeli ties should belinked to the convening of an international conference, attended bythe PLO,'' he said.   Israel and the United States have rejected PLO participation inany such forum.   Abed-Rabbo is also deputy leader of the Marxist Democratic Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine and headed the Palestinian side innegotiations with the United States that began in December. He saidhe still has no idea when the U.S.-PLO dialogue, suspended afterPresident Bush took office last month, will resume.   Washington lifted its 13-year ban on public dealings with the PLOafter Arafat explicitly recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.   U.S. officials said the talks were suspended because the newadminstration wanted to review U.S. policy in the Middle East. ButAbed-Rabbo said this was ``nothing but a pretext.''   ``The reality is that Washington is trying to gain time forIsrael to crush the uprising in the occupied territories so thepressure for a Middle East peace settlement will ease.   ``But they're ignoring a reality which even the Israelis areslowly accepting: that it's impossible to suppress the uprising andreturn to the situation that existed before the uprising waslaunched.''   At least 380 Arabs and 15 Israelis have been killed since theuprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8, 1987.   Abed-Rabbo repeated a statement by Arafat that Israeli leadershave made indirect contacts with the PLO on peace initiatives andthe uprising through third parties.   ``What they've been saying through these third parties isdifferent from their public statements,'' he noted.   ``These messages are coming regularly and on a weekly basis. IfIsraeli leaders continue to deny that they've been in touch with us,then we shall be forced to uncover everything,'' he said, withoutelaboration.   Israeli leaders have denied that there have been any direct orindirect contacts made with the PLO, which it regards as a terroristorganization.</TEXT></DOC>
