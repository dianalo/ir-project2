Gerald P. Hirshberg, chief designer at Nissan Motor Co.'s La Jolla, Calif., studios, told a seminar at the International Design Conference at Aspen, Colo., last week that the next few years would see an emphasis on automobile-interior design. Among other things, he said Nissan and other companies were developing innovations to make cars safer, including changes in interior contours and padding.    One safety aim at Nissan, he said, is to detect when a driver is nodding off. &quot;The only part of the car that the driver is always touching is the steering wheel,&quot; he noted, and that contact can be used to monitor electrical patterns in the driver's body that signal approaching slumber. Another approach measures the small steering corrections a driver constantly makes. &quot;When the corrections become rhythmic and regular, you're gone,&quot; said Mr. Hirshberg.    If the car detects any snoozing, he said, &quot;the windows roll down, the radio blares and the dashboard lights change color.&quot;    Mr. Hirshberg also said that anyone designing cars for the international market, as he is, faces a dilemma over cultural differences in what is considered safe. &quot;Americans regard as safe something you could plow into a wall without hurting yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;That means mass and bulk -- a tank would suit them fine. Europeans and Japanese, on the other hand, judge safety by how much control the driver has over the car. They value things like road feel and agility.    &quot;The idea is to avoid a collision in the first place. But when those two kinds of cars do collide, there's not much question who comes off better.&quot;    Training-Center Design   Promotes Teamwork   CORPORATE-TRAINING facilities are growing more sophisticated, posing subtle problems for architects.    The spaces are hybrids to begin with, often combining lodging, dining and classroom facilities, usually either next door to an urban headquarters or in a remote campus-like setting. According to Theodore S. Hammer, managing partner at Haines Lundberg Waehler, New York-based architecture, engineering and planning company, corporate-training courses require flexible, technical spaces. Classrooms must accommodate future generations of computers and advanced audio-visual systems, sometimes connected to distant facilities.    Moreover, companies use these facilities to inculcate corporate values and encourage teamwork -- and designers try to encourage that camaraderie. Robert S. Fenn, national director of training at Travelers Corp., says the company's training center in Hartford was designed &quot;to encourage trainees to network, to get together in small groups.&quot; Instead of long corridors, for instance, the center has many small lounges where people can meet spontaneously between classes.    Eric Chung, director of design at Kling-Lindquist Partnership Inc., Philadelphia, adds that in the training centers he has designed &quot;the places where students sleep and wash are kept almost monastic. The emphasis is on the social spaces, the void between classroom and dormitory.&quot;    Time Stands Still   (For 5 Minutes)   TIME WOULD seem to move more slowly if only clocks and watches weren't so precise, Frank Nichols believes.    Mr. Nichols, a New York designer, has attempted to slow the perceived passing of time by stripping away precision in the Time Gauge watch he designed for Ole Mathiesen, a Copenhagen company. He also stripped away one hand. &quot;Instead of having two hands, one that calls attention to passing time by racing around the face and lapping the other, this watch has only an hour hand,&quot; he says.    Each hour is divided into five-minute segments. &quot;If you ask someone what time it is, they usually tell you to the nearest five minutes anyway,&quot; says Mr. Nichols. &quot;This watch encourages people to think in five-minute increments.&quot;    The watch case is black and the single hand is red.    Odds and Ends   MORE WORKERS think they need a private office rather than an open-space cubicle to perform effectively, according to a survey by Steelcase Inc. The proportion saying they needed four walls and a door rose to 65% this year from 57% last year. And more office workers are getting them -- 40% vs. 33%. But a poll of designers and facilities managers indicates that the open plan will continue to dominate office landscapes for at least the next decade . . . An indoor amplified antenna can enhance FM radio reception, but most of the units are so large -- typically nearly a foot and a half tall -- that they don't easily fit on a bookshelf. Now Terk Technologies Corp., New Rochelle, N.Y., has introduced the Pi antenna, a disk one-inch high and four inches in diameter. Neil Terk, president, developed the shape with John Lonczak Design. But Mr. Terk credits engineer Larry Schotz with shrinking the electronics. </TEXT></DOC>
