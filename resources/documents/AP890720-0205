Dalilia passed about 60 miles south of Hawaii Island,southernmost in the chain, Wednesday night after weakening from ahurricane to a tropical storm. A flash flood watch was in effectfor all islands as the weakening storm moved northwest on a courseparallel to the state.   At 8 a.m. HST Thursday, the storm was about 120 miles south ofHonolulu, moving northwest at 17 mph. Its maximum sustained windspeed was 58 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speedreaches 74 mph.   Dalilia was forecast to pass 60 miles south of Honolulu, on theisland of Oahu, causing heavy rain, high surf and stiff wind, butforecasters said the progressive weakening of the storm made itless of a threat than it was to Hawaii Island.   Nevertheless, the Oahu Civil Defense Agency advised Honoluluresidents to purchase emergency supplies such as flashlights,batteries and canned food in case the storm takes a sudden turnnorth, spokesman Paul Takamiya said.   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring itparallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be fromthe rain, hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we mightget some flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, the weather service's leadforecaster.   ``We got away pretty clean in regard to rain, wind and surf,''said Harry Kim, Hawaii Island Civil Defense administrator.   Up to 8 inches of water closed the only highway along HawaiiIsland's south coast, but the road was reopened early Thursday, Kimsaid.   More than 7 inches of rain fell during a 24-hour period in areasof Hawaii Island's south coast, the weather service said.   Winds of 35 to 40 mph knocked out a transformer near Pahala,blacking out the community of 3,000. Kim said electricity therewould remain out until late Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
