Behaviors of the ground during earthquakes relate closelyto the pore water pressure, and it is required for an effective stressanalysis to make in-depth evaluation on the stability of the ground.In this report, the results of the development are described on dynamiceffective stress analysis based on the Biot theory considering interactionsbetween soil and water. Obtained results from the study indicate that;(1) stress analysis can be made effectively, (2) the results are wellagreeable to the exact solutions, and, (3) it has been made clear thatthe two-dimensional distribution of the pore water pressure can be calculatedand that the larger the ground permeability is, the smaller the maximumresponse acceleration of structure becomes.
