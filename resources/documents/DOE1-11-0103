Results are presented directedtoward optimizing these two process steps. Oxygen stabilized the YBa{sub2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 6.9/ material against decomposition to temperaturesnear the melting point, allowing processing at higher temperatures, whichproduced significantly higher quality single phase material and somewhatimproved grain to grain contacts. 16 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
