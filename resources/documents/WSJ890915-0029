It renewed its commitment to tight money, a key part of the austerity program Premier Li Peng imposed late last year, after the democracy movement was quashed in June and economic conservatives consolidated their power.    But the restrictive policy has so far had mixed and potentially devastating results, and economists, both Chinese and foreign, doubt it will improve matters. Rural enterprises have been finding ways around the credit squeeze, mainly by keeping cash outside the banking system. Many economists believe the central bank will be forced to print money to prop up ailing state concerns, thereby preventing an increase in unemployment -- and in worker unrest. The likely upshot of all this: continued high inflation.    Foreign economists estimate that 30% to 40% of China's money supply is cash. Inflation, by official measures, grew at an annual rate of 26% in the first half, up from 18.5% for all of 1988 but slower than a 27% pace in 1989's first four months. But the modest deceleration sparks little optimism among economists, who expect inflation to remain above 20% through 1990.    &quot;The central bank is losing its grip on monetary policy,&quot; says Li Kehua, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The central bank governor, Li Guixian, said in an address to a conference of Chinese bank presidents in July that &quot;we're still facing a perilous period. There is no room for optimism.&quot;    The central bank finds itself in a monetary limbo, caught between heavy-handed regulation and half-hearted liberalization. It imposed a host of regulations late last year to curb cash withdrawals, hoping to discourage expansion and big bonus payments at rural enterprises and to reduce their consumption of energy and raw materials.    But the enterprises, established by local governments, households and individuals and thus less subject to central-government authority, managed to evade the restrictions. They and their employees also have balked at putting cash into bank deposits, which the state had hoped to channel to priority industries such as steel and fertilizers, where shortages are acute.    &quot;With so much money circulating outside the banking system, it isn't surprising that the central bank policy isn't working,&quot; says Mr. Li, the economist.    Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments. Wages and bonuses rose 19% in the first half, a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices. China's economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7% in the first six months, roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade.    One example of how rural enterprises thwart Beijing's tight-credit directives is Yuhua Bedsheet Factory, a collectively owned cotton mill in the suburbs of Nanjing. Director Yu Zhiwei says his bank refused to increase his credit this year. With prices of raw materials rising, the plant was facing serious cash-flow problems.    Mr. Yu called an emergency meeting of the factory's 1,100 workers to plead for financial help -- and raised 600,000 yuan ($161,000). &quot;I was tapping money our workers keep under their mattresses,&quot; says Mr. Yu, who expects sales to grow 27% this year to 28 million yuan.    Nationwide, industrial output for rural enterprises grew about 20% in the first half, more than the state's target of 10% but down from growth of 30% to 40% in the year-earlier period. Overall, industrial output grew 11% in the first half, compared with 17% a year earlier.    But contrary to the goals of retrenchment, much of that slowdown came from the state-controlled sector that deals in the kind of raw materials whose production the state has vowed to protect.    State-owned factories lack the flexibility of the rural enterprises to raise money from employees or even suspend their pay in an emergency. At the same time, they are much more reliant on bank loans for working capital.    Such constraints can stifle expansion plans. State-owned Nanjing Iron andamp; Steel Plant, for example, this year ordered $8 million of machinery from Italy as part of a program to double annual steel capacity to 1.2 million metric tons over five years. But retrenchment caught up with the plant, freezing total lending to its 1988 level. With half the equipment on its way, Li Qianxu, the mill's boss, suddenly had to scramble to get loans to put up the building that would house it. The delays cost his company six months of production time, Mr. Li complains.    As the credit squeeze slows production, supply shortages for major raw materials become more acute, fueling inflation. Deteriorating results at state-owned factories are cutting into the treasury's tax receipts and forcing the government to increase subsidies to ailing factories.    In the end, economists say, the central bank will be compelled to print money to support the state budget. The government will also require a huge amount of cash to pay farmers for their fall harvest. &quot;It's only a matter of time before we ease credits,&quot; says a central bank official. &quot;Mass company failures and unemployment are unacceptable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
