(IDI) of Dublin, Ohio.andM;The corporation runs DM RDBMS on two separate VAXclusters as well as on 32networked VAXstation 2000 workstations.andP;  The first cluster consists of twoVAX 8530s, a pair of Micro VAX II front-end processors that handlewire-service transactions, and the VAXstations.andP;  The system powers two majorDow Jones text-based applications: The Wall Street Journal's editorialdatabase and the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service's on-line version of TheJournal.andM;The second cluster includes two VAX 6220s running DM and The ConnectionMachine, a parallel processor from Thinking Machines of Cambridge, Mass.,andO;that accepts simple English database queries.andP;  The system is dedicated tocommercial database users who dial in through time-sharing terminals or theirown personal computers.andM;Dow Jones also runs DM on a single VAX 8250 dedicated to in-houseapplications development.andM;Since the company installed and began implementing its new database systemlast summer, company officials say, the benefits have been dramatic.andM;Data Can Be SharedandM;Dow Jones Newswire production editors can now extract excerpts from WallStreet Journal articles, and The Journal editors have access to numerous DowJones data resources--including wire services--directly from their VAXstation2000s.andP;  Previously, each group's data resided on mutually inaccessiblecomputer systems.andM;According to Kevin Hahn, a Dow Jones senior programming analyst, bringing ina full-text relational database system &quot;simplified the design of the systemconsiderably&quot; and also dramatically increased database performance.andP;  Forexample, Hahn said, DM increased the number of stories each data record canpoint to, and it made updating records a trivial task.andM;In addition, DM &quot;has allowed us to considerably fine-tune storyclassifications so that end users can find stories more easily,&quot; Hahnexplained.andP;  &quot;We can classify under more codes per story, such as geographicregion, subject matter, statistical information, market sector and the like.&quot;andM;Initially, Dow Jones system analysts sought a new database out of necessity.andM;Dow's former database system, called Tex/Story Manager, from Syntax ComputerSystems of Bordentown, N.J., ran on &quot;ancient equipment,&quot; Hahnsaid--PDP-11/34s with DEC RK05 disk drives--and was a hierarchical systemthat required too much tailoring when records were updated.andM;&quot;We were trying to move onto newer equipment,&quot; Hahn explained, &quot;and we wererunning out of database space.andP;  We wanted to go to a new [database]architecture and technology, one that would enable us to grow into thefuture.&quot;andM;Dow system analysts approached several hardware vendors, including StratusComputer of Marlborough, Mass., Tandem Computers of Cupertino, Calif., andDEC.andP;  According to Rod Wang, a Dow Jones project leader who helped select DM,&quot;We didn't look into IBM because our group was a bunch of DEC programmers.&quot;andM;&quot;We told each vendor what we expected our new database to be able to do, andthen they all came back with a proposal,&quot; Wang said.andP;  &quot;Some came back withtheir own customized databases, and others came back with packagedthings&quot;--their own computers and a third party's database.andM;According to Wang, Tandem offered computers running a Tandem DBMS calledRelational SQL.andP;  Dow decided against Tandem, however, because the company'srelational product hadn't been released yet.andM;Stratus offered a joint arrangement with Oracle, but Wang felt Oracle's RDBMSwouldn't handle text retrieval sufficiently.andP;  Stratus then offered its ownflat-file data model DBMS, which Wang considered useful only as a short-termsolution.andM;Meanwhile, DEC's media industry group proposed using VAXstation 2000s andclustered VAXes.andP;  For software, DEC recommended comparing one hierarchicalDBMS--Advanced Data Management's DRS--and three relational products:Oracle's, DEC's Rdb and IDI's DM.andM;Wang decided early on to consider only relational DBMSes because hierarchicaland other data models clearly couldn't answer all of Dow's needs.andP;  &quot;DRS wasout of the question,&quot; Wang said, &quot;because hierarchical would have meant goingback to our old ways.&quot;andM;With Dow's previous hierarchical database, Wang said, &quot;It was troublesome tomaintain indexes by ourselves.andP;  A story [could] exist in regional code andthen in multiple directories.andP;  So we had to do heavy transaction entries.andP;  Ifwe didn't, we'd get into a deadlock situation.&quot;andM;File maintenance also got out of hand with a hierarchical package, Wang said.andO;&quot;Whenever we wanted to delete a story, we had to go through the stories oneby one and modify every directory in which the stories appeared,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;That's why we were leaning toward a relational database,&quot; Wang continued.andO;&quot;I don't have to update records myself.andP;  The database does it.&quot;andP;  For adatabase directory that holds stories for 90 days, for instance, DM givesauthorized users the ability to delete all stories that were entered 90 ormore days earlier than a given date.andM;A relational package alone wasn't enough, however.andP;  Dow Jones wanted adatabase package that combined relational data modeling with sophisticatedtext-handling capabilities.andM;This criterion eliminated Rdb and Oracle, Wang said, and pointed toward DM.andO;&quot;The main thing was that the other relational databases couldn't handle textas well as DM,&quot; Wang said.andP;  &quot;Oracle, Rdb and [Relational Technology's] Ingresall follow Codd's rule and don't index as efficiently as DM does.andP;  DM followsthat rule only to a degree.&quot;andM;&quot;DM has the capability to handle text, and the way it handles indexing isbetter than Rdb,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Rdb's index structure looks like ISAM, whileDM's index structure is a B-tree, or balance-tree, type.&quot;andM;Wang said DM more readily allows Dow users to break records into fields,subfields, elements within subfields, and subelements.andP;  &quot;For the otherrelational databases, that isn't easy to do,&quot; Wang claimed.andM;There were other selling factors as well.andP;  To begin with, Dow Jones systemanalysts were already familiar with the text-handling capabilities offered byanother IDI database product--a relational predecessor of DM called Basis.andO;The analysts had worked with Datatimes of Oklahoma City, Okla., an IDIvalue-added reseller (VAR) that used Basis for its on-line news retrievalservices.andM;More importantly, Dow Jones wanted a subset of its new RDBMS to run on eachof its 32 VAXstation 2000 workstations.andP;  According to Bo Stoffregen, IDI'smarketing manager, IDI agreed to provide scaled-down versions of DM, eachcontaining only the most essential program libraries.andP;  The cost for eachVAXstation 2000 DM license was thus brought well below the standardminicomputer price.andP;  DM normally ranges from $60,000 for a Micro VAX IIlicense to $160,000 for a VAXcluster license.andM;Dow Jones system analysts were also impressed with IDI's willingness to helpthem select the most appropriate DEC hardware for their applications, andwith IDI's status as a DEC cooperative marketing program partner.andM;IDI signed a formal agreement with Dow Jones in May 1988 and began installingthe full-text software that summer.andM;3 Groups Use SystemandM;Three LANs, representing each of the Dow Jones &quot;functional groups,&quot; use theDM database system: the editorial production group, the retail on-line newsand data retrieval operation, and an application development group.andM;Editorial and production editors sitting at 32 distributed VAXstation 2000sconnect to a VAXcluster housing IDI's DM database.andP;  According to Hahn, theeditorial system is used to compose new articles using information from anumber of sources, including wire-transmitted news stories.andM;Based in South Brunswick, N.J., the database system contains four years'worth of Wall Street Journal articles.andP;  Each day, new articles are stored inthe DM database and the oldest articles are deleted.andM;According to Hahn, VAXstation 2000 users access the DM database, select astory, and then run windowed applications--for classifying stories, checkingspelling, searching for typographical errors and the like--that reside on theworkstations.andM;Workstation users can also write stories from scratch, Hahn said, &quot;but mostoften text is generated from various wires,&quot; and editors splice theinformation together into a news story.andM;When editors summon text, Hahn said, two windows appear on their workstationscreens.andP;  The first is a DM screen that contains &quot;fixed-field information,&quot;such as display date and time, company and industry codes, the amount of timea given story is to be maintained in the database, codes showing which wireservice a story came from, and codes indicating whether stories are &quot;hot&quot;(leading stories for the day) or not.andM;&quot;They are fixed fields,&quot; Hahn said, &quot;so providing a window with fixed placesfor fixed purposes is advantageous.&quot;andM;The actual text of a story appears in the second window, which allows usersto employ DEC's TPU text editor.andP;  &quot;We do a lot of on-line updating,&quot; Hahnsaid of the editorial group.andM;The editorial group's database engine is also used to ship wire-serviceinformation &quot;in message format&quot; to commercial customers such as brokerageservices and financial consultants, regardless of what their databasearchitecture is like, Hahn said.andM;&quot;It's on-line service for the outside world,&quot; Hahn said, though the usersdon't actually access the DM database.andM;By contrast, the on-line retrieval service consists of two clustered VAX8530s and Thinking Machine's The Connection Machine, a front-end processorthat uses inferential and artificial intelligence techniques to convey endusers' simple English queries to the DM database engine.andM;The Connection Machine translates unformatted English queries into DM'sproprietary query language at the rate of 10 English queries per second.andP;  Thecommercial database searchers dial into the service via standard time-sharingterminals or personal computers.andM;The Connection Machine not only searches by establishing links between wordsentered by end users, but also supplies information related to the queries,even though it wasn't specifically requested.andM;Few Hitches ReportedandM;Getting the new database system and VAXclusters up and running has beenrelatively painless for Dow Jones, Hahn said.andP;  Little VMS training was neededbecause in augmenting its system management staff to handle the new databasesystems, Dow hired only VMS veterans.andM;Moreover, IDI support has been readily available.andP;  Initially, one Dow Jonesdatabase manager attended a DM training seminar for two weeks, Hahn said.andM;&quot;Information Dimensions gave us quite a few hours of consulting services, anda good number of training credits,&quot; Hahn said.andP;  &quot;It was all part of the costwhen we purchased DM.&quot;andM;Hahn praised IDI's response time when problems arise.andP;  &quot;They've come up withanswers quickly when we've had questions,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We've got a direct lineto speak with them.&quot;andM;Hahn said DID officials are closely forllowing Dow Jones' use of theirsoftware.andP;  &quot;They're very interested in some of the things we're doing,&quot; hesaid, &quot;especially with the workstations.&quot;andM;Hahn has also found DM's documentation useful.andP;  He recently pored through aDM manual to do some system tuning, he said, and found the material waspresented &quot;in a quite straightforward manner.&quot;andM;&quot;When we first put the system up, it was page-faulting itself to death,&quot; Hahnadded.andP;  &quot;But what we needed to do about that was right there in thedocumentation, and [the solution] worked pretty well.&quot;andM;DM isn't without faults, Hanh noted, but he considers the problems minor andsaid many are supposed to be corrected in the software's next release.andM;&quot;Currently there's a 16KB-per-record limitation,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot; Right now, some[Wall Street Journal] stories take up to 120KB.andP;  I'd like to be able to storea whole story in one record.&quot;andM;But the maximum record capacity will be substantially increased in the nextrelease, Hahn said, and &quot;120KB per record will be a drop in the bucket.&quot;andM;In addition, the VAXstation 2000 keyboard is mapped differently for the twowindows DM presents.andP;  &quot;Right now, the DLI screen's keyboard [DLI is DM'slanguage interface] is very EDT-like, while the TPU screen uses the EVEformat.andP;  So editors have to think in different ways for each window.&quot;andM;That problem will soon be rectified.andP;  DM's next release will let systemmanagers establish similar keyboard maps for both VAXstation 2000 windows,Hahn said.andM;Another DM shortcoming, according to Wang, is the very factor that led him topurchase the package.andP;  DM doesn't fully comply with the relationalmethodology rules that many RDBMS vendors are following as a de factostandard.andM;&quot;If you're looking for a package with future compatibility with SQL,&quot; Wangsaid, &quot;DM may not be the best choice.andP;  Codd's [relational] ruels aren'talways the best, but [software vendors] go with the standard.&quot;andM;Workstation Benefits CitedandM;Hahn said Dow Jones' editorial production system isn't developed to peakoperating efficiency yet, but expressed satisfaction with DM's currentperfomance.andM;A nice benefit of running DM on workstations as well as VAXex, Hahn said, isthat &quot;we offload a lot of the work from the cluster itself.andP;  Not that much isrunning on the cluster other than the [software] kernel.&quot;andM;Hahn noted that Dow Jones is locked into using DEC workstations for thepresent &quot;because DM runs on VMS.andP;  But with the advent of DECwindows, we maybe able to run on different [operating] systems, as long as they supportDECwindows.&quot;andM;Hahn also said Dow Jones will migrate the workstation to DECwindows &quot;as soonas we get more memory, and we're working on that right now.&quot;andM;The Dow Jones applications, even with the VAXstation 2000s offloading much ofthe VAXcluster's CPU workload, &quot;already take up more than 4MB,&quot; Hahn said.andO;&quot;It's an improvement over our old system, but we want to improve it evenmore.&quot;andM;For instance, another application Dow Jones officials would like to run on DMand their VAXclusters is the Dun andamp; Bradstreet database, a 50GB compendium ofdata that provides in-depth financial profiles of major publicly heldcompanies.andM;Hahn said Dow Jones intends to acquire MicroVAX 3100 workstations during thenext year.andP;  &quot;They're faster than VAXstation 2000s, but they'll serve the samefunction.andP;  That's when the real [database] expansion will come,&quot; he said.andM;Would Dow Jones end up with DM if it began a relational database productsearch today?andP;  Not necessarily, according to Wang.andP;  He feels DEC has latelyput more effort into making Rdb run efficiently within DEC networks.andM;&quot;At this moment, I'd suggest looking into Rdb more,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;My philosophyis, if the hardware vendor has a product that fits our need, i'll always gowith that choice.andP;  I'd suggest looking into Rdb in more detail.andP;  But DM isstill a good choice.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
