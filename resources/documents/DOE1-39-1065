<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-1065 </DOCNO><TEXT>The carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased by about25% over the last 150 years and will surely continue to increase as aresult of fossil fuel combustion. Enhancement of the atmospheric effectby elevated levels of CO{sub 2} and other trace gases may over the nextcentury increase global average surface air temperature by a few degreesCelsius to levels unprecedented in human history. Even eliminating emissionsof CO{sub 2} will not prevent global climate change because the combinedgreenhouse effect of less abundant but radiatively important gases suchas methane and chlorocarbons is likely to be just as large as the impactof projected increases in carbon dioxide concentration. Quantitativeestimates of future warming that could result from continued increasesin greenhouse gas concentrations come from sophisticated mathematicalmodels, which are the modern climatologists' primary prognostic tool.The current limitations and uncertains in these model results, however,prevent definitive predictions of the regional climatic responses thatmake up the projected global change. Deficiencies in the historical climaterecord prevent confirmation of the climate model predictions, but futureresearch offers the potential for improved understanding. 25 refs., 10figs.</TEXT></DOC>
