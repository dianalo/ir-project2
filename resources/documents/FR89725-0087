Description </ITAG>SCG would be an organization of clearing agencies.\6\<NOTE/> Membership in SCG would be open to any clearing agency self-regulatoryorganization (``SRO'')\7\<NOTE/> that is registered with the Commission under Section 17Aof the Act.\8\<NOTE/> While the initial membership of SCG would consist of theorganization's seven founding members (<T3>i.e</T3>., DTC, MCC, MSTC, NSCC, OCC, Philadep, and SCCP), other registeredclearing agencies,\9\<NOTE/> or newly-registered clearing agencies, would become eligiblefor SCG membership.\10\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The term ``clearing agency'' is defined by the Act toinclude both clearing agencies and securities depositories. <T3>See </T3>section 3(a)(23) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For definition of ``SRO,'' <T3>see </T3>section 3(a)(26) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Section 17A(b)(1) of the Act, in effect, makes it unlawfulfor a clearing agency to operate unless registered with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ At this time, seven registered clearing agencies are notsignatories to the SCG Agreement: (1) Boston Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation,(2) Delta Government Options Corporation, (3) Government Securities ClearingCorporation, (4) Intermarket Clearing Corporation, (5) International SecuritiesClearing Corporation, (6) MBS Clearing Corporation, and (7) ParticipantTrust Company. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Membership would not be automatic. Rather, membershipin SCG would be voluntary and would require, among other things, executionof the SCG Agreement. The governance of SCG would consist of one Principal Representative appointedfrom each member clearing agency. The Principal Representatives would electa Chairman from among themselves by majority vote. The Chairman would servea term of one year effective immediately upon election. At the end of thatterm, a successor Chairman would be elected in like manner. Each PrincipalRepresentative would be authorized to select an Alternate from the staffof its clearing agency. The Chairman would be authorized, among other things,to call meetings of the SCG and to appoint subgroups to study issues withinthe scope of SCG's interest. Each Principal Representative (or Alternate)would have one vote on each matter coming before the SCG, and no actioncould be taken at, or as a result of, an SCG meeting without the affirmativevote of all Principal Representatives (or their Alternates).\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See </T3>SCG Agreement, Sect. 1. Under this provision, SCG votes wouldnot simply require unanimity of a quorum but unanimity of all PrincipalRepresentatives (or their Alternates). <T3>See id. </T3>at Sect. 1(D).   Under the SCG Agreement, SCG meetings normally would be called at the discretionof the Chairman at sites selected by the Chairman. Alternatively, meetingscould be called at the request of a majority of the Principal Representatives.SCG contemplates that meetings would take place not less frequently thanquarterly.\12\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See </T3>SCG Agreement, Sect. 1(B). The purposes of SCG would include fostering cooperation among members towardthe goals set forth in the SCG Agreement, which include: (1) Identifyingfacilities and systems that could serve as a central data base for FOCUSreports and related systems that would contain data on participants, whichlater would be accessible to any SCG member; \13\<NOTE/> (2) identifying potential improvements and additions to FOCUSreports in order to facilitate clearing agency monitoring of the financialand operating condition of participants; (3) resolving particular legalissues involving clearing agencies; \14\<NOTE/> (4) developing standard notification forms for SCG memberswith which to notify other SCG members when a new participant is addedand when an existing participant is placed on surveillance due to questionsabout its financial or operational ability; (5) developing means to increasecurrent levels of cooperation between clearing agencies and marketplaceregulators, including the SEC; and (6) other purposes as identified bySCG members in the future.\15\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The term ``FOCUS report'' is an acronym for Financialand Operational Combined Uniform Single report. Section 17(a) of the Actand Rule 17a-5 thereunder require the periodic filing of FOCUS reportsby all broker-dealers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The legal issues include: (1) Cross liens between twoor more clearing agencies of participant guarantee deposits where a participantis in default to one or more clearing agencies; (2) application of settlementcredits of a participant in two or more clearing agencies where the participantis in default at one or more clearing agencies; (3) application of a participant'sexcess margin balances at two or more clearing agencies where the participantis in default at one or more clearing agencies; (4) the netting of a participant'sdebit and credit obligations at two or more clearing agencies when theparticipant is not in default; (5) the routine sharing of net settlementdebit and settlement credit information among SCG members; and (6) theexchange of a participant's securities between two or more clearing agenciesto secure settlement obligations in event of a temporary cash imbalanceof the participant. <T3>See</T3> SCG Agreement, Sect. 3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See </T3>SCG Agreement, Sect. 3.Further, each SCG member would agree to work with the others to developprocedures that would identify financial and operational conditions ofany participant of one SCG member that might produce risks to one or moreother SCG members.\16\<NOTE/> These procedures would include mechanisms for sharing bySCG members the exact information underlying such risks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The term ``participant'' is defined in Section 3(a)(24)of the Act.The SCG Agreement provides that each SCG member would agree that, concerning``confidentiality,'' any clearance, settlement, financial, and operationalinformation received under the SCG Agreement would be used exclusivelyfor a clearing agency's legal, regulatory, or compliance purposes.\17\<NOTE/> Moreover, each SCG member would agree to deliver, upon request,information about a participant to another SCG member provided such participantis also a participant of the SCG member requesting the information.\18\<NOTE/> The SEC, other appropriate regulatory agencies, and the courtslikewise would have access to such information. Non-SCG SROs, such as thesecurities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers(``NASD''), also would have access provided they agreed to abide by theAgreement's confidentiality provisions.\19\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The SCG Agreement would bar any SCG member that receivesinformation under the SCG Agreement from providing, without the writtenconsent of the delivering member, such information to its non-legal, non-regulatory,or noncompliance departments. The main purpose of this prohibition is toavoid confidential information about participants being used by a clearingagency for its own marketing purposes. <T3>See </T3>SCG Agreement, Sect. 2. <ITAG tagnum="28">Nothing in the SCG Agreement, however, would bar any SCG member fromfurnishing information concerning a participant to: (1) Appropriate governmentalauthorities, (2) other SROs as necessary to conduct an investigation ordisciplinary proceeding, and (3) a subsidiary of an SCG member whose applicationfor registration is pending. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The term ``participant'' for this purpose would be construedto include: (1) A current participant as defined in section 3(a)(24) ofthe Act, (2) an applicant for participation, (3) a subsidiary or affiliateof a participant, and (4) a subsidiary or affiliate of an applicant forparticipation. <ITAG tagnum="28">Under the SCG Agreement, an SCG member would be expected to provideparticipant information to another SCG member in response to a ``reasonablerequest.'' This would include such information about a participant that,from the viewpoint of the SCG member requested to provide the information,is: (1) Within its possession, (2) reasonably accessible, and (3) not undulyburdensome in terms of the request's size.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ In those circumstances where a member participates inmore than one self-regulatory organization, the SRO's may agree to allocateto one SRO examination responsibiities. <T3>See </T3>Rule 17d-2 under the Act, 17 CFR 240.17d-2 (1989). The designatedexamining authority for broker-dealer members of a clearing agency generallywill be an exchange or the NASD.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale for the Proposals </ITAG>The clearing agencies state that section l7A of the Act provides, amongother things, that: (1) Congress has determined that a national systeminvolving the linking of clearance and settlement facilities and the developmentof uniform standards and procedures would reduce unnecessary costs andincrease protections to investors and to persons facilitating transactionson behalf of investors, and (2) the rules of a clearing agency should bedesigned to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement ofsecurities transactions and to foster cooperation and coordination withpersons engaged in clearance and settlement. The clearing agencies state that the goals of their proposals, in accordancewith the Act, are to promote coordinated action among clearing agenciesand to identify, address, and minimize the risks and problems common tomore than one clearing agency. The clearing agencies further state thatthe key methods of achieving these goals will be: (1) The sharing of appropriatefinancial, operational, and clearing information with other clearing agenciesin an atmosphere of cooperation; and (2) the development of certain uniformprocedures for use among clearing agencies. The clearing agencies emphasize that the SCG and its governing Agreementare consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Act, including theAct's concept of a national system of clearance and settlement and itsconcept of fostering cooperation and coordination among persons engagedin the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comment Letter </ITAG>A. The BOTCC Letter As stated above, the Commission received a comment letter on the proposalsfrom BOTCC, the affiliated clearing corporation of the Chicago Board ofTrade.\20\<NOTE/> The BOTCC comment letter, in essence, raised two issues.First, it recommended that the proposed SCG Agreement, in its Section 2(<T3>i.e., </T3>the provision captioned ``Confidentiality''), should providethat nothing in the Agreement would preclude an SCG member from furnishingfinancial or operational information concerning its participants to a commoditiesexchange or its affiliated clearing organizations. The letter added thatany such information would be subject to the confidentiality provisionsof the SCG Agreement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See, supra, </T3>note 4. Secondly, BOTCC's comment letter recommended that section 2(vi) of theproposed SCG Agreement, which would permit the sharing of information witha subsidiary of an SCG member whose application was then pending with theSEC, be amended and either: (1) Limited to a particular ``named entity,''or (2) extended to include all ``new entities.'' \21\<NOTE/> BOTCC argued that this SCG provision seemed designed solelyto address a particular entity and, if so, that entity should be named.Alternatively, BOTCC argued that if subsidiaries of SCG members with applicationspending before the Commission are to be included, the Agreement shouldprovide for the ``automatic admission of new entities'' into SCG. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The comment letter suggests that, in any case, if a clearingentity's application were only pending, it would have no information tocontribute and would not be a meaningful contributor to the process.B.The NSCC's Response In response to BOTCC, NSCC noted that the proposed SCG Agreement, as anagreement among clearing agencies, would not expand or restrict the rightsof any registered clearing agency to share data with a commodities clearingorganization, which is a matter for each clearing agency's own rules.\22\<NOTE/> NSCC emphasized that it is a clearing agency's rules andagreements with its members, not the proposed SCG Agreement, that wouldauthorize or prohibit the sharing with commodities clearing organizationsof any information regarding the financial and operational capacity ofdual participants. Accordingly, NSCC stated that even if SCG were to adoptBOTCC's proposed amendment, it would have no substantive effect on theSCG Agreement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Letter from Robert J. Woldow, Executive Vice Presidentand General Counsel, NSCC, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated March27, 1989. According to the letter, Mr. Woldow also currently chairs theproposed SCG. NSCC also noted that the status of certain new clearing organizations haschanged since the SCG Agreement was first drafted,\23\<NOTE/> and that the SCG, from a policy viewpoint, could not logicallydirect its procedures to a single named clearing  organization.\24\<NOTE/> Additionally, NSCC disagreed with BOTCC's proposal of ``automaticadmission'' to SCG for each new clearing entity, stating that the partiesto the SCG Agreement have had years of mutual experience through workingtogether and that they possess the necessary expertise and operationalcapacity to support the sharing arrangement as set forth in the Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The Commission notes that the first draft of the SCGAgreement was circulated among prospective SCG members under a cover letterdated June 10, 1988. After revisions, a final draft was executed by theseven signatories on October 19, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The NSCC letter notes that: (1) Government SecuritiesClearing Corporation, a wholly-owned NSCC subsidiary when the SCG Agreementwas first drafted, has become registered; (2) International SecuritiesClearing Corporation, a wholly-owned NSCC operating subsidiary, when theAgreement was first drafted, has become temporarily registered; and (3)Participants Trust Company, a spin-off of MBS Clearing Corporation, hasbecome temporarily registered. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposals are consistent with the Act.The proposals would: (1) Create the SCG, an organization of clearing agencies;and (2) approve the SCG Agreement as rules of the affected clearing agencies.\25\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ The term ``SRO rules'' is defined in section 3(a)(28)of the Act. The Commission notes that section 17A(a)(1)(D) of the Act expressly encouragesthe linking of clearance and settlement facilities and the developmentof uniform standards and procedures. Section 17A(a)(2) of the Act, moreover,directs the Commission, having due regard for the public interest, to useits authority to facilitate the establishment of a national system forthe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.Furthermore, section 17A(b)(3)(F)   requires that the rules of a clearingagency be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with personsengaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. A. The Status of Clearing Agencies and the SCG Proposals The Commission believes that a nexus exists among the SCG-SROs. These clearingagencies provide clearance, settlement, and safekeeping services for financialintermediaries that participate in, among other things, corporate equitysecurities markets, including the National Market System contemplated inSection 11A of the Act. The nexus among SCG-SROs includes: (1) Many commonparticipants,\26\<NOTE/> (2) interfaces through which clearing agencies offer accessto participants in or services offered by other clearing agencies, (3)shared operational and financial exposure, and (4) common regulatory responsibilities.\27\<NOTE/> The development of a formal structure to   further commonregulatory, operational, and member monitoring obligations will furtherthe stated goals of the National Clearance and Settlement System.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Based on data recently compiled by NSCC, of 848 broker-dealersthat are clearing agency participants, 541 are participants at two or moreclearing agencies, and 221 are participants at three or more clearing agencies.The clearing agencies that were subjects of the study were: DTC, OCC, MCC,MSTC, NSCC, Philadep, SCCP, and MBS Clearing Corporation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Section 19(g)(1)(C) of the Act requires each of the SCGSROs, as clearing agencies, to enforce member compliance with their rules.Pursuant to section 17(d) of the Act, Rule 17d-2 thereunder authorizesSROs to file a plan with the Commission that allocates examinations forcompliance and enforcement to a designated examining authority (``DEA'').Although not involving DEAs, the Commission believes the proposed rulechanges are consistent with the legislative purposes of section 17(d).<T3>See</T3> Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, <T3>Report to Accompany S. 249: Securities Acts Amendments of 1975,</T3>S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 121-122 (1975). Although clearing agencies compete in offering quality clearance, settlement,and safekeeping services, the SCG-SROs comprise the core components ofan integrated national clearance and system that Congress envisioned inits enactment of section 17A, and continuously deliver or receive instructions,securities or funds among themselves.\28\<NOTE/> Essential to understanding the nexus among the SCG-SROs isa brief review of the services SCG-SROs offer and the interfaces that connectthese organizations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See</T3> Order Granting Registration to NSCC, Securities Exchange ActRelease No. 13163 (January 13, 1977), 42 FR 3916. NSCC, MCC, and SCCP, among other things, provide trade comparison, clearance,and settlement services for brokerdealer members executing trades in corporateand municipal securities.\29\<NOTE/> Each of these clearing agencies operates a continuous netsettlement system (``CNS''),\30\<NOTE/> which permits a member to net all deliver and receive obligationsin each security, which can be settled with one electronic book-entry movementbetween the member and its clearing agency on the   books of an affiliateddepository.\31\<NOTE/> Corresponding money payment obligations in all securitiesissues are settled on a net basis at the end of the day in clearing housefunds. Each of these clearing agencies also provides a mechanism for transferof customer accounts among clearing members, known as the Automated CustomerAccounts Transfer System (``ACATS'').\32\<NOTE/> Each clearing agency also maintains interfaces with eachother to permit clearing members to settle trades with or transfer customeraccounts to members of other clearing agencies.\33\<NOTE/> Thus, these clearing agencies communicate with each otherdaily on behalf of their members and daily settle payment and securitiesdelivery obligations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See</T3> Division of Market Regulation, SEC, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3>, 10-1 to 10-12 (February 1988) (``<T3>Division Report</T3>''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ For further discussion of CNS, <T3>see id.</T3> at 10-2 to 10-5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ DTC is the designated depository for settlement of securitiesdelivery obligations between NSCC and NSCC members. Similarly, MSTC andPhiladep are the designated depositories for MCC and SCCP, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22481 (September 30, 1985),50 FR 4l274 [File No. SR-NSCC-85-07]. <T3>See also</T3> New York Stock Exchange Rule 412. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ The Regional Interface Organization (``RIO'') offersa participant the option of clearing and settling trades at the clearingfacility of its choice, regardless of the market of execution. To effectdelivery, one depository receives instructions from its affiliated clearingcorporation or from an interfacing depository on behalf of its clearingcorporation, and the depository makes the necessary book-entry movements.These movements enable clearing corporations to settle, by book-entry,trades between their respective participants. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20461 (December 7, 1983),48 FR 55654 [File No. SR-DTC-77-10]. <T3>See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13163 (January 13,1977), 42 FR 3916. The three depositories, DTC, MSTC, and Philadep, offer various depositoryservices to member banks and broker-dealers. These services include safekeeping of members' securities, in a fungiblebulk; \34\<NOTE/> same-day credit for deposit of negotiable securities; facilitiesfor distribution of securities in primary offerings, and facilities fordelivery of securities between member banks, brokers, clearing corporations;and through interfaces with other depositories, facilities for deliveryof securities to banks, broker-dealers and clearing corporations that aremembers of other securities depositories. DTC, MSTC, and Philadep alsooffer communication and settlement services for institutional trades throughthe National Institutional Delivery System (``NIDS''). Through NIDS, brokerdealerscan confirm to institutional money managers the terms of trades in corporateand municipal securities executed on a securities exchange or over-the-counter,and institutional money managers can affirm those trades,\35\<NOTE/> thereby setting the stage for book-entry settlement of thosetrades on settlement date (usually five business days after the trade date).\36\<NOTE/> In 1988, more than 16.7 million confirmations were processedthrough NIDS and more than $1.3 trillion in NIDS trades were settled bybook-entry. Exchange and NASD rules require brokerdealers to use NIDS facilitiesto confirm, affirm, and settle most delivery-against-payment trades incorporate \37\<NOTE/> and municipal securities.\38\<NOTE/> Accordingly, each day DTC, MSTC, and Philadep communicatemember trade and delivery data, and settle on a net basis, inter-depositorysecurities movements and payments.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ The term ``fungible bulk'' refers to the fact that securitycertificates of the same issue are interchangeable and that units of adepository-eligible security typically are held in large volume in thecustody of a depository. This permits the electronic book-entry transferof units of such a security issue, units which nominally are held by adepository's participant broker-dealers. Such transfers occur with no physicalmovement of certificates and no change in the number of units of the securityheld by the depository. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>D. Scott, <T3>Wall Street Words </T3>150 (1988); D. Weiss, <T3>After the Trade Is Made </T3>314 (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Affirmation is the second step in the process of settlinga typical institutional securities transaction where the parties have agreedthat the broker will deliver securities (or funds) to the institution'custodian bank against payment (or delivery of securities). As indicatedabove, the first step in settling such a trade entails delivery of thebroker's confirmation of the terms of the trade to the money manager (NIDSprovides copies to the money manager and the custodian bank). The ``affirmation''is the money manager's agreement that the confirmation correctly reflectsthe terms of the trade and, in NIDS, can constitute the necessary authorizationto the custodian bank to release funds or securities. If the money manageraffirms the trade by the third day after trade date, settlement generallyoccurs automatically by book-entry at the depository by the fifth day aftertrade date.

OCC issues and clears, on behalf of its members, all exchange traded optionson equity securities, index participation, stock-index options, and a varietyof other nonequity securities options. OCC routinely interacts with NSCC,MCC, and SCCP, which are OCC's primary correspondent clearing corporations,\39\<NOTE/> for settlement of equity options exercises on the fifth businessday after exercise. OCC also participates in ACATS thereby permitting thetransfer of customer accounts including option positions.\40\<NOTE/> DTC and MSTC hold on deposit ``valued securities'' for OCCmembers' margin accounts,\41\<NOTE/> and covered option contracts often are written against stockon deposit at a DTC, MSTC, or Philadep member bank, which may issue an``escrow receipt'' that would guarantee the delivery of stock if an assignmentnotice were given to the call writer.\42\<NOTE/> Moreover, while OCC currently is using a physical deliveryfacilitator for delivery of equity index participations, OCC is workingwith NSCC to develop an electronic delivery system.\43\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ For definition of ``correspondent clearing corporation,''<T3>see </T3>OCC By-Laws, Art.

DTC and NSCCceased to act for American Investors Group (``AIG'').  As explained in greater detail in the <T3>Division Report.</T3>\46\<NOTE/> NSCC liquidated approximately 166 security positions heldfor Metropolitan with a total contract value of more than $58 million,at a loss to NSCC of approximately $395,000, which NSCC funded from itsretained earnings. DTC and MBSCC closed out Metropolitan's accounts andreturned to Metropolitan an overage of approximately $1.1 million. NSCCand OCC liquidated  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See id. </T3>at 10-16 to 10-18, 10-44 to 10-45. Shaine's positions: NSCC's liquidation of more than 170 security positionsgenerated a profit of approximately $160,000 which NSCC returned to Shaine'strustee. OCC's liquidation of Shaine's positions generated a loss of approximately$8 million, and OCC assessed its members, <T3>pro rata, </T3>approximately $8 million to fund OCC's payment obligationsin closing out Shaine's positions. Neither NSCC nor DTC suffered lossesin closing out AIG's accounts.andpara;The interdependence of clearing agencies highlights the need for effectivecommunication among clearing agencies.\47\<NOTE/> Improved communication has been a Commission and clearingagency priority for many years. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>See Division Report </T3>at 10-19 to 10-23. Where a brokerdealer isa member of two or more clearing agencies, absent established communicationschannels, one clearing agency may be unaware of the broker-dealer's debtpositions with the other clearing agencies, thereby exposing itself tounknown financial risk. In 1984, following the SEC-sponsored Securities Processing Roundtable,\48\<NOTE/> various SROs established the Monitoring Coordination Group(``MCG'').\49\<NOTE/> MCG, in turn, established procedures for communications amongclearing corporations, depositories, and other self-regulatory DEAs.\50\<NOTE/> These procedures apply whenever a common participant's financialcondition is deemed to threaten the financial or operational conditionof clearing members, clearing agencies, or marketplaces. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See Report of the Division of Market Regulation 1984 Securities ProcessingRoundtable </T3>(May 31, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ MCG members include: DTC, MCC, MSTC, NSCC, OCC, SCCP,Philadep, American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago BoardOptions Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange, National Association of SecuritiesDealers, New York Stock Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and PacificStock Exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ <T3>See, supra, </T3>note 27. During the Market Break, the clearing agencies' monitoring and communicationsnetworks generally enabled them to spot potential member defaults in timeto minimize or eliminate losses to themselves.\51\<NOTE/> Thus, the communication channels of MCG proved useful inprotecting MCG members as well as the marketplace in general.\52\<NOTE/> Although MCG provided the basis for effective communicationduring the Market Break, the Commission believes that a need exists fora more structured form of cooperation and problem solving among clearingagencies. The Commission believes that, at the present time, this needcan best be filled by SCG. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ <T3>See Division Report </T3>at 10-21. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ <T3>See id. </T3>at 10-19, 10-21. B. The BOTCC Comment Letter Despite these benefits, BOTCC argues that the Agreement should be amendedto state that it does not preclude sharing information with commoditiesorganizations. NSCC counters that such an amendment is both unnecessaryand ineffective because the rules of the SCG members would control sucha provision in any event. That is to say, a mere statement in the SCG Agreementthat nothing in the Agreement bars SCG members from sharing informationwith commodities organizations, in itself, would provide no affirmativelegal authority, much less a mandate, for such information sharing.\53\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Commission notes that actions by SCG at itslast meeting show that its members are willing to share information withcommodities clearing organizations where appropriate.\54\<NOTE/> The Commission agrees with NSCC's views and believes thatapproval of this rule change is consistent with the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ By contrast, the SCG Agreement, as SRO rules formallyapproved by the Commission under the Act, would provide clear legal authorityfor the information sharing arrangements that are set forth in the Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ At the last SCG meeting, which was held on May 25, 1989,at the offices of OCC in Chicago, the SCG SROs agreed to release to BOTCCand other commodity clearing organizations a list of clearing members foreach SCG SRO.  To the extent, however, that BOTCC's underlying concern is to develop moreformal methods whereby securities and commodities clearing corporationscan share necessary information, the Commission believes such a goal isnot only appropriate but a necessary adjunct to a coordinated intermarketsystem. Indeed, this conclusion was adopted by several post-Market Breakstudies of the marketplace, including: The <T3>Brady Report,\55\</T3><NOTE/> the <T3>Division Report,\56\</T3><NOTE/> the Commodities Futures Trading Commission reports,\57\<NOTE/> and the <T3>Working Group Report.\58\</T3><NOTE/> The Commission urges the SCG SROs, individually and withinthe SCG context, to develop, and implement expeditiously, improvementsin intermarket information sharing procedures.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ <T3>See Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, </T3>51,64 (January 8, 1988), known as the <T3>Brady Report, </T3>after the Task Force's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>See. e.g., Division Report </T3>at 10-55. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Divisions of Economic Analysis and Trading and Markets,Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Follow-up. <T3>Report of Stock Index Futures Markets during October 1987, </T3>70-71(January 6, 1988).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ <T3>See Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets. AppendixD </T3>at 6-7 (May 1988). Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the SCG proposals are not inconsistentwith the Act for failure to incorporate commodities clearing corporations.\59\<NOTE/> The Commission urges the BOTCC to pursue information sharingarrangements with the SCG and its member SROs_just as the Chicago Boardof Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are pursuing similar objectiveswith the Intermarket Surveillance Group. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ The Commission also believes that it is not inconsistentwith the Act for clearing agencies to provide, by contract, terms for sharingconfidential information with their own clearing agency subsidiaries. Theparties to the Agreement apparently determined that, rather than use thename of a particular subsidiary (as recommended by BOTCC), they would usethe generic term ``subsidiary,'' a decision that may extend the effectivenessof that contractual provision. In any case, the Commission finds no legalissue here under the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28">BOTCC, alternatively, recommended that the SCG Agreementprovide forthe ``automatic admission of new entities.'' The Commission notes thatto be admitted to SCG membership, a clearing agency must voluntarily becomea signatory to the SCG Agreement and that the Agreement sets forth specificcontractual obligations for all members. Thus, inasmuch as a voluntarycontractual agreement is involved, with various obligations incidentalto that agreement, the Commission does not regard an automatic admissionpolicy as a workable concept. </ITAG>The Commission also notes, as a general matter, that numerous conferencesover many months were required before these seven rather homogeneous clearingagencies and depositories, with close working relationships, could cometo a written agreement on basic mutual problems that had been highlightedby the Market Break. Initially, various legal and organizational obstacleshampered their ability to address those problems; but, eventually, newground was broken and important results achieved. This uniform proposalsince has been approved by the boards of seven SROs. Thus, for the Commissionnow to require amendments to this major proposal, for any but the mostsubstantive reasons, would be inappropriate and not in the public interest.In any case, the Commission finds that the recommendations set forth inBOTCC's comment letter, taken on their own merits, are not persuasive indetermining whether the proposals, as filed, are consistent with the Act.C. Summary The Commission believes that the SCG and the SCG Agreement whereby clearingagencies would organize themselves to, among other reasons, share confidentialfinancial information about common participants, address certain mutualproblems of the marketplace, and, in general, ameliorate the financialrisks to themselves caused by market price volatility, are fully consistentwith the Act, particularly Section 17A of the Act, and warrant approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion  </ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposed rule changes are consistent with the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder. <T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act,that the seven above-mentioned proposed rule changes (File Nos.
