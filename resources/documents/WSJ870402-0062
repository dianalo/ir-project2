But most other interest rates fell and Treasury bond prices rose, snapping out of a deep three-day slump. Rates fell especially sharply on short-term Treasury bills. For example, rates on three-month Treasury bills dropped more than a quarter of a percentage point to 5.47%.    In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues increased more than half a point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That followed a drop of more than four points in the three previous sessions amid widespread fear that the dollar's weakness would translate into higher inflation and possibly frighten away foreign investors.    The dollar rebounded yesterday in the foreign-exchange markets, helping to bolster bond prices. Traders also were encouraged by the drop in short-term borrowing rates yesterday.    Nevertheless, many analysts are speculating that the dollar will resume its decline again soon despite attempts by foreign central banks to rush to its rescue. Although Federal Reserve System officials have indicated great concern about the dollar's plunge, Reagan administration officials sound less concerned. Some analysts contend that the administration would welcome further declines in the dollar on the theory that this would strengthen U.S. exports and defuse protectionist pressure in Congress.    &quot;Uncertainty over the dollar is the most important factor in the bond market, at least for now,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. He said there is &quot;no clear sense&quot; of what the Reagan administration's policy is and whether the U.S. will help defend its currency. &quot;Any further weakness in the dollar implies foreign investors, especially the Japanese, may back out of our markets,&quot; he said.    Among the dozen or so banks that raised their prime, or base, rate on corporate loans yesterday to 7 3/4% were Chemical Bank, Irving Trust Co., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, and Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago. The prime rate had been at 7 1/2% since last August.    Banks have attributed the prime rate increases, the first in nearly three years, mainly to slight rises in their own borrowing costs in the past few months. But many analysts contend that is far from the main reason. They note that banks' borrowing costs haven't risen significantly, especially in recent weeks. Some argue that the prime rate boosts mainly represent an effort by banks to fatten their profit margins and strengthen their financial backbone in an effort to withstand losses on foreign loans, especially those to Brazil.    Shortly after Citibank led the prime rate move Tuesday, Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said: &quot;I guess (Citicorp Chairman) John Reed is trying to make up for the Brazilian loans.&quot;    Nonsense, Citibank officials reply. &quot;I would refer to you to your own paper&quot; for evidence that short-term interest rates have climbed since last August, a spokesman said. He said Citibank's parent, Citicorp, sold $50 million of 91-day commercial paper last Aug. 26 at an average rate of 5.505%, and that it sold similar paper this past Tuesday at 6.298%. &quot;My calculator shows that's a 79-basis point increase,&quot; he said.    Moreover, the Citicorp spokesman said, &quot;I estimate the impact on our earnings (from the prime rate increase) is very small, perhaps 1%.&quot; He added: &quot;You are talking about a relatively small number -- and amount -- of loans pegged to the prime rate.&quot;    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose to 95 27/32 from 95 8/32 Tuesday. The yield fell to 7.86% from 7.92%. As recently as last Thursday, the issue was quoted at 99 3/8, where the yield was 7.55%. Yesterday, the issue ranged between 95 11/32 and 95 29/ 32. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose yesterday to 98 1/32 from 97 17/32, as the yield declined to 7.54% from 7.61%.    &quot;The sell-off in the bond market (in the three previous days) was so sharp that a fair number of people are coming back in and buying on the theory that bonds now look cheap,&quot; said James Capra, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;That strategy doesn't always work, but it has worked well in the past few years.&quot;    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose only 0.08 point yesterday to close at 1383.09. But that index is based on prices as of 5 p.m. EST. On Tuesday afternoon, Treasury bond prices fell sharply after 5 p.m., mainly because of the Citibank and Chase prime rate increases.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills dropped yesterday to 5.47% bid from 5.77% Tuesday, one of the sharpest one-day declines in many months. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills fell to 5.70% from 5.89%. Analysts said part of the reason for the popularity of short-term bills, which are regarded as the safest and stodgiest of investments, was investor fear about growing international trade tensions and concern about Brazil's financial woes.    Despite the Treasury bond market's rally yesterday, traders remain nervous about a Labor Department report to be released tomorrow morning. The department's monthly statistics on employment and unemployment are watched especially closely by economists and bond traders for clues to the economic and interest rate outlook. The department's report on non-farm payroll employment is widely considered one of the most important government reports each month and often sparks big moves in the financial markets.    Many forecasters expect tomorrow's report for March to provide further evidence that the economy is growing at a mediocre pace, but individual estimates of economic growth vary widely. According to the median estimate of 45 analysts surveyed recently by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., non-farm payroll employment last month rose only about 225,000, following an increase of 337,000 in February. Most analysts also estimate that the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.7%.    In the municipal market, a $120 million issue of Ohio higher education facilities revenue bonds got off to a strong sales start yesterday. As of late in the day, the unsold balance among the underwriters totaled about $46 million. The issue was priced after auction to yield from 4.20% on bonds due 1988 to 6.875% on bonds due 2002. Prudential-Bache Capital Funding heads the underwriting group. The issue is rated single-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, the Virginia Public School Authority offered $51.5 million of school financing revenue bonds. The issue was priced after auction to yield from 3.80% on bonds due 1988 to 6.85% on bonds due 2006-2007, according to a spokesman for Chemical Bank, the underwriter. The bonds are rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. The unsold balance late yesterday totaled about $29.7 million.    Elsewhere in the municipal bond market, underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. tentatively priced a proposed offering of about $112.4 million of tax allocation refunding bonds by the Industry Urban Development Agency, Calif. Yields range from 6.625% in 1994 to 7% in 1997. </TEXT></DOC>
