As the armiesof the Big Blue rumbled through Europe a certain Mr Hitler noticed all thisand jumped on their coat-tails and got afl the credit (and a few of the billsas well).andM;Which software company renowned for its spreadsheet products (only known forits spreadsheets in fact - when it can get them out) was involved in diestorming of the Bas- tille? We know a thing or two y'know, but remember a lotof this information is secret, so don't tell anyone; just imagine the billfor rewriting all those history books.andP;  And next time you talk to RogerFoster, managing director of Apricot, ask him just what was Apricot's role atthe Battle of Agincourt.andM;If you have any inside information about computer companies that wereinvolved in major moments of history drop us a line..andM;Talking of dropping us a fine, you may remember a couple of weeks ago I askedyou to send in suggestions of rebadged equipment and the companies thatrebadged them  y'know like Compaq rebadging Volvos, or Apple rebadging Dinkytoys).andP;  I said something foolish  surely some mistake? - Ed) like we wouldprint the best ones.andM;Alas this proved a trifle difficult.andP;  Does any one know what the wordlibelous means? The people who sent their ideas in (and they know who theyare) would have had us off the air before you could say &quot;IBM is rumouredto...andP;  &quot;andM;When I say &quot; send it in and we'D publish it&quot;, I don't mean &quot;spend a weekthinking up a gross libel, then send it in to us and we'll print it and thengo to prison&quot;.andM;What do you think this is, Private Eye? So, no rebadged jokes (not even theY-Front ones) until you lot can think of ones we can publish without goingout of business.andP;  And die same goes for the computer industry's role inhistory.andP;  Anybody would think we were here to enjoy yourselves...andM;Whilst perusing a pile of press releases I came across an interesting piecefrom the BSI.andP;  Pertaining to British Standard 5750 it refers to the BSIRegistered Stocklists Scheme, and it's very interesting ...andP;  Honest.andM;The bulk of the release is in the form of a question and answer session.andP;  Thefirst pithly insight sets the scene, &quot;What is a BSI Registered Stockist, andhow does it relate to other Quality Assurance Management Systems?&quot;andM;In no way phased, the plucky answer tells it all, &quot;The Stockist Scheme is notBS 5750.&quot; And while the question is still reeling with the directness of theanswer, it continues, &quot;BS 5750 comprises three certifiable parts, concernedwith design, production and testing.andP;  The application of this standard to thestockholding or distribution activity does not give the necessary assuranceto the customer.&quot; The answer does go on a bit longer but I think you get thegist of the message.andM;But die most riveting bit was finding out where the origins of the StockistsScheme are.andP;  Apparently, it was &quot;born from the ashes of MOD Def Stan 05-31 &quot;.andM;Now, who is Def Stan, was he baptized  Def or is he hard of hearing? And whywas he burnt to ashes?...andM;Enable Software Inc is a US software company (you may have guessed) with anew product.andP;  This new product is called Higgins 2.3.andP;  (One rather assamesthat there has been at least 2.2 Higgins' prior to the current release).andO;Briefly, Higgins is a Calendar Sched- uling system that does sterling stufflike...andP;  well...andP;  scheduling your calendar.andM;When asked why it was called &quot;Higgins&quot; (forget the 2.3), the US president ofthe company, Ted Newlin, explained that Higgins was their idea of what abulter would be called.andM;Forget the-word  butler', forget the name Jeeves', but remember' Higgins'.andM;It rather makes you wonder how they ever got to cross the Atlantic, let alonecome over and self us ridiculously named software.andM;Anyway, who wants butler software? I mean, would P. G. Wodehouse really havehad such a hit with Bertie Wooster if Jeeves was an executable file run onhis K, activated by typing JEEV [CRI.andP;  We can only guess ...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
