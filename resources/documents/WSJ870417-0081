The decision, which Reagan administration officials don't expect to come before the first week of May, is calculated to address growing Western European fears that accepting the Soviet offer would be a critical step toward the Soviet goal of a nuclear-free Europe, leaving North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies dangerously exposed to the Soviets' superiority in tanks, planes and soldiers.    &quot;It would be a great mistake to continue down the path of denuclearization of Europe,&quot; says Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle, who was instrumental in the U.S. proposal in 1979 that both sides should abolish medium-range missiles from Europe, planting the seeds of the superpower agreement that seems near. &quot;This is a train that has reached the end of the line. This is the end of the productive potential for nuclear-arms control in Europe.&quot;    Administration officials, who badly want NATO to accept the Soviet offer, strongly reject West European charges that Washington is unwittingly abandoning a military doctrine of &quot;flexible response&quot; that has kept the peace since the 1960s and allowed the U.S. a range of ways to respond to a Soviet conventional attack without being forced to escalate to a U.S.-Soviet exchange of intercontinental ballistic missiles.    The West European fear is that, in the words of one West German official: &quot;when given the choice between Hamburg and Chicago, the U.S. will let Moscow have Hamburg.&quot;    Secretary of State George Shultz told a press conference yesterday after his meetings with NATO ministers: &quot;I'm sure all of us in the alliance intend fully to see that that flexible response, which is based in part on certain elements of nuclear capability in Europe, is maintained.&quot; He said to do otherwise would limit the alliance to a &quot;light-switch approach.&quot; He particularly stressed that NATO would follow through on plans to modernize nuclear systems of less than 300 miles range.    A West German official said even skeptical allies are likely to accept the Soviet offer, due to misgivings over whether they could gain public backing for new nuclear-missile deployments. Such deployments would be necessary if NATO stuck by its initial demand to match Soviet levels of short-range systems deployed in Europe, rather than accepting the new Soviet proposal to abolish them altogether.    NATO doesn't have any short-range missiles, with a range of 300 to 600 miles, though West Germany has 72 conventional missiles of that range that could be fitted with American nuclear warheads. The Soviet Union has 130 to 150 such systems in Europe.    The NATO allies will first discuss the military ramifications of the Soviet proposal at a meeting in Washington next week of the High Level Group, a collection of senior NATO defense officials chaired by Mr. Perle. The Special Consultative Group on INF, or medium-range missiles, chaired by State Department political-military chief Alan Holmes, meets April 28 to work on final details, and a decision by the NATO Council of Ministers could follow closely thereafter.    Despite Mr. Shultz's assurances, many national security experts and officials argue that a decision to accept the Soviet proposal would remove two of the most essential rungs from the ladder of escalation that constitutes the NATO doctrine of flexible response.    A leading West German arms-control expert, Uwe Nehrlich, complains that the alliance, in giving up Pershing IIs, the medium-range U.S. missiles now based in West Germany, is surrendering its most effective piece of flexibile response. He says the alliance has never stressed sufficiently the military importance of these missiles, which are highly accurate and capable of penetrating Soviet defenses.    Mr. Nehrlich says West European leaders, seeing no alternative, &quot;have talked themselves into a conciliatory posture, but they know in the back of their minds what they are in for. They don't know how to regain control over negotiations. How can you stop this process by strategic reasoning?&quot;    One West European foreign minister, during closed-door meetings yesterday with Mr. Shultz, warned the U.S. to stop the process of eliminating nuclear weapons before it goes too far. &quot;We have to be careful not to be hustled&quot; by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, British Foreign Minister Geoffrey Howe said.    Mr. Perle counters European concerns about the Soviet proposal by saying that although some elements of flexible response will be lost, the Soviets will give up many more weapons than NATO. Moreover, he says, the doctrine of flexible response, which has existed since the 1960s, can survive the medium-range Pershing and Cruise missiles and short-range missiles that were only put in place 20 years later.    Many administration officials also argue that the Pershing and Cruise missiles are highly vulnerable to a pre-emptive Soviet strike and aren't militarily important for other reasons as well, including the availability of substitute weapons.    James Schlesinger, a former U.S. defense secretary, notes that even if the medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles were removed from Europe, &quot;We will have Poseidon boats, F-111 aircraft in Britain, submarine-launched cruise missiles and nuclear-capable aircraft in Germany.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
