But the Taylor is Larry Champagne's specialty. He drives a towtruck and, as they say in the trade, business is picking up. He satthe other day in his Chevron station and pointed out the highway'slatest victim: a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows.   ``He was passing a motor home on a curve, got over too far, andt-h-p-p-t, into the river,'' he said. Champagne was happy to haulthe van and its uninjured driver back to Tok, for $700.   A 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of Alaskahighways were in fair to poor condition. But the potholes and frostheaves don't slow the flow of vacationers. Growing herds oftourists not only keep Champagne smiling but also help fuel debateover this frontier state's transportation future.   More roads! say business leaders who see a young and developingstate with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits.   Stop the bulldozers! cry environmentalists who see a pristineland needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower48 states.   The arguments likely will continue as long as there are placespeople cannot drive to, and much of Alaska fits that category. Thestate's 11,600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeasternquarter, leaving vast areas untracked.   One-fourth of Alaska's half-million residents live unconnectedby road to the outside world. Of 151 incorporated communities, 133are unconnected, including the state capital of Juneau.   Given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that covermuch of Alaska, it's a wonder roads were ever built.   Turn-of-the-century gold rushes spurred the first majorconstruction. In World War II, concerns about a Japanese invasionprompted another building frenzy; the 1,520-mile Alaska Highway,Alaska's first overland link to the lower 48, was finished in justnine months.   Since statehood in 1959, expansion has continued steadily. Thelatest road, completed this summer in northwestern Alaska, is a54-mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as Red Dog.   ``I try not to think about that,'' said Susan Alexander, staterepresentative for the Wilderness Society, which unsuccessfullyfought the road's route through Cape Krusenstern National Monument.   She said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resultingdevelopment and pollution. She cited the 416-mile Dalton Highway,built in 1974 to link Fairbanks and the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.Although only the highway's southern half is open to the public,lax enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north, andAlexander worries about the effect on wildlife.   ``Increased access means increased poaching, and theredefinitely has been poaching along the road. The road lets inpeople, hunters, who wouldn't have been there otherwise,'' she said.   Letting more people into Alaska is what economic boosters havehad in mind for years. Wherever roads have gone, tourism hasfollowed. U.S. Customs officials say 38,150 vehicles _ about 70percent of them motor homes and campers _ entered the state on theAlaska Highway last year.   Roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote miningmore competitive, say the boosters, who over the years haveproposed dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map.   In 1977, travel guides called the 152-mile Elliott Highway nearFairbanks the ``Road to Nome,'' even though it dead-ended, andstill does, 500 miles short of the Bering Sea town.   In 1986, the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce suggested aroad that would head 200 miles southwest from Denali National Parkto McGrath, then swing north another 200 miles to the Yukon River.   In southeastern Alaska, plans surface occasionally to connectJuneau to highways that now stop in Haines and Skagway.   But such projects, each estimated to cost hundreds of millionsof dollars, are distant dreams for state officials who can barelyraise the $52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads.   Alaska's oil-dependent government has grown cautious since theoil boom busted, and the state Department of Transportation plansno major highway expansion. It would cost $600 million just tobring Alaska's rural highways up to standards, said Ron Lind, theagency's planning and budget director.   Patterns of land use and ownership also discourageroad-building. National parks, preserves and monuments now cover 50million of Alaska's 375 million acres. Natives, protective of openspace needed for subsistence hunting and fishing, own 44 millionacres.   But things could change quickly in Alaska's boom-bust economy.As publisher Robert Henning wrote in an Alaska Geographic bookcalled ``Adventure Roads North'':   ``Strong anti-roads sentiments of environmentalist groups haveslowed Alaskan road construction, but in the history of the North,there has ever been the cry for `more roads, more trails,' and itis inevitable that the road building will continue. ... Like it ornot, it seems to be the American way.''   Wherever and whenever roads are built, the likes of LarryChampagne will be there to pick up the pieces. Back at the Chevronstation, Champagne was smiling again; a Winnebago driver was in forthe second time that day with a flat tire.   Champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cashregister. ``That'll be $10,'' he said. ``You have a nice day.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT></DOC>
