OPEC was in disarray. Saudi Arabia had opened the floodgates. From Brussels to New York, oil prices crashed to their lowest level in more than two years.    Yet through it all, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Robin Stonehill was leaning ho-hum against the post where he trades shares of Atlantic Richfield Co. &quot;The stock is stable,&quot; he nonchalantly said. &quot;The investment community isn't paying any attention to the price of oil today.&quot;    Why should it? Despite plunging prices, ARCO's profit is surging. So, in fact, are the profits of Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., and nearly every multinational oil company. Despite the continuing collapse of oil prices, profits of the nation's 18 biggest oil companies will leap by about one-third this year, to nearly $20 billion -- far exceeding the profits of every major airline and auto maker combined.    Through a radical restructuring spanning less than a decade, Big Oil has abandoned the days when profits moved in lockstep with oil prices. Indeed, for the first time in its 129-year history, the oil industry has positioned itself to make money -- big money in some cases -- even when oil prices fall out of bed.    &quot;It is one of the most sweeping and most dramatic restructurings of any industry,&quot; says Philip Verleger, visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.    The turnaround is due partly to cost cutting on a scale that has hit few industries. Almost 300,000 oil-patch employees have lost their jobs -- 20 times the number of financial-industry workers idled since last year's stock-market crash.    Exxon alone cut about $375 million in costs just last year. Only two years ago 800 Exxon employees occupied 13 floors of the oil giant's New York skyscraper. Today, after layoffs and transfers, only 300 workers remain on seven floors. And the building, part of the legacy of Exxon founder John D. Rockefeller, has been sold to a Japanese group.    But Draconian cost cutting alone doesn't account for the surge in profits. By radically overhauling the process by which it refines and distributes oil, the industry has managed to keep consumer prices high, even as crude-oil costs plunge. Big Oil, long adept at exploring and pumping, has also finally learned the art of selling -- by going after market niches with new grades of gasoline, for instance, and by manufacturing such high-value petrochemical products as Mobil's Hefty Storage Bags. In recent years, all large oil companies have slashed the number of gasoline stations through which they move their products, eliminating any unprofitable or even marginal operations.    There isn't any evidence that major oil companies have conspired to keep retail oil prices high. But consumer groups complain that regulators have been inattentive to the issue. Three times during the Reagan Administration, the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, based in Washington, D.C., has approached the Justice Department with claims that consumer prices were too high relative to the falling price of crude. Two years ago, in response to such a complaint, the coalition received only a thank you note in return, said Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of the group.    Behind the turnaround is a fundamental reshaping of the internal structure of the major oil companies. For more than a century, oil companies have consisted of two halves. There was an exploration or production division that drilled wildcat wells and kept the oil flowing -- the so-called upstream business. The oil companies pumped crude furiously and &quot;sold&quot; it to themselves at market prices, which, in nearly every year until the price crash of 1986, were sufficient to guarantee huge profits.    Then there was the &quot;downstream&quot; side -- all the refineries and filling stations that &quot;bought&quot; the oil, poor stepchildren of the romantic and profitable wildcatting and oil-pumping business. &quot;Service stations were just a way to move oil,&quot; says Thomas Manning, vice president of Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc., a refining-consulting firm in Houston. Money-losing retail operations were a global phenomenon. Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles of France once chose where to sell products according to a guidebook called &quot;Losses at Posted Prices.&quot;    Such losses were practically guaranteed because there were simply too many refineries and gasoline outlets. By the late 1970s, the industry was operating more than 300 refineries, many of them among the world's largest factories. Service stations grew ubiquitous, often four to an intersection, with price wars erupting regularly.    Then the industry began awakening to a painful truth: The crude-oil gravy train was screeching to a halt. The U.S., it became clear, was rapidly running out of oil. Governments in Asia, Africa and the Middle East nationalized their oil fields. &quot;Now that (the companies) don't own the oil, they must run the rest of their business to make money,&quot; Mr. Manning says.    The answer lay largely in marketing. No longer could oil companies blindly push products with broad national advertising, as Texaco once did with its &quot;Texaco Star Theater.&quot; The industry began choosing geographical markets carefully, cannily introducing new products and pricing shrewdly.    &quot;It wasn't until this decade that big oil companies focused on ensuring that the refining and marketing businesses operate profitably,&quot; said Robert Stobaugh, a business professor with the Harvard Business School.    Headhunters have noticed the change. &quot;Our clients want marketing people who understand the concept of 'positioning' a product, even if he comes from the fastfood or soft-drink industry,&quot; says Joseph Collard, an oil and gas specialist at Spencer, Stuart andamp; Associates, an executive-search firm. In the past, he said, oil companies generally wanted people with technical backgrounds.    The industry also eliminated excess refining capacity, mothballing in this decade more than a third of its refineries. The resulting tight supplies now force the oil industry to import not just crude oil but also gasoline.    And as supplies of gasoline tighten, the industry is doing all it can to get consumers to buy more. High-tech gasoline stations decked out in eye-catching colors dot the landscape, replacing the mom and pop operations that had become part of American folklore. In addition to the old stand-by products -- tires, batteries and accessories -- gasoline stations now sell bread, milk, beer and Playboy magazine.    Computerized pumps at these designer stations have more than tripled the speed at which gasoline moves to the customer. The &quot;smart pumps&quot; can handle the credit-card payment, log the sale for inventory purposes and then reset themselves in a flash for the next patron -- at huge cost savings to the oil companies.    Like cereal and soap makers, the oil industry is rapidly introducing new products, further segmenting a market that once consisted solely of &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;hightest.&quot; Most of the majors have introduced, at least in some regions, a medium-octane gasoline that most cars don't need but that consumers are buying in droves, largely because of advertising. Exxon, for instance, just introduced its Exxon Plus medium grade in six states.    Although the medium-grade gasoline costs very little extra to produce, it fetches several cents a gallon more than regular unleaded gasoline. In some cases, profit margins are two times higher. And best of all, clever marketing of the new grades generally causes consumers to &quot;buy up&quot; from the less expensive gasoline, rather than &quot;buy down&quot; from the premium grade.    The companies have also become very fussy about where they sell their gasoline, withdrawing from the most competitive areas and building a presence in locations where they can dominate. Tenneco Inc., a big gasoline retailer in the South, even quit selling gasoline in its hometown of Houston because it didn't have a big enough share of the market to make it worth the company's while.    Atlantic Richfield pulled out of the Atlantic states. Amoco Corp. makes gasoline in Texas but recently quit selling it there, except at the lone outlet where refinery employees can fill up. Exxon and Texaco Inc. recently swapped dozens of gasoline stations, mostly in California and Nevada to consolidate their hold on markets that are closest to their respective refineries. All told, the industry has closed 26,514 service stations since 1982, nearly a quarter of the total.    As the big companies cut costs, they can also cut prices, sometimes driving independent distributors out of the business altogether. Steven Riggins, whose family runs 16 gasoline stations in New Jersey, says the number of independent gasoline suppliers in his market has shrunk by one-half in only the past year. They have abandoned their businesses because of slim profits. As a result, Mr. Riggins is stuck buying from the majors. &quot;There definitely isn't the pick anymore,&quot; he says.    As the majors achieve market dominance, they naturally can charge more. An ARCO station in Boulder City, Nev., which competes with only one independent retailer, has charged 10 cents more for a gallon of gasoline than ARCO stations in Las Vegas, only 15 miles away, where at least four major oil companies compete.    Gasoline is far from the only product producing huge profits these days. The petrochemicals business, for years a dumping ground for the by-products of gasoline refining, has become the diamond in Big Oil's hydrocarbon crown.    In fact, the oil industry has nudged the petrochemical industry out as the top player in its own business. Oil firms now produce three of every five pounds of building-block petrochemicals -- ethylene, propylene, butadyne, benzene and parazylene -- from which up to 85% of petrochemicals in the U.S. are made.    Petrochemicals also are going into an increasing proportion of high-value consumer packaging and products -- no longer just the bowling ball, for instance, but also the bowling shoes and the finish used to buff the bowling lanes.    Mobil has clawed to the top in the plastic-bag wars, producing not just Hefty Bags but also plastic vegetable sacks for New York City's Korean grocery stores. In fact, the 2,500 employees at Mobil's chemical and plastics plants in Rochester, N.Y., exceed the number at almost every Mobil facility in the U.S., including, by far, its headquarters in Manhattan.    Occidental Petroleum Corp. has practically become a chemical company with its recent acquisition of Cain Chemical Co. The California oil company, which has no refining and marketing operations to cushion the blow of low oil prices, bought the independent chemical company for $1.25 billion as an oil-price hedge. &quot;It would have been too difficult to buy a strong position in refining and marketing,&quot; explains Occidental President Ray Irani.    Some skeptics have their doubts about how long the oil industry will be sitting so pretty. &quot;The next thing you know, they'll decide to expand&quot; capacity, which could drive down retail prices, says F. Gerard Adams, a former industry official who is an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;A competitive industry doesn't work as a group. They would all have to behave -- but they never do.&quot;    But the industry may be kept from expanding refining capacity to excess, something it has been prone to do in past booms. As the industry contracted in the first half of this decade, so did the construction companies and suppliers that serviced them -- by at least 50%, estimates John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants, a Houston-based firm that serves both the refining and the petrochemicals businesses. Historically, the gasoline-refining and petrochemicals industries have competed for the same suppliers, meaning that both industries would have to scramble to find companies capable of building new refining units.    The oil industry is also operating much smarter in its &quot;upstream&quot; business: oil production. After years of trading oil under long-term, fixed-priced contracts, today's oil markets function like a bazaar in Baghdad. Excluding the millions of &quot;electronic barrels&quot; traded daily on the futures markets, major oil companies last year conducted 8,000 major crude-oil purchases on a spot basis, compared with only 300 in 1979. The spot buying allows the companies to respond more quickly to changes in the market.    The industry's transformation hasn't been lost on Wall Street, where brokerage analysts have revamped their methods of analyzing oil stocks, though sometimes belatedly so. William Randol of First Boston Corp. downgraded oil stocks last January after OPEC failed to reach an agreement that would bolster oil prices. &quot;I had to eat my words,&quot; he says.    &quot;The lesson I have learned,&quot; adds Constantine Fliakos, international oil analyst at Merrill Lynch, &quot;is that the stock now never gets to the low levels that oil prices would appear to dictate. Stocks don't reflect the despair of oil prices.&quot;    ---                  Oil: Profits and Prices                                             MIDEAST                           PROFITS OF 18     LIGHT                          INTEGRATED COS.
