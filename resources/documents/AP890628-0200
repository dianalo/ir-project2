Bush's proposal for salary increases for members of Congress aswell as top government officials will be included a speech Thursdayin which he will unveil proposals for tougher campaign finance laws,said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Bush aides played down the salary increase, which Bush haspreviously advocated, as a side issue to the packet of proposalsdesigned to limit special interest influence in elections.   The White House initially planned to advance the idea of agradual pay increase tied to a phaseout of honoraria, the feesmembers of Congress earn from speeches, said one source. But thepresident decided Wednesday to leave such specifics out of hisspeech, another top official said.   ``He'll make a point that he thinks honoraria and pay raisesshould be linked,'' and he will offer to work with Congress to puttogether a deal, the first official said.   Bush also decided not to propose a specific pay increase forCongress to go along with the 25 percent raise he already is seekingfor federal judges. However, he was expected to give a number in hiscall to raise top officials' salaries in the Executive Branch.   A proposed 51 percent pay raise for Congress, governmentofficials and judges went down in flames earlier this year in abacklash of public resentment. That raise would have increasedcongressional salaries from $89,500 a year to $135,000.   Bush aides noted a proposal this month by Sen. Christopher Dodd,D-Conn., that would increase salaries for members of Congress, topexecutive branch officials and the judiciary by 10 percent per yearfor four years. At the same time, honoraria for lawmakers would bephased out.   Congressmen currently augment their salaries with thousands ofdollars in speaking fees, a practice criticized as an invitation toinfluence-buying. They may get $2,000 per speech, up to 30 percentof salary in the House and 40 percent in the Senate.   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairman of a House task forcealready studying honoraria and other ethics issues, said Bush'sinput was welcome but he doubted Congress would quickly embracewhatever he proposes.   ``We appreciate his willingness to get into these issues ... butwe've got to solve these matters internally,'' he said.   Fazio said his group hoped to finish drafting a new ethicspackage this year and, pay raise or not, it will be a tough sell.   ``It's a lot easier to vote `no' and deal with the devil youknow,'' he said.   The speech Thursday will outline the president's proposals forelection law changes. That package, according to those working onit, will include the abolition of business and labor politicalaction committees, a ban on carrying over campaign funds from oneelection to the next, curtailment of gerrymandering methods ofdrawing political district lines, and full disclosure of so-called``soft money'' contributions to campaigns.   Soft money is a term used to describe funds that are raisedoutside the guidelines of federal election law and that do not haveto be reported to the Federal Election Commission. The frequentlycited example is that of corporate and union funds, barred infederal campaigns, that are given to political parties or stategroups which then help the candidates even though they are formallyindependent of the campaign committees.   Bush also will call for restrictions on franking privileges,which allow members of Congress to send mail to their constituentsfree.   Bush has been meeting in recent weeks with members of Congress,advocacy groups and campaign law specialists to address concernsthat special interest money plays too big a role in politics.   Advocates of campaign changes said the president efforts wouldn'tgo far enough to make a difference.   Ellen Miller, who heads the non-profit Center For ResponsivePolitics, said disclosing the sources of money will not eliminatespecial interest influence. But she said, ``The very fact that he isin this ball game, that he is clearly personally concerned andcommitted to change and reform in this area is a major step.''   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a longtime advocateof tougher election laws, said that from what he knows of Bush'sproposals, they do not solve the problems of massive campaignspending and special-interest influence.   He also said that Bush's plan to bar corporate and union PACs butallow political action committees that are not tied to companies,unions or trade associations, would leave room for continued abuse.   But he said if Bush's action leads to bipartisan congressionalnegotiations ``this could mean an enormous difference in breakingthis whole thing open.''   Wertheimer and Miller were invited to the White House on Tuesdayto talk with Bush and his advisers about revamping the campaignfinance system.   On the pay raise, Bush has said he wanted to distinguish thecongressional pay raise quagmire from salary increases for judgesand executive branch officials.   In April, Bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federaljudges, which is pending in Congress.   At a news conference on Tuesday, Bush was asked about his concernthat many people have left government service for higher payingprivate jobs.   ``I want to see that remedied,'' he said. ``I still would like tosee the separation of consideration for judges and other keyexecutive branch posts _ I'm thinking of some of the researchers inthe NIH (the National institutes of Health) and people of thisnature. And I want to see it separated out so it doesn't get caughton the question of congressional pay.''   Bush endorsed the 51-percent salary increase for Congress,executive branch officials and judges in January at his first newsconference.</TEXT></DOC>
