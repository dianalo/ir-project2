Plan Computer --- Artificial Intelligence Model At Low Price Expected To Be Shown Tomorrow </HL><AUTHOR> Paul Duke Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AAPL TXN </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Texas Instruments Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. plan to announce tomorrow a new low-priced artificial intelligence computer based on Apple's Macintosh II model, according to industry sources.    Neither Texas Instruments nor Apple would discuss the introduction, but the new machine seems to fit recent strategies at both companies.    For Texas Instruments, which will supply its advanced microprocessor for artificial intelligence called the Lisp chip, the venture offers access to markets not reached by its own Explorer and Explorer II machines, priced at $40,000 and up. As well, the project underscores the new willingness under President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry Junkins to form alliances in technology areas where Dallas-based Texas Instruments isn't strong.    For Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, the move adds to its efforts to broaden markets for its personal computers, which traditionally have been used mainly in offices, schools and in the home. Apple has pushed the Macintosh II, introduced a year ago, as a powerful personal computer for business and technical markets.    Industry sources said the new computer, apparently called the microExplorer, is essentially a Macintosh II with a circuit board employing Texas Instruments' Lisp chip. The chip is the piece of silicon that actually performs computations. The Lisp chip is now available only in Texas Instruments' Explorer II line, which was introduced last summer. The price range of the microExplorer is expected to be about $15,000 to about $30,000, depending on the size of memory and other features.    Texas Instruments is one of the biggest companies exploring the field of artificial intelligence -- the branch of computer science devoted to creating computers and software that mimic human thought processes. The Lisp chip is specifically designed to work with artificial intelligence software that might, for instance, monitor manufacturing processes or aid in making medical diagnoses.    Thus the microExplorer probably would be aimed at businesses and professionals who can't afford the more expensive Texas Instruments systems. At the moment it's unclear just how big that market is. Most analysts expect artificial intelligence to be a booming industry in the next decade, but so far little sophisticated software is available.    The microExplorer is the latest in a number of ventures announced in recent months teaming Texas Instruments with other high-technology firms. In the past, Texas Instruments was known for jealously guarding its own inventions, but Mr. Junkins, who assumed his current posts in 1985 and will add the title of chairman next month, is credited with pursuing the alliances.    Last summer, for instance, Texas Instruments and Intel Corp., the Santa Clara, Calif. semiconductor maker, agreed to swap chip designs and manufacturing technologies for developing customized chips. The venture with Apple, however, doesn't appear to involve continuing development of other new products.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Texas Instruments closed at $52.50, up 62.5 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, Apple closed at $43.25, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
