(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Challenge Of IntegrationandM;Image-processing technology is on a fast track these days.andP;  The pace of newproduct announcements alone should be enough to make information systemsmanagers pay heed.andP;  High-resolution monitors that use as many as 3 millionpixels to paint pictures of stunning crispness are available.andP;  So, too, arefaster and cheaper laser printers and scanners.andP;  Optical storagesubsystems--the generally favored means for storing electronicimages--continue to raise the limit fo data storage.andP;  sony Corp., forexample, offers a 12-inch disc that holds 3.75 giga-bytes of data per side.andO;And 5 1/4-inch optical jukebox systems are proliferating like rabbits.andM;Data transfer from an optical disc is still slower than from a magnetic disk.andO;But here, too, new advances promise to close the gap between optical andmagnetic data speeds.andP;  New compression/decompression algorithms can squeezethe image for a standad paper document from one megabyte down to less than 50kilobytes.andM;Songs of SolutionandM;Such an outpouring of technology has the imaging industry bustling withexcitement.andP;  But what excites many IS pros even more is the fact that it'snow possible to tie together these various components into imagingappications that offer enormous returns.andP;  Instead of harping on technology,the image industry is suddenly singing songs of solution.andM;All of tis marks a significant change.andP;  Not so long ago, imaging was, in thewords of one Is director, &quot;a technological curiosity.&quot;andP;  Image processingtended to be used in stand-alone applications, usually built around the taskof document storage and retrieval, an application for which the technology iswell suited.andP;  But the real returns from imaging won't happen until systemsbegin to eliminate the physical flow of paper in a company.andP;  And withoutsoftware to replicate work flow or to link imaging to other existingapplications built on years of Is effort, an image system is scarcely morethan an expensive filing cabinet.andM;Image systems are starting to live up to their potential to integrateelectronic document handling with other business critical applications,however.andP;  Consider the case of St. Paul-based Northwest Airlines Inc., whichis using image technology to tackle a job that, until recently, defiedautomation.andP;  Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest air carrier, processesover 600 million ticket transactions a year.andM;The front end of the ticket business is sufficiently automated.andP;  Electronicrecords of every ticket sold by a travel agent or one of Northwest's own60,000 ticket agents go directly into an IBM mainframe database.andP;  The backend of the ticket accounting system, however, was anything but automated.andO;When passengers turned in tickets, the flight coupons were stuffed intoenvelopes by gate agents and shipped back to Northwest's headquarters.andP;  Therethey were stored in a warehouse stacked to the ceiling with card-board filingboxes.andM;The problem facing Northwest--and every other airline--stemmed from the factthat passengers use tickets in a way that bears only a passing resemblance tothe electronic records housed in the ticket database.andP;  They may use a ticketfrom one airline to fly with another, or they may use only the A-B leg of anA-B-C flight.andP;  Because of the discrepancies between original ticket recordsand actual ticket use, airlines need to match every flight coupon in thewarehouse against every ticket in the database to accurately calculatepassenger revenues.andM;Deregulated ComplicationsandM;Further complicating revenue accounting is the deregulated airlineenvironment, in which daily price changes can affect as many as 1 milliontickets.andP;  Given the number of passenger carried by Northwest, a manual matchfor every ticket was clearly impossible.andP;  &quot;Instead, we took a sampling oftickets and used a statistical-modeling program to essentially estimaterevenues,&quot; explains Harold Atkins, assistant controller at the airline.andM;But this shortcut left much to be desired.andP;  For one thing, revenue estimateswere not always accurate.andP;  Nor did they alleviate the paper problem, sincetickets still had to be physically tracked down in the warehouse and pulledeach time a fare refund or interairline transfer was required.andP;  Of the 600people employed in Northwest's passenger revenue accounting office, 20 didlittle else but search for flight coupons.andM;Instead Of ChasingandM;Paper, Workers WillandM;Be Reassigned ToandM;More Useful Jobs.andM;So, in 1986, following its merger with Republic Airlines, Northwest realizedit had to streamline the process.andP;  It hired Chicago-based Andersen Consultingto design an automated Passenger Revenue Accounting (PRA) system.andP;  Theassignment proved to be an archetypical systems integration job: by the timeAndersen sought out the best components for each system element, at least 10vendors were involved.andM;From an imaging standpoint, a key element of the PRA is a scanner fromRecognition Equipment Inc. of Irving, Texas, that was specially engineered toread 17 tickets per second.andP;  Once the ticket images are captured and indexedby ticket number, the images are stored in an optical storage and retrievallibrary from FileNet Corp. of Costa Mesa, Calif.andP;  The optical libraryconsists of two jukeboxes, each containing 204 twelve-inch optical discs andcan house a maximum of 40 million documents.andM;Another key elements of the PRA system is a network of workstations from SunMicrosystems Inc. used to access ticket images.andP;  Each ticket number isscanned by optical character recognition (OCR) software and then sent to aSun fileserver.andP;  The system uses the relational database management softwarefrom Sybase Inc. of Emeryville, Calif., to keep track of the location of eachticket image in the FileNet library.andM;Special audit software from Los Angeles-based Inference Corp. matches theticket image in the library with ticket records on the mainframe database.andO;For those cases where audit errors are detected, the ticket in question isfetched from the FileNet library and put in a queue to await further auditingby operators working at the Sun workstations.andP;  &quot;The ticket retrievalprocess--which used to take hours--is now done in seconds,&quot; says RachelHollstadt, director of the PRA system.andM;Northwest's application is being touted by some as a vision of the imagingfuture.andP;  &quot;Historically, image applications have been confined to documentmanagement with some limited connections between the document storage systemand host data,&quot; says FileNet's vice president of marketing, Bob Castle.andP;  &quot;The[Northwest application$] represents a much broader use of image.andP;  Differentdatabases, different data types, expert systems, a number of differentsoftware technologies are all tied together at the workstation level using aclient/server, open systems architecture.&quot;andM;For IS directors contemplating image applications, Northwest's PRA doesindeed illustrate the technology's potential.andP;  But it also serves tohighlight some of the scarier aspects of integrated image systems today.andP;  Forstarters, there is the matter of sticker shock.andP;  Northwest won't disclose thecost of the system, but educated guesses put the total tab in the range of$50 million, counting hardware, software, development and training costs.andM;While not acknowledging the accuracy of the $50 million estimate, DougSchwinn, then senior director of IS development at Northwest (he has sincemoved to Dayton Hudson (Corp.), who headed up the project, says the costfigures merit some qualification.andP;  The total PRA system includes a number ofpieces, he says, including a new IBM mainframe and specially developedaccounting software to run on it.andP;  To that add the costs of expert systemaudit software and an upgraded data center network.andP;  According to Schwinn,the parts of the system directly related to imaging account for only about10% of the total cost.andM;By another measure, the image portion of the system--including scanners,workstations, network and servers--comes to about $11,000 per workstation,according to Tom Grudnowski, the partner at Andersen Consulting who led thePRA project team.andM;Price appears not to be a major concern to Northwest: the airline expects torecoup the costs within the first year through greater employee efficiencyand other savings.andP;  &quot;Instead of chasing paper, workers will be reassigned tomore useful jobs, such as doing audits,&quot; explains PRA director Hollstadt.andP;  Aneven greater payoff will come in the form of improved market intelligence.andO;&quot;For the first time, Northwest will be able to know what its true customerbase is and where those customers fly,&quot; says Schwinn.andM;There is another aspect to the Northwest system that may give some ISdirectors pause, and that is the amount of customization required.andP;  At thepoint of peak activity, some 180 people worked on the PRA system.andP;  Many ofthem were part of the software development effort to build in auditingfeatures and integrate the image capture and storage system into themainframe ticket database.andP;  But a sizable chunk of development time was alsodevoted simply to tying the various hardware pieces together.andP;  &quot;One of thebiggest challenges of the project was to get all the components running atthe speed of the scanner,&quot; admits Schwinn.andM;The Integration QuestionandM;Integration--how much is needed and at what cost--is a major question in theimaging arena these days.andP;  How much customization work is needed to makeimage technology fit an organization's needs?andP;  Depending on the particularapplication, the answer can be a lot, as the Northwest system shows.andP;  Buteven less-specialized applications will generally require the assistance of asystems integration company.andM;&quot;There is no single-product company today that gives an optimal solution,&quot;says Brendan Reidy, vice president and general manager of Litton IntegratedAutomation in Alameda, Calif., one of a number of integrators doing a briskbusiness in building large imaging applications.andP;  Reidy points out that for alarge imaging system--$10 million and up--roughly one-third of the final costtypically goes to the systems integrator for consulting and integration work.andO;Integration fees often include the programming of entirely new applicationsor, at the very least, software to link the image system to an existingapplication.andM;In many cases, more fundamental integration problems need to be solved.andO;Depending on the needs of an application, it may be necessary to write advicedrivers forprinters, scanners or optical disc systems just to link thevarious imaging components together.andP;  Then there is the issue of linking theimaging components to other computers and databases.andM;For a number of years, standards for optical storage--or the lack ofthem--were a subject of concern, with discussion typically focusing on suchthings as data compression/decompression standards and optical-writingtechniques.andP;  Today, many experts agree that standards are no longer a majorstumbling block.andP;  Standards for compression/decompression do exist, andstandards for interchange of data among optical systems are developing.andM;To what extent vendors will support these standards remains a valid concern.andO;But whether vendors go their own way on things like compression/decompressionand optical writing is not the major hindrance to integrated imaging.andM;&quot;Data formats for optical disc are irrelevant,&quot; maintains Roger Sullivan,vice president of image management systems at BIS/CAP International, a marketresearch firm in Norwell, Mass.andP;  &quot;Most customers are making decisions wellbeyond the question of what are the nuts and bolts of data format or whetherthey can move data from one optical disc to another.andP;  Integration within thedata-processing environment is the primary concern.andP;  What customers reallywant is to intercept the data stream on the host or to have the host systemautomatically retrieve documents from an image system and do something withit.&quot;andM;Even a modest imaging project can easily run into difficulties.andP;  forinstance, piecing together the various hardware and software elements can beespecially problematic.andP;  Two years ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. of EastBrunswick, N.J., undertook a project involving the conversion of allinternally developed research and development documents in its Princeton,N.J.-based Research Information Center (RIC) from microfilm to an opticalstorage and retrieval system.andM;Risk-Free ConversionandM;One reason for doing the project was to learn more about the technology.andO;&quot;Down the line, we have some ambitious plans for image, but this [project]was not one of them,&quot; says Alan Gilson, manager of the firm's TechnologyAssessment Group.andP;  Gilson terms the RIC project a production pilot that&quot;posed no real risk to the company if the conversion failed.&quot;andM;Just as well, because, says Gilson, &quot;what we learned is that integratingimage is a lot more difficult than it needs to be.&quot;andP;  For example, problemscropped up when the implementers tried to use a session number from adatabase management system running on a VAX minicomputer as an index numberto access an image document.andP;  &quot;Sun workstations offered an implementationthat was better than other vendors,&quot; says Gilson.andP;  &quot;Even so, it was clumsierthan it needed to be.andP;  Operators have to use Sun tools to transfer from theDEC terminal to an imaging session on the Sun Server.andP;  That should be anautomatic transfer; it shouldn't require human intervention.&quot;andM;How long will it take image vendors to develop the kinds of integration thatusers want?andP;  The answer depends on whether this technology truly poses uniquechallenges or whether it cn benefit from the steep learning curve that otherIS technologies have followed.andM;Some experts believe that image applications do pose special challenges.andO;&quot;Architectural issues for image are very different than for data,&quot; says ScottMcReady, director of image systems for IDC/Avante, a Framingham, Mass.,andO;research firm.andP;  &quot;They are much more complicated than most users, or manyvendors, realize.andP;  One vendor may use a proprietary server architecture tohandle high-volume I/O; another may opt for a different solution.andP;  Thenthere's a whole host of back-end storage issues and workstation designissues.&quot;andP;  According to McReady, the solution for one application willgenerally not be the optimal solution for another.andM;But this view is not shared by all--and certainly not by the image vendors.andO;&quot;I don't believe image technology requires a higher degree of customizationthan other new technologies have,&quot; asserts David Sarna, president of New YorkCity-based Image Business Systems Inc.andP;  &quot;But image is new technology, sopeople are puzzling through how to implement it with existing technologies.andO;That means they often come up with a detailed requirement that isn'tnecessarily the ideal solution.andP;  It just happens to be the way they solvedthe puzzle.&quot;andM;Prevailing PlatformsandM;Sarna predicts that, over time, a small number of accepted image platformsand approaches will prevail.andP;  He offers the analogy of building one's owndatabase management system: &quot;Today you'd have to be out of your mind to evenconsider it, but several years ago it was thought to be a reasonablequestion.&quot;andM;The challenge of piecing together imaging solutions has mainly fallen tosystems integrators, many of which have standardized on a particular set ofproducts that they use as a basic imaging platform.andP;  Litton IntegrationAutomation, for instance, typically uses as its solution a standard platformconsisting of an IBM mainframe, Sun workstations, a highspeed fiber opticbackbone and a mix of printers and scanners.andM;The image vendors now appear to be following this lead by offering standardsolution platforms, mainly through a flurry of vendor alliances.andP;  Imagebusiness Systems, for instance, offer a package consisting of IBM RTworkstations (to be replaced by RS/6000s later this year); optical drivesfrom Laser Magnetic Storage International Co. of Colorado Springs; jukeboxesfrom Cygnet Systems Inc. of San Jose; OCR scanners from Santa Clara-basedCalera Recognition Systems Inc.; Ethernet, Token Ring and Fiber-opticnetworking solutions from a variety of sources; and IBS' own bar codesoftware.andM;Indeed, there appears to be a real scramble to form alliances.andP;  Unisys Corp.andO;recruited at least 10 supplies--including FileNet, Plexus Software Inc. (alsoin Santa Clara) and Sigma Imaging Systems Inc. of Anaheim, Calif.--for itsgeneral purpose imaging product called InfoImage Folder, introduced earlierthis year.andP;  Similarly, IBM offers a set of its own and third-party productsas building blocks for its AS/400-based imaging system.andP;  &quot;We think thisapproach takes a lot of complexity out of the equation for the customer,&quot;says Craig Grant, IBM's manager of AS/400 market development specializing inimage applications.andM;With imaging technology moving so fast, the vendor alliance approachrepresents in some respects a compromise solution.andP;  &quot;We've got a platformthat offers basic functionality, but if you have an application that needsthe latest and greatest and fastest of a certain type of device, we may notsupport it today,&quot; says Grant.andM;Of course, there is no guarantee that the rash of vendor alliances will meetthe specialized needs of many potential customers.andP;  David Coldren, executivedirector of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, has a casein point.andP;  &quot;I've watched the technology get better and better, and now I'mseeing vendors and systems integrators put the pieces together.andP;  But no onehas put them together in a system that meets our needs.&quot;andM;What Coldren has in mind is a unique system for storing and retrievingelectronic images of court records.andP;  It would need to be a big system, hefigures; Illinois has millions of court records on file, and the file for theaverage felony case is 3 inches thick.andP;  &quot;There's a lot of information inthose files that could have relevance to other criminal cases, if only wecould get at it,&quot; says Coldren.andM;The bureau currently stores court documents on microfilm.andP;  Optical storagewould improve the retrieval time for entire cases, but it still would notallow for key word retrievals based on the information contained withinscanned documents.andP;  As yet, few vendors have linked OCR technology to imagingin a way that can accomplish this feat.andP;  Moreover, an indexing system thatcould keep track of all the names, aliases, dates, times, places and otherdata that might be relevant to a criminal prosecutor would be challenging tobuild.andP;  &quot;We've talked with systems integrators,&quot; says Coldren.andP;  &quot;They aredoing some interesting things.andP;  But hiring a systems integrator to invent themissing pieces is too expensive.&quot;andP;  Nor does systems integration lend itselfto the needs of a public agency, which typically must be able to point to aspecific product before it can secure money from funding agencies.andM;&quot;It's nice to see that the imaging pieces are starting to be assembled intovertical solutions,&quot; says Coldren.andP;  &quot;It just doesn't look like ours is goingto be one of the target markets anytime soon.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
