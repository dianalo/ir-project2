Monday announced TOPIC version 3.0, a major new release of thecompany's intelligent document retrieval system.andM;Version 3.0 expands the TOPIC network computing model to support WANs, andincludes new developer products for tight integration to SQL databases andother applications.andP;  In addition, TOPIC 3.0 features a redesigned userinterface that supports all major GUIs.andP;  TOPIC 3.0 ships June 1.andM;TOPIC and TOPIC REAL-TIME are designed to provide fast, accurate andeasy-to-use document management solutions for the networked computingenvironments of the 1990s.andP;  TOPIC and TOPIC REAL-TIME employ conceptretrieval, a knowledge-based approach to accessing structured andunstructured data from both internal and external sources.andM;This includes all documents, manuals, reports, scanned/OCR data, and livenewswire feeds that comprise an organization's information base.andM;An optional new feature of TOPIC 3.0 is the TOPIC Partition Server.andP;  Itexpands the current TOPIC distributed system architecture for local areanetworks (LANs) of workstations, to include enterprise-wide configurationssupporting wide area networks (WANs).andP;  This unique architecture is ideal forsite-to-site information retrieval, as well as dial-up database applications.andM;By seamlessly integrating the use of desktop retrieval clients and TOPICPartition Servers via low-level network drivers such as TCP/IP, DECnet, orNamed Pipes, a user may now formulate and execute a search across local andremote data simultaneously.andM;The retrieval client issues a query to the Partition Server to search acrossremote databases.andP;  While the query executes on the Partition Server, theTOPIC retrieval client uses the desktop CPU resources to issue the same queryacross local data.andP;  The results of the queries are returned to the user asthey become available.andM;For database administrators, systems integrators and consultants, Verity hasdeveloped a command interpreter and &quot;English-like&quot; query language calledTOPIQL (pronounced `topical').andP;  TOPIQL allows other applications to performTOPIC queries as an integrated part of the application, without the need towrite `C' code.andM;The TOPIC SQL-Gateway is phase two of Verity's SQL-Bridge strategy to connectto enterprise-wide RDBMSs.andP;  Initially available for ORACLE on UNIX platforms,it allows TOPIC users to retrieve information directly from the RDBMS viaqueries composed using TOPIC retrieval clients.andM;The TOPIC SQL-Gateway automatically connects to the RDBMS server, translatesthe user's query into the necessary SQL commands to access data, and returnsthe values from the RDBMS to be displayed in the TOPIC interface.andM;With the release of TOPIC 3.0, Verity now supports the most widely-installedgraphical user interface platforms including Macintosh, Microsoft Windows3.0, IBM Presentation Manager for OS/2, OSF/Motif for the X Window System,and Sun Microsystems' SunView.andM;The new TOPIC user interface implements a common object metaphor whichexploits these GUI environments while maintaining the native look-and-feelspecifications of each environment.andP;  It supports clipboard operations, directmanipulation of objects, multiple selections, point and click, and draggingand dropping in of Topics.andM;TOPIC 3.0 implements a new TOPIC user interface paradigm which supportsdifferent interfaces for different types of users.andM;Three distinct query types provide the appropriate level of power andfunctionality for each type of user:  the Simple Query for the novice user,the Form Query for applications requiring a customized, structured approach,and the Topic Query for the expert/knowledge worker composing advancedqueries.andP;  Users simply point and click on the menu bar to select query type.andM;TOPIC 3.0's end-user interfaces also include a number of new, powerfulfeatures, including TOPIC Sources, Sorting, new retrieval capabilities andTopic-building Assists.andM;TOPIC 3.0 and TOPIC REAL-TIME run under VMS, UNIX, OS/2, DOS and Macintoshoperating systems and support all the major workstations and desktopcomputers.andP;  TOPIC supports network operating systems from Sun, DEC, IBM,Novell, 3Com, Banyan and Apple.andP;  TOPIC integrates with most word processing,technical publishing, and electronic mail systems, with support for 17 nativedocument formats.andM;TOPIC database servers are priced at $15,600 and go up to $150,000, dependingon the number of networked users, and the number of data sources in areal-time environment.andP;  TOPIC desktop retrieval clients are priced at $795and are available on IBM PCs and compatibles under DOS, the IBM PS/2 underOS/2, the Apple Computer Macintosh under MacOS, UNIX Workstations and VMSterminals.andM;TOPIC 3.0 will be available for all Verity supported platforms.andP;  TOPIC 3.0 isavailable as a free upgrade to customers covered under a customer support andmaintenance agreement.andP;  Optional features such as the TOPIC Partition Serverand TOPIC SQL-Gateway are available through Verity Consulting Services andare priced on a per installation basis.andM;Verity Inc. was founded in 1988 and is the fastest growing document retrievalcompany in the industry.andP;  Its TOPIC family of products are sold worldwidethrough a direct sales and service organization with offices in the UnitedStates, Canada, Europe and distributors around the world.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
