Introduction_Statutory and Regulatory Background </ITAG>Existing regulations, codified in the Rules and Regulations for the Federalsavings and loan system, provide for the conduct of federal associationreceiverships in Part 549. In addition, if the FSLIC is appointed as receiverfor a state chartered association pursuant to section 406(c)(1)(B) of theNational Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1729(c)(1)(B), the Board has by order andpursuant to section 406(c)(1)(B)(i)(II), 12 U.S.C. 1729(c)(1)(B)(i)(II),directed the receivership to operate under Part 549. If the FSLIC is appointedas receiver for a state chartered association pursuant to section 406(c)(2)of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1729(c)(2), the receiver operatesunder Part 569a of the Rules and Regulations for the Federal Savings andLoan Insurance Corporation. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4> of November 27, 1985 (50 FR 48970) the Boardproposed extensive revisions to its regulations covering the conservatorshipand receivership of Federal and other FSLIC insured institutions (``Proposal'').These proposed regulations have not been adopted in full, but selectedportions have been promulgated, such as the rules on priority of claims(53 FR 25129 (July 5, 1988), 53 FR 30665 (Aug. 15, 1988)). The Proposal contained a specific provision at 12 CFR 569c.8-1, concerningthe status of Federal Home Loan Banks (``Banks'') as secured creditors.This provision recognized that the Banks have a unique role as speciallenders to the thrift industry, and that this unique role entitles theBank to distinctive treatment on specific matters. Congress recognizedthis in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-86,section 306(d), 101 Stat. 552, 601-02 (``CEBA''), which added section 10(e)\1\<NOTE/> of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1430(e)\1\ (1988),to provide for the  priority of Federal Home Loan Bank security interestsover the claims and rights of any other party except those claims entitledto priority under otherwise applicable law and held by actual bona fidepurchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actualprotected interests. Since publication of the Proposal in 1985, there hasbeen a substantial increase in the number of thrift institutions that haveundergone liquidation and payment of insurance following the appointmentof a receiver, and it is reasonable to assume that this pace will continue.This increase in liquidating receivership insurance actions has presentedseveral additional concerns not addressed in the Proposal with respectto the Banks, including the concerns addressed in CEBA. Accordingly, theBoard has determined that it is desirable to adopt a regulation recognizingthe unique role of the Banks and setting forth expressly their rights vis-a-viscollateral securing Bank advances in situations in which a receiver isappointed, not to effect a purchase and assumption transaction, but toliquidate assets over time, accompanied by the FSLIC's payment of insuranceon accounts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Another subsection (e), concerning qualified thrift lenders,was also enacted in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Section 569c.8-1 Federal Home Loan Banks as Secured Creditors</ITAG>The following discussion summarizes the provisions of andSection; 569c.8-1.Paragraph (a) reiterates section 10(e) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Actadded by section 306(e) of CEBA and contemplates that the receiver shallrecognize the priority of the security interest of a Bank, subject to theexceptions set forth in section 10(e). Paragraph (b) recognizes that a Bank may in some cases acquire a securityinterest without taking possession of collateral; and paragraph (b) confirmsthat the Bank is entitled to take possession of collateral notwithstandingthat a receiver has been appointed. Paragraph (c) provides procedures for the liquidation of collateral securingBank advances when the Receiver does not enter into a purchase and assumptiontransaction. The Board has determined that the Banks, because of theirunique role, which is recognized by CEBA, should be entitled to certainprotections if a Receiver has been appointed and a purchase and assumptiontransaction has not occurred. To protect the interests of the Receiverand the Bank in the liquidation of assets serving as collateral for Bankadvances, the regulation provides that the receiver and the Bank shallattempt to develop a mutually agreeable plan for the payment of outstandingadvances and for the liquidation of collateral. If a plan cannot, in goodfaith, be developed or if, in the interim, adverse market changes are occurringwhich the Bank in good faith reasonably concludes could cause the collateralvalue to decrease to such an extent that the Bank's claim would not besatisfied in full, then the Bank may proceed to liquidate the collateral,provided it does so in good faith and in a commercially reasonable mannerand otherwise in accordance with applicable laws. Paragraph (d) implements section 10(d) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Actby permitting the Bank to require the deposit of additional or substitutedcollateral when deemed necessary for its protection, notwithstanding anyprovision of state law. It is similar to language contained in ProposedRegulation andSection; 569c.8-1(b). Paragraph (e) sets forth the circumstances under which the receiver shallhonor a claim for a prepayment fee by a Bank. Prepayment fees are an integralpart of the operations of the Banks, which may issue long term obligationsin order to make prudent long term advances to members. Because of thismatched funding, prepayment of long term advances can result in lossesto a Bank, depending upon reinvestment opportunities available at the timeof such prepayment. Accordingly, the paragraph provides for the allowanceof a prepayment fee to the Bank set forth in a written contract, providedthat the fee shall not exceed the present value of any economic loss sufferedby the Bank and the collateral is sufficient to pay in full the principaland interest due on secured advances and the applicable prepayment fee.The Board has deferred for later consideration whether it is appropriateto require the Bank to provide a discount to the receiver when the Bankwould realize an economic gain from the prepayment. This regulation, effective April 27, 1989, is being issued without thenotice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, andwithout the thirty (30) day period delayed effectiveness generally requiredby that Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), 553(d)(3) and in accordancewith the Board's regulations published at 12 CFR 508.11 and 508.14, theBoard finds good cause for waiving these requirements in the necessityto ensure the continuing provision of advances to the thrift industry onreasonable terms by the industry's special purpose lender. To ensure thisflow at a critical period for the industry, it is necessary that the Banksoperate with greater certainty concerning their rights with respect tocollateral securing advances. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis: 1. <T3>Need for and objectives of the rule. </T3>These elements are incorporatedabove in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2>regarding this final rule. 2. <T3>Issues raised by comments and agency assessment and response. </T3>Theseelements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>. 3. <T3>Significant alternatives minimizing small entity impact and agencyresponse. </T3>The Small Business Administration defines a small financialinstitution as ``a commercial bank or savings and loan association, theassets of which, for the preceding fiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.''13 CFR 121.13(a) (1988).
