The unscheduled DNA synthesisin the seedlings was determined autoradiographically on squashed preparationsof Vicis cracca root meristem cells. The plants from the experimentalfields exhibited a lower unscheduled DNA synthesis stimulated by acute{gamma}-irradiation than the control plants. Possible mechanisms of thisphenomenon are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
