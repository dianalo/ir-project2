 Significantlyrevamping an established column is perhaps even more so.andP;  After all, if itain't broke, why fix it?andP;  My answer to that comes from Tom Peters'sbest-seller Thriving on Chaos: &quot;If it ain't broke, you just haven't lookedhard enough.andP;  Fix it anyway.&quot;andM;My aim here is to make the old Spreadsheet Clinic even better--more relevant,more detailed, and more informative.andP;  Much of the time I'll continue thepopular reader submission format that has been the mainstay of SpreadsheetClinic all along.andP;  But you can also expect to see spreadsheets covered from avariety of angles.andM;I'll be looking at a greater variety of spreadsheet programs than we have inthe past (this is not simply a Lotus 1-2-3 column), at new add-ins and otheraccessories, and at new technologies.andP;  We'll investigate relationalspreadsheets, consider in detail what a third spreadsheet dimension can dofor you, and examine Microsoft's Excel for OS/2 and Presentation Manager,Borland's exciting new Quattro Pro, and much more.andP;  The first twoinstallments will probe the new features in 1-2-3, Release 3.andM;As always, a lively column depends on lively feedback from readers.andP;  Soplease keep those cards and letters (and disks) coming.andP;  This is still thebest place to share a brilliant macro or an ingenious workaround.andP;  And it'sstill the best place to get a question resolved.andP;  Naturally, we'll still payyou $50 for the items we publish, with a $25, bonus if you send them on adisk.andM;I've been using, writing about, and teaching others to use spreadsheetprograms since Apple II and VisiCalc days.andP;  I find them not only useful butinherently interesting, and I look forward to sharing my enthusiasm with youhere.andM;1-2-3--THE NEW RELEASEandM;The latest news in spreadsheets is that Lotus 1-2-3, Release 3, is finallyhere.andP;  Though the face is familiar, this is a very new spreadsheet, and thedifferences between Release 3 and its predecessor are pervasive and dramatic.andO;Nearly every aspect of the program has been strengthened in some way; inevery corner, on every menu, there are a number of new tools to learn anduse.andM;Release 3 lets you handle larger spreadsheet tasks than you could before anddispatch simple ones more efficiently.andP;  It allows you to generate graphs morequickly and keep them on-screen as you manipulate numbers.andP;  It gives youbroader control over the printing of worksheets and graphs.andM;The upgrade also gives you powerful new ways to extract and cross-tabulateinformation stored in data tables.andP;  You'll be able to perform relationaloperations on two or more tables at once, and (with the proper driver inplace) you cna reach out and touch information stored in external databasemanagement programs.andM;Getting to know Release 3 as intimately as you now know 2.01 or 1A will takesome time and effort.andP;  Fortunately, however, you can load your.andP;  WK1 or .WKSfiles directly, without a separate translation step, and learn the newfeatures as you continue working with your older files.andP;  Unless they dependon Release 2 add-ins, your existing applications will behave normally inRelease 3.andP;  Similarly, unless they make menu selections using cursormovements instead of letters, your macros should work without modification.andO;And all your ingrained keystroke habits will continue to serve you well.andM;To assist you in exploring Release 3, I'll be taking you on a tour of itsmost important new features in this and the next installment of Spreadsheets.andO;I'll certainly not be able to cover all there is to learn about Release 3;there will still be plenty for you to discover on your own--and in manyfuture installments of this column.andP;  But we will be able to get the highspots together.andM;INSTALLING RELEASE 3andM;Installation is a three-step process.andP;  In the first step, you must &quot;submit&quot;to a brief interrogation about your identity and that of your company.andP;  Thisis required by 1-2-3's new&quot;copy-discouragement&quot; scheme shown in Figure 1.andP;  Becareful: the names you supply will thereafter flash on-screen whenever youboot the program.andM;In the second step, you choose an operating system (OS/2, DOS, or both) andtarget path, and the appropriate files are transferred to your hard disk.andM;In the third step, after you've identified your display(s), printer(s), andspecified any country-dependent preferences, the install program copies therelevant drivers and creates a .DCF file--the functional equivalent of theSET files used by earlier versions.andP;  This done, you can quite INSTALL and getright to work.andM;As before, you can create multiple configuration files and run a nondefaultconfiguration by including its name on the DOS command line.andP;  Typing LOTUSODDBALL, for example, will get you the Release 3 Access System with theODD-VALL.DCF configuration in place.andP;  Unfortunately, however, the good folkin Cambridge still haven't provided a command-line switch to let you start1-2-3 and load a particular worksheet at once.andM;To read more on installing Release 3, see the sidebar &quot;Hardware Requirementsto Run Lotus 1-2-3, Release 3.&quot;andM;TWO INSTALLATION TIPSandM;You can set up two display types in any .DCF file.andP;  The /Worksheet WindowDisplay command then lets you switch between them.andP;  For example, if you workat a VGA, you can have 80 by 25 color, shown in Figure 2, as your standarddisplay, and use 80 by 34 (see Figure 3) or 80 by 60 color as an alternate.andM;The INSTALL program doesn't offer a &quot;Choose Alternate Display&quot; prompt,however, so it's eas to miss your opportunity.andP;  To install two displays,highlight the item describing your primary display and press the Spacebar.andP;  Anumber 1 should appear to the left of that item.andP;  Then highlight youralternate display and press the Spacebar again; a 2 will appear.andP;  Then pressIns.andM;Second, you may get bounced out of the installation program if you're using acache program that caches your A: drive as well as your hard disk.andP;  You won'tget any explanation for this behavior; instead, you'll get a message that ineffect assails your personal integrity.andP;  To solve the problem, temporarilyremove your cache software, reboot, and try again.andP;  Once you've finished theinstallation, you can put all your good stuff back in.andP;  (According to a Lotusspokesperson, this problem may also occur if you're using the DOS 4.01BUFFERS command with a look ahead parameter.)andM;Lotus's copy-discouragement scheme, incidentally, is designed to keep youfrom passing your distribution diskettes (or duplicates) to other users.andO;After you've installed Release 3, you can use normal DOS commands in order tomove it to a different directory or drive, and you can back it up the sameway you back up any other files.andP;  In short, the program is not copyprotected; it only looks that way.andM;EXPLORING THE THIRD DIMENSIONandM;The most important enhancement in Release 3--the one that will probablyaffect almost everything you do--is tits support for three-dimensionalworksheets.andP;  Figure 4 provides a sample screen.andP;  In Release 3, you're nolonger limited to a flat array of rows and columns.andP;  A.WK3 file starts out asan ordinary two-dimensional grid, but you can insert as many as 255additional grids, or sheets, into your file.andP;  Each sheet is identified by aletter, from A to IV, in the upper-left intersection of the row and columnheadings.andP;  The full address of any cell consists of the sheet letter,followed by a colon, followed by the column letter and the row number.andP;  Thus,the home cell of the file is no longer A1, but A:A1.andM;Going from Release 2 to Release 3 is pretty much like moving from ordinarytictac-toe to one of those three-level assemblies.andP;  The rules of the game are(mostly) the same, but you now have a lot of new possibilities to take intoaccount.andP;  Formulas, for example, can now reference cells on other sheets aswell as the current worksheet.andP;  A range argument for a formula or command cannow &quot;tunnel&quot; its way through several adjacent sheets, and so on.andM;In addition to this multisheet three-dimensionality, Release 3 also allowsyou to keep more than one file in memory at a time.andP;  In fact, you can have asmany files active at once as the size of your system (and your taste forcomplexity) permits.andP;  Formulas in one worksheet can reference cells in otherworksheets, and you can create such &quot;external&quot; references in POINT mode byusing the cursor keys to navigate to the target cells.andM;What can you do with a three-dimensional spreadsheet that you couldn't do intwo dimensions?andP;  Technically, nothing; but you can do everything you'vealways done more efficiently.andM;For example, put each of the functional components of a model--the table ofcontents, data, modeling logic, reports, and macros--on a separate sheetwithin a common file.andP;  You'll find it easier to locate and modify eachsection (each can be in the home corner of its sheet, for example), andyou'll never have to worry that adding or deleting rows or columns in onearea will destroy your work somehwere else.andM;Or, put analogous data in parallel, identically formatted sheets.andP;  This canbe data for individual time periods, divisions, departments, or whatever.andO;Any information that you need to see both broken out and consolidated is aperfect candidate for a three-dimensional spreadsheet.andP;  In order toconsolidate, just add a new sheet, either before or after the componentsheets, and write formulas that bore through the component stack.andM;Having component data lined up back to back in identically laid-out sheetsalso gives you valuable new ways to look at your data graphically.andP;  Forexample, if you track sales and expenses by quarter for each of a dozenstores in a dozen parallel worksheets, you can chart the COGS (cost of goodssold) by store for any given quarter just by specifying a data range thatincludes the same cell location in each parallel sheet.andM;Release 3's GROUP mode makes it easy to set up parallel sheets.andP;  With GROUPmode enabled, you can make layout and formatting changes to the current sheetthat will be duplicated in every other sheet in the current file.andP;  Row andcolumn additions and deletions will affect all sheets in the file, as willany settings made using the commands listed in Figure 5.andM;Note that when GROUP mode is not in effect,/Worksheet Global settings applyto the current sheet only.andP;  There is no/Universal commands as such: the wayto format all sheets simultaneously is to use/Worksheet Global Group Enable.andM;Also be aware that when you enable GROUP mode, all format, column-width, andprotection settings--not just changes you make subsequently--will be copiedfrom the current sheet to every other sheet in the file.andP;  Therefore, if sheetA is set up the way you want it and sheets B through E are not, be sure youare on A when you enable GROUP mode.andP;  Otherwise, in your eagerness to makeyour sheets consistent, you'll wind up making your only good sheet look justlike one of your four bad ones.andM;Should you happen to make that blunder, however, you can recover instantly bypressing Alt-F4 only if you have previously enabled Release 3's Undocapability.andP;  The Undo feature lets you reverse your last formatting orediting move.andP;  How much memory it uses depends on the complexity of thatmost-recent move.andP;  The default setting for Undo is off, but you can turn iton at any point by choosing/Worksheet Global Default Other Undo Enable.andP;  Ifyou find that you seldom hit the memory limits of your system, you might wantto change the default Undo setting from off to on.andP;  To do that, enable Undoand then invoke the /Worksheet Global Default Update command.andM;LINKING WORKSHEET FILESandM;Release 3's &quot;linked file&quot; capability also provides possibilities that maychange the way you work.andP;  For example, you could put values that are subjectto change in a worksheet by themselves, apart from the contexts in whichthey're applied.andP;  This way, if you create many forecasting models based on acommon set of economic assumptions, the linked-file approach will obviate theneed to go searching through a lot of separate worksheets when you reviseyour premises.andP;  (Even without using linked files, you'll find Release 3's new/Range Search command a godsend.andP;  It lets you do a search and replace muchthe way you do in a word processor.)andM;File linking can also help you work around memory limitations.andP;  The target ofan external reference (a formula that gets a value from a cell in anotherfile) does not have to be present in memory.andP;  It can be in a disk file,provided you have given 1-2-3 enough information to find it.andP;  Thus, bydividing your work into modules contained in separate files, you can create amodel that would be too large to fit in memory all at once.andM;Release 3's ability to keep many files open in memory at once makes itpossible to create and maintain a general-purpose macro library.andP;  No longerdo you have to copy the macros you use every day from one worksheet toanother.andP;  Just create a separate file for your everyday macros and keep thatfile in memory whenever you work.andP;  (You can make the macro library appear inmemory automatically at each working session by naming it AUTO-123.WK3.)andP;  Butmore about macros later.andM;INSERTING NEW WORKSHEETS AND FILESandM;With the new upgrade, inserting a new worksheet into a file is almost exactlylike inserting a new row or column.andP;  Just use /Worksheet Insert Sheet, thentell 1-2-3 how many new sheets you want and whether you want them insertedahead of or behind the current sheet.andP;  all sheets behind the insertion getrelettered, and all references are updated appropriately.andM;Inserting a new file involves a slightly different procedure: You start byusing /File New.andP;  1-2-3 prompts you for a filename and proposes FILE0001 thefirst time you do this.andP;  You can accept the dummy filename and give it a realname later, when you save.andM;To bring in a file from disk without overwriting the current file, you use/File Open Before or /File Open After.andP;  If the file you name is already inmemory, 1-2-3 beeps; you can't open multiple instances of a given file.andM;To bring in a file from disk that does replace the current file, you use thegood old /File Retrieve.andP;  The good old caution is in order, too: there'sstill no warning prompt if you use /File Retrieve to overwrite unsaved work.andO;(Release 3 does warn you if you're about to lose work by quitting or using/Worksheet Erase, however.)andM;To remove a sheet or file, use /worksheet Delete Sheet or /Worksheet DeleteFile (there's no /File Close comand).andP;  Again be warned: 1-2-3 assumes youknow what you're doing and will not keep you from throwing away unsaved work.andM;NAVIGATING IN THREE DIMENSIONSandM;Releaes 3 provides a number of new keystroke combinations to help younavigate from worksheet to worksheet and file to file.andP;  These are worthexploring in a bit more detail.andM;Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn move you forward and backward, respectively, fromsheet to sheet.andP;  For example, if you're working in a file with three sheetsand you're currently on sheet A, pressing Ctrl-PgUp takes you to sheet B.andO;Pressing the same combination again takes you on to sheet C.andP;  Ctrl-PgDn movesyou back the other way.andM;If you're in GROUP mode, Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn take you from sheet to sheeton the same cell.andP;  That is, if you're on A:E7, Ctrl-PgUp takes you to B:E7.andO;If you're not in GROUP mode, each time you move to the next sheet, you landon the cell you last occupied in that sheet.andM;If you have two or more files in memory, Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn can alsomove you between files.andP;  If you're on the last sheet in the first file, forexample, Ctrl-PgUp delivers you to the first sheet of the second file.andM;End Ctrl-PgUp and End Ctrl-PgDn move you along the third dimension to theends and beginnings of data blocks in just the way End works with the variouscursor arrows on a two-dimensional sheet.andP;  End Ctrl-PgUp, for example, movesyou forward (in ascending alphabetical order) through a stack of sheets tothe next intersection of a blank and nonblank cell.andM;To get to the first cell in the current file (cell A:A1), press Ctrl-Home.andO;To get to the last cell in the current file, press End Ctrl-Home.andP;  Note thatEnd Ctrl-Home is exactly analogous to End Home in Release 2.andP;  The last cellit moves you to is the intersection of the last nonblank row, last nonblankcolumn, and last nonblank sheet.andM;So far, the new keystrokes in Release 3 are rather intuitive extensions ofthe navigational keys in Release 2.andP;  Moving directly from file to file may bea little tougher.andP;  The key combinations for moving to the first and lastfiles in memory, respectively, are Ctrl-End Home (easily confused with EndCtrl-Home) and Ctrl-End End.andP;  For moving to the next and previous file, thekeystrokes are Ctrl-End Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-End Ctrl-PgDn, respectively.andM;If you find these combinations monstrous, you aren't alone.andP;  But not toworry: you can use the F5 (GOTO) key to move from file to file just as youuse it to move from point to point within a file.andP;  When you press F5 followedby F3 (NAMES), Release 3 gives you a list of all named ranges in the currentfile, followed by the names of all other files in memory.andP;  The filenames areenclosed in double angle brackets, for example, andless;andless;FILE1andgt;andgt;, andless;andless;FILE2andgt;andgt;, and soon.andP;  And, as in Release 2, you can press F3 a second time to get afull-screen list instead of a one-liner.andM;If you typically work with several files at once, you'll probably want totrade in Release 3's clock display, at the lower-left corner of the screen,for a display of the current filename.andP;  You can do that by using /WorksheetGlobal Default Other Filename.andP;  To make the change permanent, use the Updatecommand, as well.andM;PERSPECTIVE VIEW AND ZOOMINGandM;The new /Worksheet Window Perspective command divides the screen into threepanels, so you see parts of three sheets at once.andP;  These may be three sheetsfrom the same file or, for example, the last two sheets of one file and thefirst of another.andP;  To return to the normal full-screen perspective, you use/Worksheet Window Clear.andM;Unfortunately, the new Release of 1-2-3 doesn't let you change the positionor size of perspective windows.andP;  (Perhaps the upcoming Presentation Managerversion, referred to in the press as 1-2-3/G, will do that).andP;  But you canzoom the current window back out to full-screen dimensions while remaining inperspective view by pressing Alt-F6.andP;  Press the same combination again tounzoom.andM;WRITING EXTERNAL REFERENCESandM;Referencing cells on other sheets within a file is exactly like referencingcells on the same sheet.andP;  That is, you can use POINT mode or you can type thecell's name or address.andP;  If you type the address, be sure to include thesheet letter followed by a colon; if you omit the sheet letter, 1-2-3automatically inserts the letter of the current sheet.andM;Referencing cells in other files in memory is almost as simple.andP;  Again, youcan use POINT mode or type.andP;  If you type, begin the cell reference with thefilename enclosed in double angles.andP;  For example:andM;@AVG (andless;andless;WESTERN.WK3andgt;andgt; OVERHEAD, andless;andless;CENTRAL .WK3andgt;andgt; OVERHEAD, andless;andless;EASTERN.WK3andgt;andgt;OVERHEAD)andM;Obviously, unless you really love typing, POINT mode is the way to go.andP;  TheF3 key will help you find your target.andP;  Press F3 once or twice, highlight thefilename you want, and press Enter.andP;  1-2-3 puts the filename (complete withpath) into the formula and changes the F3 display to list all defined rangesin the selected file.andP;  At this point, you can type in a cell address orselect a name from the list.andM;There is one case in which typing an external reference is easier thanpointing to it.andP;  If the target has a unique name, you can type andless;andless;?andgt;andgt; NAME,(where NAME is that unique name), and 1-2-3 will fill in the appropriatefilename--again, complete with path.andM;Once the target of an external reference is in memory, the referenced cell isrecalculated the same way any other kind of reference is recalculated.andP;  Thatis, with automatic recalc on, it is updated any time the target cell or oneof its antecedents is modified.andP;  With manual recalc on, it gets recalculatedwhenever you press F9.andP;  (Note that Release 3 performs minimal recalculationin automatic mode, updating only those formulas that might be affected by anew entry or edit.)andM;If the target of an external reference is not in memory, matters are a littledifferent.andP;  The referenced cell then is updated when you use the /File AdminLink-Refresh command; use /File Dir or /Worksheet Global Default Dir; changethe default file extension with /Worksheet Global Default Ext Save.andO;(provided for those who normally want to save files in .WK1 format); or bringthe target file back into memory with /File Open.andM;COPYING IN 3-DandM;By now you probably have enough of a feel for three-dimensionality to realizethat it opens up new possibilities for the versatile /Copy command.andP;  Forexample, you can replicate a block of cells from one sheet to each of manysheets by specifying a target range that defines the upper-left corner of theblock in each target sheet.andP;  This, of course, is a straightforward extensionof the Release 2 copy command, but there are several points worthy of specialmention.andM;First, the issue of absolute versus relative reference now applies to theworksheet as well as to the row and column.andP;  That means you now have eightkinds of reference to play with: absolute, relative, and six species ofmixed.andP;  In its potential for confusion and creativity, this represents aquantum leap.andP;  (As usual, the default is absolutely relative, and you cancycle through all the possibilities by tapping F4 in EDIT mode.)andM;Second, when copying relative formulas from sheet to sheet or file to file,remember that 1-2-3 will try to update those formulas to suit the newlocations.andP;  If all you want to replicate are end results, convert formulas tovalues first with /Range Value.andP;  (Fortunately, you no longer have to convertformulas to values when doing a /Range Transpose; Release 3 makes thisconversion for you automatically.)andM;PRINTING FEATURES AND COMMANDSandM;Earlier this year, Lotus acquired the rights to the technology used in FunkSoftware's Allways add-in for Release 2.andP;  Allways is a WYSIWYG publishingutility that lets you assign fonts and sizes to individual ranges, intermixgraphics with numbers, deploy shading and rules in various densities andthicknesses, and generally dress up your work for a trip to the boardroom orprinting press.andM;Lotus has promised to incorporate these features into 1-2-3, but they're notthere yet.andP;  Release 3's changes in the printing department leave it wellshort of desktop publishing, but they do bring about improvement in thefollowing areas:andM;* Printing now takes place in the background, so you can continue working.andM;* You can establish, suspend, resume, and cancel a print queue, as well ascontrol the position of new jobs entered into the queue.andM;* You can choose most of the printing attributes you're likely toneed--including font, pitch, line spacing, orientation, and color--from/Print menu commands.andP;  You can also still enter a setup string when you needit.andM;* You can name and reuse any combination of print settings in much the sameway as you name graphs.andM;* You can print graphs from the /Print menu, and you can control the density,size, scale, and orientation of those graphs.andM;* You can select from a list of installed printers.andM;* Additional header and footer codes let you start page numbering at aspecified number and link header and footer text to worksheet labels.andM;* You can now print the worksheet frame (the row and column headings).andM;The first thing you'll notice on the top-level /Print menu is an item labeledEncoded.andP;  Since Release 3 lets you print graphics and encourages you toassign fonts, sizes, and other attributes to particular worksheet elements,it also includes options for printing formatted (encoded) files as well asplain text files.andP;  So where before there were two choices--Printer andFile--at the portal to the print-setting commands, now there are three.andM;Other new top-level items include Suspend, Resume, and Cancel.andP;  These areused for general queue management and error recovery.andP;  (Another vitalqueue-management command, Priority, applies to specific jobs and thus liesdeeper in the menu tree.)andP;  If your printer runs out of paper or is takenoff-line in mid-queue, Release 3 displays an error message at the bottom ofyour screen.andP;  It does not go into ERROR mode (you can keep on working) but itdisplays the message continuously until you attend to the problem.andP;  When youdo, you can get things going again by using /Print Resume.andP;  If you want tobreak into the stream yourself (to change ribbons, for example), you can use/Print Suspend.andP;  And to abort whatever remains in the queue, there's /PrintCancel.andM;Fonts, pitch, orientation, line-spacing, and colors are all selected withcommands under /Print [E,F,P] Options Advanced.andP;  Fonts are numbered on themenu from 1 to 8, according to the general scheme shown in Figure 6.andP;  You canexamine just how this translates into output from your printer by using/Print Printer Sample Go.andP;  The printout generated by this command includes aworksheet example, a graph example, and a list of all current print settings.andO;The text and graphics will show you just what the currently selected printercan do and how its attributes are keyed to Release 3's/Print commands.andM;Fonts can be applied separately to the header, footer, border, frame, andprint range.andP;  To output different ranges in different fonts, you have toqueue them up as separate print jobs.andM;Colors are selected by number (from 1 to 8), and they can also be verifiedwith the sample printout.andP;  Colors apply to the whole print job, with oneexception.andP;  If you format negative numbers on the worksheet so that they aredisplayed in red, those numbers will be printed in red (your printerpermitting), while the rest of the job is in black.andM;You have three pitch options (standard, compressed, and expanded), twoline-spacing options (standard and compressed), and two orientation options(the customary portrait and landscape).andM;To name the current constellation of print settings (with or without aspecified print range), you use /Print [E,F,P] Options Name Create.andP;  To reusea named set, the command is /Print [E,F,P] Options Name Use.andP;  Unfortunately,Release 3 does not provide a straightforward way to create aworksheet-independent library of print settings.andM;To print a graph, you use /Print [E,F,P] Image Current or /Print [E,F,P]Image Named-Graph.andP;  Printing a graph is pretty much like printing a worksheetrange.andP;  You can put a graph and a worksheet range on the same page (assumingthey will fit) by queueing up the two without a form feed between them.andM;After specifying a graph to print, you can wander farther down the tree to/Print [E,F,P] Options Advanced Image and use the commands there to rotate,scale, or change density.andP;  Rotating the graph means switching it fromportrait to landscape; you can't flip or tilt it by 45 degrees.andP;  Densityoptions are final and draft.andP;  And the scaling options are Length-Fill,Margin-Fill, and Reshape.andP;  Length-Fill and Margin-Fill maintain aspect ratiowhile stretching the image to fill page length or page width, respectively.andO;Reshape lets you enter your own length and width values.andM;MACROS IN RELEASE 3andM;Enhancements in the macro department include the ability to invoke macros bymenu (which allows you to surpass the 27-macro limit), the ability to createmacro library files, a record feature (of rather limited utility), some newkeystroke commands (including a very useful &quot;internal&quot; keystroke), and ninenew programming verbs.andP;  The /X commands are still supported by the program.andM;Unfortunately,  there is still no debugging facility.andP;  You can trace, asalways, but you can't set breakpoints or watch particular variables.andM;Macros no longer must be named \X and invoked via the Alt key.andP;  You can nowpress Alt-F3 and get a horizontal menu of all named ranges.andP;  If you press F3and second time the horizontal menu goes full screen.andP;  Just select the macroyou want to run, and off it goes.andP;  Nor does the macro have to be in thecurrent file; anywhere in memory will do.andP;  That means you can create alibrary of macros for easing the everyday burdens of worksheet building justby keeping that file in memory whenever you work.andM;Of course, you can still use the standard 27 \X names as well, and these canstill be invoked by the appropriate Alt-letter combinations.andP;  These can alsobe stored on any active sheet: as long as the name is unique, 1-2-3 will findit by searching the active files in order, starting with the current file.andM;The macro recording feature in Release 3 is incorporated into ageneral-purpose keystroke backup facility that continually keeps track ofyour keystrokes.andP;  A buffer holds your most recent 512 strokes (actually 512bytes, which isn't always the same thing).andP;  You can play back some or all ofthis buffer, or copy a selection from it to any spot on the worksheet at anytime.andM;To get at the buffer, you press Alt-F2.andP;  That summons a four-item menu:Playback, Copy, Erase, and Step.andP;  If you're starting a macro-recordingsession, you begin by erasing the buffer.andP;  Then you carry out your macrosteps on the worksheet, after which you go back to the buffer, copy yourkeystrokes to the appropriate worksheet range, name your creation, make anynecessary edits, and add the appropriate commentary.andM;You don't really have to start by erasing the keystroke buffer.andP;  If youdecide while you're working that the maneuver you just executed would make ahandy macro, you can go to the buffer and select just the keystrokes you wantto copy for your macro.andM;Either way, the mechanism is smart enough to wrap the copied keystrokes downthrough consecutive cells in a column, and it's smart enough to condensekeystrokes where possible.andP;  (15 up-arrows, for example, will be recorded as{U 15}).andP;  Unfortunately, however, when cursor moves are used to define rangearguments for functions, the recorder converts them to fixed addresses.andO;Thus, to make a general-purpose macro to do something as simple as sum acolumn of numbers, you have to edit what the recorder feature produces.andM;The new keystroke names include the internal keystroke {CE}, which stands for&quot;clear entry.&quot;andP;  This handy token clears away any prompt that may appear onthe edit line in response to a command--that is, the current default value.andO;In a way, it's similar to {Esc}.andP;  But where {Esc} mimics the Escape keyexactly, {CE} wipes off the edit line regardless of how many separate {Esc}smight be needed.andP;  (See the sidebar &quot;Advanced Macro Commands.&quot;)andM;One other point should be made about the new macros: the Release 3 add-infacility (formally called the Lotus Development Environment) allowsdevelopers to expand the macro language, to add new @ functions, and tocreate resident applications.andP;  So it's a pretty sure bet we'll be seeing someinteresting third-party macro products this time around.andM;I'll keep close tabls on this in upcoming issues, as well as take a muchcloser look at Release 3 macros than is possible at this point.andM;FILE INTEGRITY IN A MULTIUSER CONTEXTandM;Release 3 was designed from the beginning to be used in a wide assortment ofcomputing environments, from standalone AT-class machines to full-blownmainframes.andP;  LANs and other multiuser contexts figured prominently in Lotus'splanning.andP;  As the last topic in Part 1 of this column, then, let's brieflyconsider the new features that have to do specifically with protecting fileson networks.andM;In addition to ordinary password protection under/File Save, which isavailable in Release 2, Release 3 offers two new means of ensuring fileintegrity in multiuser environments: the /File Admin Seal commands and asystem of reservations.andP;  Let's look first at the reservation system.andM;The reservation system is designed to keep users from overwriting eachother's changes to a file when the file is in use at several network nodes.andO;Each file has only one reservation, and only the user who owns thereservation can save the file.andP;  Any attempts to save a file without thereservation generates a polite error message.andM;Who gets the reservation is determined in part by the file's &quot;reservationsetting,&quot; which may be either automatic or manual.andP;  If the setting isautomatic (the default), the first user to read the file into memory isautomatically awarded the reservation.andP;  Users who subsequently load that filewill see the legend RO (read-only) at the bottom of their screens.andP;  (Thisindicator also appears when you use /File Retrieve or /File Open to load afile that has been given read-only status by some other means--the networksoftware, for example, or the ATTRIB command.)andM;If the reservation setting is manual, the file will always be marked RO whenloaded into memory, no matter who opens it.andP;  In this case, however, you cantry to get the reservation by using /File Admin Reservation Get.andP;  Ifavailable, it's yours.andM;The reservation may be unavailable for either of two reasons: someone elsemay own it; or you may no longer have a current version of the file.andO;(Someone else may have written the file to disk subsequent to your readingit).andP;  Error messages tell you which is the case; if your version is no longercurrent, you can just use /File Retrieve to reload it and try again to claimthe reservation.andM;If you own a file's reservation you can relinquish it by means of /File AdminReservation Release.andP;  In response you'll be greeted with the RO symbol.andM;The second set of safeguards, the /File Admin Seal commands, are designed toprotect certain aspects of a file from change.andP;  There are two commands: /FileAdmin Seal Reservation-Setting and /File Admin Seal File.andP;  Both acceptcase-sensitive passwords of up to 15 characters.andM;The /File Admin Seal Reservation-Setting locks up only the file's reservationsetting; no other aspect of the file is affected.andP;  To change the reservationsetting after this has been done, you must first use /File Admin Seal Disableand reenter the correct password.andM;The /File Admin Seal File Prevents changes (alterations, deletions, oradditions) to these file components: the reservation setting; the graphnames; the range names; all range notes; all formatting, both global andlocal; all range-protection settings; all column widths, local and global;all hidden columns or worksheets.andM;You may still alter the data in a sealed file, and, of course, you may removethe wraps by using /File Admin Seal Disable and reentering the correctpassword.andM;Next time we will take a look together at the new graphics features, the newand enhanced database features, and the new worksheet functions in Release 3.andO;Finally, I'll wrap it up with a discussion of whether or not an upgrade isworth the effort.andM;SEND US YOUR HINTS,andM;TIPS AND QUESTIONSandM;Share your latest spreadsheet discovery through Spreadsheets.andP;  We'll pay $50or more for tips we print, plus an extra $25 if you submit your letteron-disk.andP;  If you do, please include a printed copy.andP;  Mail contributions toSpreadsheets, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016, or uploadthem to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in the Utilities column).andM;HARDWARE REQUIREMENTSandM;TO RUN LOTUS 1-2-3, RELEASE 3andM;Lotus 1-2-3, Relcase 3, requires an 80286 or 80386 microprocessor and about3.5MB of hard disk space.andP;  You can run it under either DOS (3.0 or later) orOS/2 (1.0 or 1.1).andP;  The INSTALL program asks which OS you plan to use; if youwant, you can set it up to run under both systems.andM;Although Release 3's commands are the same under both operating systems,memory management is different.andP;  Under DOS, Release 3 supports extendedmemory to 16MB, plus an additional 8MB of LIM 3.2 or 32MB of LIM 4.0 expandedmemory.andP;  In other words, if you have the chips and your box can take theheat, you can put a whopping 48MB on-line under DOS (Lotus has actuallytested a worksheet that fills this galactic space).andP;  Under OS/2, the limitsare 16MB of extended memory plus an impressive 128MB of local or remotevirtual memory.andM;As for minima, if you're using DOS, you need at least 1MB.andP;  For OS/2, thenominal requirement is 3MB, but Lotus recommends 4MB.andP;  DOS users, note thatthe 1MB requirement means 640K plus at least 384K of extended memory.andP;  Ifyou're running a 640K system with a 384K expanded memory card, you need toreconfigure the expanded memory as extended.andP;  And if you have only 384K ofextended memory, you need to remove any cache or RAMdisk software from yoursystem; you must have at least 384K of unencumbered extended memory.andM;EXTENDED OR EXPANDED?andM;To get the best possible performance, DOS users should configure as muchmemory as possible as extended, not expanded.andP;  Thanks to Rational Systems'DOS extender technology, the DOS version of Release 3 sees conventional andextended memory as a single linear address space, much the same way as theOS/2 version does.andP;  Using expanded memory, on the other hand, entailsfrequent remapping, which chews up clock cycles.andM;Obviously, if you run other programs that require expanded memory, you'regoing to need to split your unconventional memory between extended andexpanded.andP;  If possible, give Release 3 at least 1MB of extended memory towork with.andP;  That way, 1-2-3 can park all of itself in extended memory,leaving almost all your conventional memory available for operations at thesecondary DOS command prompt.andP;  In other words, with 1MB of extended memory onhand, you cna start Release 3 at the beginning of a day and zip out to DOSwith /System any time you need to run another application.andP;  You will stillhave enough conventional memory available to run, say, a full-featured wordprocessor without quitting 1-2-3.andM;Programs that use 80386 extended memory to emulate expanded memory are OKwith Release 3, provided they're compatible with the Virtual Control ProgramInterface.andP;  (For further discussion of VCPI, see Ray Duncan's PowerProgramming column in the June 27, 1989, issue.)andP;  The list of compatiblesincludes Quarterdeck Office Systems' QEMM-386 and DESQ-view 386, Compaq'sCEMM, and Qualitas' 386-to-the-Max.andP;  One prominent incompatible program isMicrosoft Windows/386.andP;  If you depend on an EMS emulator and you're not sureabout its status relative to the VCPI, you might want to consult the vendorbefore you spring for Release 3.andM;ADVANCED MACROandM;COMMANDSandM;{APPENDBELOW} copies data to the bottom of a target range, expanding thetarget range to include the incoming data.andP;  This command is useful should youneed to add records to a database under macro control.andM;{APPENDRIGHT} is analogous to {APPENDBELOW}.andP;  You can use it to add fields toa database.andM;{SYSTEM} shells to the operating system and executes a specified command.andP;  Ontermination of the command, control is returned to Lotus 1-2-3; the user doesnot have to type EXIT.andP;  You can use @INFO in conjunction with this command toverify the successful completion of the operating system command.andM;{FORM} suspends macro execution and allows the user to enter data into aspecified range.andP;  Similar to /Range Input but much more powerful, {FORM}gives you precise control over the user's keystrokes.andP;  An optional call-tableargument lets you tie any number of command sequences to specific userkeystrokes.andP;  Two other (mutually exclusive) optional arguments let you listuser keystrokes that will be allowed or ignored.andM;{BREAK} returns the user from a command to READY mode.andM;{FRAMEON} and {FRAMEOFF} control the display of the worksheet frame (the rowand column legends).andM;{GRAPHON} presents a full-screen display of the current graph or makes anamed graph current (optionally displaying it).andM;{GRAPHOFF} removes a {GRAPHON} display.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
