Michael Dukakis accusedrival Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt today oftrying to impose ``a $50 billion burden on the nation's economy''with an oil import fee and ``duck-and-hide'' trade barriers.   Dukakis, barnstorming across Texas in quest of the biggest SuperTuesday primary prize of 183 delegates, defended his own oppositionto an oil import fee, which many in the ailing Texas oil industryhave hoped for.   On a visit to MP Industries, a successful small business thatmakes rubber parts for oil field drills, Dukakis said the Missouricongressman wants to return the United States to ``policies thatalmost destroyed us 50 years ago.''   ``If we adopt Congressman Gephardt's policies, we'll have atrade war, and nobody benefits from a trade war,'' said Dukakis.   ``There's always somebody around who suggests that: throw up thewalls, hunker down,'' he said. Dukakis claimed his administrationwould foster ``a competitive America, one that doesn't duck andhide but stands up and competes with the best of them.''   An oil import fee ``will put a $50 billion burden on thisnation's economy. We don't need that,'' said the governor, whofavors creating incentives for small oil producers to startdrilling again, repealing of the oil windfall tax, filling theStrategic Petroleum Reserve, and increasing natural gas production.   Dukakis was traveling across Texas today, from East Texas toCorpus Christi to border towns to Houston and on to West Texas inhis campaign for votes in next Tuesday's primaries in 20 states.   On Wednesday, Dukakis promised to fight to make all Americanworkers eligible for basic health insurance on the job. He tolduninsured workers at a free clinic in Tampa, Fla., ``It is verydisturbing to meet American families who literally don't have adime of basic health insurance.   ``If they or their youngsters have to go to the hospital, theydon't know how they're going to pay those bills. ... '' he said.``It's just unconscionable.''   Back home, the Massachusetts House passed a Dukakis plan toforce employers with six or more workers to provide healthinsurance. The state Senate is expected to follow suit within twoweeks.   Dukakis predicted Massachusetts' example will pave the way for asimilar federal breakthrough, four decades after Harry Trumanproposed national health insurance.   Thirty-seven million Americans are uninsured, he said. ``It'stime we decided in this country that one of the things you getalong with your wages is basic health insurance.''   He claimed it could be done without ``creating a big newbureaucratic program. ... This will not cost the federal Treasury adime.''   Asked how small businesses could afford it, Dukakis said mostbusinesses already provide insurance, and indirectly pay ``a hiddensurcharge'' to cover hospitals' costs of treating the uninsured.   Richard Posada, 32, a Tampa carpet installer who makes $18,000 ayear, told Dukakis he went without insurance when he found it wouldcost him $240 a month.   ``It's a gamble,'' said Posada. Then he found the JudeoChristian Health Clinic here, where care for his wife and twotoddlers is free. ``They've treated us real nice here,'' the carpetlayer said.   Dale Smith, a lawn worker with high blood pressure and noinsurance, told the candidate, ``This place has been a realblessing to me.''   Dukakis said if all workers had insurance, ``we'd have clinicslike this springing up all over the place.''   The Massachusetts bill will cost the state $100 million,including aid for hospitals hit by big debts for indigent care.   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts governor began airing a newtelevision commercial attacking rival Rep. Richard Gephardt andmocking Gephardt's populist slogan, ``It's your fight too.''   The advertisement says Gephardt is taking campaign contributionsfrom ``big establishment power brokers'' and adds: ``Kinda makesyou wonder, is Dick Gephardt fighting your fight or theirs?''   In Miami, where he was endorsed by the president of theembattled Machinists' union at ailing Eastern Airlines, Dukakissaid, ``I hope I'll be the candidate who emerges from Super Tuesdaywith the largest number of cumulative delegate votes.   ``If we can do that, then I think we're going to be steaminginto Illinois and we're going to be on our way to the nomination,''said Dukakis.   Dukakis did Wednesday what a lot of visitors to Florida do thistime of year: visit a baseball spring training camp.   But unlike ordinary tourists, Dukakis actually got to stand inthe Boston Red Sox batting cage in Winter Haven for a turn at bat.In 10 swings against a batting practice pitcher, the onetimecatcher on the Brookline, Mass., High School freshman team hitthree foul balls, a pop into the cage and five grounders; andfanned once.</TEXT></DOC>
