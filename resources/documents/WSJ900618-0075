Siegel was sentenced to twomonths in prison for his crimes.   In imposing the lenient sentence, U.S. District JudgeRobert J. Ward said that the two securities fraud-relatedfelony counts to which Mr. Siegel pleaded guilty in February1987 were &quot;serious.&quot; But Judge Ward added that Mr. Siegel's&quot;cooperation, his contrition and his candor under difficultcircumstances&quot; prompted him to order a much lighter sentencethan many had expected. Mr. Siegel could have been sentencedto as long as 10 years in prison.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Ward also noted that the government's position, putforth in a sentencing memo released on Friday, was &quot;nottypical.&quot; The government, in its memo and in court, praisedMr. Siegel as a &quot;credible and reliable&quot; witness whocooperated despite &quot;an intense campaign of villification.&quot;The government said the assistance of the 42-year-old Mr.Siegel enabled prosecutors to learn about wrongdoing theywould not otherwise have uncovered.   The sentencing of Mr. Siegel, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.'sformer chief takeover strategist, ended a saga that began onNov. 14, 1986, when a federal marshal thrust a subpoena intoMr. Siegel's hands relating to his dealings with Ivan F.Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator. Mr. Boesky'scooperation, which began the insider trading investigation,led the government to Mr. Siegel.   Mr. Siegel began cooperating with the government andeventually pleaded guilty to exchanging insider informationwith Mr. Boesky and with Robert M. Freeman, the former headof arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Mr. Siegel also paidmore than $9 million in fines.   Mr. Siegel's cooperation proved a bonanza for thegovernment. The Kidder unit agreed in June 1987 to pay $25.3million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission chargesin connection with Mr. Siegel's actions. The government alsodisclosed for the first time in its sentencing memo thatleads provided by Mr. Siegel resulted in the conviction lastyear of five officials of Princeton/Newport Partners and aformer Drexel trader on racketeering and other charges.   Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty last August to one felonycount. Mr. Freeman, who had long denied that he had doneanything wrong, admitted to using inside information receivedfrom Mr. Siegel in connection with the proposed takeover ofBeatrice Cos. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. In April, Mr.Freeman was sentenced to four months in jail.   The government has said the crime to which Mr. Freemanpleaded guilty was one of many he committed. But untilFriday, the government hadn't elaborated on Mr. Freeman'sother alleged misdeeds. In its memo, the government said thatbeginning in 1984, Messrs. Freeman and Siegel passed insideinformation to each other about companies involved in &quot;atleast twelve takeover situations.&quot;   The government also said that Mr. Siegel provided credibleinformation about a 1985 telephone call in which Mr. Siegelreceived a tip from Mr. Freeman about Unocal Corp. Mr. Siegelthen ordered Kidder traders to buy securities based on thattip. The government said in the memo that it also seized atape from Princeton/Newport on which Mr. Freeman is heardgiving that defunct firm similar information about Unocal.   On Friday, Mr. Freeman's attorneys continued to deny thathe had engaged in further wrongdoing. &quot;Mr. Freeman has takenand passed a lie detector test on his statements that noillicit arrangement with Siegel ever existed and that henever deliberately gave Siegel confidential information tohelp Siegel make a trading decision,&quot; the attorneys, PaulCurran and Robert Fiske Jr., said in a statement.   According to individuals familiar with the drafting of thegovernment's memo, Messrs. Curran and Fiske successfullysought to block the government from including more detailsabout Mr. Freeman's actions. Those details were included in aprobation report that was not made public. Mr. Currandeclined to comment.   Mr. Siegel had accepted $700,000 in cash payments from Mr.Boesky in 1983 and 1984 in exchange for information heprovided to Mr. Boesky. Judge Ward noted that the profits ofMr. Boesky, who recently completed a three-year prison term,totaled $30 million.   &quot;After Mr. Boesky received a three-year sentence {in1987}, I began to think about Mr. Siegel,&quot; Judge Ward said.&quot;At that time, I was of the view that&quot; a prison term of &quot;18months to two years would be reasonable&quot; for Mr. Siegel.   Judge Ward said that in the &quot;intervening period, I wasadvised that the government wished to defer Mr. Siegel'ssentence because of his cooperation.&quot; Largely because of thatcooperation, Judge Ward decided that Mr. Siegel should serve&quot;a sentence less than imposed on Mr. Freeman,&quot; who hasrefused to cooperate with the government.   Legal experts say that Judge Ward is likely to be attackedfor the lenient sentence. Jed Rakoff, an attorney for Mr.Siegel, said: &quot;The sentence was fair and just and reflectedvery well on the degree to which Judge Ward immersed himselfin the particulars of the case.&quot;   Mr. Siegel was also sentenced to five years probation andordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service inJacksonville, Fla., near his home. He is to begin serving thesentence on July 16.</TEXT></DOC>
