A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit on Friday reversed a lower courtruling and said the administration did not have to distribute themoney to local governments.   ``I think it's virtually certain we'll ask the court toreconsider its decision,'' said David C. Vladek, a lawyer for theNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities,the U.S. Conference of Mayors and 10 city and county governments.   ``My sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature ofour legal arguments,'' he said.   The dispute involves President Reagan's Feb. 1, 1986, orderunder the Gramm-Rudman law that set aside 4.3 percent of budgetitems, including $180 million from that year's $4.2 billionappropriation to the revenue sharing trust fund.   The local governments argued that the law provided that 1986budget money that had been sequestered should remain in governmenttrust funds and be paid out in 1987. They argued that even thoughCongress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986, it intended thatany money remaining in the trust fund be distributed.   Revenue sharing, begun under the Nixon administration, providednearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants.   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green on July 28 ruled in favorof the local governments and said Treasury Secretary James A. BakerIII had illegally transferred the revenue sharing money from thetrust fund to the general fund.   However, Judge John R. Gibson, who wrote the appeals panel'sdecision reversing Green, said Congress' intent with theGramm-Rudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit.   ``Merely freezing (the monies in 1986) and resuscitating them(in 1987) would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction andcould be characterized by critics to be a sham,'' said Gibson, whowas joined by Judges Patricia M. Wald and David Santelle.   ``The result in this case may be harsh, but we believe it isconsistent with congressional intent,'' wrote Gibson, who wasdesignated to the case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit in St. Louis.   Among the plaintiffs are New York City; Kansas City, Mo.;Milwaukee County, Wis.; and Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includesCleveland.   The U.S. Conference of Mayors, at the time of the originaldistrict court decision last summer, had estimated that New Yorkwould receive $10 million; Chicago, $2.6 million; Los Angeles, $2.2million; and Detroit $1.3 million of the money.   Other estimates were $606,000 for New Orleans; $554,000 forIndianapolis; $677,000 for Washington D.C.; $440,000 for Denver and$104,000 for Des Moines, Iowa. Estimates for other cities were notprovided.</TEXT></DOC>
