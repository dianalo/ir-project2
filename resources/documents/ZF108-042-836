 The investigationdemonstrated the need to standardize the management and accessibility ofinformation for major investigations.andM;A standard procedure for incident room (case) management was subsequentlydeveloped by the United Kingdom Home Office in cooperation with severalpolice forces.andM;One-year trialandM;The Home Office initiated a project with computer company Bull WorldwideInformation Systems to automate this process, applying the benefits ofcomputer technology to case management.andM;The system is called Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES).andP;  Itoffers an automated functional solution for cross-referencing and correlatinginvestigative data, document management, action management and free textinformation retrieval or research.andM;Today, HOLMES is used by virtually every police force in the U.K.andP;  tocomplement their existing Computer-Aided Dispatch, Records Entry and PoliceNational Computer facilities.andM;This year, the Ontario's Halton Regional Police force became the firstCanadian force to purchase the system.andP;  The Halton police began a one-yeartrial with HOLMES in June, 1988.andP;  Later in the summer, two murders took placewithin days of each other and HOLMES was brought in to investigate one ofthem.andM;&quot;At CIB (Criminal Investigation Bureau), we spend about 50 per cent of ourtime going over data,&quot; says Halton's Inspector Wayne Jessop.andP;  &quot;The rest ofthe time is for street investigation.andP;  HOLMES means that our officers canspend more time investigating.andP;  What was a 50-50 deal is now probably 70-30.andO;The system has made our office far more efficient.&quot;andM;Halton bought HOLMES, which runs on a minicomputer, at a cost of $200,000over three years.andP;  The deal was signed before the one-year trial was evenover since the police were convinced of the benefits shortly after theystarted using the system.andM;Ten officers and two civilians spent four weeks in training.andP;  According toJessop the system was so user-friendly that this group could have loaded anactual case on it by the third week.andP;  A retired detective sergeant from theU.K.andP;  was also brought in to help out.andM;Now a Halton police officer -- salary of $43,000 a year -- doesn't have tospend time inputting material since a civilian employee does it -- freeing upinvestigators for actual investigating.andM;Also, HOLMES is efficient at correlating and cross-referencing data whichsaves time.andP;  Other benefits include a sound document management system,action management, and free text information retrieval or research.andM;During one week in August of last year, the murders of Francine Cote and KenMartin rattled the quiet Halton Region which has an average of only 1.5murders a year.andP;  HOLMES was brought in to assist the Cote investigationshortly after the test began, and police quickly saw how the computer couldassist a major investigation.andM;HOLMES' cross-referencing of data means that clues may be found more quickly.andO;A research to connect pieces of information, which may take weeks manually,can be done in seconds.andM;The Halton Police say that what once required eight hours of manually pouringthrough documents can now be done in two minutes on the computer.andM;While the Halton Regional Police are first in Canada to purchase the BullHOLMES system, other forces are looking at it.andP;  HOLMES was first demonstratedin Canada two years ago.andP;  In 1987, it was exhibited at the CanadianAssociation of Chiefs of Police annual convention in Quebec City, at theannual meeting of the Canadian Police Association in Vancouver, and at theInternational Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Toronto.andM;Art Mathies, Bull's marketing manager for the HOLMES initiative in Canada,said his company was very pleased with Halton's pilot project and looks toexpand automation in the police community.andM;&quot;We would like to see HOLMES adapted as a Canadian standard which would thenopen the door for the next phase, HOLMES LINK, which is already operationalin the U.K.,&quot; Mathies says.andP;  &quot;HOLMES LINK allows all police forces withHOLMES installations to link their systems in a network and easily sharepertinent information in a controlled secure environment.andP;  This would be verybeneficial when criminal activity crosses multiple police jurisdictions.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
