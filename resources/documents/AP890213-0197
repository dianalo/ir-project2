Only 44 percent of Third World women inlabor receive medical care. In many countries, about 80 percent ofall births take place at home. About half the time, these women arealone, national studies report.   Niger, like several African countries, has taken preliminarysteps to improve health services for expectant mothers. The aging,concrete shelter where Mrs. Issa had her baby is one of about 80maternity centers set up by the government around the nation.   But in a poor country like Niger, where per capita income hoversaround $260 a year, medical service is rudimentary at best and thestandards of service differ widely.   Even in the capital, where six multi-purpose complexes offerprenatal, obstetric and early pediatric care by trained midwives andhealth workers, the centers often lack sufficient antibiotics, painkillers and plasma.   Rural facilities, frequently lack electricity and running waterand are often more like the center here _ two crude rooms with a fewyellowed cots and an inexperienced midwife the expectant mothershave never seen before.   Despite the lack of health care and many dangers, African womencontinue to give birth too often, too early and too late.   Mrs. Issa got married in her teens, like 70 percent of the womenin West Africa but only 7 percent in Europe. She had her first childat 17.   African women often produce their first baby around the age of 15and continue having children every year or two until menopause. Mrs.Issa says she has had enough.   ``I'm tired, really tired,'' she said, sitting on a dirty foammattress without sheets the day after she gave birth.   ``I want to take something to stop having babies. My husband maynot want to accept it, but he's not the one who's tired'' she addedin the tribal language Djerma, speaking through a midwife whotranslated.   In rural areas, UNICEF reports, 50 percent of the women who hadtheir first child before 15 were dead by the age of 50 from causeslinked to the trauma of frequent pregnancies.   But only about 2 percent of African women have access to modernbirth control or information on family planning. Laws, customs andreligious beliefs stand in the way.   Until Niger adopted a new birth control law last April, womenneeded written permission from their husbands even to visit a familyplanning center. In some countries, women need permission from theirspouses to leave a village.   They cannot vote. They can neither own property nor inherit it.They cannot decide whom to marry or divorce and they are prohibitedfrom seeking an education.   Female literacy in West Africa hovers around 6 percent, comparedto 20 percent for African men and 99 percent for women and men inNorth America.   ``Women have no options,'' said Perdita Huston, spokeswoman forthe London-based International Planned Parenthood. ``She may bedesperately tired and not want another child, but she doesn't wantto disappoint her husband. She has to go on pleasing him.   ``You can talk about safe motherhood until you are blue in theface and accomplish nothing until you convince the men.''   Ms. Huston added, however, that attitudes gradually are changing.Recurring drought and famine in African countries bordering theSahara produced a ``psychological shock'' to African governments,forcing them to reconsider limiting population growth.   Chiefs of states and heads of families are realizing they don'tneed any more mouths to feed.   World Bank lending for programs related to women's health andbirth control will triple over the next five to eight years.   ``We need to put our money where our mouth is,'' said M.J.Gillette, the World Bank's director of the Africa Country Department.   ``But there is hope. Since the late 1970s ... there has been atremendous reversal of spirit in Africa and a real intellectualgrasp of the situation,'' Gillette said. ``Women are organizing andthey are going to take care of this problem. Governments arerecognizing the link between development and population control andthey are changing policies.   ``The last obstacle to family planning is the African man and heis waking up. There are forces loose in African society that hecan't control anymore.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 19</NOTE></DOC>
