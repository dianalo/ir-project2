The White House said the two ``discussed the Soviet Union'' andits leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, including Gorbachev's talks lastmonth in Belgrade and Reagan's three summit meetings with theSoviet general-secretary.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said Reagancongratulated Vrhovec on Yugoslavia's agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund for a loan to support the country'smonetary and economic programs.
