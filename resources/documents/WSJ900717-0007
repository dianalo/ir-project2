Two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, ofBrooklyn, N.Y., urged lawyers involved in the cases, whichallege injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos, toconsider consolidating all the cases nationwide into onecourtroom, presumably his.</LP><TEXT>   But Judge Weinstein never issued an official order thatwould call for such a consolidation.   Late yesterday U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros ofCleveland did.   In what some lawyers are calling a pre-emptive strikeagainst Judge Weinstein, Judge Lambros ordered theestablishment of a single national class of claimants in allasbestos-related personal injury cases.   In a class-action suit, typically all similar claims aretried together, instead of separately, with several namedplaintiffs standing in as representatives of the entireclass. Damages are generally awarded under some sort offormula devised for the particular case.   The virtue of a class action is that, at leasttheoretically, the available money for damages is divided insuch a way that every plaintiff gets his fair share. Incontrast, when the cases are tried separately, the firstplaintiffs to win judgments can deplete the defendant'sresources, leaving nothing for any other claimants.   Judge Lambros's order effectively prevents any other judgefrom consolidating the cases in any other court at this time.Judge Lambros, the chief judge of the Cleveland federalcourts, presides over 7,000 asbestos-related cases involvingmore than 13,000 individuals' claims. As a practical matter,the judge's surprise move could induce the federaladministrative office of the courts to step in as a refereeand decide where the cases should be tried.   The move by Judge Lambros follows increasing problems withthe Manville trust, set up by Denver-based Manville in 1986to pay the company's asbestos personal-injury claims. Thetrust is a defendant in nearly 100,000 cases before 500 statecourts and in each of the nation's federal jurisdictions. Inrecent weeks, it has come under fire because of its huge cashshortfall.   Last week, Judge Weinstein gave the Manville trust untilAug. 6 to restructure its financing and to change the way itpays asbestos victims. He issued a temporary stay barring thetrust from paying any settlements, judgments, trustees' feesor plaintiffs' attorneys fees until the changes are made.   The move worried the community of attorneys representingthe claimants. They said they were concerned that JudgeWeinstein, who is known to favor giving as much money aspossible to the claimants, would cut the attorneys' fees tothe bone if he gained control of all the cases. Indeed, JudgeWeinstein, in suggesting consolidation, indicated that hisbiggest concern with the current tangle of cases was what heconsidered to be runaway attorneys fees.   Judge Weinstein declined to comment late yesterday, as dida representative for the Manville trust. Some plaintiffs'attorneys predicted that Judge Lambros's order would beappealed.   Individuals familiar with the situation said that lastweek some plaintiffs' lawyers met in Chicago to discuss theirconcern that Judge Weinstein might be ready to certify anational class of claimants and bring the cases to Brooklyn.   One of the individuals said the attorneys decided to seekout judges who they believed were more lenient towardplaintiffs' attorneys and try to get them to take control ofthe cases. Judge Lambros was said to be one of these judges.Judge Lambros couldn't be reached for comment last night, buthe is understood to have denied any undue pressure.   In his order yesterday, Judge Lambros said the asbestoslitigation meets the criteria for creating a single classaction because &quot;it has become apparent to judges managingthese cases that there are insufficent funds among all of thedefendants to pay all meritorious claims and all the costsassociated with processing the claims through the judicialsystem.&quot;   Lawyers contacted late yesterday expressed someuncertainty about the precise meaning of certain aspects ofthe order. While he called for a national class action, thejudge also established &quot;subclasses&quot; for existing cases. Somelawyers interpreted this to mean that those cases already ontrial dockets in the nation's courts should remain where theyare.   The order said the largest concentration of casesinvolving asbestos claims is in Judge Lambros's court.   The judge also said the only group that could veto hisorder was an ad hoc committee of judges with the largestasbestos dockets. The group met for the first time at the endof June.</TEXT></DOC>
