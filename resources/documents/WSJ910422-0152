Feazell, former McLennan County districtattorney, sued Belo Broadcasting Corp. and reporter CharlesDuncan in 1986 in state court in Waco. He charged that Mr.Duncan ruined his reputation in a 10-part series that accusedMr. Feazell of taking kickbacks to settle drunken-drivingcharges. The series, which ran in 1985, was followed by acommentary by one of the station's anchors.   Mr. Feazell was indicted on bribery and racketeeringcharges in September 1986, after the series ran and justbefore he was to run for re-election. He was acquitted of allthe charges in June 1987. In an interview, Mr. Feazell, whohas argued that the news stories prompted the indictments,said the verdict vindicates him and &quot;sends a message to therest of the media to get your facts straight.&quot;   Belo, a television and newspaper concern that owns WFAA-TVin Dallas, said it believes there isn't a &quot;factual basis tosupport this jury verdict, which involves a public official.&quot;The company said it will ask for a new trial, among othermotions, and if necessary, will appeal.   The company also said that the verdict, if upheld,wouldn't impact its financial results or its financialcondition, but it didn't elaborate. Belo recently reported afirst-quarter loss of $1.9 million, or 10 cents a share, onrevenue of $94.2 million. It blamed the loss on beefed-upcoverage and lower advertising revenue related to the PersianGulf war.   The jury's verdict included $17 million in actual damages,including $2 million in damage to Mr. Feazell's business, $9million in damage to his reputation and $6 million forpersonal humiliation. The $41 million in punitive damagesincluded $1 million assessed to Mr. Duncan.</TEXT></DOC>
