For the first time in eight years, thebalance sheets of nonfinancial corporations will end the yearwith more equity relative to debt than they had when the yearstarted.   Names like RJR Nabisco, Duracell International, KaiserAluminum and Warnaco are among the spate of 1980s leveragedbuy-outs now returning to public ownership. So are lesswell-known companies like York International Corp., whichraised $270 million in a common-stock offering in October tocure a balance sheet heavily leveraged as a result of a 1988buy-out.                                                                                                          &quot;We were running ahead of a freight train, and God help usif we stubbed our toe,&quot; says Robert Pokelwaldt, York'spresident. Now the York, Pa., maker of air conditioners andrefrigeration equipment is saving more than $1 million a weekin interest expenses and has the cash and financingflexibility to pursue some attractive small acquisitions.   Deleveraging also is in vogue for a host of othercompanies that merely let debt creep higher than normal.&quot;Equity and balance-sheet quality are in fashion,&quot; saysColgate-Palmolive Corp. Treasurer Brian Heidtke. Last month,Colgate raised $460 million in equity to retire debt andlower its debt/equity ratio from 50/50 to about 35/70.   &quot;We are beginning a period of financial convalescing thathas a long way to go,&quot; says Henry Kaufman, who runs his owneconomic consulting firm in New York. He and most economistsview the shift as healthy. As new equity retires debt,interest costs are reduced, operating restrictions areloosened, and credit-rating agencies cast a more favorableeye.   Last Monday, for instance, RJR Nabisco Inc., earned aninvestment-grade rating on some of its bonds for the firsttime since its mammoth leveraged buy-out in 1989. Thecatalyst: a series of equity transactions and debtrestructurings since mid-1990 that lopped billions of dollarsoff its debt load and hundreds of millions of dollars fromannual interest expenses.   The stock market's troubles of late have cooled off thepace of new stock deals, especially for start-up companies.And those that are getting done have to accept less.Owens-Illinois Corp., which underwent a 1987 leveragedbuy-out, raised $660 million this week in an initial publicoffering, but it had to go off at an offering price 25% belowits target.   But analysts and investment bankers maintain there will beno lack of demand for new stock offerings in years to come,especially from healthy seasoned companies whose only problemis an onerous debt burden. &quot;We're talking about a majorsecular change that is unrelated to the initial publicoffering phenomena of 1991,&quot; says Jack Lavery, researchdirector of Merrill Lynch. One of the themes of Merrill'sresearch is the &quot;re-equitization&quot; of corporate America.   The retirement of debt may set the stage for an economicrebound because it frees up cash for companies to spend andputs them in position for another round of financings whichcan be plowed directly into capital spending.   Indeed, in a disappointing year for the economy, thebalance sheet progress of corporate America is one of the fewbright spots. It is bringing about a sharp decline in thenumber of credit-rating downgrades. At Moody's InvestorsService, the fourth quarter pace of 1.7 downgrades for everyupgrade is well off the 6.35 to one ratio of a year earlier.   &quot;In all likelihood the worst has passed in deteriorationof corporate credit quality,&quot; says John Lonski, Moody's chiefeconomist. He suspects that just as the sharp worsening indowngrades-to-upgrades ratio in 1990 was an early warningsign that the recession would be worse than expected, so toothe pace of ratings changes in recent months &quot;could betelling us the current pessimism is overdone.&quot;   Driving the increase in upgrades are the first positiveyearly changes since 1983 in issuance of equity, interestexpense reduction and debt/equity ratios. The SecuritiesIndustry Association said last week it expects there will bea $35 billion net issuance of equity this year after nearly adecade of leveraged buy-outs, stock buy-backs andacquisitions took more than $500 billion out of the stockmarket.   The burst of equity financing has meant that debt as apercentage of total capitalization has finally begun inchingdown. It had climbed from 34.2% at the end of 1983 to 46.8%last year and should end the year at about 46.5%, Mr. Lonskipredicts.   Thanks to the paying back and refinancing of debt, alongwith lower interest rates on adjustable-rate loans, netinterest expenses of nonfinancial corporations are decliningfor the first time in years. Mr. Lonski expects a $125billion figure for 1991, still $55 billion higher than eightyears earlier, but down from $128.4 billion in 1990.   Fueling the equity surge are some of the hard lessons ofthe 1980s. &quot;Debt is now a four-letter word,&quot; notes RichardKauffman, a managing director of First Boston Corp. DavidKomansky, head of the equity department at Merrill Lynch,adds, &quot;Just as there was a social acceptance of debt in the1980s, there's now a move toward more conservatism in the1990s.&quot;   Some companies are raising new equity despite their beliefthey were doing just fine without it. Stone Container Corp.added $2.5 billion in debt for acquisitions in 1989, raisingthe packaging-products company's debt to definedcapitalization to 70%. It recently raised $180 million from astock offering to retire debt and &quot;reduce the cash-flowconcerns of the market,&quot; says Arnold Brookstone, chieffinancial officer. &quot;We thought the concerns were illfounded,but weren't going to leave them unattended,&quot; he adds.   In the 1980s few corporations could resist the temptationto take more debt on their balance sheets, especially as junkbonds and bank debt were readily available to financeleveraged buy-outs. Oftentimes, the threat of hostiletakeovers left managers little choice but to pile on debt tobuy back stock if they were determined to remain independent.   Gillette Co., for instance, went an extra $1.5 billioninto hock in the late 1980s to buy back stock to avoidtakeover moves by Coniston Partners and Ronald Perelman,chairman of Revlon Inc. Since then, with strong cash flow andthe proceeds of Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett'spurchase of $600 million in preferred convertible stock debt,Gillette has brought its former $1.7 billion debt level downto about $1 billion, about equal to its equity.   With the economy flagging and without strong inflation toboost revenues and jack up the value of assets that could besold, the ability to meet debt obligations taken on in thelast decade has suffered. And with little room to maneuver,chief financial officers suddenly found all those willinglenders of the 1980s not quite so accommodating.   Junk bond issuance and junk bond exchange offers, forinstance, fell into disrepute along with Drexel BurnhamLambert, their chief architect. And bankers have turned adeaf ear to many entreaties for new loans, especially thosefrom companies that would have to be characterized as highlyleveraged transactions.   Companies want to deleverage, says Moody's Mr. Lonski, &quot;tobe better able to survive the unforeseen.&quot; Besides, withoutso much debt draining their cash flow, they can afford toprice more competitively to win new markets, invest intechnology to enhance productivity and pay lower rates on newborrowings down the line.   Some of the companies bearing the brunt of the recessionare coming by equity the hard way. Too shaky to sell stock tothe public, they are offering equity to creditors in privaterestructuring deals where debt holders get paid stock ratherthan cash for all or part of their positions.   To be sure, the debt burden spurred many companies toimprove performance, though even those say they will bebetter off without so much debt now. Despite a 1986 leveragedbuy-out debt load, Warnaco Inc., the clothing manufacturer,boosted earnings threefold by restructuring operations andputting in tighter controls on everything from inventory toreceivables. Even so, it used proceeds of a $120 millionstock offering to retire debt so it would save an extra $12million of interest a year.   RJR Nabisco, which had a debt/equity ratio that was ashigh as 25 to one at the time of its leveraged buy-out, isnow cited as a classic case of deleverage. &quot;Nothing focusesthe mind so much as a lot of debt,&quot; says Karl von der Heyden,chief financial officer, who came on board after the buy-out.&quot;It instilled a new sense of urgency that squeezed a lot ofcosts out of the balance sheet and improved productivity.&quot;   Even so, RJR is busily restructuring to reduce debt,because of &quot;restrictive bank credit agreements that gave usvirtually no flexibility in diverting cash, say for smallacquisitions, that would help our growth,&quot; Mr. von der Heydensays. &quot;We want to grow again, particularly in internationaltobacco, where there are unique opportunities in places likeEastern Europe and Turkey.&quot;   Not everyone buys the argument that more conservativedebt/equity ratios are in order. Some fear too much dilutionof current stockholder stakes and that buy-outs of maturecompanies will be too difficult.   Though no one expects a return to the days when debtaccounted for only a third of the average balance sheet, thetrend toward more equity offerings is expected to continuefor some time. Mr. Lavery of Merrill Lynch notes that demandfor stock offerings will come from the baby boom populationmoving into the savings-accumulation stage of their lives.Their best alternative is equities, which historically havereturned 10% overall annually, several percentage pointsabove bonds or real estate and twice the inflation rate.   As for corporations, he sees the &quot;fundamental cleansing ofbalance sheets&quot; continuing because greater levels of equitywill enable them to take advantage of growth opportunities.&quot;As we assess the decade, it will be one of investment bycompanies in their future.&quot;   ---   Staff reporter George Anders contributed to this article.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
