Traders shrugged off the reports, noting that the interest-rate cuts have been widely expected for several days. &quot;The markets already have discounted all the news about rate cuts by Germany and Japan,&quot; said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co.    Mr. Lerner and many other forecasters still expect lower U.S. interest rates in coming months because the economy remains very weak, they say. But they also say it will take at least another month or two for signs of the economy's plight to emerge. Until then, they say, the Federal Reserve System probably will leave its credit policy unchanged.    The dollar's sharp drop has unnerved many investment managers, partly because they fear foreign investors will be reluctant to increase their holdings of dollar-denominated securities.    The dollar's tumble also is likely to discourage the Federal Reserve System from easing credit conditions any time soon. Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday that a declining dollar generally reduces flexibility in setting monetary and fiscal policy. Although he didn't specifically rule out the possibility of a cut in the Fed's discount rate, his remarks strongly suggested that the Fed won't reduce the rate as long as the dollar remains weak.    &quot;It looks like the pieces are in place for West Germany to take action&quot; to reduce interest rates, said Raymond W. Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. But he said it is highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve would join in any move by Germany and Japan because the dollar has been under such heavy attack in the foreign exchange markets lately. &quot;The Fed can't afford to cut the discount rate right now,&quot; he said.    Trading volume in the bond markets yesterday was &quot;very quiet,&quot; Mr. Stone said. &quot;The rumor mills were more active than bond traders.&quot;    Nonetheless, many forecasters say the U.S. economy will be so weak in the next few months that eventually the Fed will have to cut the discount rate to 5%, or possibly 5 1/4%. The Fed's discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, has stood at 5 1/2% since last August.    The economy won't show any growth at all this quarter, said Mr. Lerner of Bankers Trust. But it will take &quot;a couple of months&quot; to convince Fed officials that the economy needs additional help in the form of lower interest rates, he said. He expects that evidence to emerge during March.    The Commerce Department is scheduled today to release its preliminary estimate of the economy's performance in last year's fourth quarter. According to the average estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the economy expanded at a mediocre 2.4% annual rate in the period, compared with a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, after adjusting for inflation.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 declined slightly to 102 3/32 from 102 5/32 on Tuesday, leaving the yield at about 7.32%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 edged up to 101 25/32 from 101 22/32, leaving the yield at about 7%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 1.39 points to close at 1437.37. It hovered between 1435.92 and 1441.25 during the day.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose yesterday. The rate on the latest 13-week Treasury bill rose to 5.35% bid from an average of 5.23% set at Monday's auction. The latest 26-week issue rose to 5.31% bid from the average auction rate of 5.27%.    In the new-issue market, Hydro-Quebec offered $250 million (U.S.) of debentures. Lead underwriter was Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The 8 1/4% debentures due 2027 were priced at 99.55 to yield 8.29%. They are rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Chase Manhattan Corp. offered $250 million of notes through a group led by Salomon Brothers Inc. The 7 3/8% notes due 1994 were priced at 99 1/2 to yield 7.468%. They are rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    Cooper Industries Inc. offered $100 million of notes. Lead underwriter was Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The 7 7/8% 10-year notes were priced at 99.895 to yield 7.89%. They are rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    On the municipal front, a $387.3 million revenue-bond offering by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority was tentatively priced by underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. Under the proposal, the bonds would yield from 4% in 1988 to 7.017% in 2015.    Separately, yields on parts of a $391.8 million San Antonio, Texas, offering of electric and gas systems refunding revenue bonds were lowered by a group led by Merrill Lynch. Under the new terms, the bonds yield from 4.75% in 1990 to 7.04% in 2012. Originally, the scale ranged from 4.8% to about 7.1%. </TEXT></DOC>
