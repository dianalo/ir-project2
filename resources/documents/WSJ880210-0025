Mr. Stahl pleaded guilty in June to four wire-fraud charges. The charges were related to misappropriation of funds in a check-kiting scheme that prosecutors said involved $19 million.    Federal Judge Vincent L. Broderick gave Mr. Stahl five years in prison on each of the first three counts, with the sentences to run concurrently, and two years in prison for the fourth charge. The last two years were suspended and changed to five years' probation.    Still pending is a civil suit by a Manhattan doctor and his wife, who charged that Mr. Stahl misappropriated at least $2.5 million of their funds. </TEXT></DOC>
