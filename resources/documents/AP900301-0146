In testimony before the Senate Labor and Human ResourcesCommittee, Indianapolis Mayor Richard Hudnut III and New YorkAttorney General Robert Abrams called for passage of the proposed``Civil Rights Act of 1990.''   Hudnut spoke for the United States Conference of Mayors andAbrams for himself and Nebraska Attorney General Robert Spire.   ``It must be understood that there are people in our society whohave been excluded from the mainstream of opportunity for too long,and that without some kind of proactive government policy they willcontinue to be excluded,'' Hudnut said.   The hearing focused on efforts to counter the effects of the1989 Wards Cove decision, which critics complain transferred theburden of proof in certain discrimination cases to plaintiffs.   Under the decision, plaintiffs must prove an employer wrong whoargues that some employment practice they are complaining about wasbased solely on a neutral, non-discriminatory consideration.   The proposals would reinstate a standard that had been inexistence since 1972 for state and municipal employees. Thatrequired the employer to prove that the employement practice underattack was not discriminatory.   Abrams argued that the old Griggs standard, as it was known, hasbenefited employers as well as plaintiffs. As attorney general ofNew York, Abrams must argue civil rights cases on both sides.   ``The result has been the development of selection proceduresthat better serve to identify those who are truly capable ofperforming the job,'' he said.   The civil rights enforcement activities of the Nixon, Ford andCarter administrations, Abrams said, ``served to bring about racialand ethnic diversity in law enforcement.''   ``Congress and several presidential commissions have found thatsuch diversity is essential to the reduction of citizen mistrust ofour law enforcement activities,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
