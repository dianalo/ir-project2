Mr. Coleman sayshe supports the Americans With Disabilities Act but worriesabout how it will be enforced.   &quot;We serve blind customers and lawyers in wheelchairs; wedo everything we can to accommodate them,&quot; says Mr. Coleman,who six years ago during a total renovation added features tomake his hotel and two restaurants accessible to thedisabled. &quot;But this {new law} could cost businesses tens ofthousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. You have to bereasonable about it; that's the whole thing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Many small-business owners are confused and fearful aboutthe legislation. The House bill, approved yesterday andexpected to become law, would require all businesses -- largeand small -- to be, in some form, accessible to people withdisabilities by the end of next year. Businesses with 25 ormore workers also would have to make accommodations forworkers with disabilities within two years, and those with atleast 15 workers, within four years. Discrimination againstthe disabled in hiring or firing would be illegal.   Many small-business owners aren't aware of what the billwill require, says the National Federation of IndependentBusiness, the largest membership group for small firms. Thefederation predicts the law could cause a &quot;nightmare on MainStreet,&quot; though backers of the measure say such fears areunfounded.   &quot;Contrary to what proponents would like us to believe, notall the costs are small,&quot; especially in comparison with thefinancial means of smaller companies, says John Motley, chieflobbyist for the group. He says concrete ramps cost from$1,000 to $10,000, widening an exterior door, another $3,000,and hiring a certified sign-language interpreter, about $23an hour.   Richard Aronow, owner of Money's Worth Auto Rental inHartsdale, N.Y., says it would cost him about $5,000 a yearto maintain one car with hand controls for disabled patrons.&quot;But if I have the equipment, would I have greater liabilityunder my insurance policy? I don't know if there's anyone whocan tell you exactly what you have to do to comply.&quot;   The National Association of Convenience Stores estimatesit could cost $50,000 for an average store to widen itsaisles to accommodate wheelchairs, lower display shelves andmake freezer cases usable by disabled patrons.   Stewart Hartman Jr., president of Rutter Farm Stores, achain of Pennsylvania convenience stores, believes about aquarter of his 51 stores would meet the bill's requirements.Among other things, the height of shelves was lowered instores built in recent years, though the change had nothingto do with the disabled; it was aimed at watching forshoplifters, he says. But he worries that there aren'tspecific requirements in the bill and says remodeling hisolder buildings would mean losing substantial sales space.   Albert Foer, chairman of Melart Jewelers, a 22-store chainin the Mid-Atlantic states, says it's unclear whether jewelrystores would have to alter display cases and lighting tocomply. &quot;If all you have to do is have a doorway large enoughfor a wheelchair to come through and you can assist thecustomer without having to retrofit the interior, the costwill be negligible,&quot; he says. But he estimates a majorinterior renovation would cost $75,000.   Many such concerns reflect a misunderstanding of what thelaw will require, says Ellen Daly, a spokeswoman for thePresident's Commission on the Employment of People WithDisabilities. If a business is doing a total renovation, itwould be expected to do as much as possible to provideaccessibility, Ms. Daly says. But if there was a recentremodeling, &quot;I can't imagine that the regulations would tella small convenience store you have to do all that over,&quot; shesays. &quot;They'll have to be more conscious of who's coming intotheir store and offer assistance, but they're probably doingthat now. And they may have to readjust the pull on thedoor.&quot;   In the case of the small car-rental agency, she notes thathand controls don't interfere with the operation of a car'sfoot pedals, so the auto could be used for regular rentals.   But while the legislation requires only reasonableadjustments, &quot;it's difficult to know how the reasonablestandard provision will be enforced. It's very vague. That'swhy everyone's so nervous,&quot; says Mark Gorman, head ofgovernment relations for the National Restaurant Association.&quot;People could make a point of challenging you in court.&quot;   Small business won a few changes in the bill passed by theHouse. For example, Congress approved a provision givingsmall firms extra time to comply after federal regulationsare issued. And, after an emotional debate about workers withAIDS, the restaurant industry won an amendment that wouldpermit restaurants to transfer an employee with a contagiousdisease to a job that doesn't involve food handling.   Although disabled people must be considered for employmentif they can perform the essential elements of a job, anamendment says courts should consider a business owner'sdefinition of the job when deciding what's necessary toperform it. Small businesses also won a provision that saysstructural changes required to provide access for thedisabled are the responsibility of landlords, not storeowners who lease space.   The enforcement section of the bill, originally linked tothe 1964 Civil Rights Act, will also be tied to the proposed1990 civil-rights bill. The new civil-rights bill wouldpermit a jury trial and punitive and compensatory damagesafter a finding of intentional discrimination. The Bushadministration had pressed to require only the reinstatementand back-pay remedies that exist under the currentcivil-rights law for workers who prove discrimination.   Small business also wanted an amendment saying thatdisabled people must describe in advance their special needsto a business owner and suggest how those needs could be met.   A proposal for a $5,000 small-business tax credit wasrejected, but the idea is expected to be considered as partof budget legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
