The surplus, which isn't seasonally adjusted, widened from $475.5 million in March.    The figures are converted at the lira's current rate. The balance of payments measures all flows of funds into and out of the country.    In 1987's first four months, the bank added, the balance of payments swung to a surplus of $2.76 billion from a deficit of $3.43 billion a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
