However, the president said he didn't ``want to be responsiblefor the loss of innocent life.''   ``But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them andbring them out, and that required using the military force of theUnited States, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in aninstant,'' Bush said Tuesday at his 21st formal news conferencesince taking office seven months ago.   Bush stressed the uncertainties that involve any militaryresponse when asked why he had not retaliated for the murder ofhostage Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   Bush, who embarks today on a 20-day vacation to his oceanfrontretreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, again signaled that he is willingto work to improve the bitter U.S.-Iranian relations of the lastdecade.   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of ourlives,'' the president said. ``We've had a good relationship withthem in the past.''   The first step, he said, is for the Islamic republic to stopsupporting terrorism and to pressure the Lebanese kidnappers torelease their American captives.   ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to comeout of there, there would be a good likelihood that that wouldhappen.''   Noting conflicting signals from the new Iranian leadership aboutrapprochement with the West, Bush said ``the jury is still out as towhat has happened internally ... in Iran.''   He said he can't say the chances of a breakthrough on thehostages are closer today than three weeks ago, ``but we're going tokeep on trying.''   On another matter, Bush previewed the national anti-drug strategyhe and drug czar William J. Bennett will send to Congress on Sept. 5.   The drug strategy ``will target all aspects of the problem,''including new efforts to cut off drugs at the source as well astougher penalties for casual users, Bush said.   ``I think the day of tolerance for those who break the law inusing drugs is over,'' he said. ``We are going to expand federalexpenditures'' for the drug fight not by raising taxes but through``some reallocation of resources.''   Bush gave no specifics, but said his budget office was drawing upa list of programs from which funds could be diverted.   On other topics, the president:   _Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting Panamanianstrongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to face drug-trafficking charges.``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said.   _Declared he was ``very comfortable'' with budget directorRichard Darman's complaint that the Federal Reserve was keepinginterest rates too high.   _Praised Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith, R-Miss.,killed in separate plane crashes, as ``outstanding public servants''who gave their lives trying ``to better the lot of mankind.''   _Said that if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Shiite cleric seizedlast month by Israeli commandos, were indicted for the kidnapping ofHiggins, ``I would be remiss if I didn't try to see him brought totrial.''   _Suggested ``some kind of international effort'' to offermilitary assistance to countries that request help in eradicatingdrug production.   _Expressed the hope that ``the legal process (can) go on withouta lot of hype'' against suspended State Department diplomat FelixBloch, suspected of spying.</TEXT></DOC>
