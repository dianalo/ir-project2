The Red Cross expected to begin shipping in food and medicalsupplies from neighboring Kenya and Uganda and distributing them insouthern Sudan by the end of May. He said the prime minister hadpledged to help the operation.   In the past, there have been tensions between relieforganizations and the government, which bans contacts with rebels.   They took up arms against the government of this East Africanation in 1983, demanding more autonomy and economic reforms. Sincethen, fierce fighting has forced hundreds of thousands ofsoutherners to flee to towns and cities, where they depend onrelief food.   Government officials who banned the four relief groups said theywere no longer needed. But other sources said the government actedmainly because the groups had contacted rebels to arrange fortransport of food supplies to civilians caught in the cross fire.   The rebels, who control more than 90 percent of the southerncountryside, have been attacking relief convoys. They claim thegovernment uses them to transport military troops and supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
