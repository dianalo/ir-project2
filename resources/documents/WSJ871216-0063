Maguire said he knew trouble was ahead. Before the stock market even opened, he confronted his colleagues at Henderson Brothers, a New York Stock Exchange specialist firm, with a dire prediction. &quot;Today,&quot; he said, &quot;we are going to witness the greatest calamity ever in the marketplace.&quot;    Mr. Maguire didn't know how right he would be, nor exactly what forces would eventually lead to the Crash of 1987. Yes, stocks were unrealistically high, investors were euphoric, interest rates were rising, the budget deficit was huge and the trade gap seemed to be worsening. But why was this the day the bull market would collapse, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 508 points in a matter of hours?    The answer has remained elusive. A presidential task force, congressional committees and several industry groups are now investigating the causes of the plunge and its consequences. But a thorough examination of trading on Black Monday reveals that weak links within the financial markets allowed an early sell-off to rage out of control. Among the stresses that played a crucial role:    --One of Wall Street's most explosive trading strategies, portfolio insurance, persisted unchecked throughout the day, dragging down the stock market with each computer-aided trade.    --A trading technique known as index-arbitrage was abandoned when a computerized execution system was clogged with small retail orders. Index arbitrage could have softened the blow of portfolio insurance and helped stabilize stock prices.    --Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund operator, was forced to unload nearly $1 billion in equities because of its unusually aggressive investment strategy.    --Block traders, who work for Wall Street's biggest brokerage houses, turned cautious, selling positions as quickly as they were forced to buy them from customers.    --Remarks by the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning a possible trading halt were reported with a two-hour lag by the wire services, helping to squelch a brief rally.    --The buyers of last resort, the specialists on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, were overwhelmed by sell orders and lacked the capital to support prices.    Each of these factors fed upon one another in a furious chain reaction that was fueled by the cataclysmic power of the new global market. Linked by computers and communications networks, investors big and small, from Tokyo to London to New York, leaped into the selling frenzy.    The forces that rocked the markets that Monday climaxed the next day, when the market came perilously close to total breakdown and the New York Stock Exchange was on the brink of closing.    CHAIN REACTION   Market professionals point to Wednesday, Oct. 14, as the start of a chain of events leading directly to the Oct. 19 disaster.    On that day, investors were jolted by two pieces of news. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes that would make corporate takeovers much less attractive. In addition, the U.S. trade deficit for August had been wider than generally expected. The Dow industrials fell more than 95 points, then a record point decline.    Many believe that the prospect of more takeovers and restructurings had been propping up the Dow. &quot;That bill took a lot of the value right out of the market,&quot; says Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, the arbitrage-trading chief at Prudential-Bache Securities.    For Luis Mendez, who heads First Boston's equity division, the trade figures were even more disturbing. They sharply depressed the dollar and the confidence of one of the most potent forces in the U.S. market this year: overseas buyers.    The trade news also sent interest rates soaring. On that Wednesday, 30-year Treasury-bond yields rose above 10%. By contrast, stocks then yielded less than 3% -- one of the widest gaps on record.    On Thursday, the Dow industrials fell another 58 points. New York's Chemical Bank raised its basic lending rate on business loans half a percentage point. And the Maryland state pension plan said it had shifted more than $2.3 billion from stocks into bonds -- another indication of bonds' greater appeal.    On Friday, Oct. 16, an &quot;unremitting,&quot; 108-point drop in the Dow -- another record -- scared even seasoned professionals, according to PaineWebber Group Inc. Chairman Donald B. Marron. He sensed real trouble after a late-afternoon meeting with top aides. &quot;Pessimism was setting in even among the most optimistic market professionals,&quot; he says.    In all, the industrial average had fallen 17% from its Aug. 25 peak, and fear was growing that the five-year bull market, which had tripled stock prices, was over. Over the weekend, moreover, Treasury Secretary James Baker feuded publicly with West Germany, reportedly threatening to let the dollar drop. That made foreign investors even more nervous. By Sunday night, U.S. time, they were selling heavily.    Another First Boston stock trader, Nicholas Minucci, got a call late Sunday night from his Tokyo office. Japanese investors wanted to sell so much stock that Mr. Minucci needed to approve the trades. He did. Then, at 2 a.m., he was awakened by a call from the London office. It was a similar, ominous message: European sell orders were heavy.    FUNDS START SELLING   At 7 a.m. Monday in Boston, Robert Morrison, Fidelity's head stock trader, assembled his team of 17 stock traders. He wanted to plan how to execute his huge sell list, which would spread fear through the market as its dimensions became known. Many of the younger traders had never been through a bear market, and their boss was a bit nervous about how they would handle it.    Investors had peppered Fidelity over the weekend with requests to cash in some fund shares; calls were double the normal level. And, as trading unfolded, Fidelity would have more than 1,000 stocks to sell.    Most mutual funds keep a small cash cushion in portfolios to have money on hand if investors want to withdraw funds. But Fidelity keeps many of its $30 billion in stock funds fully invested, in hopes of improving its investment returns. When customers want to sell, as they did Oct. 19, Fidelity's fund managers have to unload stocks almost immediately.    Mr. Morrison says Fidelity's market impact has sometimes been compared to &quot;an elephant in a kitchen. We're not Thumbelina.&quot; For example, it wanted to sell 150,000 shares of International Business Machines. Fidelity tried to soften the impact of some its big sell orders; it didn't initially disclose the identity of every stock for sale or the number of shares. &quot;We practice triage,&quot; Mr. Morrison says, referring to a system of treating battlefield casualties in order of priority. &quot;We concentrate on some of the most important orders.&quot; He adds: &quot;Our selling was planned, orderly and thought-out.&quot;    Later in the day, some mutual funds began calling their lawyers, asking whether they could limit investor redemptions or honor redemption requests by issuing shares from the portfolio rather than cash. Fears of a surge of redemptions later proved groundless, but the funds wanted a full range of choices, just in case.    And at Fidelity, more customers called at lunchtime with redemption requests, forcing more selling in the afternoon when stocks had fallen even further. Mr. Morrison says the lunch hour was &quot;a chance for people to look at the market and decide, 'Jeepers, get me out of the fund, get me into bonds.'&quot; &quot;    PORTFOLIO INSURANCE   Another prime source of selling pressure came from portfolio insurance, which has mushroomed in the past few years to cover more than $60 billion in stocks -- mostly shares held by pension funds.    Portfolio insurance purports to let pension funds own stocks for long-term appreciation but avoid some of the volatility along the way. To do this, portfolio insurance seeks to reduce stock-market exposure in a bear market by selling futures or options matched to an index such as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500. (Futures are more liquid and cheaper to trade than stocks or options, so most portfolio insurers concentrate their hedging in futures markets.)    Because stock prices had already fallen 17% between Aug. 25 and Oct. 16, traders were expecting portfolio insurers to be active sellers of futures on Oct. 19. &quot;There was tremendous anticipation of what portfolio insurance did or did not have for sale&quot; that day, says Jeff Geller of BEA Associates, a New York money manager that offers the product. This anticipation helped widen the discount between stocks and futures, according to many traders.    From Aug. 25 to Oct. 16, BEA itself sold 2,600 futures contracts, equivalent to about $400 million. On Oct. 19 alone, it sold 2,000 contracts -- nearly $300 million. Overall selling by portfolio insurers that day totaled $4 billion of futures and another $2 billion in stocks themselves, according to an estimate by pension consultants at Frank Russell Co., of Tacoma, Wash. &quot;Unquestionably portfolio insurance exerted selling pressure on the market early in the day and was one of the many factors involved in the early decline,&quot; Russell concluded.    As futures prices collapsed even faster than stocks Oct. 19, many portfolio insurers pulled back. &quot;When the market fell apart and seemed to us to be trading in an uneconomic fashion, we stopped participating,&quot; says Ralph Tate, who runs portfolio insurance for Aetna Life andamp; Casualty.    But others -- notably Wells Fargo Investment Advisers -- pressed on. &quot;We felt that the futures market reflected actual trading levels at the time,&quot; says Fred Grauer, the head of the Wells Fargo andamp; Co. subsidiary. Many stock prices hadn't been updated in several minutes, he explains, and it was likely that subsequent stock trades would be at even lower levels. By day's end, Wells sold 14,000 futures contracts, amounting to nearly $2 billion.    &quot;Our first obligation was to our clients,&quot; Mr. Grauer says. The futures hedges helped cushion the clients' portfolios against further losses. And as Mr. Grauer sees it, the problem Monday was a shortage of buyers for futures rather than a flood of sellers. Still, he acknowledges that portfolio insurance unleashed &quot;a lot of selling.&quot;    FUTURES OPEN   All this selling pressure from foreign investors, mutual funds and portfolio insurers hit the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices for the widely traded Standard andamp; Poor's 500 December futures contract opened down 18 points, about 7%.    Further rattling already-fearful traders was news, just before the markets opened, that an Iranian oil platform had been attacked, reportedly by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.    At 9:15 a.m., the Chicago Board of Trade's Major Market Index of 20 bluechip stocks opened down 14 points, indicating a 70-point decline in the Dow. It was the first of many negative signals that the stock market would get from the Chicago stock-index markets.    The futures' record 20-point discount to Friday's closing prices almost immediately spilled over into the stock market, as index arbitragers bought futures and sold stocks until futures and stock prices were again in line.    &quot;All the pros knew the portfolio insurance selling was coming; so, the guys with sneakers cut in front of them and tried to sell first,&quot; a source familiar with the presidential task force's work says. The &quot;guys with the sneakers,&quot; he explains, were New York's nimble traders and &quot;hedge funds&quot; -- fast-trading investment partnerships.    As portfolio-insurance selling mounted, the local traders at the Chicago Merc, who normally take the other side of the trade, began to get apprehensive. One of them, Jerry Friedman, says he bought some futures at the start of the day, figuring they were at too big a discount to stock prices.    But as bellwether stocks such as IBM were delayed in trading, Mr. Friedman had second thoughts about owning any futures. &quot;All of a sudden, you realized some things were really different here,&quot; he says. &quot;There was pandemonium.&quot; Institutions began trying to sell futures contracts 1,000 at a time, far beyond a local trader's ability to buy them. (A 1,000-contract order was worth nearly $150 million at the start of the day.)    SWAMPED SPECIALISTS   In unruly times, there is a buyer of last resort on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange: the &quot;specialist.&quot; As the market maker in a stock, he is supposed to keep an orderly market, buying or selling from his own account when there are order imbalances.    But from the very start Oct. 19, specialists realized that they alone couldn't absorb the flood of selling. Many of their firms have $60 million or less of buying power, hardly enough to offset the billion-dollar waves of selling coming from portfolio-insurance and other sellers.    A few minutes before trading started, Mr. Maguire of the Henderson Brothers specialist firm sought permission from a Big Board floor official to open American Express stock down more than two points. Permission was granted. Even so, Mr. Maguire himself had to buy 150,000 shares at the opening because there weren't enough other buyers. He ended up buying American Express at a loss much of the day.    The selling deluge was just as tough for William Rosenau, the specialist in Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing stock. He opened the stock at $64 a share, down $6.75 from the previous Friday's close. It was the biggest opening drop he had ever set. Yet the stock eventually closed at $51, down nearly $20. &quot;As it turned out, I would have done better had the {opening} price been lower,&quot; Mr. Rosenau says. &quot;Obviously, it was too high.&quot;    One of the later Dow stocks to open was Eastman Kodak, which opened at 10:40 a.m. down $14.125 at $76 a share. One trader at the specialist firm in Kodak says it was very difficult to arrive at an opening price because &quot;every time there was a fluctuation in the futures, the number of orders changed dramatically.&quot;    CAUTIOUS BLOCK TRADERS   In the upstairs trading rooms of Wall Street's big securities firms, traders knew that they must be willing to buy stock to maintain their relationships with clients wanting to sell. The traders sought to hold stocks as briefly as possible before passing them onto another client willing to buy.    At 7:30 a.m., First Boston's Mr. Minucci warned his seven block traders that the Dow industrials could drop 50 to 70 points at the opening. &quot;Lighten up positions, get rid of any small positions&quot; that may become a nuisance as the day goes on, he ordered.    Once trading began, he recalls, &quot;We were being hit with large blocks {for sale} on a consistent basis.&quot; He was troubled by the number of Dow industrials that hadn't begun trading right away because of order imbalances. &quot;You have the indexes open but not the stocks. It's difficult to read the market,&quot; he says, especially for those who might have considered buying.    Mr. Minucci refused to buy stock for the firm's own portfolio, though he kept handling customers' buy-and-sell orders. &quot;Any positions we owned we were attempting to trade out of,&quot; he says. &quot;My main concern was the capital we had at risk. I was always doing something in the futures market or the options market to adjust our hedges. I told our traders: Don't worry about losing 50 cents or even a dollar a share, just get out of the stocks.&quot;    In a crucial move, First Boston traders priced their bids for stock on the basis of the collapsing futures market rather than the last reported stock sale. Says Luis Mendez, the head of the firm's equity division: &quot;If someone asks for a bid on 100,000 shares of Dow Chemical, and the last sale is $82, but the futures market is indicating a price of $78, my bid is going to reflect $78.    &quot;You don't know if the futures market is right or not,&quot; Mr. Mendez adds. &quot;But you have to bid lower.&quot;    A BRIEF RALLY   At 11 a.m., some professional traders saw a buying opportunity. All but one of the Dow industrials were open, and traders had quickly bid up the futures in Chicago to about the same level as the stock market itself. So, even though the Dow average was down 206 points, there was reason to expect the market to steady itself because the futures wouldn't be dragging it down.    Mr. Chapman told his Kidder traders, &quot;We aren't going to risk hundreds of millions of dollars, but if you think certain stocks are way out of line {with their actual value}, go ahead and own some.&quot; He now says, &quot;We bought some, unfortunately. A lot of people lost their money between 11:00 and 2:00, when they guessed there was going to be a rebound.&quot;    Among aggressive buyers was Drexel Burnham Lambert. Its risky strategy would eventually help cost a top Drexel trader, Mark Mehl, his job. Also buying were professional options players. Some had made a fortune the preceding week by selling borrowed stocks and owning offsetting &quot;call&quot; options, which gave them the right to buy the stock at a fixed price. With the market down about 200 points, they figured it was time to buy stocks and close out their positions.    'DOT SYSTEM' DELAYS   By late morning, stock-market volume was running triple the normal pace. Some 200 million shares had already been traded, more than an average day's entire volume. And critical strains mounted in the Big Board's ability to keep up with the pace of trading.    Retail orders were surging; stockbrokers and their clients had decided this was a day they didn't want to sit out. That didn't directly affect prices, but it helped overwhelm part of the Big Board's computerized trading system, known as &quot;Super DOT&quot; (designated order turnaround). Ordinarily, the high-speed DOT system can crunch through orders as fast as they come. But by noontime on Oct. 19, delays of 45 to 75 minutes had built up, says Catherine Kinney, who oversees the DOT system for the exchange.    A particular bottleneck was the printers that inform the Big Board specialists of DOT orders. &quot;We started to throttle back traffic to printers so we didn't blow it,&quot; she says. Compounding the printer problem was a software bug on processing canceled orders.    INDEX ARBITRAGE ENDS   For index arbitragers, the DOT system is a lifeline. To capitalize on small gaps between stock and futures prices, they need to execute a blizzard of trades as fast as possible, before prices might move against them. The DOT system lets them trade $30 million of stocks, spread over as many as 500 issues, in only a few minutes.    But with huge delays in the DOT system, traders had little idea at what price their trades would eventually be executed. With futures prices well below stocks, firms should, in theory, have been able to lock in a healthy profit by buying &quot;cheap&quot; futures and selling an offsetting collection of stocks. But if it took an hour to sell the stocks, the prices might be so low as to wipe out the profit.    What's more, stock-exchange rules inadvertently stymied index arbitragers' ability to trade. Most index arbitragers don't keep a large inventory of stocks; so, when they do sell shares, they must sell them short, using borrowed stock that must be bought later to repay the lender.    Because of short-selling abuses in the 1929 crash, Big Board rules say stocks can't be sold short if the previous price change was a drop. The idea is to prevent a runaway &quot;bear raid&quot; in a stock. But such rules don't take into account the way stocks now interact with the huge stock-index futures market that has sprung up the past few years.    As a result, the market was functioning without one type of trading that might have pulled stock and futures prices back in line -- albeit by lowering stocks somewhat more and raising futures prices.    In the afternoon, &quot;anyone who did index arbitrage was shooting blind,&quot; says William Breck, who runs such activity for Shearson. The firm stopped doing index arbitrage about 1:30 p.m., and others had quit even earlier. At First Boston, traders pulled out partly because of concern that index-arbitrage trades could lead to sudden, unexpected margin calls if conditions went against them.    With hindsight, some market experts think that index arbitrage, if continued, might have softened the drop. Even though such trading would have involved more stock sales, it would have provided badly needed buyers in the futures market -- closing the gap between stocks and futures. &quot;When index arbitrage stopped, the portfolio-insurance futures sellers lost their natural buyers,&quot; says the head of stock trading at a top Wall Street firm.    From 1:30 onward, there were few forces left to narrow the futures/stocks gap. And as futures kept plunging, they exerted a suction-like force on stock prices. Among traders' biggest worries: The lower futures prices went, the more selling it would entail by some portfolio insurers.    TAKEOVER PLAYERS NAILED   The market plunge was causing another kind of meltdown for Wall Street's takeover speculators, many of whom had chalked up profits of 60% or more for the year to date. But instead of sitting on their gains, they had borrowed against their profits and bought more stocks on margin. When prices plunged Oct. 19, these speculators, who controlled an estimated $15 billion in buying power, had little choice but to dump stocks before their creditors cut them off.    &quot;We couldn't even think of selling in an orderly fashion,&quot; recalls George Kellner, a partner in Kellner, DiLeo andamp; Co. In the crash, his firm would lose more than half its capital, which had totaled about $400 million. On Black Monday, prices for perceived takeover candidates such as Gillette and Dayton Hudson were sagging by the minute. And yet, &quot;we found there were no buyers,&quot; Mr. Kellner recalls.    Meanwhile, most mutual funds, except for Fidelity, were only modest sellers. As a group, equity mutual funds sold less than $800 million Oct. 19. But other sellers included foreign institutions, which became very apprehensive about the dollar over the weekend. Some bank trust departments also sold stock to prepare a move into what they considered a safer investment, government bonds.    'FUN' FOR SOME BUYERS   It's a truism that &quot;for every seller, there's a buyer.&quot; And as odd as it seems, some investors happily bought stocks Oct. 19. Among them was Robert DiBraccio, a stock trader for the $5 billion Vanguard Windsor Fund. His mutual fund bought $120 million of stock on Black Monday. But he had a hard time getting brokers' attention.    Mr. DiBraccio says he had to place orders directly on the Big Board floor instead of dealing with brokerage firms' block-trading departments, which usually service big institutions. Some brokers wouldn't even tell him what big blocks of stocks were for sale, Mr. DiBraccio recalls. &quot;The prices were moving so quickly that they were afraid that taking five minutes to shop a block could mean they'd lose a point or more,&quot; he explains.    Another buyer was Greta Marshall, the investment manager of the California Public Employees' Retirement System. When she stopped by the trading desk, she found the traders agape at the market slump, unable to react. She gave the orders to buy more than $30 million in stocks. &quot;We always say we want to buy when other people are selling,&quot; she observes. And with some understatement, she adds, &quot;I saw people selling&quot; on Oct. 19.    For active buyers, the crazed environment was &quot;kind of fun,&quot; according to J.J. Jelincic, the California state fund's head trader. At one point, he recalls, he offered an outrageously low bid for a stock, at $2 below the last sale. Normally, even bidding 25 cents below last sale is considered cheeky. As Mr. Jelincic recalls: &quot;The guy said, 'That's brutal, but hang on.' He called back 30 seconds later and said 'You bought it.'&quot;    Joining the buyers as stock prices kept skidding were the companies themselves. Fidelity says it ended up selling 50,000 shares of IBM back to the computer company itself, for example.    Over the subsequent week, corporate stock repurchases surged to unprecedented levels. Companies said they found their stocks attractive; traders also believed that the big buy-backs were part of a concerted effort to shore up confidence.    FEARS OF A TRADING HALT   Any hopes of a lasting rally were jolted when wire services carried word at 1:04 p.m. that David Ruder, the SEC chairman, was thinking of closing the markets. Mr. Ruder said: &quot;There is a point at which I would be interested in talking with the New York Stock Exchange about a temporary, very temporary, halt in trading. I don't know at what point that is.&quot;    With the Dow industrials then down more than 150 points, that was all Mark Harah needed to hear. A floor trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr. Harah says he began selling Sandamp;P index contracts right away. &quot;I said, 'All hell's going to break out now,'&quot; he recalls. To him, Mr. Ruder's remarks were &quot;like saying: 'I'm closing the bank.'&quot;    Curiously, Mr. Ruder actually spoke shortly after 11 a.m., answering questions following a speech on the globalization of financial markets. But with stock prices on the mend at the time, his comments seemed moot. They were reported on the news wires two hours later -- when they became a bombshell.    Around 1:20 p.m., the SEC rushed out a statement saying it wasn't discussing closing the markets. But by then, the Dow average was plunging more than a point a minute. Cynical traders weren't likely to be assured by anything the government might say.    A PANIC SETS IN   Smaller investors, who might not have realized the suction-like effect that futures were having on stocks, nonetheless scrambled to sell. Bruce Reymann, a floor broker at Thomson McKinnon Securities, says his customers stepped up the urgency of their sell orders around 2:30 p.m., with the Dow industrials down 270 points. Instead of handling the usual limit orders, which seek to sell stock at a desired price, &quot;we just hit the bids wherever they were,&quot; Mr. Reymann says. The recurring message, he adds, was: &quot;Get me a bid on my stocks! Sell them! Get me out of them!&quot;    On the Big Board floor, one specialist says that by 2:30 p.m. he despaired of the market's prospects. &quot;I knew whatever buys I was making, I wasn't going to make money,&quot; he says. &quot;The only reason I was there was because I had to be. But our job isn't to buy the whole company.&quot;    By 3 p.m., the Dow was down nearly 300 points, and Wall Street players of all sizes became worried about the solvency of their trading partners. One by one, each precaution made sense. But taken together, they produced a climate of fear that worsened their problems.    At First Boston, Mr. Mendez had already warned traders to deal only with market participants able to meet their obligations. At Pershing andamp; Co., a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society that clears trades for many small brokers, credit was tightened up, too. &quot;There were a lot of margin calls,&quot; says Richard Pechter, an official. &quot;If a guy owes you $100 million, you're quite interested if he can pay you.&quot;    Regular market-making disintegrated. Many investors wanting to sell over-the-counter stocks found that they couldn't reach market makers. The market makers say they fielded as many phone calls as they could but were swamped. But many investors suspect that some securities firms simply left their phones off the hook.    On the New York Stock Exchange, prices were sinking without any support from the specialists or block-trading desks. Big Board records show that Procter andamp; Gamble stock, for instance, fell from $68 to $60 in less than 15 minutes, with no intervening trade larger than 5,000 shares.    In the late-Monday anxieties, even some of Wall Street's premier firms found themselves under fire. Rumors about losses at E.F. Hutton became so widespread that after the market close, Hutton's chief financial officer, Edward Lill, publicly denied that the firm had sustained any losses big enough to threaten it. Hutton survived the crash -- but six weeks later was driven into a merger with Shearson.    Stocks finished the day in free fall, with the Dow industrials plunging another 100 points in the last half hour.    As the stock market closed at 4 p.m., an eerie quiet took hold at First Boston's trading desk. Mr. Minucci says he didn't move and didn't speak. &quot;I felt sick about what I had just seen taking place,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Then, I was relieved that it was over, and I could get my people together and regroup.&quot;    The market's severe strains were also evident the next day, when trading nearly collapsed at midday. Since the Oct. 19 lows, stock averages have rallied more than 10%. But the stunning severity of the crash raises major questions. Will Wall Street be able to put its house in order?
