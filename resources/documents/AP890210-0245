The Financial Accounting Standards Board on Thursday proposed anew procedure that would force U.S. companies to deduct billions ofdollars in annual profits to account for medical and insurancebenefits to be paid to employees after they retire.   But the proposed rules, scheduled to take effect in 1992, couldwipe out the earnings of many companies, forcing some to reduce ordiscontinue benefits, analysts said.   Such cutbacks could affect millions of employees.   A 1988 survey by the Wyatt Co. consulting firm of more than 2,200employers showed that 54 percent of all employers offer medicalbenefits to retired workers. Twenty-one percent of the companiespick up the entire tab, while 74 percent of the retirees pay lessthan half of their bills.   The impact of the proposed rules would vary but probably wouldaffect larger companies more than smaller ones, said Harry Don, aCleveland-based group-benefit consultant for Wyatt Co.   ``There are moderate-sized companies out there who will go from aprofit position to a loss position. This will more than wipe outtheir reported profits,'' Don said.   Current accounting rules do not obligate companies to reportestimated retiree benefit expenses or to reserve money for them.They only have to report such expenses as they are paid.   But the new rule _ which has been in the works for a decade _would require companies to deduct from their earnings enough moneyfor a special reserve that would cover the estimated benefitexpenses.   FASB, a government-sanctioned authority for setting accountingstandards, acknowledges that retirement benefits are the biggestliability for some companies, yet they are not recognized in mostfinancial statements.   The proposal would require companies to set up a reserve to coverretiree benefit costs. Companies would set aside funds when anemployee begins working and would add to the reserve until theemployee becomes eligible for retirement, generally at age 55.   There also would be a reserve to make up for past years thatcompanies did not set aside funds.   Most companies have not set up such reserves because, unlikepension costs, other retirement benefits aren't deductible fromtaxable income.   But LTV Corp. last November announced it was taking a $2.26billion charge for what it anticipates will be its potential healthinsurance cost liability for 118,000 current and retired employees.And earlier this month, Corning Glass Works announced an $84 millionafter-tax charge to account for retiree medical benefits.   FASB Chairman Dennis R. Beresford said the new rule would makefinancial statements more informative and complete and would enhancedisclosure.   ``It will require companies to publicly acknowledge theirexisting commitments to investors and other users of financialstatements who in turn can evaluate the implications of thosepromises,'' Beresford told a news conference.   He also said the proposed accounting would not change the natureor cost of current pension promises.   With medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent ayear, the potential benefit liability of U.S. corporations isstaggering.   The Employee Benefit Research Institute, a non-profitorganization in Washington, estimates that non-governmentalemployers owe at least $168.7 billion in retiree health benefits,assuming medical inflation is brought under control. The GeneralAccounting Office puts the figure at over $200 billion.   ``Those benefits may have been granted on the assumption that thecosts would be relatively minor and could be paid for quite easilyout of current cash flow and current earnings as they wereincurred,'' Beresford said.   Some companies already are looking closely at how to minimizetheir retiree health insurance costs by restricting or eliminatingsuch benefits.   Employer groups are preparing to fight the rule, which could endup before Congress and be dramatically modified by the time thebattle is over, said Lee Seidler, an accounting specialist andsenior managing director of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Seidler believes the debate will postpone enactment of the rulesuntil at least 1995, and by then the impact will be dramaticallyreduced.   ``FASB will modify this thing, companies will reduce benefits toemployees and Congress will allow them to take money from overfundedpension funds and put it in underfunded health funds. That willrelieve the impact,'' Seidler said.   Companies will have six months to comment on the draft FASBproposal. Public hearings will follow in October and November in NewYork and Washington and a final rule is expected in late 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
