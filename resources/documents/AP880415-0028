I want first, last andalways to have a good treaty,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,D-W.Va., told reporters Thursday.   The Reagan administration has pushed for a ratification votebefore Reagan's May 29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev, but Byrd said there is a possible ``hole in the treaty''that first has to be filled.   That question revolves around whether the treaty bans so-called``futuristic'' weapons, using exotic technologies such as lasers,plasma, or ion beams.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said the treaty is not likely to come to theSenate floor before early May, after the chamber returns from aweek-long recess.   When the Senate finally votes, ratification is probable,according to both Byrd and Republican leaders. Ratificationrequires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators, and both parties say thetreaty will likely be supported by 88 to 90 senators.   The Armed Services Committee has been meeting behind closeddoors with administration officials, including chief treatynegotiator Maynard Glitman, to try to resolve the issue of whichtechnologies are banned.   The treaty doesn't mention futuristic weapons, but Glitman andadministration officials have said the Soviet Union understands thepact bars the possession or flight testing of all medium-rangeweapons, no matter how they are armed or operate.   The Armed Services panel has already endorsed the pact, but itis planning to issue another report on the ``futuristic'' weaponsissue, and Byrd said no floor action is likely before that reportis done.   Two former top Reagan administration officials said in lettersreleased Thursday they don't believe the treaty bans futuristicweapons.   The pair, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and formerArms Control and Disarmament Agency Director Kenneth Adelman,outlined their views in letters to the Armed Services Committee.   Weinberger wrote, ``I can simply state that there was nounderstanding of any kind that I knew about that the treaty coveredanything related to these so-called futuristic weapons.''   ``Certainly, there was no discussion or evaluation of themilitary sufficiency questions involved in banning futuristicweaponry that I ever participated in, and I never heard any othershaving such a discussion,'' said Weinberger.   ``Indeed, had there been any suggestions that `futuristic'weapons were banned, I would have opposed it in the strongestpossible terms, because it would have had an obvious adverse effecton (the Strategic Defense Initiative) for us to agree to anylimitation on any systems not yet designed or `futuristic' systems...'' Weinberger said.   Adelman said he never knew about any such ban that was discussedin National Security Council meetings he attended or in ``anymeeting with Soviet officials with which I am familiar.''   Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus,a private group, announced a nationwide campaign to defeat thetreaty or to delay the Senate vote.   Phillips said black umbrellas emblazoned with anti-treatyrhetoric would be sent to all senators to symbolize the campaign.   ``Open, the umbrella symbolizes the protective shield which, formore than four decades, has prevented Soviet domination andintimidation of Europe,'' said Phillips.   ``Closed, the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit ofappeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized (BritishPrime Minister) Neville Chamberlain's dealings with Adolph Hitlerat Munich precisely 50 years ago.''</TEXT></DOC>
