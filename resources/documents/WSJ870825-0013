Stephen Dakin, a vice president for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York, said traders didn't know whether the Bank of Japan was merely acting to &quot;calm the downside&quot; or will be in the market more actively to defend the dollar.    &quot;Market participants aren't so sure,&quot; Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader for Bank of Tokyo in New York, said. Last week, he said, &quot;we had no meaningful correction,&quot; or interruption of the trend, as the dollar fell to 142 yen from 150. But yesterday, he said, &quot;it was meaningful,&quot; as the currency moved as high as 143.40 yen from its lows around 141.    In late New York trading, the dollar receded to 141.92 yen from 142.23 late Friday but inched up to 1.8175 West German marks from 1.8145. The British pound fell fractionally to $1.6320 from $1.6325.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 142.25 yen.    The major activity yesterday took place early in the day in Tokyo, as reports said the Bank of Japan spent between $200 million and $400 million to support the sagging dollar. Traders said the central bank repeatedly sold yen and bought dollars, first when the dollar had sunk to near 141 yen, then when it stood at 141.55 and again at 141.90.    The dollar touched an intraday low of 140.90 yen in early trading in Sydney, Australia. It opened in Tokyo at 141.15.    The Japanese central bank's reported activity, along with a rumor -- later denied -- that Japan would curb exports to reduce its trade surplus, were enough to help the dollar close above 142 yen in Tokyo, at 142.68.    &quot;The market was short (or oversold) dollars; (it) wasn't looking for central bank intervention,&quot; Arthur C. Agostini, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. Word of the Bank of Japan's dollar purchases accordingly triggered a round of short-covering as traders scrambled to cut losses and lock in profit from earlier transactions.    Although the volume of the reported intervention was moderate by normal standards, the move was well-timed for a market caught leaning in the wrong direction.    &quot;Considering the market, probably it was all that was needed,&quot; Daniel E. Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. in New York, said. &quot;More probably would have been available if needed.&quot;    Still, traders were left confused about central bank intentions -- particularly after the Bank of Japan permitted the yen to recover in European and North American trading. They also noted the apparent absence from the market of the West German Bundesbank and U.S. Federal Reserve.    &quot;Now we have this extra uncertainty about what the attitude of the Bank of Japan is,&quot; Mr. Agostini said, after a week in which central banks essentially let the dollar fall. &quot;The question remains whether there will be any concerted intervention if the dollar continues to spiral downward.&quot;    Mr. Agostini said many of the short dollar positions that were &quot;scared out&quot; by Tokyo's reported intervention early yesterday were being re-established later because &quot;there was no follow-through on the intervention.&quot;    Traders also were still puzzled by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's reported remarks Friday that agreements the major industrial nations reached in February to defend certain currency ranges were &quot;very vague&quot; and that the yen's rise hadn't seriously affected the Japanese economy. The finance minister also indicated that market forces should dictate a currency's direction. Dealers took the comments as a signal that Tokyo was willing to let the dollar fall.    &quot;I'm still incredulous&quot; about Mr. Miyazawa's Friday statements, Mr. Dakin of UBS said. &quot;If you believe that, fine, but just don't say it. It's things like that that just encourage you not to buy dollars.&quot;    In North American trading, the yen received some support yesterday from the drop in oil prices, as Japan is much more dependent on imported petroleum than the U.S. is. Market sentiment remains bearish on the U.S. currency, with the Aug. 14 announcement of an unexpectedly wide U.S. trade deficit for June followed by what were considered disappointing data on U.S. economic growth Friday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $460.70 an ounce, up $3.80. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $460.02 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, Aug. 24, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
