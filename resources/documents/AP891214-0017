Aerospace industries are likely to decline in sales volume overthe next decade, according to a year-end industry report by theAerospace Industries Association.   This year's record sales are due primarily to delivery ofmilitary aircraft and related equipment that were ordered inprevious years and to a boom in commercial airliner sales,association president Don Fuqua said Wednesday.   Long-range declines are expected as a result of the prospect ofpeaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union and predicted defensebudget cuts, Fuqua said. Much of the decline will be offset bygains in civil aviation and commercial space programs, but theoverall result will be a modest decline, he said.   ``I do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defensespending cuts we know are coming,'' Fuqua said. ``We are braced forheavy weather, particularly among those AIA member companies mostdeeply committed to defense work.''   ``We do not expect impact of catastrophic dimension but rather amoderate decline in real, inflation-adjusted sales volume,'' Fuquasaid. ``The United States is not going to abdicate its globaldefense responsibilities, nor is the defense industry going out ofbusiness.''   The association also released the results of a survey whichshowed that 67 percent of its responding members, including most ofthe country's major aeronautical corporations, have a shortage ofscientists and engineers and 55 percent report a shortage ofproduction workers. More than 80 percent said they expect moreshortages in the future.   The problem is made more serious by rapid changes in thetechnology needed in aerospace industries, by a lack of youngpeople preparing for jobs with a technological focus, by thefailure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by thefact that U.S. students generally are doing poorly in science andmath, said the AIA study.   Fuqua and the report noted that U.S. students don't measure upto their foreign counterparts in science and math and fewer areentering those fields.   The aerospace official predicted that defense sales will besignificantly lower in the 1990s than in the decade just ending.But, he said, ``we're declining from an all-time peak.''   The industry will set a sales record in 1989 of $120.6 billion,and AIA is projecting another overall sales record next year of$137 billion, Fuqua said.   He said the statistics are based mostly on deliveries becausethere is a long lead time between the time an order is placed and amajor aerospace system is delivered.   ``The growing prospects for peaceful coexistence with the SovietUnion and the Warsaw Pact nations will exert an additional downwardpressure on the defense budget,'' Fuqua said.   But that will be offset partly by other opportunities foraerospace manufacturers, he said, including development of the U.S.space station, new emphasis on space science and a technologyeffort for missions to the moon, Mars and other bodies of the solarsystem.   The expected upturn in 1990 arises mostly from a ``dramaticincrease in commercial aircraft deliveries,'' Fuqua said. Jetlinermanufacturers are several years behind on their orders.   ``Market surveys suggest that airline traffic will double by theyear 2005 and that the world's airlines will need some 8,500 newtransports to handle the growth and replace older aircraft,'' hesaid.   Civil aircraft sales for 1989 will top $20 billion, a recordthat will be broken next year when they will go beyond $32 billion,Fuqua said.</TEXT></DOC>
