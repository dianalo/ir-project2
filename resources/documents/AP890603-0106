Michael S. Dukakis said Saturday his greatestregret in losing the presidential race was allowing George Bush tomalign Massachusetts, and swore to ``give the Republicans a dose oftheir own medicine.''   Dukakis stopped just short of apologizing to the 4,000 Democratsgathered for the state party's annual convention. Though he hasbeen under attack since coming home in defeat to face a mountingbudget deficit, many of the delegates said no apology was needed.   ``Fiorello LaGuardia, the late, great mayor of New York, used tosay, `When I make a mistake, it's a beaut,' '' Dukakis told thecrowd. ``And I made some beauts in the course of the campaign.   ``But what I regret most of all is that George Bush didn't onlysucceed in painting a distorted picture of Mike Dukakis and what Istood for. He also managed to put you down in the process,''Dukakis said.   ``He put down this great commonwealth and its people,'' headded. ``And I let him get away with it _ and I shouldn't have.''   During the presidential race, the Bush campaign attackedDukakis' environmental record by drawing attention to the pollutionin Boston Harbor, and sought to discredit the economic``Massachusetts Miracle.''   Delegates interrupted the speech repeatedly with applause. Somewaved signs that read ``Proud of Michael Dukakis.''   Dukakis then lambasted the Republicans with caustic wit thatsupporters might have wished he'd inflicted on George Bush.   ``There's a party whose idea of public safety is Seabrook! ... Aparty whose environmental hero is James Watt and whose program forcleaning up Boston Harbor was one boat ride last fall,'' he said.   ``They'd probably make Frank Lorenzo secretary of labor,'' headded, earning a big laugh from labor delegates sporting hats andpins attacking the besieged Eastern Airlines owner.   Dukakis has said he will not run for re-election for governornext year, but hasn't ruled out another bid for the presidency in1992. He promised to keep Massachusetts Democratic in 1990.   ``Let's shake off the doubts and the disclaimers,'' he said.``Let's give the Republicans a dose of their own medicine.''   Reaction to the speech was divided, with some saying Dukakisshould have offered more than a tepid apology, and othersmaintaining an apology would only give ``Duke-bashing'' criticsmore ammunition.   ``I think it was an important apology,'' said U.S. Rep. ChesterAtkins, chairman of the state Democratic Party. Atkins said thegovernor's decision to ``own up to the mistakes that have beenmade'' was the first step to restoring credibility.   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said while Dukakis acknowledged mistakesin his campaign, he did not take responsiblity for the deficit thatmushroomed while he was away on the campaign trail.   ``I think it would have been better to acknowledge error on thefinancial situation as well,'' Frank said.   While Dukakis was at the podium, however, some delegates weresizing up the floor, where three potential Democratic candidatesfor governor were trying to drum up support.   ``I think the bashing's over,'' said state Rep. Susan Tucker,D-Andover. ``He's on his way out and people recognize that. Theemphasis is on who's going to replace him.''</TEXT></DOC>
