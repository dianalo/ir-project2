The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Arthur Davis was pursued fortwo miles in Panama City on Sunday by a government military vehiclewith its siren blaring. It called the incident serious.   Sunday's communique signed by Justice Minister Rodolfo Chiari deLeon said the incident began when a police sergeant saw civiliansin three vehicles following the ambassador's car with ``anexaggerated display of automatic arms.''   ``We do not want to think that they are fabricating falseaccusations against our armed forces to justify an announcedinvasion of Panama, and we reiterate the intent of the Panamaniangovernment to protect the life and property of residents andforeigners, including North Americans,'' the communique said.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman PhyllisOakley escalated the administration's criticism of Panama over theincident.   ``We consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to beserious as always,'' she said today. ``We will take the necessarysteps to protect Americans. I am condemning the incident from thepodium; we regard the action as deliberate harassment.''   The United States is sending 1,300 additional troops to Panamaon Tuesday. Troops were loading weapons and supplies intohelicopters today in the United States in preparation.   American officials have said the forces are intended to protectU.S. bases and American citizens. Washington has declared it willnot use military force to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whoseleadership has been the focus of a national political and economiccrisis.   Sunday's edition of the government-run newspaper La Republicaquoted pro-government labor leaders as urging Panamanians toprepare for an American invasion when the additional troops beginarriving.   There are 10,000 troops stationed at the U.S. Southern Commandin Panama. Pentagon officials said more troops may be sent if theyare needed.   The chase on Sunday ended an otherwise calm Easter holiday andushered in a week of uncertainty for Panamanians. A Roman CatholicChurch offer to mediate an end to the country's political crisiswas set to expire at midnight tonight.   Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone said Davis was leaving thehome of Vatican Ambassador Jose Sebastian Laboa when the Panamanianvehicle ``began following immediately, picking them up rightoutside the gate.'' He said it tried to stop the chauffer-drivencar with its lights and sirens.   ``The ambassador's driver, in accordance with instructions, didnot stop. The ambassador was driven to his residence, and the othervehicle followed all the way,'' Kneebone said. The residences areabout two miles apart.   ``We consider this serious,'' Kneebone said. He declined tocomment on what security provisions Davis had but said they werenormal under the circumstances. No weapons were displayed in thechase, he said.   Embassy vehicles are clearly marked with special license plates.   Earlier Sunday, Kneebone said Davis had gone to pay his respectson Easter to the papal nuncio, who is dean of the diplomatic corpsin Panama.   Eric Arturo Delvalle, in hiding since he was ousted from thepresidency after he tried to fire strongman Noriega Feb. 25, hascalled for the United States to intervene militarily and remove thegeneral. Noriega is under indictment on U.S. drug-traffickingcharges.   Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the archbishop of Panama City,agreed to requests by several foreign governments to act asmediator in the dispute, and several opposition leaders said theywould back the idea under certain conditions.   McGrath set a midnight deadline for all parties to agree to thearrangement or the offer would be withdrawn. The government has notresponded.   The opposition conditions included guarantees that Noriega, headof the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behindthe civilian government, indicate a willingness to resign and toleave the country.   A letter made public Friday by three opposition leaders said anyagreement would have to be guaranteed by the church, fourgovernment officials to be named later, and the presidents of CostaRica and Panama.   Meanwhile, leaders of the National Civic Crusade, the mainopposition coalition, were considering Sunday whether to call off a2-week-old general strike that lost momentum last week.   The United States has frozen Panamanian assets in Americanbanks, choking the flow of dollars, the official currency inPanama. Banks have remained closed since March 3.   Most Panamanians are saving cash for essentials, and thousandsof families, especially in poorer areas, have had to turn tochurch-run food kitchens for their meals. The cash shortage haskept the government from paying its estimated 130,000 employees fora month.</TEXT></DOC>
