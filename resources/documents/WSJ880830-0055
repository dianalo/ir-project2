Set to Sell 1 Division, Consolidate 2 Others </HL><SO> </SO><CO> PSX </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pacific Scientific Corp. said it will try to sell its instrument division and will consolidate two other divisions whose revenues are expected to fall about 20% next year.    Pacific Scientific, which makes a variety of products for the aerospace, electronics and utility industries, said it expects to take an after-tax charge of about $4 million in the third quarter because of the consolidation.    However, the company said, it expects the charge to be &quot;substantially&quot; offset by a gain from selling Anaheim, Calif., real estate that is used by one of the divisions.    Pacific Scientific said its instrument division, located in Silver Spring, Md., has annual sales of about $30 million, but it didn't indicate an asking price for the unit. A spokesman said the company doesn't expect to realize a substantial gain on the sale.    The instrument unit is being sold because Pacific Scientific wants to focus on supplying equipment to other manufacturers rather than making its own final products, the spokesman said.    The company said two divisions that make equipment for the aerospace industry are expected to have combined revenue of about $50 million next year, down from about $65 million this year, largely because of lower demand for defense products.    Pacific Scientific plans to move one operation from Anaheim to a smaller facility in Southern California whose exact location hasn't been determined. Total employment of the two divisions will drop by about 20% from its current level of 677 people, the spokesman said.    Pacific Scientific shares closed at $13.25 yesterday, unchanged in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    For last year's third quarter, Pacific Scientific reported net income of $579,000 on revenue of $38.8 million. In this year's second quarter, the company had net income of $1.1 million on revenue of $45.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
