as a departmental computer in conjunction with workstations; and as a general processing host computer in medium-sizedcompanies; its target is to sell 5,000 of the M-730 group, and 1,500 of thenew Model 2A, over a three-year period; with it it added two new peripherals,the F6472 magnetic tape units with storage capacity of 200Mb per cartridgeand data transfer speed of 1.5Mbytes-per-second, and a new 1.89Gb6422CB3/B1/D1 3Mbyte-per-second disk drive.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Ltd has also established two new wholly-ownedandM;subsidiaries, Fujitsu Information Network Systems Ltd, and Fujitsu KobeSystems Ltd, the former being dedicated to the development and marking ofapplication packages for communications networks such as ISDN, the COMSCorporate network Management System, the CPNS Communication Processing NodeSystem and TCSI Telecommunication andamp; Computer Service Interface; it will startout with 40 people, growing to 220 by 1992; the other company is a spin-offof Fujitsu's Western Japan systems engineering branch, and will start with 60people, building a business supporting Fujitsu customers in themanufacturing, financial and distribution industries as well as developinguser applications.andM;- o -andM;Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard Co and Canon Inc are joining forces toandM;rewrite the Developer's Kit for Hewlett-Packard's NewWave environment forpersonal computers to the Japanese AX standard, which are based on IBM's ATspecification with Japanese-language processing: the new version of NewWave -which Hewlett built on top of Microsoft Windows - will enable developers tocreate more challenging AX programs.andM;- o -andM;Seiko-Epson Co has decided to move off-shore the manufacturing ofandM;all its Equity personal computers that are to be sold abroad: it plans todouble output in Portland, Oregon to 16,000 computers a month, and inTelford, Shropshire to 6,000 a month, while the plants in South Korea andSingapore will remain at the present levels of 10,000 and 20,000 a monthrespectively; the moves do not mean any relaxation back home, because itsfactory in Nagano, Japan, will increase monthly output of personal computersby 40% to 21,000, and the company's target is to have output running at anannual rate of 650,000 by year-end.andM;- o -andM;That NEC Corp survey of computer buyers, which found that womenandM;accounted for 5.2% of sales last year (CI No 1,214), has encouraged thecompany to create a marketing campaign that will be targeted specifically atwomen; it also found that 63.3% of its sample were first time buyers ofmicros last year, up from just 32.9% of the total two years ago.andM;-  o  -andM;NEC Corp has expanded main memory on its two mainframe families,andM;the 36-bit Acos System 2000 and the 32-bit Acos System 1500: the  2000 nowtakes up to 1Gb memory, while the 1500, 930 and 900 models now go up to500Mb.andM;- o -andM;As Japanese used to study at what was seen as the fount of allandM;knowledge, the US, a few years ago, so would-be technologists from all aroundthe world want to study with Japanese companies, reports Newsbytes: for fiveyears, Hitachi Ltd has admitted 10 foreign doctorate holders a year, but willraise the number of  places to 30 this year; Toshiba Corp has been taking twoBritish doctors a year but has raised the number of places to 15; NEC Corphas 26 foreign researchers in residence, and will take on another 10 thismonth, but Fujitsu Ltd at present has no such programme.andM;- o -andM;Canon Inc is developing technology to connect its multi-functionandM;NAVI office terminal to an integrated services digital network with theassistance of Nippon Telegrpah andamp; Telephone Corp: NAVI includes the functionsof telephone, personal computer, word processor, and facsimile machine, soCanon sees it as a natural as a piece of ISDN terminal equipment.andM;- o -andM;Just as its parent is targeting the Apple Macintosh with originalandM;peripherals, so Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard Co is doing the same for Japan'srunaway market leader in the personal computer wars, the NEC Corp PC-9801:first up is the HP PaintJet HP3630A colour ink-jet printer, which has gonedown well in the US, expecially among users of the Lotus Development CorpFreelance business graphics program, which is now available in a Japaneselanguage version for the PC-9801 family; it is charging $1,765 for the thingand is looking to sell 5,000 of the things in year one.andM;- o -andM;Fuji Xerox, already in the Sun Microsystems Sparc camp, will buyandM;Sun workstations OEM and resell them as terminals to its own J-Star documentprocessing system: the company plans to offer capability to read drawingscreated on the Sun workstation into its J-Star, to combine files, and alsouse the workstation as a sever processor on the J-Star network; formed as ajoint venture between the two firms under the fanciful name of Unisol, theoperation will also develop applications that will run on both machines andimplement existing software for the combination systems.andM;- o -andM;Tokyo-based software development organisation Birds SystemsandM;Research Institute has developed a program that it claims is able to readcomplex Japanese printed characters: running on a NEC Corp PC-9800 personalcomputer with an external expansion board and a scanner board, the system canscan five characters per second with over 99% percent precision, using ascanner from NEC or Sharp Corp; the software costs $4,500 - against $15,000for the last generation of Japanese character recognition software - andBirds is hoping to sell 6,000 copies of the package in year one.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
