Hudson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/28/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7</SO><CO>   U.GUI EUROP</CO><LP>   LONDON -- The longest-running financial scandal of theThatcher era neared a conclusion as a London jury convictedthe former chairman of Guinness PLC and three co-defendantsof charges arising from the company's 1986 takeover ofDistillers Co.   After a three-year investigation and a trial of more than100 days, a Southwark Crown Court jury found former GuinnessChairman Ernest Saunders, 55 years old, guilty of 12 of 13charges against him. Mr. Saunders, who resigned from Guinnessin 1987 after the scandal broke, allegedly conspired toinflate the company's stock price to help win its #2.53billion ($4.91 billion) bid, made in late 1986, forDistillers, a Scottish spirits company.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Saunders's son, James, said his father plans toappeal.   Much like the separate U.S. proceedings against arbitragerIvan Boesky and &quot;junk bond&quot; king Michael Milken, in Britainthe Guinness Affair -- as it was called -- came to symbolizethe excesses of the 1980s bull market and economicprosperity. As the investigation dragged on and targeted afew big Conservative Party contributors, the case also becamea political embarrassment to the Conservative government ofPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   The guilty verdict, though nearly four years in themaking, will enhance the oft-tarnished reputations of Britishfinancial regulators. After the scandal broke, Mrs.Thatcher's government accelerated adoption of a broad seriesof reforms in U.K. legislation on financial crime, insidertrading and corporate law. The Guinness case was the mostfar-reaching undertaken by the government's new white-collarcrime squad. And in London's financial district, it became amajor test of the government's mettle.   &quot;It is an important case because it demonstrates theauthorities' intention to prove that the new legislation . .. actually sticks and is made to work,&quot; said Peter Smith,partner in charge of the London office of managementconsultants Coopers Lybrand Deloitte.   &quot;Had there not been a guilty verdict, it might have beenopen house for quite a lot of undesirable practices&quot; inLondon's financial district, Jonathan Guinness, a formerGuinness director, told the British Broadcasting Corp. Aspokesman for the London-based spirits company, which wasnever implicated in any of the charges, declined to comment.   But the case was hardly a resounding victory for Britishprosecutors or the legal system. The criminal inquiry didn'tget very far until some help came in 1987 from the U.S.,where investigators found a link between the Guinness andBoesky cases.   Even then, the trial's start was repeatedly delayed, and amistrial was declared after some jurors pleaded that theycouldn't withstand what promised to be a six-month hearing.And the trial that ended yesterday, after six days of jurydeliberations, is only the first of two: Mr. Saunders andthree other defendants are expected to go on trial in Octoberon related charges.   Mr. Saunders, who now claims to be impoverished, faces amaximum penalty of 90 years in prison from yesterday's juryverdict. His sentencing is scheduled for today.   Convicted along with Mr. Saunders on the conspiracycharges were British financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, and GeraldRonson, 50, chairman of Heron International PLC, a bigBritish property concern. A fourth defendant, stockbrokerAnthony Parnes, 45, was found guilty of false accounting andtheft charges. Sir Jack faces a maximum penalty of 45 yearsin prison; Mr. Ronson, 31 years, and Mr. Parnes, 68.   The charges all stem from the tactics Mr. Saunders and hiscolleagues used to ensure Guinness's victory in the 1986takeover battle for Distillers. By the then-decorousstandards of British takeover fights, the Guinness contestagainst rival bidder Argyll Group PLC was unusually nasty.Under Mr. Saunders, the once-sleepy Guinness company in the1980s had embarked on a spending spree to become a globalforce in the brewing and spirits business.   Because both Guinness and Argyll were offering their ownshares for Distillers, the success of the takeover battledepended partly on how well Guinness and Argyll sharesperformed on London's stock exchange. During the trial,prosecutors alleged that Mr. Saunders and colleagues tried toinflate Guinness's share price.   Among other things, prosecutors said he authorized paymentof #5.8 million to Mr. Ronson, partly to indemnify himagainst losses on the #25 million of Guinness stock that hebought.   The prosecutors also alleged that Sir Jack received a feeof #3 million from Guinness, and Mr. Parnes #3.4 million, fortheir help in arranging the illegal share-support scheme. Thedefendants maintained that the payments were normal businesstransactions.   ---   Craig Forman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
