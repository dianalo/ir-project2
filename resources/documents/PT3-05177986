Two joined and closed loops are formed by the device, a first loop      capturing a first object and the second loop capturing the second object      tethering them together. The device has a line of flexible, strong      material with a slip buckle. An end of the line remote from the slip      buckle is passed through the buckle to form a noose. The noose is made to      either encircle a first object or pass through an opening defined by the      first object, either way capturing it. The second loop can be formed by      joining an opening defined by the line remote from the noose to at least      one other opening defined by the line between the noose and the remote      opening. The second loop can be closed by a shackle passing through the      joined openings, preferably the shackle of a lock. The lock can be secured      to the belt and the belt can be worn around a person's waist when not      being used to tether objects. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention relates in general to adjustable, loop forming, lockable      straps and the like used for securing movable objects to fixed anchors,      such as permanent posts and rails, to protect the objects from being      carried off by persons not authorized to do so by the respective owners of      the objects. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The prior art presents cables and chains and the like. They are used by      passing them through a captured opening in the object to be protected and      wrapping them around an anchoring bar. The ends are then locked together      by means of a padlock linking eyelets at the ends, or by means of joining      a male half of a lock affixed to one end and a female half of the lock      affixed to the other end. These prior art devices cannot be used unless      there exists in the protected object a confined opening through which they      can pass. Skis and ski poles typically have no such openings. </PAR><PAR>  There exist devices to lock skis and poles to a fixed anchor but they are      bulky and not safely transportable by a person while skiing. This      particularly becomes a problem when there exists multiple ski lodges      distant from each that a skier wishes to visit. For example, there may be      a ski lodge at the base of a mountain and one at the top of a mountain. If      a skier rides a ski lift and carries a prior art locking device to the top      of the mountain to secure his or her skis while visiting the upper lodge,      the rigidity and bulkiness of the prior art devices make it unsafe for the      skier carry the device downhill while skiing. Thus at the base of the      mountain the skier has no means to secure the skis. </PAR><PAR>  Two very significant advantages of this invention over the prior art are      that this invention can protect objects from thieves even though the      objects, such as skis, do not have confined openings, and further, that      this invention can be safely and attractively transported by a person even      while skiing. It is worn about the waist as a colorful decorative belt,      but when removed it can function as a relatively unbreakable locking      device. </PAR><PAR>  Other advantages and attributes will be readily discernible upon a reading      of the text hereinafter. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention presents a device for lockingly tieing a moveable object to      a fixed bar, such as a post or a rail comprising a line of flexible      material, means for making a noose with the line, the noose being used to      secure the object to the line, means for both preventing the noose from      becoming loosened and for lockingly closing a portion of the line outside      the noose around the fixed bar to secure the line to the bar. In one      embodiment the invention has an elongated, flexible strap and a slip      buckle affixed to one end of the strap for creating a noose whenever the      end of the strap remote from the slip buckle is drawn through the slip      buckle, the size of the noose being proportional to the amount of strap      drawn through the slip buckle, the noose being used to capture the object      or alternately the fixed bar. An opening defined by the strap at the end      of the strap remote from the slip buckle and a plurality of openings      spaced along the strap are used for the purpose of selectively limiting      the maximum size of the noose in order to keep the thing captured by the      noose captured and for the purpose of closing the free end of the strap      means back upon the strap means in order to capture the bar means or      alternatively, respectively, the object. A locking means having a shackle      is used to lockingly link the opening at the end of the strap means remote      from the slip buckle with a selected one of the plurality of openings      spaced along the strap which is outside of the noose, the locking means      being too large to pass through the slip buckle. </PAR><PAR>  An object of this invention is to provide a lockable strap means which is      easily and conveniently transportable by being worn about the waist of a      person as a belt, but which functions as a relatively unbreakable means      for securing a transportable object to a fixed bar, such as a post or      rail. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to prevent casual thievery of      transportable property and to make it necessary that a thief perform more      difficult and more noticeable actions, such as using cable or bolt cutters      and other instruments, in order to take away transportable property      secured by this invention. </PAR><PAR>  Other objects of this invention will either be expressly discussed      hereinafter or will be clear from a reading of the text. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a pictorial view of the invention </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a plan view of a first broad side of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a plan view of a second broad side of the other side of the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken along lines 4--4 of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a pictorial view of the invention securing a pair of skis and ski      poles to a fixed rail. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a pictorial view of the invention securing a skate board to a      fixed post. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a pictorial view of the invention securing a snow board to a      fixed rail. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a pictorial view of the invention securing a bicycle to a fixed      rail. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a partial edge view showing means by which a lock means is      attached. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1-4 illustrate an embodiment of this invention in the form of a      narrow strip of flexible material, i.e. a strap. A web 2 of the strap      comprises a durable and strong fabric, such as durable nylon and the like.      A length of relatively unbreakable, but flexible cable 4 circumscribes the      web in a closed loop. Along the sides, i.e., the long edges, of the web      lengths of the cable extend through and are disposed in marginal hems 6 of      the web. The cable extends from hem to hem at and beyond the ends of the      web forming at one end a slip buckle 8, and forming a U-shaped loop 10 at      the other end. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1-4 again, the cable loop forming the slip buckle 8 is      flattened and reinforced by a stiffening sleeve 12. The flattened loop      permits easier passage therethrough of the strap. As will be further      explained, by passing the opposite end of the strap through the slip      buckle, a noose 14 is formed (as illustrated in FIG. 1) which closes      tighter as more of the strap is drawn through the slip buckle. </PAR><PAR>  The cable can be a steel cable material such as the kind commonly used in      bicycle locking cables. By relatively unbreakable, as used herein, is      meant that the length cannot be cut except by use of special steel cutting      instruments which exert great cutting force. This invention will, of      course, not prevent a determined thief with special cutting instruments      from taking an object secured by this invention, but it will prevent more      casual thievery, and it will force a thief to perform obtrusive acts in      order to accomplish his or her purpose. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1-4 again, suitably spaced along the strap are grommets      16. As will be further explained, the grommets provide a means for fixing      the size of a noose 14. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 5, an example of the invention in use is illustrated. It      is being used to tie a pair of skis 18 and poles 20 to a fixed rail 22. In      this use, a noose 12A was created by passing the end of the strap opposite      the slip buckle 8 through the slip buckle. The skis and poles were either      inserted through the noose or the noose was created around them between      front and back portions of a ski boot bindings, 24A and 24B. The noose was      tightened to at least a size too small for either portion of the boot      bindings to pass through. The loose portion of the strap was wrapped      around the fixed rail and the opening defined by the U-shaped cable loop      10 was made to register with a grommet 16A, and the shackle of a padlock      26 was inserted through both openings and locked. The padlock shackle not      only closes and locks the strap loop 28 which is around the rail, but it      also prevents the slip buckle from traveling further along the strap noose      which would have the effect of loosening the noose 12A. This is because      the slip buckle opening is suitably sized to permit the strap to pass      therethrough but not the padlock. Grommet 16A was chosen to keep the noose      tight enough to keep either portion of the ski boot bindings from passing      therethrough, thus capturing the skis and poles in the noose. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 6, another example of the invention in use is      illustrated. It is being used to secure a skate board 30 to a fixed pole      or post 32. As in the previous example, a noose 12B is created by passing      the end of the strap opposite the slip buckle 8 through the slip buckle.      The noose was made to capture a stem portion (not shown) of a truck 34.      (The stem portion affixes the truck to the board and the truck carries the      wheels.) The capture was made by tightening the noose to a size too small      to permit passage therethrough of the truck. As before, the loose portion      of the strap was wrapped around a fixed bar, in this case a fixed vertical      post, and the opening defined by the U-shaped cable loop 10 was made to      register with a grommet 16B, and the shackle of a padlock 26 was inserted      through both openings and locked. The padlock shackle not only closes and      locks the strap loop 38 which is around the post, but it also prevents the      slip buckle from traveling further along the strap noose which would have      the effect of loosening the noose 12B. Grommet 16B was chosen because it      was suitably disposed on the strap. Restraining the slip buckle at the      point of grommet 16B is sufficient to keep the noose tight enough around      the truck stem to maintain capture of the truck and thereby the skate      board. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 7, another example of the invention in use is      illustrated. It is being used to secure a snow board 40 to a fixed rail      42. As in the previous examples, a noose 12C is created but there are two      significant differences. In this example the strap was passed through a      confined opening 44 in a boot binding 46 that is affixed to the snow board      before the noose is created, i.e., closed. In this way the snow board was      captured by the noose, but not by the tightness of the noose, rather by      the fact that noose is a closed loop which extends through a confined      opening 44. As before, the loose portion of the strap was wrapped around a      fixed bar, in this case a fixed rail, and the opening defined by the      U-shaped cable loop 10 was made to register with a grommet 16C, and the      shackle of a padlock 26 was inserted through both openings and locked.      Grommet 16C PG,10 was chosen because it was beyond the noose and therefore      it was usable to accomplish closure of the loop 46 around the rail,      closure being accomplished, as likewise in the other examples, by the      linking of the U-shaped loop 10 with the grommet 16C by the padlock      shackle. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 7, another example of the invention in use is      illustrated. It is being used to secure a bicycle 48 to a fixed post 50.      In this example, the strap was passed through two confined openings before      the closed noose 12D was created. It was passed through a confined opening      52 in the frame in order to secure the frame to the post, and it was      passed through a confined opening 54 in the front wheel to secure the      front wheel also. (Thieves often detach wheels of chained bicycles if they      are unable to steal the entire bicycle.) In this way both the bicycle      frame and a bicycle wheel were captured by the noose, but not by the      tightness of the noose, rather by the fact that noose is a closed loop      which extends through the confined openings, 52 and 54. As before, the      loose portion of the strap was wrapped around a fixed bar, in this case a      fixed post, and the opening defined by the U-shaped cable loop 10 was made      to register with a grommet 16D, and the shackle of a padlock 26 was      inserted through both openings and locked. Grommet 16D was chosen because      it was beyond the noose and therefore it was usable to accomplish closure      of the loop 56 around the post, closure being accomplished, as likewise in      the other examples, by the linking of the U-shaped loop 10 with the      grommet 16D by the padlock 26 shackle. </PAR><PAR>  While the above examples show a noose capturing the protected object and      the free end of the strap being wrapped around a post or a rail and locked      to a grommet, it should be understood that alternatively the free end need      not be wrapped around anything if the thing to which the object is being      anchored has a grommet or grommet-like confined opening to which the      U-shaped loop can be locked. For example, the noose could be made to      capture a part of a jet ski while the free end could be locked to an      eyelet anchored in a dock piling by registering the U-shaped loop with the      eyelet and locking the shackle of the padlock through both. </PAR><PAR>  It should also be noted that this invention can be used in a manner      somewhat reverse to the uses described above. The noose 14 can be used to      capture a fixed bar (e.g. post or rail), and the free end of the strap can      be used to capture the object to be protected. The free end can loop      through a confined opening with the U-shaped loop being locked to a      suitable grommet, or the U-shaped loop can be locked to a grommet or      grommet equivalent defined by the object. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1-4 and 8, additional features of this invention are      illustrated. A tongue of fabric 60 is affixed to the web 2 at the U-shaped      loop 10 end of the strap. The fabric tongue extends in a line with the      strap and on a first side has an area of fastener hooks 62 which mates      with an area of fastener loops 64 on a facing surface of the web proximate      the slip buckle 8. The hook and loop fastener areas are so disposed and      are of such extents that they face each other to allow a person to wrap      the strap around his or her waist passing the end of the strap opposite      the slip buckle 8 through the slip buckle. The hook and loop fastener      areas permit the person to tighten the noose around his or her waist and      secure it in that tightened position by mating, i.e., pushing together,      the hook and loop fastener areas. Wearing the strap around one's waist is      an easy way for one to carry this invention without inconvenience. For      example, a skier can carry this invention about his or her waist, and      thereby carry the means to lock up his or her skis, in a way which does      not interfere with the activity of skiing. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 9, a fabric tongue 66 affixed to the slip buckle end of      the strap provides a means for securing the padlock 26 to the strap on an      inside of the strap, inside being the side facing a person's body when the      person is wearing the strap about the person's waist as described      hereinabove. Proximate the slip buckle and located on the inside of the      strap is an area of fastener loop material 68 which is so disposed and      sufficiently extends to mate with a fastener hook area 70 on the inside      face of the fabric tongue 66. The padlock 26 has both broad sides covered      with fastener hook or loop material. In operation the padlock is secured      to the strap by sandwiching it between the strap and the folded back      tongue 66 as illustrated in FIG. 9. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing description and drawings were given for illustrative purposes      only, it being understood that the invention is not limited to the      embodiments disclosed, but is intended to embrace any and all      alternatives, equivalents, modifications and rearrangements of elements      falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the following      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
