However, Secretary of State James Baker III has reiterated hissupport for Gregg's nomination to the high-profile diplomatic byPresident Bush, Gregg's former boss.   Gregg's nomination, which will be debated by the Senatecommittee next month, is one of several that have run intoopposition in the light of disclosures about the Iran-Contra affairthat have surfaced in the trial of former White House aide OliverNorth.   On Thursday, Michael Armacost, Bush's nominee for ambasasdor toJapan, ran into questioning about documents indicating he attendeda 1985 meeting at which it was decided to release military aid toHonduras in return for that nation's continued backing of theNicaraguan Contras.   Armacost denied attending that meeting but promised to searchhis records and report back to the panel. The congressional sourcessaid Friday that Armacost, who served in the No. 3 post at theState Department in the Reagan administration, will tell thecommittee he was invited to attend the White House meeting but didnot go.   Also on Thursday, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called Baker toask that Gregg's nomination for South Korea be withdrawn, saidcongressional sources commenting only on condition they not benamed. Margaret Tutwiler, Baker's spokeswoman, confirmed thatCranston called the secretary but declined to say why.   Baker then talked to Gregg ``and the status of the nominationremains the same. The president supports his nominee,'' she saidFriday.   When Bush was vice president, Gregg was his national securityadviser. His name is mentioned in several documents that becamepublic during the 1987 congressional investigation of theIran-Contra affair.   The final report from that investigation says that Gregg, aformer CIA official, knew that North was directing the Contrasupply effort _ at a time when official U.S. aid was banned _ butthat he contended he did not tell Bush.   Another nomination facing some opposition is that of JohnNegroponte as ambassador to Mexico. Negroponte was ambassador toHonduras from 1981 to 1985 and some Democrats want to know whetherhe was involved in the inducements promised the Honduran governmentin exchange for its support of the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
