Wildlife Federation attorney Robert Irvin said he would appealthe decision by U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Harris to the U.S.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.   The federation had asked the court to require the CommerceDepartment to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to equip theirnets with turtle excluder devices, or TEDs.   Five conservation groups, meanwhile, filed suit against CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher, alleging his actions on behalf ofshimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands ofendangered sea turtles.   In a lawsuit filed late Monday in federal court here, theorganizations claim Mosbacher acted unlawfully when he suspendedregulations that require shrimpers to use TEDs, which prevent seaturtles from becoming ensnarled in their nets and drowning.   The lawsuit also seeks to force Mosbacher to resume enforcementof the suspended regulations on TEDs.   Mosbacher suspended TEDs regulations after shrimpers, angry abouthaving to use the devices, which they claim reduce their catch by asmuch as one-third, blockaded shipping channels along the Texas GulfCoast.   Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in aseparate lawsuit by the Wildlife Federation, Mosbacher then orderedshrimpers who don't use TEDs to limit their trawling times to 105minutes at prescribed intervals.   Michael J. Bean, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,said there has been ``no sign'' that Gulf Coast shrimpers arecomplying with the limited trawl times.   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said the department is waiting``for the courts to make a judgment about the appropriateness of ourcourse of action'' but declined to comment further because thematter is in litigation.   According to the lawsuit, Mosbacher's decision suspending theTEDs regulations ``and replacing them with ineffective, inadequateinterim regulations is causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs andtheir members by depriving them of the opportunity to study,observe, photograph and otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtleson their nesting beaches and in coastal waters.''   Filing the suit are the Environmental Defense Fund, NationalAudubon Society, Center for Marine Conservation, Greenpeace-U.S.A.and Defenders of Wildlife.</TEXT></DOC>
