According to a lecture and slide show presented by Soviet healthofficials over the last week in Washington, Baltimore andCambridge, Mass., the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminatedbone meal fed to livestock, whose meat, in turn, caused the deathsof 66 people in Sverdlovsk, a city of 1.2 million in the UralMountains.   The long-awaited Soviet explanation ``leaves many questionsunanswered,'' said Gary B. Crocker, a State Department analystspecializing in questions relating to Soviet military use ofbiological and chemical weapons. ``It does not fit with theevidence and facts we have collected on the issue,'' he said.   The Carter administration had demanded a full accounting fromthe Soviets in 1980, saying it had ``disturbing indications'' thatthe epidemic was caused by ``some sort of lethal biological agent.''   And in 1986, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency releaseda report alleging that the anthrax came from the Microbiology andVirology Institute, a top-secret military research facility inSverdlovsk.   The Pentagon report said ``a pressurized system probablyexploded'' at the institute, spewing as much as 22 pounds ofanthrax spores into the air, and that ``hundreds'' of Sovietcitizens died.   Anthrax, an infectious disease which occurs naturally, isconsidered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons. A 1975treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biologicalweapons and significant quantities of biological agents, but allowsresearch ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses.   James Oberg, author of the recent book ``Uncovering SovietDisasters,'' said he believes the Soviet health officials ``aretelling the truth'' in blaming the outbreak on a batch ofcontaminated meat rather than germ-warfare experiments. ``But theyare not telling the whole truth,'' said Oberg.   ``They should have said this eight or nine years ago,'' saidOberg, who urged the Soviets to open the Sverdlovsk researchfacility to Western observers. ``The damage has been done,'' hesaid. ``It will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undothe damage that Soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted oninternational relations.''   The Soviets had long denied the U.S. allegations, but hadoffered little evidence to refute them. The more detailed rebuttallast week came from Dr. Pyotr N. Burgasov, former deputy Soviethealth minister, Dr. Vladimir N. Nikiforov, chief infectiousdisease specialist at the Moscow Institute for the AdvancedTraining of Physicians, and Dr. Vladimir P. Sergiyev, of the Soviethealth ministry.   The heart of their argument, bolstered by gory autopsy slides,was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines,indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax.   But the DIA report said ``hundreds of Soviet citizens died frominhalation of anthrax,'' and that others suffered after eating themeat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores.   The Soviet officials declined to answer questions about the workperformed at the Sverdlovsk research lab. But, in circumstantialrefutation of the U.S. allegations, they said no one at the labbecame ill during the outbreak.   Moreover, the Soviets denied that any military personnel wereinvolved in efforts to contain, control and clean up the epidemic,a contention that contradicts U.S. intelligence reports thatsoldiers were among the first victims and that military chemicalwarfare teams may have been called in to fight the contamination.   A number of American scientists who saw the presentation saidthe Soviets made a good case. Dr. Philip Brachman, of EmoryUniversity, called it a ``landmark report.''   Dr. Alexander Langmuir, the former chief epidemiologist at theNational Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said he found theSoviet version credible.   And Harvard University biologist Matthew Meselson, who organizedthe Soviet visit, was quoted by The Washington Post as saying hefound the Soviet explanation ``completely plausible and consistentwith what we know from the literature and other recordedexperiences with animal and human anthrax.''   In the past, Meselson and Brachman have acted as consultants tothe government on alleged Soviet biological weapons. But governmentofficials said they remained skeptical and wanted to see a lengthypublished account that the Soviets first promised in 1986 but whichhas not yet appeared.   The Soviets still have not given a full accounting of theepisode to their own citizens, and some of the data offered to theAmerican audiences were at odds with past Soviet explanations.   Nikiforov, a member of the visiting Soviet team, wrote in May1980 that in March and April 1979 ``isolated cases of anthrax amonghumans were recorded.''   A Soviet Ministry of Health official, Nikolai Antonov, told aworld health conference in Switzerland in September 1986 that theoutbreak came after ``undisciplined workers'' threw contaminatedmeat into garbage cans, and that stray dogs spread the meat to manyneighborhoods in Sverdlovsk.</TEXT></DOC>
