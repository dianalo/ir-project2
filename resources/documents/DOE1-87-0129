Plasma energyvolumetric density and its total energy before and after its interactionwith a beam are estimated. The given experimental results show that majorpart of relativistic beam energy (up to 65 %) with its collective interactionis transferred from the beam to plasma for its heating. This estimationtakes no account of the beam energy losses for SHF-radiation, X-ray radiation,acceleration of part of the beam electrons in excited SHF-fields et al.</TEXT></DOC>
