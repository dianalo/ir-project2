PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> CARTHAGE, Tenn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the family hometown as his backdrop, Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. formally declared he was running for president as a &quot;Son of the South&quot; with the experience and youthful vigor to match Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev at the bargaining table.    Standing in front of the old courthouse, Mr. Gore reminded two busloads of reporters and a crowd of several thousand supporters that Carthage and the rest of what he called the new South, &quot;eagerly anticipates the new powerful role the South will play in selecting the presidential nominee next year.&quot;    On March 8, &quot;Super Tuesday,&quot; Democrats will go to the polls in as many as 20 states, 14 of them in the South, including Tennessee. The dark-haired, 39-year-old Mr. Gore is aiming his campaign straight at those primary states, without much mention that he attended St. Albans Preparatory School in Washington, D.C., and Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.    For now, at least, he boasts that he is the only Southerner in the race.    He takes as his role model Woodrow Wilson, another Southerner, who he says was choosen 75 years ago by a divided and defeated Democratic Party to &quot;unite and lead the party and the nation.&quot;    Sen. Gore stated: &quot;I believe they -- the Democrats -- are ready to do so again.&quot;    Mr. Gore, elected to the Senate in 1984 after serving eight years in the House, also likened his mission to those of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. But, Southerner though he may be, he made no reference to Lyndon Johnson or Jimmy Carter.    Sen. Gore said that some people have asked him, &quot;why don't you wait&quot; to run for president? After all, if elected, Sen. Gore would be the youngest president in American history.    The same question could be put to the nation, Sen. Gore told the shirt-sleeve crowd broiling in the midday sun. &quot;Are we ready,&quot; he asked, &quot;for the challenge of our future now, or are we content to wait? I believe we are ready now.&quot;    Joining Sen. Gore on the platform was his 79-year-old father, Albert Gore Sr., who served 32 years in the House and Senate. Also on hand, in a flaming red dress, was Sen. Gore's wife Tipper. She is something of a celebrity herself after the recent publication of her book &quot;Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society,&quot; an attack upon explicit sex and violence on television and in movies, videos and rock music.    Sen. Gore joins five others who have announced they are seeking the Democratic presidential nomination: Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and Paul Simon of Illinois, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. The Rev. Jesse Jackson hasn't announced formally, although he too is running.    In his speech, Sen. Gore failed to stake out any special themes or issues for his campaign, except to note whenever he could that he was young and Southern.    He said his first promise to the American people would be to fire immediately &quot;any government official who steals from the American people or lies to the United States Congress.&quot; He said his second pledge is &quot;to restore respect for common sense in managing the business of government.&quot;    He vowed to combat unfair trade practices overseas, create an agricultural policy that works, help the homeless, build strong families with strong values, and fight crime and violence.    And in a line that seemed to puzzle the Carthaginians, he said that &quot;the ancient practice of human sacrifice, once commonplace throughout the world, is now obsolete.&quot;    He ended his speech by noting that the Soviet Union &quot;for the first time in at least a generation,&quot; is led by a man &quot;who combines youthful energy and innovation with experience. The free world urgently needs a leader who can match him, test him, bargain with him and make the most of this possibly historic opportunity for a safer, saner world.&quot; He left the crowd in no doubt that he had himself in mind as Mr. Gorbachev's challenger.    After finishing his speech here, he took off in a chartered jet to make another one in New Hamphire, and was scheduled to fly on through the night to Iowa. </TEXT></DOC>
