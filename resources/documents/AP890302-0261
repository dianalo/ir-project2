Several of Eastern's competitors said Wednesday they areassembling plans to respond to a possible walkout Saturday by theMachinists union, which could send passengers booked on Easternscurrying to other airlines. Eastern carries an average of 100,000passengers a day.   In addition, some carriers are mapping strategy to keep operatingin the event of a secondary boycott by the Machinists, who havethreatened to picket other airlines over the Eastern dispute.   To absorb the passenger spillover from a strike againstMiami-based Eastern, some competitors plan to roll out extrasections _ an extra plane for existing flights.   Pan Am Corp., for example, plans to operate a ``double shuttle''on its service linking New York with Boston and Washington if astrike occurs. Pan Am and Eastern compete fiercely with theirprofitable hourly shuttle services.   Starting Monday morning during peak travel hours, the Pan Amshuttle would have flights every half-hour instead of the currenthourly take-offs, said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon. At``prime'' peak hours, even more flights could be added as needed,she said.   Pan Am, which also vies with Eastern in the lucrative Floridamarket, also plans to put extra sections on some flights and switchto larger aircraft on others.   Airlines admit, though, that it's difficult to actually add newflights to their schedules in a pinch.   ``We don't have a lot of extra aircraft sitting on the groundthat we can throw into the schedule,'' said Delta Air Linesspokesman Jim Lundy, adding that Delta might add one or two flightsat the most.   Atlanta-based Delta, one of Eastern's closest competitors, vieswith the besieged carrier in the Florida and Puerto Rican markets.Like many of the airline spokesmen polled, Lundy said Delta believesit can handle most of the surplus with its current seat capacity,even if the strike spills into the busy Easter-spring vacationtravel time.   Several Eastern rivals said Wednesday they still hadn't decidedwhether they will honor Eastern tickets in the event of a walkout.   As a strike deadline of midnight EST Friday set by the militantEastern Machinists looms, hope is fading for a last-minutesettlement of the 16-month contract dispute. The National MediationBoard has recommended that President Bush declare a presidentialemergency, a move that would delay any work stoppage for at least 60days.   AFL-CIO officials, meanwhile, said Tuesday they would urge their14 million members to picket, boycott and otherwise rally againstEastern nationwide if the Machinists strike.   Machinists said they too would picket Eastern's sister carrier,Continental Airlines, plus other airlines, ships, railroads andother transportation services covered by the federal Railway LaborAct.   ``We do not expect any impact at Continental from the Easternsituation,'' said Ned Walker, a spokesman for non-union Continentalin Houston, which like Eastern is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.``There will be no service disruption whatsoever.''   Just in case of a sympathy action, Walker said, Continental ismaking contingency operating plans. He declined to give details.   So are industry leader United Airlines and USAir Group Inc.,according to their press representatives, who also declined toelaborate.   ``Unequivocally, United Airlines has a plan,'' said spokeswomanSara Dornacker at the Chicago heaquarters of United.</TEXT></DOC>
