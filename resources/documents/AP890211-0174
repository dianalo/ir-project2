The steam boileroperators of the American economy do something about it.   The boiler operators are the little-known Federal Reservefunctionaries who add steam to the economy or take it away bymanipulating the reserves of the banking system.   The importance of their manipulations became obvious Friday whenthe Labor Department reported wholesale inflation in Januaryskyrocketed to an annual rate of 12.7 percent.   It was apparent, too, when major banks raised their prime rate to11 percent _ the highest level since 1984.   The combination of high rates and high inflation leaves theFederal Reserve in a delicate position:   Should it push rates even higher and risk triggering a recession?   Or should it leave rates where they are and risk allowinginflation to rage out of control?   The policy decisions are made in secret by the Federal OpenMarket Committee, a group of 12 Fed governors and regional Fed bankpresidents.   The people who carry out those decisions _ the steam boileroperators _ sit on the eighth floor of an imposing ItalianRenaissance-style building near Wall Street, the home of the NewYork Federal Reserve Bank.   Joan E. Lovett runs the 20-person open market trading desk. Shereports to Peter D. Sternlight, who in turn answers to the FederalOpen Market Committee.   Unlike ordinary bond traders, Fed traders usually enter themarket just once a day, and they don't care about profits. Theironly job is to keep excess banking reserves at the level specifiedby the Open Market Committee.   The bedrock assumption is that banks will lend up to the limitpermitted by their level of reserves. If banks get more reserves,they will increase their lending. If they lose reserves they willhave to cut back lending.   If the Fed wants to stoke the furnace of the economy, it buysTreasury bills in the open market. The cash it spends for theTreasury bills ends up as extra reserves on the books of commercialbanks. The banks increase lending and the economy expands.   Conversely, selling Treasury bills drains reserves from thebanking system and banks have to cut back on lending.   The Fed traders monitor the federal funds rate, which is how muchbanks charge each other for the overnight loans they need to meettheir reserve requirements.   The Fed can make direct loans to the banks at what it calls thediscount rate. But borrowing at the discount ``window'' is aprivilege, not a right, and banks use it sparingly.   If the fed funds rate gets too high, the open market desk injectsreserves into the system by buying Treasury bills. If the rate dropsthey sell bills.   The Fed also trades in other government securities, but lessfrequently. No small player, it typically does transactions of $2billion or $3 billion at once.   For short-term fine-tuning, the Fed can inject reservestemporarily through repurchase agreements, known as ``repos.''Customers sell Treasury bills to the Fed with the agreement torepurchase them soon, usually the next day.   To drain reserves temporarily, the Fed does matched sale-purchaseagreements, or ``matched sales.'' The Fed sells securities tocustomers and agrees to buy them back a few days later.   Not every Fed move is fraught with significance. For instance,the Fed drains reserves every month to compensate for deposits ofgovernment checks.   In the face of turmoil in the markets and uncertainty about theeconomy's direction, the goal of the Fed's steam boiler operators issimply stability.   ``Achieving this in the face of very large flows of funds in andout of the economy which are not under our control, that's the skillof the open market desk,'' said Peter Bakstansky, a New York Fedspokesman.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs Feb. 13.</NOTE></DOC>
