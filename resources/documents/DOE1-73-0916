<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-73-0916 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes a gas turbine engine with a variable pitch rotatablepropulsor blade, including means for varying the pitch of the blade,air control means comprising: a platform fixedly attached to a radiallyinner end of the blade. The platform is generally positioned in a firstopening in a rotatable annular surface, and the platform and surfacedefine outer and inner spaces, so that in a first position correspondingwith blade pitch for steady state altitude cruise power operation ofthe engine an edge portion of the platform substantially conforms tothe surface. In a second position corresponding with a blade pitch fortakeoff power operation of the engine, the edge portion is displacedradially outwardly from the surface thereby allowing fluid communicationbetween the outer and inner spaces.</TEXT></DOC>
