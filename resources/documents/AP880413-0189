The tribunal in the West German state of Hesse decided this weekto turn the case of Mohammed Hamadi over to a juvenile court todecide if he should be tried as a minor or as an adult.   If convicted as an adult he could receive a life term in prison,but as a juvenile, his maximum sentence would be 10 years.   ``We are urging that if Germany tries Hamadi in juvenile court,they try him as an adult, where he could receive the maximumpenalty of life imprisonment in connection with the crimes of thehijacking including murder and hostage taking,'' Justice Departmentspokesman John Russell said.   ``We would be very disappointed if the court tries Hamadi as ajuvenile, therefore making him eligible for far less severepunishment,'' he said.   Hamadi is awaiting trial on charges he led the hijacking ofTWA's Athens-to-Rome flight 847 in June 1985 and forced it to landin Beirut, where U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death.Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt in 1987 when he allegedly wascaught at the airport carrying liquid explosives.   Last year, when West Germany rejected a request that Hamadi beextradited to stand trial in the United States for Stethem'smurder, U.S. officials consoled themselves with assurances fromBonn that Hamadi was subject to equally stern punishment ifconvicted in Frankfurt or Washington.   They were consoled again this week that the latest ruling wasnot the ultimate decision on Hamadi's possible sentence.   ``German authorities tell us that even if Hamadi is tried in ajuvenile court he could be sentenced as an adult and receive a lifesentence,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.   ``As we've stated before, the Federal Republic of Germany hasgiven assurances that Hamadi will be prosecuted to the full extentof German law on all charges associated with the TWA 847 case,including murder, hijacking and hostage taking as well as crimescommitted in the federal republic,'' Redman said.   ``We expect the FRG will continue to abide by these assurancesand hope that Hamadi will be tried and sentenced as an adult as hewould were he were tried in the United States,'' the spokesman said.   Redman said press coverage of the case will be permitted. Mostjuvenile proceedings in the United States are closed to reporters.   Redman noted that under West German law, juvenile courts receivejurisdiction in cases where there is doubt about whether adefendant was 21 during all the events leading to a crime.   The court ruled that Hamadi was born on June 13, 1964, whichwould have made him 21 the day the hijacking began, June 14, 1985.   A court spokesman said, however, ``a possibility exists that theperpetration of the crime that he is accused of may have begunbefore June 13, 1985, and went back to the time of hisadolescence.''   A State Department terrorism expert, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said it was difficult to argue with the court's logic,given the requirements of German law. If the court had rejected thedefendant's request to be tried in a juvenile court and Hamadi wereconvicted in an adult tribunal, the conviction might be thrown outon appeal, the official said.   Still, this official said, ``there has been some residualconcern in the department about the effect this will have on thepossible sentence.''</TEXT></DOC>
