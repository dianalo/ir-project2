Thisreporting requirement would be in addition to the present requirement in31 U.S.C. 5313 and 31 CFR 103.22(a) that requires financial institutionsto report currency transactions over $10,000. The reason that Congressamended the Bank Secrecy Act to permit the lowering of the current currencyreporting threshold was because of its concern with schemes involving thestructuring of currency transactions below $10,000 to avoid the Bank SecrecyAct reporting requirements in certain areas of the country. <T3>See</T3> H. Rep. No. 100-716, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 8.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>On March 24, 1989, Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking inwhich it proposed procedures and limitations to govern the issuance ofan order under section 5326(a). 54 FR 12238. Under the proposed rule, priorto selecting an area of the country for targeted reporting, Treasury wouldbe required to make a determination that there may exist a significantlevel of drug money laundering or other illegal activity being conductedin that geographic area at levels below the current $10,000 currency reportingthreshold. Treasury then would identify the affected financial institutionor institutions in the geographic area that would receive the targetingorder. In the preamble to the proposed regulation, Treasury stated that,at least initially, geographic areas subject to the enhanced reportingrequirement could be as small as a few city blocks or as large as a majormetropolitan area.Under the proposed regulation, each financial institution in a targetedarea would receive an order requiring it to keep a record of specifiedcurrency transactions at or above a specified monetary limit for a certainperiod of time (not to exceed 60 days), with respect to all or certaintypes of cutomers, and to file a report as prescribed by Treasury on thosetransactions and the individuals involved in those transactions beginningon a date designated in the order. The proposed regulation further providedthat the order would set forth all the information required to be reported,instructions on how and where to file the reports (not necessarily theDetroit Computing Center), and the length of time that the records generatedin response to an order issued under section 5326 were to be retained.Treasury notes that there may be variations in the orders received by thetargeted financial institutions within a specific geographic area.Treasury stated that it would be as specific as possible in delineatingwhat would be expected of a financial institution served with a section5326 geographic targeting order and that it would consider the amount oftime necessary to implement the order. In addition, Treasury stated thatit would make every effort to work with the targeted financial institutionsto ensure maximum compliance with the targeting order at a minimum burdento the financial institutions. For this reason, Treasury said that thename of a Treasury contact would be provided for assistance if needed.In the proposed rule, Treasury emphasized that in complying with a geographictargeting order, financial institutions would not be required to purchaseadditional computer hardware or software. However, Treasury encouraged,but indicated that it would not require, financial institutions, when feasible,to adjust any existing computerized aggregation systems that they had inplace in order to capture the information specified in the order. Treasuryalso stated that it did not expect financial institutions with manual aggregationsystems to have any problems adjusting their manual systems in order tocapture the data required to be reported. Treasury emphasized, however,that if a financial institution had knowledge through other means, <T3>e.g.,</T3> the personal knowledge of a bank employee, that there wereaggregated transactions falling within the limits described in the order,the financial institution would be required to report those aggregatedtransactions, regardless of whether the existing system at the financialinstitution was able to identify the aggregated transactions. Finally,Treasury said that it would make every effort to work with financial institutionsfiling magnetically who received a section 5326 order so as not to disruptthe magnetic media filing process.Treasury stated that geographic targeting orders would not be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> but would be issued only to the affected financialinstitutions. Treasury made clear that issuance of a section 5326 orderto a financial institution would not exempt that institution from its dutyto report all over-$10,000 currency transactions.In the preamble, Treasury explained that the Right to Financial PrivacyAct, 12 U.S.C. Chapter 35, would not apply to geographic targeting ordersbecause that information is required to be reported by law. 12 U.S.C. 3413.Therefore, targeted financial institutions would not be required to notifycustomers of their temporarily enhanced reporting requirements. In orderto ensure proper use of the order, Treasury stated that it would normallyrequest targeted financial institutions not to notify the public of theenhanced reporting requirement limit.Treasury further proposed that in order to comply with a section 5326 order,financial institutions generally would be required to use IRS Form 4789,the Currency Transaction Report (``CTR''), which currently is used by financialinstitutions to report currency transactions over $10,000. In addition,Treasury explained that, in general, unless otherwise specified in theorder, all the provisions of 31 CFR Part 103 relating to the reportingof currency transactions in excess of $10,000 would apply to reports filedon transactions falling within the scope of a section 5326 order, and that,unless otherwise noted in the order, existing exemptions granted by a targetedbank under 31 CFR 103.22(B) prior to the time it received the order couldcontinue to be utilized in complying with a section 5326 order. However,Treasury emphasized that no new exemptions could be granted to businessesthat have regular and frequent currency transactions in amounts eitherabove or below $10,000, without the approval of Treasury. Finally, whilethe legislation gives Treasury the authority to include other monetaryinstrument transaction reporting in such an order, Treasury indicated thatit anticipated that, as a general rule, it would use section 5326 ordersto require reporting on currency transactions only.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Thirty-three comments were received on the above-described Notice of ProposedRulemaking. These comments have been considered carefully in drafting thefinal rule. A discussion of the major comments follows.Systems IssuesMost commenters stated that they would not be able to use their computersystems if only one branch of a financial institution were targeted forthe lower reporting requirement. As a result, they explained that theywould be forced to adopt a temporary manual system for processing the reports,which possibly could lessen the accuracy of reports and pose additionalproblems for the financial institution. Many also sought guidance in handlingaggregated transactions conducted by or on behalf of the same person whenthe transactions took place at branches both in and outside of the targetedarea.After carefully considering these issues, Treasury has decided that itwill require reporting of currency transactions at or below $10,000 onlyfor those transactions that occur at the branch of the financial institutionthat is targeted. Thus, only those transactions occurring at the targetedbranch should be aggregated for purposes of complying with a geographictargeting order. If a financial institution aggregates transactions amongits branches, it should report transactions in currency conducted by oron behalf of the same person that exceed $10,000 in the normal manner,<T3>i.e.</T3>, on a CTR to the Detroit Computing Center. Only aggregatedtransactions resulting solely from the targeted branch which exceed thelowered reporting threshold should be sent or made available in accordancewith the order. The order may also specify that photocopies of forms filedwith the Detroit Computing Center also be sent to the address specifiedin the order or otherwise be made available as instructed in the order.Financial institutions may, but are not required to, change their computersystems to accommodate a lower reporting threshold at a targeted branch.If a financial institution's computer system cannot accommodate the loweringof the currency transaction reporting threshold over $10,000 for one ormore of its branches, the financial institution will be required to usea manual system for completing the reports.Procedural IssuesThe comments raised numerous procedural issues. Many commenters requestedthat Treasury set forth in the final rule the minimum amount of time thatfinancial institutions will be given to implement a geographic targetingorder. Commenters estimated that they needed between 10 to 90 days advancenotice of the imposition of an enhanced reporting requirement. After reviewingthese comments and considering the different circumstances in which a targetingorder may be issued, Treasury has concluded that it would be detrimentalto define in advance, and without reference to particular facts, how muchtime should be given to implement an order. Treasury, however, will giveas much time as feasible to implement a section 5326 order, and will workwith each financial institution to ensure maximum compliance with an order.Several commenters recommended that Treasury establish a dollar limit belowwhich it would not target currency transactions. The specific recommendationsasked for limits of between $3,000 and $5,000. After considering the comments,Treasury has decided that in order to be able to respond to changing lawenforcement needs, it cannot set a dollar amount below which Treasury willnot target currency transactions for special reporting. Treasury, however,notes that before granting a request for a targeting order and establishingreporting limits, it will consider the law enforcement need for the information.A few commenters suggested that Treasury specifically provide in the regulationsexactly who in the financial institution will be served with a geographictargeting order. Various suggestions were made as to who would be served,including the Chief Executive Officer (``CEO''), the manager of the targetedbranch, or the Bank Secrecy Act compliance officer. Because Treasury believesthat these suggestions have merit, it has amended the proposal to specifythat the CEO of a targeted financial institution be served with a geographictargeting order. Treasury has selected the CEO as the person to be servedbecause it believes that by serving the CEO, senior officials at the targetedfinancial institution will be informed of the issuance of the order. Ordinarily, Treasury will serve a targeting order by sending it by certifiedor registered mail, return receipt requested. In addition, in order toensure that the order has been received and is being implemented, in mostcases, Treasury will contact the institution a few days after it has beensent. Other issues that were raised by the comments concerned the actual filingof the reports: where to file, what type of report to file, and the timedeadlines for filing. With respect to the place of filing, the final regulationprovides that the order will indicate the specific place the reports areto be sent or will indicate that the reports are to be made available forpick up by designated individuals. If a financial institution that filesCTR's by magnetic media is targeted, and the financial institution wouldlike to report transactions for the targeted branch of the financial institutionon magnetic tape, Treasury will work with the financial institution todetermine where and how to file the reports. As for the format of the report, Treasury has decided generally to requirefinancial institutions to use the CTR form to file the information on transactionstargeted below $10,000. Treasury made this decision because financial institutionsare familiar with the CTR form and their employees know how to completethese forms. The regulation, however, provides Treasury with the abilityto order targeted financial institutions to use a different format if thecircumstances necessitate it. A geographic targeting order will specifythe format in which the reports will be required to be filed. Finally, with respect to the time required to file these reports, Treasuryhas decided that it will specify in each section 5326 order when the reportsmust be filed. Generally, however, Treasury anticipates that in most instancesit will require the filing of these reports soon after the date of thetransaction and no more than 15 days from the date of the transaction,as is required now for filing CTR's. A few comments asked about the types of transactions in currency that wouldbe targeted. One commenter requested that Treasury not differentiate amongdifferent types of transactions (<T3>e.g., </T3>targeting only purchases of money orders and cashier's checks),while another asked that cash withdrawals not be included in targetingorders. Because each order will depend on the specific facts and circumstancessurrounding the request for the targeting order, Treasury is not able todelineate in advance the types of transactions to be included in the order.In many cases, not all types of transactions in currency may be includedin the order; in other cases, all types of currency transactions may betargeted. In some cases, only the currency transactions of certain typesof customers may be targeted. One commenter noted that any revisions to the original order should bemade in writing. Treasury agrees with that comment and accordingly hasincluded in the final regulation a provision that revisions to a geographictargeting order will not be effective until made in writing. This willensure that a formal record is kept of all changes made to the originaltargeting order. It is anticipated that, in some cases, Treasury and thefinancial institution initially will discuss any revisions to the order,and that these revsions will be reduced to writing by Treasury later. Several commenters requested that the regulation provide a limit on thenumber of times a section 5326 order may be renewed. Because there maybe instances where an extended targeted period may be necessary, Treasuryhas decided not to put a limit on the number of times an order may be renewed.However, Treasury notes that in order to renew an order it must make adetermination that there may be a significant level of drug money launderingor other illegal activity may be occurring in that area at levels below$10,000, keeping in mind Congress' admonition that these orders be of ``limitedduration.'' Finally, many banks asked to be permitted to continue utilizing existingexemptions at the targeted branches of the banks and to be able to addnew unilateral exemptions at exemption limits below $10,000. In the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking, Treasury had stated that banks would be able tocontinue to use their existing exemptions, unless otherwise indicated inthe order, and that banks could not add new exemptions either above orbelow $10,000 unless approved by Treasury. Because Treasury wants to closelyscrutinize currency transactions taking place at targeted financial institutions,it is standing by this position and is incorporating it into the finalrule. Thus, unless otherwise noted in an order, during the course of atargeted reporting period, a targeted bank may not grant new exemptions,either above or below $10,000, but it may continue to use the exemptionsit already has in place.Customer Relations Issues In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Treasury indicated that generallyit would request the targeted financial institution not to disclose theexistence and specifics of an order to persons not employed at the financialinstitution. Many commenters had questions about such a requirement, includingwhat potential penalties were applicable if the financial institution madea disclosure, what specific guidelines to follow in handling customer inquiries,and whether therefore financial institutions could raise a good faith defenseif information were disclosed. Treasury has considered these issues carefully.Treasury realizes that financial institutions may have difficulties withcustomers who will not be satisfied with a response that the informationis required by Federal regulation, and that they will continue to pressthe financial institution as to why the information is required. Treasuryhas balanced this against the real probability that information disclosedby the financial institution, either upon request or voluntarily by anemployee of the financial institution, could interfere with the abilityof law enforcement to obtain useful information on drug money launderingand other illegal activities occurring in the targeted area. Treasury fearsthat once criminals learn of the enhanced reporting requirements and wherethey are applicable, criminals merely will move on to another non-targetedbranch. In light of these concerns, Treasury has decided to retain its initialproposal that the specifics of a geographic targeting order not be disclosedoutside the targeted institution. Thus, an order issued under section 5326will request that the existence of the order not be disclosed to anyoneoutside the financial institution. Treasury recommends that financial institutionstell customers who ask why the information is required only that they arerequired to fill out the report pursuant to a Federal regulation. Treasuryfurther recommends that the financial institution notify Treasury in theevent of any disclosure of the existence or specifics of an order to personsoutside the targeted branch. Finally, Treasury recommends that if the customer'sconduct raises the suspicions of the financial institution, that the financialinstitution report that activity to the Treasury contact person listedin the order.Miscellaneous IssuesSeveral miscellaneous issues were raised in the comments. One nonbank financialinstitution with branches nation-wide requested that a financial institutionbe subject to no more than one section 5326 order at a time. While Treasurycannot guarantee that a financial institution will have to comply withonly one order at a time, it does anticipate that initially targeting ordersgenerally will be issued consecutively, and not concurrently, in orderto assess their success.Several commenters recommended that the regulation specify the maximumamount of time that the reports generated in response to a section 5326order must be retained. Treasury agrees with these comments and, accordingly,the final rule provides that the maximum retention period for the reportsand records of reports generated by a targeting order will be no more thanfive years, the current maximum retention period in the Bank Secrecy Actregulations.Some commenters wanted to know what they should do if they observe suspiciousactivity at a targeted branch and whether the activity should be reportedto the local office of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal InvestigationDivision pursuant to Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Ruling 88-1. If suspiciousactivity occurs at a targeted branch, Treasury would prefer the financialinstitution to report the activity to the Treasury employee named in thegeographic targeting order as the contact person. As stated above, oncean area has been targeted for enhanced reporting, Treasury will closelyscrutinize all activity occurring in the targeted area, including reportsof suspicious activity.Finally, several commenters asked what the potential penalties were forfailing to comply with a geographic targeting order. The penalties in 31U.S.C. 5321 and 5322 that are applicable to failures to comply with theBank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations will be applicable tofailures to comply with a section 5326 order. Civil penalties may be imposedup to the greater of the amount invoved in the transaction, if any, (notto exceed $100,000) or $25,000. Any person who willfully violates theseprovisions also would be subject to criminal penalties of not more than$250,000 or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful consideration of the comments received in response to theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, Treasury is adopting the regulation as proposed,with the changes noted above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This Final Rule is not a major rule for purposes of Executive Order 12291.It is not anticipated to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more. It will not result in a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies,or geographic regions. It will not have any significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or foreign markets.
