The protesters who gathered at th walled midcity hippodromepledged to resume racing at the beginning of the new year.   ``We shall race anew despite the government decision,'' NabilFreij, a leading member of the track's governing committee, toldreporters.   ``The track has long been a prime symbol of national unity. Itschoice for a new palace ground shatters this symbol.''   As he spoke graceful Arabians trained at the track for the firsttime in two years. Hundreds of Moslem and Christian fans joined inthe applause as the horses paraded.   The track is governed by ``the committee for preserving thedynasty of the Arabian horse,'' which allows only Arabian steeds torace. Throroughbreds are prohibited.   Bulldozers were clearing the rubble of 15 years of civil warduring which the track, because of its location right on Beirut'sdividing Green Line, was caught in Christian-Moslem crossfire.   The track, called the Palace of Peace, was closed and reopenedmore than a dozen times during the civil war. The last closure wasin March 1989, during a rebellion by renegade Gen. Michel Aoun.   Now, peace finally seems to be coming to this nation of roughly3.5 million people.   Of the 700 racing Arabians in the stables at the track, 400survived shelling duels between troops loyal to Aoun and regularsand irregulars with whom he fought intermittenty until hisrebellion was crushed on Oct. 13.   Some horses were killed in their boxes. Many perished of hungerand thirst when breeders and stable grooms fled.   The heavy shellfire punched huge craters in the mile-long ovaltrack, wrecked sections of the galleries and left gaping holes inthe three-story headquarters of the governing committee.   ``The loss is colossal for us, something around $5 millionwithin the track,'' said Freij, whose family has a breeding farm ineast Lebanon's Bekaa valley. ``And now we have this irresponsibledecision of the government.''   On Nov. 7, President Elias Hrawi's Cabinet decided to build anew palace and government complex for the prime minister at thepine-wooded track.   The old palace in suburban Baabda, a main target during thesectarian conflict, was demolished by Syrian warplanes during thedrive against Aoun.   Hrawi's administration has abolished the city's demarcation lineand ordered civil war irregulars to withdraw from the capital andits environs to create a unified, militia-free ``greater Beirut.''   ``You don't inaugurate a united greater Beirut with an act ofdisunity,'' Freij said. ``That's what the decision to build thepalace on the race track amounts to.''   The track has been one of the few places where up to 10,000fans, rich and poor, Moslems and Christians, mixed at weekends.   Freij inherited the racing passion from his father, the lateMarquis Moussa de Freij, who founded the track with millionairesportsman Henry Pharoun, now 90, about 70 years ago.   Moslem horse owners and breeders flanked Freij, a Christian, ashe warned on Friday that closing the track would strip 2,500families of their only source of income.   ``I've been spending $4,000 a month for years now to keep mytrainers and stable grooms with my 33 Arabians, waiting for the dayraces will resume,'' said Antoine Kashouh, a Christian. ``Will thegovernment feed them now?''   Moslem trainer Mohammed Haddar said at times during the fightinghe had to buy food one day for his family and one day for thehorses he cared for.   He complained, ``We've starved to keep the horses. We survivedthe civil war, the (1982) Israeli invasion and Aoun's wars, hopingagainst all odds to race again. With peace in sight now, thegovernment says `no.' It's not fair.''   The track was inaugurated in 1916 under the Ottoman Empire. Thepresent governing committee took an 80-year lease for the groundsin 1920, when France ruled Lebanon after World War I.</TEXT></DOC>
