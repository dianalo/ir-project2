Under regulations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Amoco received permission to raise the price it gets for the gas to $3.24 for each thousand cubic feet from the average it had been receiving of $1.29. Current spot prices from the Hugoton are roughly $1.60 a thousand cubic feet. If Williams didn't accept the new terms, Amoco could terminate the contract.    A Williams spokesman said the company has been trying to round up &quot;realistically priced gas&quot; from other suppliers and will buy only as much Amoco gas as it needs to maintain service to its customers. Williams said a number of factors, including hard-to-predict winter demand, will determine how much gas it will buy from Amoco.    Finding other supplies quickly could be difficult because the Amoco gas accounted for about 55% of the pipeline's dedicated reserves. &quot;We don't know for sure how much of the present deliverability out of this field we can replace from other sources,&quot; the Williams spokesman said.    Gas producers have been growing reluctant to enter into long-term supply commitments on the belief gas prices could rise sharply in coming years.    Williams operates other pipelines and is expanding into the telecommunications business. Amoco, based in Chicago, is a major oil company. </TEXT></DOC>
