SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tennis balls zoomed like missiles over theWhite House lawn, causing even President and Nancy Reagan to duck,but it was all for a good cause as some $500,000 was raised tocombat drug abuse.   Celebrities, tennis pros and administration officials gatheredSunday at the White House tennis court for the fourth annualfund-raising event.   The president and first lady joined a crowd of several hundredguests and corporate sponsors, watching tennis stars Tracy Austin,Vince Van Patten Jimmy Arias and Dennis Ralston compete in a matchthat had no winners _ local sportscaster and master of ceremoniesGlenn Brenner got the score mixed up.   The first couple also saw Secretary of State George Shultz andGOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf go down to defeat at the hands ofTreasury Secretary James Baker III and Wilhelm Wachtmeister, theambassador of Sweden.   Shultz, just back from his round of travels to the Soviet Union,Middle East and Spain, appeared to fall victim to jet lag with hisdouble faults.   Old and new CIA hands faced off when current CIA directorWilliam Webster and newsman Morton Kondracke opposed former CIAdirector Richard Helms and actor Dick Van Patten.   Helms, resplendent in traditional men's long slacks, wasdeclared by Brenner to be the winner of the day's ``sartorialaward,'' but he also managed to scoop up a win with a number oftough lobs and strong net play.   Other participants included actresses Dina Merrill, CatherineOxenberg and Tracy Scoggins, actor Chuck Norris, singers LeeGreenwood and Larry Gatlin, boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and footballplayer Herschel Walker.   At the end of the tournament, Mrs. Reagan presented $50,000checks to two anti-drug abuse groups, the Target InteractiveProject of Kansas City, Mo., and Wally's Club and Frontline FosterGrandparents Program of Nashville, Tenn.   ``Because of their work, the lives of many parents and childrenwill be much brighter,'' Mrs. Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
