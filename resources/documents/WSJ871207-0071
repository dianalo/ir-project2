Mr. Johnsen, who offered to resign in late November amid a political furor over cost overruns at a refinery-expansion project, said he will remain at Statoil until Jan. 15. A spokesman said the board agreed to the monthlong extension of Mr. Johnsen's term to ensure a smooth transition of management.    Six of the board's members were appointed by the government less than two weeks ago after their predecessors quit under pressure resulting from the overruns. The three continuing board members, who represent Statoil's 10,900 employees, dissented from the decision to accept Mr. Johnsen's resignation.    There are no clear front-runners to succeed Mr. Johnsen, a 53-year-old former Labor Party politician who has been the company's president since its founding in 1972. </TEXT></DOC>
