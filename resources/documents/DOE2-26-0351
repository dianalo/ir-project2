Crude oil output was held down slightlyby temporary situations, including the explosion of the Piper Alpha platformin the North Sea and damage to a Colombian export pipeline. However,production in excess of OPEC quotas by several of its member countriespointed to a continuing surplus of crude oil on world markets in theimmediate future. In the United States, the composite refiner acquisitioncost of crude oil fell $1.08 per barrel, or 6.9 percent, to an averageof $14.63 per barrel for July. Because of the continual slide in crudeoil prices throughout June, the late-July price turnaround was not sufficientto result in an increase in the average price for the month. Total refinersales statistics for the major petroleum products showed a 2.6 percentdecrease from June. 12 figs., 53 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
