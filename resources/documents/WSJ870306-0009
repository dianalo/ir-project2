The acquisition would make ConAgra one of the nation's largest and most diversified meat producers.    Under the proposed transaction, Monfort holders would receive 2.5 shares of newly issued ConAgra stock for each of the 4.3 million Monfort shares. The transaction has an indicated value of $85 a share -- a significant premium over yesterday's closing market price for Monfort stock.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Monfort shares closed at $53.50, up $4. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, ConAgra closed at $34, up 37.5 cents. The letter of intent was announced after the market closed.    The companies said the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by both boards and Monfort shareholders. The acquisition is expected to be completed in June, the companies said.    Greeley, Colo.-based Monfort, the nation's fourth-largest beef packer, would bring to ConAgra huge cattle-feeding, lamb-packing and beef-packing operations. Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra signaled its interest in beef packing in January, buying E.A. Miller Inc., a single-plant beef slaughtering company in Hiram, Utah.    ConAgra also processes pork at eight plants, slaughters hogs at one plant, processes fish and is the nation's second-largest poultry producer. &quot;They're rounding out the center of the dinner plate,&quot; said Roger Spencer, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago. Besides meat, ConAgra processes grain, packaged and frozen foods, and makes and distributes farm fertilizers and chemicals.    Last week, Monfort announced it will build a 100,000-head cattle feedlot in Yuma, Colo., becoming the nation's largest cattle feeding company, increasing its feedlot capacity by nearly 50% to 280,000 head.    For Monfort, the merger would bring marketing expertise to the beef business, provide financial security during lean years in the beef cycle and diversify its stockholders' interests in the food business, said Kenneth Monfort, president and chief executive officer. &quot;Every time I spend $10 million or $20 million in the beef business, I wondered if we should be getting into the poultry business,&quot; he said.    Industry analysts and meatpacking executives said they had heard no rumors of an impending agreement.    The planned merger is another in a series of consolidations in the meatpacking industry, in which meat companies are expanding into a variety of meats to hedge their bets on shifts in consumer tastes, and balance cyclical patterns in the meat business.    In January, Cargill Inc. agreed to buy a hog slaughtering plant, entering the pork business for the first time. Last year, Edwin L. Cox Jr., a Dallas businessman, bought Swift Independent Packing Corp., and merged it with his Val-Agri Inc. and Friona Industries Inc., combining beef and pork slaughtering and processing businesses.    Meanwhile, some old-line pork processors, including Geo. A. Hormel andamp; Co. and Oscar Mayer andamp; Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos., have shed slaughtering operations to focus on their processing and marketing operations. Industry experts suggest that the difference in direction indicates a divergence in opinion about the future of the red meat industry. &quot;There's a group of people who say beef can be marketed and some that think they should be marketing something else,&quot; said Zay Gilbreath, president of Caprock Industries Inc., Cargill's cattle-feeding unit.    In the year ended Aug. 30, 1986, Monfort had net income of $25.1 million, or $5.84 a share, on revenue of $1.6 billion, compared with fiscal 1985 earnings of $14.5 million, or $3.31 a share, on revenue of $1.5 billion.    In the year ended May 25, 1986, ConAgra earned $105.3 million, or $3.05 a share, compared with the year-earlier $91.7 million, or $2.65 a share. The company had fiscal 1986 sales of $5.91 billion, compared with $5.5 billion in fiscal 1985.    ConAgra currently has 66.4 million shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
