Here is a vast gray city, its streets habitually torn up,and those not torn up are blocked by the debris ofconstruction sites. It is the country's political dynamo, itscenter of money, fashion, enterprise and communication, themachine that makes all Italy revolve, as the Milanese say.The weather is rainy, hot or dirty, bitter cold.</LP><TEXT>   Milan is a cultural obstacle course too. Contestants arevery often taken up with the chase for tickets to La Scala,but the artistic life in general is carried on at a highpitch. The restaurants are always full and there is seldom aroom free in a hotel. It's May, travel agents say, or it'sNovember, as though everyone was supposed to know what wasgoing on. A symbol of the city's energy is the great centralrailroad station, which throws out lines all over southernEurope. The station is an enormous pile of granite andmarble, bulging with muscular horses and men and sheathed insemi-Roman vaulting. It was built in the year II of thefascist regime, a date once carved on the entablature of thebuilding. But not so very long ago it was chisled away infavor of 1931 in the year of Jesus Christ.   The station is layered in two great concourses, the ticketwindows at street level and the tracks 40 feet up staircasesthat, although mitigated by escalators, still are a trial forpassengers with awkward or heavy luggage. It nevertheless isa splendid sight to glimpse, at the top, the serriedsignboards proclaiming the great destinations -- Venice,Bologna, Mantua, Ferrara, Genoa, Turin.   Passengers and their freight make most of the noise. Thereare no screams or hisses from the locomotives waitingpowerfully under the glass and iron-girded roof. And when thetrains move, they move noiselessly. On one track stands thesilver Settebello, the train for Rome. An American mother isclimbing aboard to visit her daughter, halfway through a yearat a pensione in Florence, as surely her own mother hadvisited her 40 years before.   For all its aggressive salience, the station goes softwhen it faces the city. It has an unfinished feeling,heightened by a circle of ragged park, with its batteredgrass and jumble of masonry and stray dogs. The place isstrangely isolated with few station hotels and a long, uglycolonnaded avenue, very Mussolinian in feeling, its principalaccess to the maelstrom of the city.   Despite its ancient monuments such as the Basilica of St.Ambrose, or the palaces and churches of the Renaissance,Milan exudes a 19th-century air. Manzoni, Stendhal, theAustrian archdukes and Risorgimento figures such as Cavourand Victor Emmanuele are its ghosts. It is easy to see thebroughams and phaetons and their smart horses and coachmen atthe port-cochere of the Scala or prancing through the quarterof Montenapoleone.   The Milanese are still very elegant in their rich, darkclothes. But the atmosphere is one of business, and businessis the soul of change. In one of the most fashionablerestaurants the current scene powerfully reflects it.   There is the refectory table of Japanese businessmen.There are the sex kittens on the banquettes in sapphires andminiskirts. There are the male customers in leather jacketsand gold chains. The service is hasty and the food is well onits way downhill.   We ask a waiter to call a taxi as we end our meal andbattle our way out against the surge of the next sitting. Atthe front door a youth blocks our path. He is wearing a lightgray sweatshirt with the words &quot;Dress for Success&quot; stampedacross his chest.   Who are you and why are you wearing that? I gasp out inexasperation. I am the driver of the taxi you ordered, comesthe wholly reasonable and yet for some reason astonishingreply.   ---   Mr. King is director of the Foreign Press Center in NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
