ATandamp;T started its business in 1887 to compete with thengiant Western Union Telegraph Co., and gradually built itinto a forerunner of today's private digital datacommunications network. Today, however, lower-cost digitaltelecommunications service is universally available, makingtelegraphy obsolete.</LP><TEXT>   But its history is rich. World War II correspondents senttheir dispatches from Normandy and North Africa viatelegraph, and ATandamp;T carried the copy the last mile toclattering teletype machines in the U.S. Giant utilitiesbuilt their empires using the telegraph as a data conduitbetween their far-flung facilities. And the telegraph systemwas the highway Wall Street first used to move mountains offinancial information to ticker-tape machines nationwide.   Local phone companies still provide limited telegraphservice in some cities, but this business is fading rapidly.While ATandamp;T sends some of its newer digital services over itsold telegraph lines, fiber-optic lines have replaced thesefor long-distance traffic, the spokesman said.   Don't look for ATandamp;T to become &quot;AT,&quot; however. &quot;Telegraphstill carries a lot of historical significance at thecompany, so we'll stick with the same name,&quot; the spokesmansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
