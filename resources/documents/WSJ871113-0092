The proposal was made by MGM Grand Inc., a company Mr. Kerkorian, the Los Angeles investor, created to pursue possible investment in the airline.    New York-based Pan Am declined to disclose terms of the proposal.    C. Edward Acker, Pan Am's chairman and chief executive officer, said: &quot;After carefully examining the MGM proposal and consulting with Citicorp, which is acting as our investment banker, the executive committee has concluded that the proposal is too highly conditional in many important respects -- with no assurance from MGM that the conditions can be satisfied -- to be considered a real offer, and amounts to an option to buy our airline business.&quot;    A spokeswoman wouldn't disclose the conditions, but she said the company had no assurance that they could be met. The conditions relate to obtaining concessions from labor unions and to the availability of large debt financing.    As previously reported, under the Kerkorian plan, Pan Am would be spun off from its parent, and the airline's unions would be given a larger ownership interest in the airline in return for cost concessions. Union sources had said the amount of Mr. Kerkorian's investment would depend on the value of concessions the unions offer.    Mr. Kerkorian had been recruited by four of the airline's five unions, which for months have been seeking outside investors to finance a restructuring of the ailing airline.    Terry Christensen, president of Mr. Kerkorian's closely held Tracinda Corp., MGM Grand's parent, said Mr. Kerkorian had offered to pay $75 million cash, raise an additional $400 million, and assume more than $1 billion in debt for &quot;less than 50%&quot; of Pan American World Airways.    The offer would also give 20% of the airline's stock to its unions, Mr. Christensen said. He declined to disclose the cost concessions requested from the unions, but said he believed the unions' negotiators were &quot;pleased with our proposal, and supportive of our efforts.&quot;    Mr. Christensen disputed Pan Am's statement that the proposal was not a serious offer, and said Pan Am's management had &quot;taken a totally defensive and inaccurate position&quot; in rejecting the plan. &quot;The conditions referred to in Pan Am's release are really very ordinary conditions for a transaction of this magnitude,&quot; he said. &quot;The framework of the proposal is very close to that suggested by Ed Acker.&quot;    Mr. Kerkorian's representatives hadn't been contacted by Pan Am's management since the proposal was submitted last Sunday. Mr. Christensen said MGM Grand hasn't decided whether to pursue the deal. &quot;This (rejection) comes completely out of left field,&quot; he said.    Mr. Christensen declined to identify the management team included in MGM Grand's proposal, saying that the key managers are currently employed by other companies. Industry experts said that the team was likely to include Donald Lloyd-Jones, 56, former president of Western Airlines and a longtime American Airlines manager who has worked with Mr. Kerkorian on the Pan Am proposal.    The coalition that represents Pan Am's pilots, flight attendants, clerical and other workers and Teamsters previously had offered $180 million in annual wage and labor concessions for three years. In exchange, the coalition wanted about a 20% stake in the company. Pan Am management rejected the proposal.    Mr. Kerkorian has had an exclusive contract with Pan Am's management since late August to examine the ailing carrier's operations for a potential investment. </TEXT></DOC>
