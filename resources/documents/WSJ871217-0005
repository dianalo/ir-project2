The protein GM-CSF, for granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor, stimulates growth of infection-fighting white blood cells. Immunex, a Seattle-based biotechnology company, produced a synthetic form of the naturally occurring hormone using gene-splicing techniques.    The study involved eight patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, a suppression of the bone marrow that lowers counts of certain blood cells including white cells, rendering patients susceptible to infections. Several of the patients had pre-existing cancers, and had been treated with chemotherapy, which commonly provokes the lowered white count. Cancer patients frequently die of infections, or must cease potentially helpful treatments, because of this suppressed state.    &quot;Until now, there has been no treatment&quot; for this condition, said Jordan U. Gutterman, a physician-researcher at M.D. Anderson and senior author of a study to appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Gutterman added, &quot;GM-CSF offers a potential avenue of treatment which warrants further investigation to determine its longer-term value.&quot;    According to the study, the eight patients were given constant intravenous GM-CSF for two weeks, then had a two-week rest period followed by another two weeks of the drug. The patients experienced a raised white cell count and fewer episodes of life-threatening infection. The commonest side effect was moderate bone pain. One patient was removed from therapy after suffering flu-like symptoms, and subsequently died. None of the patients progressed to leukemia while on the treatment, the scientists said.    Christopher S. Henney, executive vice president and scientific director of Immunex, cautioned that &quot;although these results are encouraging, clinical trials of this therapeutic are still in the early stages.&quot; An expanded study is planned.    Immunex shares closed unchanged at $11.375 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    Immunex is but one of several companies making and testing GM-CSF for a variety of disorders. Genetics Institute Inc., the Boston-based biotechnology concern, is working with Sandoz Inc., the East Hanover, N.J., drug company, supplying their version of the drug to scientists testing it in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. </TEXT></DOC>
