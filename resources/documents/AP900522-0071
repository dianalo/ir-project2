Tom Casey, 53, began the trip from his hometown of Seattle andreached Anchorage Monday, but he still hadn't received permissionto fly over the Soviet Union.   He won't leave for his next stop in Nome until he gets thego-ahead from Soviet authorities, he said.   ``There seems to be some kind of problem _ I'm not sure what _and I hope it's not going to be long,'' Casey said. ``They said ithad to do with technical difficulties with the airplane.''   Casey is flying a single-engine Cessna equipped with pontoonsthat allow it to take off and land only on water.   Casey had submitted a flight plan to Soviet officials ``fromNome to wherever they'd like me to go. I told them I wanted to gofrom Nome, Alaska to Helsinki.''   He suggested a route consisting of 500-mile legs between placeswhere he can land his plane called ``Liberty II,'' on water near anairport.   The voyage is timed to get Casey back to Seattle in time for theopening ceremonies of the Goodwill Games on July 21. His departurefrom Seattle on Sunday marked the 63rd anniversary of the beginningof Charles A. Lindbergh's first solo trans-Atlantic flight.   Casey's proposed 27,000-mile route roughly retraces the 1924path of the first globe-circling flight by a pair of Douglas WorldCruisers, Casey said.   ``I'm working out an alternate plan right now, through theAleutian chain through Attu, towards Japan. But I still need onestop in the Soviet Union, in the Kuril Islands,'' he said.   Casey and his project coordinator in Seattle, Dan Hood, plannedto contact Soviet air traffic officials today.   His flight so far through Alaska, Casey said, was ``the way it'salways been _ beautiful.''   He said he spent years flying in Alaska as a bush pilot.   ``One main reason I'm doing this is I'm trying to promote thesafety and versatility of general aviation, especially in the Lower48,'' he said.   ``The only place that's left doing what aviation was originallydesigned for is Alaska. Up here, flying is almost like driving acar. You don't get all the problems that make flying difficult inthe rest of the United States. Up here it's survival. It should beshown it's a very, very safe form of transportation.''</TEXT></DOC>
