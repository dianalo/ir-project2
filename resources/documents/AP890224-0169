Switzerland's highest court branded Hussein Hariri, 22, apolitical fanatic whose actions were ``especially despicable andcold-blooded.''   Hariri single-handedly commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 flyingfrom Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris on July 24, 1987. He demanded therelease of Lebanese and Palestinians held by France, West Germanyand Israel.   Hariri asked to be flown to Beirut but agreed to a refueling stopin Geneva, where he shot passenger Xavier Beaulieu, 28, when hisdeadline for refueling the plane expired.   The five-member Federal Criminal Court, which convenes only incases of ``particular gravity,'' convicted Hariri on all sevencounts against him, including murder, attempted murder and hostagetaking.   The bearded Hariri, a Shiite Moslem whom prosecutors called a``killer blinded by conviction,'' listened impassively as chiefjudge Jean-Jacques Leu read the sentence.   In Lebanon, Hariri's father said tearfully he had expected hisson would get a severe sentence, but not life.   ``I cannot do anything now. I wish I could visit him in jail, butI do not have the money to buy an air ticket to Switzerland,''Mohammed Hariri, 61, said in Deir Qanaoun Nahr, near the southernport of Tyre.   ``I do not want to talk about my son. Nobody is with him and noone can help him,'' his mother, Felleh Hariri said at the familyresidence ajacent to the grocery shop they own.   Hariri will be eligible for parole after 15 years. He was alsoordered to pay $657,000 in damages, mostly to Air Afrique.   During the five-day trial, Hariri told the court he was a``soldier of God'' and did not want to kill.   He refused to testify about allegations he was on a mission forthe pro-Iranian Hezbollah group, Lebanon's most militant faction.   Hariri reportedly told interrogators before the trial he joinedHezbollah in 1985 after his release from an Israeli prison.Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most ofthe 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   Investigators said Hariri boarded the plane at Bangui, CentralAfrican Republic, carrying a pistol, 140 rounds of ammunition andexplosives. Hariri said he bribed his way around security checks.   Swiss police stormed the hijacked jet and arrested Hariri aftercrew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing in safetychutes. A flight attendant was shot and seriously injured when hejumped Hariri.   Hariri's demands included the release of the Hamadi brothers, twoLebanese arrested in West Germany as terror suspects.   One of them, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, has been on trial in Frankfurtsince July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a TWA airliner toBeirut, in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans heldhostage for 17 days.   The other Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted by a West Germancourt of arranging the kidnapping of two West Germans in Beirut towin freedom for his brother. The West Germans have since been freed.   When a Swiss Red Cross delegate was kidnapped in Lebanon lastNovember, Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber said the abduction wasaimed gaining leniency for Hariri.   The envoy of the all-Swiss International Committee of the RedCross, Peter Winkler, was released after a month in the hands ofcaptors who were never identified. Switzerland said no concessionswere made.</TEXT></DOC>
