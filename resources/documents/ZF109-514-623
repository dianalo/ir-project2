 Its desktopprograms--Interleaf Publisher for PCs and Macintoshes--have both soldsluggishly and did not establish Interleaf in the mass market the way it hadhoped.andP;  At the same time, the company has been undergoing a rough transitionfrom selling the turnkey systems that were once its core business to sellingjust software and services, such as consulting, training and support.andM;Interleaf faced several problems.andP;  First, its unique combination of a fastWYSIWYG text editor and superior graphics editors were no longer sufficientdifferentiators in the market.andP;  Its workstation software sales remainedstrong, but the competition in the PC and Mac markets foreshadowed risingcompetition on the Unix front.andP;  As FrameMaker, Ventura and other competitorsadvanced from the low end, Interleaf needed a product that was immediatelyrecognizable as more advanced than its competition.andP;  At the same time, itsadvanced features had to be valuable to customers.andM;Another issue Interleaf faced was its user interface.andP;  The desktop it createdin the early 1980s--before graphical user interfaces were generally availablefor computers--has become a liability in the general software marketplace,where applications are now expected to follow the graphical user interfacesupplied by the computer manufacturer.andP;  Thus, at the same time that Interleafneeded sophistication, it needed a product that was consistent, from users'standpoints, with other applications they might run on their computerdesktops.andM;Interleaf's answer was to peel apart much of its TPS product and create atoolkit from which software applications may be built.andP;  The toolkit fitsInterleaf's view of its role in the industry--it must broaden its services atthe same time that it focuses on solving specific industry and customerproblems.andP;  The toolkit also will enable Interleaf to offer a consistent baselevel of software across all of its platforms and, starting next year, tooffer products that comply with other graphical user interfaces.andM;One of Interleaf 5's distinguishing traits is its support for &quot;activedocuments.&quot;andP;  In rebuilding its software, Interleaf has made every componentof a document, both text and graphics, an object that may have programmableattributes.andP;  We wrote about Interleaf's active documents concept when it wasintroduced at the Seybold Seminars last March (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  14).andP;  Withthe introduction of Interleaf 5, this feature is now realized in a product.andM;In one sense, Interleaf 5 is Interleaf's seventh major release to TPS ineight years.andP;  From that point of view, Interleaf 5 is TPS 5.0--TPS as we knowit with the addition of some programming extensions.andM;At first glance, there is little in Interleaf 5 to differentiate it from TPS4.0.andP;  But a closer examination reveals fundamental, underlying differences inthe new code.andP;  According to Steve Pelletier, Interleaf's chief technicalofficer, the guts of TPS were overhauled more in this release than in anyother.andP;  There are three main areas in which the overhaul is significant:andM;* Modular architecture.andP;  Interleaf is calling Interleaf 5 an openarchitecture, but &quot;open&quot; means many different things to different people.andP;  InInterleaf 5, the architecture is a modular system that is programmable atevery level, allowing it to run on a variety of hardware and softwareplatforms and to be tightly coupled with many application programs.andP;  It isthe first publishing product that was designed for integratingpublishing-specific functions with other applications all driven from adocument model.andP;  and it is one of the few on the market that offer a built-inlanguage and interpreter for attaching scripts to objects within a documentor documents as a whole.andP;  Other programs are extendible, but few, if any,offer the breadth of programmability found in Interleaf 5.andM;* Font architecture.andP;  Interleaf has scrapped its bitmapped font approach infavor of an outline-based technology that will be part of all Interleaf5-based products.andP;  Initially, it is relying on Bitstream's Speedo, but it hasmade provisions for supporting other font outlining technology.andP;  Theoutlining allows arbitrary sizing of fonts and their display on the screen.andM;* Windowing/user interface.andP;  The user interface rewrite is perhaps the mostdifficult of all, which is why it was not finished in time for the show.andO;Interleaf has always relied on its own windowing manager--even when runningwithin another graphical windowing environment.andP;  Now it is cutting the cordbetween engine and display, relying as much as possible on external systemsoftware for window functions.andP;  In its initial release, Interleaf 5 is an Xapplication, running on top of X Window with the TPS interface.andP;  By nextyear, Interleaf will have made it possible to invoke one of several userinterfaces from the same engine, enabling it to introduce Motif, Open Lookand Macintosh interface products in 1991, with Presentation Manager apossibility for 1992.andM;From a hardware perspective, the Interleaf 5 engine is being offered on Sun,DEC, EBM, Apollo and HP Unix workstations, IBM-compatible PCs under MS-DOSand the Apple Macintosh.andP;  However, the LISP extensions that tweak the engineand documents to user requirements need only be writtern once because theLISP interpreter supplied as part of the engine is the same across all of theplatforms.andM;Entering new territory.andP;  The major overhauls in these areas result in afundamentally new product for Interleaf--hence its new name.andP;  But Interleaf 5has close ties to TPS 4.0, which is why Interleaf stayed with the number 5.andO;After looking at it, we see Interleaf 5 as one of new class of publishingproducts.andP;  Part engine, part development environment, part end-userpackages--in total, we can only describe it as the active documentenvironment from which a family of products are being developed to meetgeneral horizontal applications and specific vertical market solutions.andM;Yes, Interleaf can still offer a shrink-wrapped product targeted at a massaudience.andP;  And it is inroducing several such packages at the Conference.andP;  Butwe think it far more likely that initial demand for the product will comefrom high-volume corporate publishers looking for systems that do more thanput text and graphics on pages.andP;  Eventually, as VARs and even end users growaccustomed to creating active documents and personalized publishing software,Interleaf could penetrating the mass market with an Interleaf 5-basedproduct.andP;  The look and functionality of its PC and Macintosh versions, notdue out until next year, will be critical to its success in the mmass market.andM;For now, we view Interleaf 5 as a general-purpose toolkit from whichInterleaf, other deveolpers, VARs and sophisticated end users will buildinformation management toold.andP;  It is almost like a database manager in thevendor provides basic software to end software to end users from which otherapplications may be derived, then offers as a service custom-built solutions.andM;Unlike most publishing software, Interleaf 5 has the potential to interactclosely with other applications.andP;  By this we mean more than just filters thatallow cutting and pasting between documents, or live links that dynamicallybring in information.andP;  The recent trend at the high end of the market is todevelop publishing tools that interact directly with a database, which opensnew dimensions to the term electronic publishing.andM;If Interleaf were new to market, we would probably begin by describing thecore engine of Interleaf 5.andP;  But we now presume that most of our readers haveat least a passing acquaintance with Interleaf TPS.andP;  Basically the engine hasall of the TPS functional codeandgt; now it's just constructed defferently.andP;  We'lldiscuss in detail its new underlying construction, followed by an overview ofthe new features, a glimpse of what it may look like to an end user and adiscussion of how it is being packaged, marketed and sold.andM;Interleaf 5's contructionandM;Modular architecture.andP;  At Interleaf 5's core in an engine of modulesprogrammed in C.andP;  As with prvious Interleaf products, these modules areoptimized as much as possible for performance without being tied to specificoperating systems or hardware.andP;  But unlike previous versions, Interleaf 5hsengine is composed of discrete objects that may be pieced together--andextented--through Interleaf's LISP programming language.andP;  Whereas the codefor activating and displaying the engine functions (handamp;j, pagination,graphics, etc.) was formerly also written in C and Intertwined with theengine, in Interleaf 5, the code that activities the engine is LISP.andO;Essentially, all of the engine components that were previously very differenthave been unified into programmable objects.andP;  Each engine component (object)has its own class and may have unique behaviors, but the fact that all aresubsets of the master object class makes it possible to program actions thataffect all layers of the system.andM;In fact, all engine objects are now viewed as LISP objects.andP;  Interleafsupplies a LISP interpreter as part of evey Interleaf 5-based product.andP;  Thecritical difference between what Interleaf has done with INterleaf 5 and whatQuark did with Xpress is that extension written to Interleaf 5 do not becomewed to the source code.andP;  LISP extension act on objects within the systemwithout knowing what the underlyning code is at all.andM;The engine components--handamp;j, pagination, several graphics editors, fontresource, translator, etc.--are funcionally not that different from what isavailable in TPS 4.0, although there are new features.andP;  Interleaf has solvedmost of the problems of combining text and graphics on the page, and it hasdone so in a way that is extremely fast and flexible.andP;  Thus, all of thecompound document editor feature that it is known for are still present.andM;But by breaking the engine into accessible modules, Interleaf now makes itpossible to insert external code that executes on the way into or out of oneof these modules.andM;For examples, one third-party developer is working on a hyphenation modulefor Interleaf 5.andP;  It will plug into the system at the engine level, so thatthe user will see no difference in the way the system behaves, but thecomposition might make better breaks in the module, which uses rankedpreferential hyphenations points.andM;Other extensions could be written to create a customer-configurededitor--whether it be a structured editor that keeps an author with thebounds of a predetermined outline and style, a full compound document editorwith a user's favorite keyboard mappings or a form processor, in which adocument is used as the interface for accessing a database.andM;Great] But--LISP?andP;  While the ability to extend a system and define new objectattributes by writing your own code is a powerful feature, we wonder how manyend users will fell comfortable with LISP.andP;  The language has a ratherpeculiar syntax with which relatively few programmers (and even fewernon-programmers) are familiar.andP;  It stands in sharp contrast to the scriptinglanguages, such as those in HyperCard or Excel, that were designed forend-user programming.andP;  (Some cynics have even wondered if Interleaf's realpurpose in picking LISP was to assure itself of lots of custom-programmingbusiness.)andP;  We suspect that users will experience some frustration in gettingup to speed with the new functionality.andM;Font resource.andP;  all previous versions of Interleaf software were based on araster-font model that provided extremely fast display but imposed a burdenin disk space and limited most of its versions to discrete point sizes.andP;  WithInterleaf 5, Interleaf has moved to outline-based technology that adds newfunctionality and decreases the programs's footprint on the disk.andM;Initially, Bitstream's Speedo will be built into all versions of Interleaf 5.andO;The LaserWriter Plus set of PostScript fonts is the standard font set for allInterleaf 5 products, but all will also support any additional Bitstreamfonts the user might purchase.andM;The software supports arbitrary sizing of fonts to tenths of a point in sizesranging from 4 to 400 points.andP;  In addition, the display of any document maybe enlarge or reduced in single percentage ranging from 25% to 1,600% of itsoriginal size.andM;For the first time, Interleaf will be offering display of facing pages.andP;  Ifyou scale the page small enough, you get as many as eight pages on the screenat one time in slighly larger than thumbnail size.andP;  no matter what size, thedocument is still fully editable, and text is never greeked, even when itssize makes it virtually illegible.andM;In pages demonstrations we saw, zooming in or our incurred quite aperformance hit as the font was razterized.andP;  Once the font was in RAM, use ofthat size was quite fast.andM;One disappointment is that because its display technology cannot show morethan two pages in a horizontal row, the thumbnail view places all of thepages in the left side of the window, leaving part of the right side empty.andO;If Interleaf were able to display more pages horizontally, the thumbnail viewcould show up to 16 pages at a time.andM;Another limitaion is that the pages must be contigous.andP;  There is no way todisplay pages 1 and 16 side by side, for example.andM;Significantly, Interleaf has planned to make use of the font resources ofoperating environments that handle fonts.andP;  Thus, it plans support for AdobeType Manager, and it could support other outline technologies (TrueType,Folio) that might become significant in the market.andM;Why not rely on font resource managers in X Window and other Unixenvironments available today?andP;  Interleaf decided that rather than offerdifferent font capabilities on different platforms, it would offer aconsistent font capability across al of its Interleaf 5-based products.andP;  Theuse of Speedo on all platforms will unable it to provide drivers forPostScript, Impress, IBM AFP, LeafScript and PCL 4 that permit Interleaf 5users to print to any device that supports one of those page descriptionlanguages--with full confidence that what was created on the screen will berendered on paper or film.andP;  Assuming the printer supports downloadable fonts,the user also need not worry if the fonts chosen are resident within theprinter.andM;Interleaf is not abandoning customers that drive devices that do not supportdownloadable fonts.andP;  Support for Triple-I, Compugraphic 8000 series andMonotype typesetters is still offered with Interleaf 5.andM;The display and user interface.andP;  Ever since its first product (rememberOPS?), Interleaf's trademark has been its iconic desktop and popup cascadingmenus.andP;  Introduction in 1983, this approach followed the Xerox Star butpredated the Apple Macintosh and the new graphical user interfaces: Windows,Open Look and Motif.andP;  When it introduced its Macintosh and PC Publisherproducts in 1987, Interleaf made a conscious decision to offer its customerbase desktop products that were consistent in look and feel with itsUnix-based products.andM;Today the marketplace has changed.andP;  It is now an accepted fact that graphicaluser interfaces will be part of the standard operating system, although inthe Unix world there are still at least two major interfaces to contend with(Motif and Open Look).andP;  Developers in all computer applications are beingforced to adapt their programs to these graphial interfaces or face rejectionin the market.andP;  For developers who are increasingly offering their productson multiple computers, the burden of adapting the interface to eachenvironment is not trivial--unless it is planned for in the underlying code.andM;Interleaf's answer will be to separate the window drawing and user interfaceaspects of its code completely from its underlying engine components.andP;  We saywill, because this work will not be complete until 1991.andP;  In the firstrelease, Interleaf 5 will make use of X Window for displaying windows, but itwill not offer alternative user interfaces.andP;  For example, it demonstratedInterleaf 5 at the Conference running on Sun's new OpenWindows, but it didnot show support for Open Look, which is promised for 1991.andP;  This is a goodexample of how, on the surface, Interleaf 5 looks much like TPS, butunderneath there have been significant changes.andM;By next year, Interleaf will be making use of the interface toolkits providedby hardware vendors.andP;  The Sun Open Look and ISF/Motif versions of Interleaf 5will utilize those toolkits and the Mac version will make use of Apple'sMacintosh Toolbox.andP;  In so doing, Interleaf has made it possible for itself todevelop an Interleaf 5-based product that conforms to whatever graphical userinterface is required.andM;That much is not that different from what Frame did several years ago.andP;  ButInterleaf is taking it one step further.andP;  Because Interleaf 5's interfacelayer is a set of programmable objects, it is possible to write LISP scriptsthat interact with the user interface independent of the underlying enginecode.andP;  A VAR or sophisticated user can actually tailor the user interface ofan Interleaf 5 product without a source license, much as users can createdatabase query forms with today's database management products.andP;  To ourknowledge, Interleaf is the first vendor to introduce such auser-configurable interface for a publishing product.andM;(Admittedly, it is more likely that Interleaf, a VAR or a customer systemadministrator would do this customization for end users, rather than the endusers doing it themselves.andP;  This is, after all, programming in LISP, notHyperCardD.andP;  But in the academic environment it is not unreasonable to expectthat clever end users will indeed make such modifications themselves.)andM;One question that remains is how LISP routines written for one environmentwill act in another (the Mac Toolbox has different functions from the OpenLook toolkit).andP;  Interleaf is exploring that interaction, but not until nextyear will we know how that issue is addressed.andP;  Until then, one option is toput some of the user interface right into the document.andP;  For example,Interleaf hot buttons--in-document icons that initiate actions (comparable toHyperCard buttons)--are portable across all of Interleaf 5's platformswithout any additional programming.andM;Interleaf 5 featuresandM;In addition to the fundamental changes described above, Interleaf has added anew set of publishing features to its core software.andP;  We'll describe firstthe most dramatic changes, followed by a list of other noteworthyimprovements.andM;Revision control.andP;  In TPS 4.0, it is possible to initiate edit trace to trackdifferent versions of a document, but the information that is tracked must becustom-designed by the end user or Interleaf.andP;  In Interleaf 5, revisioncontrol is a basic engine component that, when part of the package, appearsin the menu bar at the top of the document with a complete dialog box listingall of the possible items to be tracked.andM;Through the property sheet, the user establishes the style for tracingdifferent types of edits--strike-through, underlines, different colors orrevision bars, for example.andP;  It is possible to have multiple editing sessionswithin a singel version-each of which may have different styles--which allowsdifferent people to edit the same version and differentiate among eachother's edits.andM;The system automatically tracks edits to text and graphics (additions anddeletions), who made the change, when, on what system and at what time.andM;When edits are approved, a new version is saved, using a hierarchicalnumbering scheme.andP;  The popup menu allows the user to access any version,current or previous, at any time.andM;Using the Relational Document Manager (RDM), an Interleaf product based onOracle, it would be possible to add further controls, such as restrictingaccess depending on revision level.andP;  Interleaf does not offer Context'sfeautre of arbitrary display of different editing sesions (e.g., Sarah'sedits but not Bob's) unless they are recorded as separate versions, but, likeContext, it does maintain all of the revisions as iterations of the samedocument, rather than storing them all as separate documents.andP;  Storingmultiple versions as iterations of the same document makes it easier to tracethe history of changes and also saves disk space.andM;In general, Interleaf's new revision control is among the best, if not thebest, in the market.andP;  A key difference between the revision tracking ofInterleaf 5 and that of Context, which prides itself on this feature, is thatContext stores the revision information inside the document.andP;  In complexapplications, Interleaf tracks revisions in RDM (outside the document in anOracle database).andP;  Context's approach is tightly integrated with its standardproduct, but it only supports certain data types.andP;  Interleaf's standardrevision control may offer less than Context's, but through RDM it offersmore, in that it extends the basic package to include other applications andother data types created by products from other vendors.andP;  Interleaf alsotracks edits inside tables and graphics, rather than just storing differentversions.andM;Graphic object masters.andP;  Another welcome improvement is the addition of aproperty sheet for all graphic objects created inside frames.andP;  In TPS 4.0,only the frame itself had a property sheet.andP;  In Interleaf 5, everydiagramming object may be named, and every object, or group of objects,within a frame has its own property sheet.andP;  The naming of objects bringsInterleaf's graphics into its text model, where each paragraph has a name(what Interleaf calls components, or what is commonly known as a tag).andP;  Bynaming objects, Interleaf is able to apply the style-sheet approach tographics as well as text.andM;For example, a drawing may be created in which one element is repeatednumerous times.andP;  Later, when a change is made to one of those elements, it isnow possible to update all of the others automatically to reflect the change,yet still maintain transforms such as stretch, shear or rotate (see photo).andO;The change may be one of style (fills, colors, etc.), or it may be content(position, rotation, addition or deletion of objects, etc.).andP;  This feature isa powerful addition to an already-strong illustration system.andM;As if the weren't enough, there is one additional aspect to the namedobjects, one that is shared by all objects (text, frames, pages anddocuments).andP;  TPS 4.0 supported the use of &quot;extensible objects&quot;--those thatwere of an unknown data type--but it was not a feature available at the userinterface level.andP;  This feature made it possible, for example, to includegraphics in Interleaf documents for which Interleaf had no filter, or toattach security levels to documents, but it did not let you attach scripts toobjects.andP;  In Interleaf 5, the program doesn't care if attributes are data orLISP code, and Interleaf has brought the object attributes out to the userinterface.andM;For the user, the ability to create attributes easily can be quite handy.andP;  Anobvious application is assigning levels of security to objects and thenselectively displaying or suppressing elements according to their securitylevel.andP;  But, in another example, an educator might create a test tht hadquestions of different degrees of difficulty, with answers that are alsogiven attributes.andP;  The instructor could use one document to produce severaldifferent tests, with or without the answers shown.andP;  Other programs allow theuse of conditional variables, but few offer such a fluid interface forinvoking the feature.andM;But the real power of Interleaf 5 is that LISP code may be attached toobjects as an attribute.andP;  For example, Interleaf is now able to create andactivate hypertext links within a document, as attributes.andP;  (In its OpticalPublishing Software, introduced in 1989, it creates hypertext links fromtokens embedded in an output file.)andP;  The attribute of a link to anotherdocument actually contains a LISP script for opening that document andscrolling to the link destination.andP;  ArborText has done this in a similarfashion in its current version of The Publisher, and it is quite attractivefor those that create a library of electronic documents.andM;Interactive equation editor.andP;  The command-driven equation editor of TPS 4.0has been upgraded to an &quot;interactive editor&quot; in which special characters arekeyed from the keyboard or pulled off popup menus.andP;  Although it is possibleto map any keyboard character to any special or math character, Interleaf isnot supplying a default mapping for math, a feature we'd like to see added.andO;In our brief look at Interleaf 5, it appears that this package is not asslick as the equation editors of FrameMaker and The Publisher, but withoutquestion it will make Interleaf 5 a more attractive authoring tool for thosewho write a lot of math.andM;Other features.andP;  The other new features may be more subtle, but some aresignificant:andM;* &quot;Computed components.&quot;andP;  Interleaf 5 will generate content within componentsbased on other components.andP;  For example, it could extract the content ofheads in body text into running heads or feet.andM;* Illustrator's palette.andP;  Some Interleaf 5 packages will sport a new paletteof drawing tools that eliminate the need to use popup, cascading menus tocreate and manipulate objects.andP;  Even though Interleaf built intelligence intoits menus so that the popup cascades across the item it anticipates you willwant to pick, the palette is much faster and more in keeping with theinterfaces of other illustration products.andP;  Like most aspects of Interleaf 5,the palette may be customized by adding your own graphics to it.andM;* Repeating column headers.andP;  Running heads and feet may now be different forcolumns as well as facing pages.andM;* Multiple page-numbering streams.andP;  Developed specifically for thepharmaceutical market, this feature allows a single document to have morethan one set of folios.andM;* PostScript color output.andP;  The spot color facility of TPS 4.0, which createdspot color separations, has been extended to allow the printing of all, orsome, layers on PostScript color printers, such as the QMS ColorScript.andM;*External references to images.andP;  Images may now be included by referencewithout pasting them into the document, a feature that saves disk space andis useful when images are created by someone other than the author.andM;* Extended search and replace.andP;  The search and replace is now case sensitiveand has a robust set of wildcards.andM;*Authoring support.andP;  The keyboard is completely user-modifiable in allInterleaf 5-based products, so you can map your favorite actions to whateverkey you like.andP;  The macro facility of Interleaf 5 enables authors to not onlysave keystrokes and mouse clicks to keyboard combinations but also to attachscripts to keys.andP;  XyWrite has a similar capability, and we find it aninvaluable time-saver.andM;* Improved hyphenation control.andP;  You can now specify the number of lettersthat may precede or follow a hyphen.andP;  The minimum number of letters in ahyphenated word remains fixed at 5.andM;* Improved leading control.andP;  Leading may be specified as baseline tobaseline, and you may enter negative leading values.andP;  As before, leadong isin hundredths of a point.andM;Compatibility with other versions.andP;  Every software vendor offers some sort ofmigration path for converting documents created in old versions into newversions of their software, but oftentimes they neglect to offer a downwardtranslation.andP;  We are glad to see Interleaf has included a &quot;convert toprevious&quot; feature that converts Interleaf 5 documents to TPS 4.0 or InterleafPublisher (for Mac or PC) format.andP;  in addition, when converting documentsfrom older versions to the new, the user has the option of freezingcomposition so that when opened in Interleaf 5, the document will retainexactly the same line endings and pagination.andM;Packaging a productandM;Unlike past Interleaf products, Interleaf 5 is not a single product.andP;  Thecore technology may be packaged in a variety of ways to fit differentrequirements.andP;  Interleaf sees three types of end-user products: horizontalapplications, which are aimed at a broad class of users much like TPS orInterleaf Publisherandgt; vertical-market applications, which are general packagestailored to specific industries and applications: and customer-specific ones,such as developed for Grumman.andP;  Horizontal applications will be soldprimarily by the direct sales force, with help from deals with hardwaremanufacturers.andP;  The vertical market packages will be offered by VARs and byselect Interleaf sales people trained in tha tapplication.andP;  Thecustomer-spefic products are sold and developed by Interleaf's systemintegration division, which is currently the fastest-growing portion of thecompany.andP;  Where applicable, Interleaf developes vertical-market products asoffshoots of custom work.andM;Horizontal applications.andP;  At the Conference, Interleaf showcased sixgeneral-purpose packages built from Interleaf 5.andP;  All rely on the score TPSengine, but with different capabilities that reflect their primary purposes:andM;* Passport.andP;  A general-purpose compound document editor designed for everydayuse in the office, Passport is much like TPS but with the addition of theactive-document technology and without some of the advanced features (tables,equations, gray-scale editing, revision control, etc.).andP;  Initially, it willbe offered with Interleaf's user interface.andP;  Broader success may be morelikely next year, when Interleaf introduces Open Look and Motif versions,pitting this Interleaf 5 product against FrameMaker, which is now availableon more than 20 different Unix workstations.andP;  Passport will lack some of thefeatures of FrameMaker, but it may offer some that Frame lacks, such asInterleaf's graphics and charting facilities.andM;* Interleaf Engineer.andP;  Similar to Passport, this package adds the table andequation editors and the Methods Toolkit (described below).andM;* Professional Writer.andP;  In addition to the features of Passport, this packageoffers revision tracking, the optional Houghton Mifflin Writher's Helper(described below), hypertext links, live links to Lotus 1-2-3 and otherapplications and configurable keyboards for emulating other word processors.andM;* Interleaf Illustrator.andP;  Interleaf's graphics editors are no substitute forAuto-trol or InterCAP systems, but they are better suited to creatingnontechnical drawings, such as flow-charts, viewgraphs and diagrams.andP;  Adobehas ported Illustrator to DEC workstations, but as yet the market for Unixgeneral-purpose illustration tools is wide open.andP;  Interleaf's Illustrator isPassport plus all of Interleaf's graphics capabilities--drawing, gray-scaleand line-art image manipulation, graphic text, the new graphic style sheetsand a palette interface as an alternative to the popup cascading menus.andM;* Interleaf Production.andP;  This is the full-blown package that includes all ofInterleaf 5's functionality.andP;  As with the other packages, it may be extendedand tailore through the use of LISP scipts.andM;* Interleaf Academic.andP;  Containing all of Interleaf Production, plus theMethods Toolkit, this package is available free to accredited colleges anduniversities in the U.S.andP;  and Canada.andM;All of those products may be extended by LISP scripts.andP;  Those customers whobuy a product with a toolkit will have complete access to all of thesoftware's components.andP;  Those who buy a subset of the engine may upgrade toreceive more functionality.andM;Interleaf expects all of these packages to be available by the end of theyear.andP;  When we prepared this article, Interleaf was still finalizing thepricing.andP;  We expect it to range from about $2,400 to $16,000, but we willreport the actual numbers as they are made available.andM;Vertical market applications.andP;  Interleaf 5 also makes possible the buildingof a special product for niche markets, and Interleaf has already developedones for aerospace and for Amoco, which will be used in petroleumengineering.andP;  (We described its work with Amoco in our coverage from SeyboldSeminars, Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  14.)andP;  In addition to these markets, Interleafannounced its intention to develop vertical applications for pharmaceuticals,computer-aided software engineering (CASE) and automobile manufacturers.andM;Of these, the aerospace market is getting the most attention.andP;  Interleaf hasset up a business unit, led by Larry Bohn, specifically to address contractsthat demand compliance with the guidelines of the Air Transport Association(ATA, the airlines) and the Aerospace Industry Association (AIA, themanufacturers).andP;  The unit has mushroomed to 22 people in just six months, andnot just in anticipation of orders.andP;  Interleaf has already won contracts withAmerica West, Eastern and, most recently, TWA.andP;  It also has won contractswith suppliers--Canadair, Boeing, Grumman and Saab.andM;ATA demo.andP;  At the conference, Interleaf demonstrated an application developedfor an airline and since &quot;productized&quot; for use at other airlines and aircraftsuppliers.andP;  The application helps firms automate the process of producingdocuments that comply with the Airline Transport Association (ATA)guidelines.andM;The first application is an engineering change order (ECO), a document thatis created in response to changes in equipment.andP;  Typically, the manufactureror airline has one person whose job is to obtain approvals for the ECO andcoordinate any requested changes.andP;  The approval cycle usually involvesseveral people from different departments.andP;  The change order must be routed(typically in hard copy) to various people for notification, approval oraction, and the coordinator complies all of the changes into the new releaseof the ECO.andP;  Interleaf developed a product in which the entire user interfacethat the engineer deals with for an ECO is a form that he fills out.andP;  TheInterleaf 5-based product uses Interleaf's Relational Document Manager togenerate an active Interleaf document from fields in the RDM database.andO;Because of its ability to attach scripts to menu items and fields in adocument, Interleaf is able to do such things as automatically fill incertain fields of the ECO when others are entered (enter part number, getpart name)andgt; verify the validity of certain fields (entered value must meetcertain criteria or user is prompted whether value is correct)andgt; andautomatically route the ECO when it is finished.andP;  After being routed, thesame document can find and place in itself a digitized signature when someonein the chain gives approval.andP;  Yet the interface for everyone who interactswith the ECO is a self-contained from that is a document (see photo).andM;A similar application is the job instruction card, which tells themaintenance person what specific tasks are required in a maintenanceprocedure.andP;  Today, some firms create these task cards by photocopying partsof the manual and pasting them together into an instruction card.andP;  InInterleaf's software, the maintenance information from which instructions areextracted is kept as a catalog of data files that is tracked in RDM.andP;  Theheader fields that identify the card are also tracked in Oracle.andP;  Thesoftware automatically retrieves the header information and maintenanceinstructions, based on the task number(s).andP;  Graphics associated with tasksare automatically made available for placement within the card.andP;  Thus, theentire process is automated, resulting in a compound electronic document thatmay be made available in hard copy or electronic form.andM;Interleaf has also developed an aerospace-specific version of ProfessionalWriter to help authors create aircraft maintenance manuals.andP;  (Some airlinesrepublish their own, based on the manuals supplied by the manufacturerandgt;others have the manufacturer do it for them under contract.)andP;  The manualitself describes all of the maintenance procedures, following the naming andnumbering conventions established by the airline industry.andP;  Interleaf tookthese names and numbers and added them to the standard menus, so that when awriter begins a new task, it may be created by picking its part number ordescription from the Menu.andP;  The software then automatically inserts both theitem selected and its corresponding name or number, checks their validitythrough RDM and inserts them in the document.andP;  Although it was not shown,presumably it would be possible to further constrain the menus to show onlythe appropriate subtasks within any given task.andM;Grumman example.andP;  An example of a customer-specific application in which theinterface is configured for a customer is the Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA),developed by Grumman, also demonstrated at the Conference.andM;Grumman's PMA is a rugged, laptop computer designed by Grumman.andP;  It is basedon a Sparc processor, but it is specially built to withstand severe operatingconditions required for some military systems.andP;  The PMA runs Unix and isequipped with electronic manuals created in Interleaf 5.andP;  The PMA plugs intothe data bus of a military vehicle and downloads information directly fromthe weapon system's computer.andP;  Maintenance technicians, interacting with thePMA through Interleaf-created documents, press on-screen buttons to viewstep-by-step repair instructions.andP;  Scanned-in maintenance manuals are alsoavailable and are retrieved by activiting hypertext hot buttons.andM;In this case, the end user does not employ Interleaf's popup menus at all.andO;The entire interface is a programmable document that contains &quot;hot zones.&quot;andO;Activating a zone initiates a behind-the-scens scrip that brings theappropriate information to the screen.andM;Texas Instruments, another Interleaf 5 customers, demonstrated what it callsthe Table Object Population Systems, an application of Interleaf 5 that fillsin, or &quot;populates,&quot; tables within data sheets with information pulled from aproduct database.andP;  TI expects the system to reduce by as much as 40% the timeit takes to produce documentation about its semiconductors.andM;Developer's toolkitandM;In addition to selling end-user solutions, Interleaf is embarking on a newventure.andP;  For the first time, it is entering the programming market with atoolkit for building applications.andP;  Just as computer language vendors offertoolkits for creating, compling and debugging applications written in thatlanguage (C, Pascal, etc.), Interlea is selling a toolkit for building,debugging and running a publishing program.andP;  The difference is that itstoolkit includes an incredibly robust engine that provides WYSIWYG editing totext and graphics, handamp;j, pagination, font scaling and rasterizing,translators--in short, everything you need to create a programmable compounddocument editor.andM;Unlike venodrs that license source code to which users add extensions(typically in C), Interleaf allows extensions independent of the source code.andO;We believe this is a significant plus for developers.andP;  It means that they candevelop application-specific solutions that do not have to be retooled,debugged and recompiled each time Interleaf updates part of its engine.andO;LISP-based extensions are executed at run-timeandgt; they need not be precompliedcode.andP;  Yet these extensons can do anything from simple macros that may berepresented as icons (much like Windows 3.0) to interacting with other programs (databases, spreadsheets, scientific measuring equipment).andM;At this time, the toolkit is intended for independent developers (such asacademics), OEMS, sophisticated end users and for use by Interleaf itself.andM;Various support levels.andP;  Because it wants to encourage enthusiasts, Interleaffelt is was imperative to offer the toolkit inexpensively to hackers who arenot necessarily developers with lots of cash.andP;  Thus, it is offering theMethods Toolkit--the full software toolkit and documentation, but withoutsupport--for much less than the Developer's version.andP;  (As we said above, itis free to the academic market.)andP;  When they run into trouble, those who donot have a support contract will be able to buy support from Interleaf on anhourly basis.andM;For more formal developers or VARs, Interleaf is offering the Developer'sToolkit, with documentation, training and support, at a higher price.andO;Obviously, developers choosing that option will be given a higher level ofsupport than those who try it on their own.andM;Third-party productsandM;In today's market, the success of any programming language or toolkit dependson application software, particularly software written by vendors or usersother than the toolkit supplier.andM;Interleaf has always enjoyed a strong relationship with vendors ofengineering-related software.andP;  With Interleaf 5, it hopes to extend itspartnerships to other areas as well.andP;  At its press conference, about a dozenor so third-party vendors were on hand to announce their support.andM;Houghton Miffin introduced Writer's Helper, a package for Interleaf 5 thatincludes Houghton Miffin's CorrectSpell spelling checker, online AmericanHeritage Dictionary and Roget's Thesaurus and CorrectText, HM's grammarchecker.andP;  The dictionary includes definitions, so you can look up words bytheir meaning.andP;  It will also show anagrams.andM;Xerox announced a cooperative marketin agreement whereby the two companieswill recommened each other's products.andP;  For Interleaf, this means being ableto offer the new DocuTech Production Publisher, a high-speed Xerox printer(see story later in this issue for details).andP;  For Xerox, it means being ableto offer Interleaf software--an interesting move considering Xerox's recentintroduction of GlobalView--the porting of its ViewPoint software to Sunhardware.andM;Apple was present to offer its support in anticipation of the new MacInterleaf 5 next year.andP;  Presumably, that product will take full advantage ofthe new features in System 7.andM;In addition, there were companies that represent specific applications:andM;* Cadre, IDE, Lockheed and the Software Productivity Consortium announcedsupport for Interleaf with their computer-aided software engineering (CASE)tools.andM;* Lotus was happy that Interleaf will support live links to Lotus 1-2-3,version 3.andP;  The links will even support values attached to them (e.g., ifgreater than 5, then get data).andM;* IBM endorsed Interleaf in conjunction with its CASE tools for the RS-6000.andM;* Database Publishing introduced an SQL database product that links Interleaf5 to databases.andM;* Design Automation stated its intent to support Interleaf with its petroleumengineering software.andM;ConclusionandM;In its seven-year history, Interleaf has earned a reputation fortechnological innovations that have redefined electronic publishing.andP;  Forseveral years, it has been the dominant player in the compound documenteditor market, and it still has a larger installed base on Unix workstationsthan any other publishing vendor.andP;  But Interleaf's vision of becoming thecorporate standard for electronic publishing--with corporations buying aturnkey Interleaf system for every desk--has been blurred by the success ofmass-market software such as PageMaker and Ventura, which offer some of thesame features.andP;  And in the Unix market, it faces stiff competition fromFrameMaker and a growing list of new competitors (DECwrite, ArborText's ThePublisher and, soon, Ventura).andP;  In anticipation, Interleaf left the turnkeysystem business a year ago, and it now relies solely on software and servicesfor revenueS.andP;  The transition has been difficult, but Interleaf has proventhat it is no has-been.andP;  Its software sales alone this year have matched itsturnkey sales of last year.andM;Interleaf 5 continues Interleaf's tradition of unbridled innovation.andO;Believing that the value of mergin text and graphics would diminish as thatability becomes commonplace in less-expensive, mass-market products,Interleaf has moved on to new, uncharted territory, creating a new type ofpublishing application (the programable compound document editor) and inactive documents redefining what is meant by an electronic document.andP;  Withoutquestion, the publishing market is beginning to look beyond the problems ofmerging text and graphics to a new set of problems, such as documentmanagement, database-oriented publishing and content-based retrieval.andP;  Inthese areas, Interleaf is not without competition.andP;  ArborText introducedprogrammable objects a year ago.andP;  Datalogics has been hard at workintegrating Pager with Oracle and SGML-tagged databases.andP;  Digital has anagreement with Verity to bring content-based retrieval to all of its productsrunning on a network.andP;  But regardless of its fate, Interleaf 5 has opened upa whole new realm of possibilities, and by popularizing the concept of activedocuments, will almost surely leave its mark on the industry.andM;Interleaf 5 is also a foremost example of exntedible software that enablesclever end users or system integrators to tie a publishing package with otherprogram.andP;  The use of Quark Xpress in the newspaper industry is the best-knownexample of this trend.andP;  Interleaf 5 is the first product designedspecifically to address these emerging issues, and it does so in a way thatgoes far beyond any previous product.andM;What remains is for Interleaf to prove that Interleaf 5 works, and that thecompany can thrive in its new role of software developer cum systemintegrator.andP;  It has won several multimillion-dollar contracts based on itstechnology, and installed a few at customer sites, examples of which wereshown at the Conference.andP;  But it has yet to begin volume production.andP;  When itdoes in a few months, Interleaf will have the change to dispel its skepticsand separate itself from its competition.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
