Witnesses said they saw Harrison drag the driver out of the carand into the roadway. He then got back in the car but ran off afterfailing to start the engine.   Harrison was handcuffed when the detectives put him into thecar, but witnesses said he had somehow managed to remove the cuffs.A pair of handcuffs was found in the front seat.   Police said Harrison has an extensive criminal record datingback to 1984, including drug and assault charges. In 1985, he wassentenced to a year in jail for biting off a girlfriend's ear.
