The first Iranian crude allowed to U.S. shores since 1987,the shipment signals Iran's efforts to take advantage ofIraq's and Kuwait's current inability to export crude.</LP><TEXT>   The issuance of a license to Coastal could be a first steptoward greater normalization of U.S. commerce with Iran andreflects a softening by the administration as well as Iranianofficials.   &quot;Iran is reaching out to re-establish itself in theinternational community,&quot; said Daniel Yergin, an oilhistorian and head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, aconsulting firm. &quot;With the Gulf crisis over, the way is openfor Iran to re-emerge as a global oil power and to re-emergeas a regional power.&quot;   The import of Iranian crude is a positive development forthe U.S. consumer. &quot;It will put some downward pressure on oilprices,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, president of the PetroleumIndustry Research Foundation. &quot;Even if Iranian imports don'tdrive prices down significantly, it will certainly keep a lidon any increases.&quot;   Iran has been selling crude to U.S. companies outside ofthe country but seeks to expand its sales directly to theU.S., the world's single biggest oil market. &quot;We have been atraditional supplier of oil to the U.S. and to Europe,&quot; JavadYarjani, managing director of the Singapore office ofNational Iranian Oil Co., said in a recent interview.   &quot;In the early 1970s we sold more than one million barrelsa day to the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Yarjani noted. &quot;We didn't stop salesto the U.S. It was the other way around.&quot;   President Carter placed an embargo against Iranian oilimports after hostages were taken in 1979 in the U.S. Embassyin Tehran. He also froze all Iranian assets. The oil embargowas lifted on Jan. 20, 1981, after the hostages werereleased. Between 1982 and 1987, small quantities of Iraniancrude moved into the U.S., but nowhere near the 304,000barrels a day brought into the U.S. in 1979 prior to thehostage crisis.   In 1987, the U.S. again barred Iranian crude importsbecause of Iran's role in terrorist activities. This pastNovember, however, the U.S. again reversed its position,although payment must be made into an escrow account and notdirectly to Iran. The regulations were printed up duringMarch, and the first applications were received in April andMay.   Iran moved to expand sales to the U.S. during the1973-1974 Arab oil embargo, when a lot of Iranian crude wentto the U.S. to replace Arab oil that was shipped to Japan andother non-embargoed points. Now, the National Iranian Oil Co.sees an opportunity to capture Iraq's old customers in theU.S. just as it has successfully targeted Iraqi clients inJapan that can't buy crude because of the United Nationssanctions against that country. War-damaged Kuwait stillcan't produce significant amounts of oil.   A number of U.S. companies, including Coastal and MobilCorp., have been buying Iranian crude but have kept withinthe bounds of U.S. law because they didn't import it. AnIranian official said that Coastal has an agreement with Irancalling for the sale of 130,000 barrels a day under a termcontract, to be processed at its Aruba refinery.   Coastal wouldn't comment about its import license. ButIranian officials said the 2.5 million-barrel shipment ofcrude has been heading toward the U.S. for some time. IfCoastal hadn't gotten Treasury approval, the crude would havegone to the Aruba refinery. At current market prices, theshipment is valued at about $38 million.   In addition to Iranian crude, Coastal has processed Libyancrude that is also banned in the U.S. Through a Bermudasubsidiary, the company owns a German refinery with theLibyans. Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, Coastal was a very largebuyer of Iraqi crude and continued to maintain ties evenafter the U.N. sanctions.   A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department's Office ofForeign Asset Control said that several other applications toimport Iranian crude were pending, although she declined toidentify the companies. But many oil companies have expressedinterest, she said.   Chevron Corp., San Francisco, has a tentative agreementwith the Iranians and applied for a license yesterday, acompany spokeswoman confirmed. It's believed the transactionwould involve one million to three million barrels of crude,the amount of a typical deal for Mideast crude. Chevrondoesn't yet know whether the oil will be used in its ownrefineries or sold to third parties.   Michael Couch, vice president of supply and transportationof Fina Inc., Dallas, an affiliate of Belgium's PetrofinaS.A., said he met last week with officials in Washington todiscuss a license but hasn't applied for one. &quot;We don't seeany rush,&quot; he said. The Iranian oil &quot;will be coming in herevery quickly, even if we don't get a license,&quot; he said. Mr.Couch said Fina could process Iranian crude through itsrefineries by buying such crude imported by another company.   ---   James Tanner contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
