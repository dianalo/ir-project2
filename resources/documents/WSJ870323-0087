Russell used to play trombone in Pittsburgh burlesque houses and with big bands in the Southeast. He gave it up for banking, but he still knows how to attract a crowd.    Mr. Russell, the president of Visa International, a bank-owned credit-card association, recently urged members to consider halting sales of American Express Co. services in retaliation for the financial-service giant's recent decision to begin offering a new cut-rate credit card.    Consumer groups denounced the plea as an illegal restraint of trade, and Congress is considering an inquiry. But Mr. Russell is resolute. &quot;Banks need to realize that there is a fox in the henhouse,&quot; he declares. Visa and the 56-year-old Mr. Russell, who enjoys riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, have collided with consumers and Congress before. Critics have long alleged that Visa member banks and other card issuers inflate interest rates. As in past years, Congress is currently considering imposing rate ceilings, and some consumer groups think such a law would be an appropriate response to Mr. Russell's recent harangue.    But the push in Congress has fallen short in the past, with Mr. Russell's plain talk helping to lead the opposition. &quot;He is more vociferous, but his statements probably reflect the general thought of the leading card issuers,&quot; says Pete Hart, a First Interstate Bancorp executive vice president.    Forewarned, First Interstate, which offers American Express Gold cards and travelers checks, is &quot;reevaluating our relationship&quot; with American Express, according to Mr. Hart. Nothing rash is planned, he says, but the new card -- Optima -- is &quot;without question an intrusion into our business.&quot;    American Express and the banks are used to being allies rather than adversaries. American Express cards generally don't offer revolving credit, and banks have marketed them alongside their Visa and MasterCard cards, which do.    But Optima will compete head-on. The card will cost $15 a year, in addition to the $45 that American Express charges for its regular card. But it will extend 13.5% credit. The average Visa card also carries a $15 annual fee, but it has a stiffer 17.5% rate, and several big banks charge even more.    American Express says only a limited number of existing customers will be offered the new card. It doesn't expect to issue many more than two million of them by 1990, compared with about 100 million current Visa card holders. It doesn't know what the fuss is all about.    &quot;We are not basically in the credit business,&quot; says an American Express spokesman. &quot;We're going after a select market.&quot;    But the elite group that American Express is targeting has been a major source of bank credit card earnings. Banks also believe that the American Express estimates are too modest, and some fear a plastic rate war.    &quot;They aren't going to fail,&quot; says Mr. Russell. &quot;I don't admire their ethics, but I certainly respect their knowledge.&quot; He thinks American Express is misleading consumers, arguing that the Optima rate is closer to 18% when the tie-in with the regular card is considered.    The flap comes at a time when Visa and its members have few other reasons to complain. There are 22% more Visa card holders world-wide than there were two years ago. The group, which furnishes members with new products, system support and other services, is developing computerized cards and new links with automated teller machines. For the banks, credit cards have been a growing source of profits, although tax changes and a growing consumer debt load portend possibly slower future growth.    In orchestrating Visa's expansion, Mr. Russell has hit a few wrong notes with bankers and competitors. Two years ago, he led the opposition against a merger proposal from rival MasterCard, an idea that some bank issuers of both cards thought would cut costs for them and consumers.    Mr. Russell says that the benefits were overrated and that a merger raises possible antitrust problems. Instead, he has backed joint efforts, but some question his interest in cooperating. Visa and MasterCard have been studying a national network to process retail store debit card transactions. Last fall, however, Visa agreed to manage a large similar operation in California, and some MasterCard officials worried that the joint venture had been doomed. Mr. Russell denies this.    His comments about American Express also have some precedent. Last summer, as part of a campaign to blunt another budding competitor, Visa encouraged members to refuse to honor Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s Discover card in their automated teller machines.    Along the way, critics believe consumers have been cheated. Card rates haven't fallen nearly as sharply as other interest rates since 1980. Current rates also reflect a jump in write-offs of bad credit card loans, which some banks have brought upon themselves through aggressive marketing.    Mr. Russell argues that usury laws depressed rates below market levels years ago, making current rates seem high. He also says critics ignore administrative costs in their rate attacks. The steeper write-offs, he contends, stem more from &quot;lax&quot; bankruptcy laws and heavy unemployment in the major oil-producing states than indiscriminate card marketing.    While Mr. Russell faces possible congressional and Justice Department investigations into his American Express comments, he says Visa welcomes the attention. &quot;We've nothing to hide, never had,&quot; adds the executive, who joined Visa in 1971.    Like scores of musicians, he put down his horn when television arrived in the 1950s. While hunting for a music-store job one day in 1953, a rainstorm forced him to take cover at a branch of what is now PNC Financial Corp. The bank hired him as a collector in its installment loan department. He married a former Pittsburgh radio singer who he used to back up in the band.    Weather permitting, Mr. Russell commutes every day from his Novato, Calif., home in his single-engine airplane. The 20-minute flight helps him forget his troubles. &quot;You can't think about anything else when you're flying,&quot; he says. &quot;When I fly home, I don't have a problem anymore.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
