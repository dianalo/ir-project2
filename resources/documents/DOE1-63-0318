Liquid Fuels and Energy Crops in particularare closely related and coordinated by Agriculture Canada. The overallobjective is to coordinate projects to develop vertically integratedsystems of technologies around fuels produced from agriculture and foodsystem based resources through unit processes in fuel conversion andfinal end use. The specific energy crop objective is geared towards establishingan expanded resource base for agriculture and energy production, andexpanded markets in the energy supply industry for plant products. Tomeet the need to help farmers achieve a measure of fuel self-sufficiency,fuel conversion projects, centred on the farm or farm communities havebeen initiated. These include fuel ethanol production, vegetable oilextraction, and developing a tamperproof method of denaturing ethanolwith minimum Excise inspection. This program of research and developmentincludes the testing of alcohols, vegetable oils, and gaseous fuels (propane,CNG) and their derivatives and blends with conventional fuels in agriculturalmobile equipment. Most of ERDAF research work is performed through contract.However, an in-house fuels test facility is planned at the Swift CurrentResearch Station. Parts of the total agriculture energy system will becomecommercialized before others since unit processes and sub-systems areat various stages of development. Some opportunities in byproduct processingare already commercial. Others, not yet proven at the pilot plant level,may be ready for commercialization within 3-7 years.</TEXT></DOC>
