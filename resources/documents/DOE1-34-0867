It is also capable of handling and treating oily wastesolids, sludges, and liquids. Recent test work has studied and demonstrateduse of the Processor plant and technology for clean up treatment of thesematerials. The plant produces separate water products, thermally crackedoil products, and a combusted solids residue. This residue is environmentallyacceptable for permanent disposal. A prototype plant has been designedfor clean up treatment of the wastes of a decommissioned refinery sitein Canada. This paper presents the Taciuk Processor technology, describesthe evaluation and test work on oil contaminated wastes, and discussesthe potential of portable Taciuk Process plants to service the wastetreatment needs of the oil industry. 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
