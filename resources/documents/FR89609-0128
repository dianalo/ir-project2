The statutory basis for the issuance of the ShowCause Order was that the pharmacy's continued registration with DEA wouldbe inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C.823(f) and 824(a)(4).Stanley Spiegel, owner of the pharmacy, timely requested a hearing whichwas held in Miami, Florida on April 15, 1988. The Government called twowitnesses, and proffered ten exhibits into evidence. Mr. Spiegel, assistedby counsel, testified on his own behalf but offered no exhibits into evidence.Both parties filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. OnDecember 15, 1988, the Administrative Law Judge recommended that Respondentretain its DEA Certificate of Registration and that any pending applicationsfor renewal be granted.The Administrator has reviewed the entire file together with the judge'srecommendation and makes the following findings: An audit of Respondentconducted by Florida state investigators in September 1983, revealed ashortage of Vicodin, a Schedule III controlled substance. On July 9, 1984,Mr. Spiegel was convicted of unlawfully dispensing a prescription drugin the Lee County Circuit Court for the State of Florida. According toFlorida procedure, adjudication of guilt was withheld and Mr. Spiegel wasplaced on probation for five years. The probation was terminated aftertwo years.It appears from the record that Mr. Spiegel has successfully completedhis probationary period and fulfilled all the conditions placed on him.Likewise there have been no recurring violations by the pharmacy since1983. The Administrator therefore finds that it would be unduly harsh torevoke Respondent's registration in light of its rehabilitation.Accordingly, the Administrator of the DEA, pursuant to the authority vestedin him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders thatDEA Certificate of Registration, AR7370694, not be revoked, and that anyoutstanding applications for renewal of those registrations be granted.This order is effective June 9, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
