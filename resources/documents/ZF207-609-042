thisoutput would then be translated - taking a maximum of 80 seconds - and outputin English at the user's terminal; the system is planned for launch nextyear, when other subjects will be added to the database alongside the presentcomputer information.andM;- o -andM;Apple Computer Japan is following the US and European operations in reducingprices on the older models of the Macintosh by an average of 15%, but theSE30 and the IIcx have only just been released in Japan and will not besubject to price cuts; the Mac SE/HD40 has been reduced by 21% and the Plusby 7.5%; an Apple spokesman said that the company plans to increase itsJapanese sales to the equivalent of $482m by 1993 - it currently holds only2% of Japan's personal computer market.andM;- o -andM;The proposed merger of graphics minisupercomputer makers Ardent Computer Corpand Stellar Computer Inc to create Stardent Inc affects their distributors inJapan: while Kubota Ltd will now manufacture Stellar as well as Ardentcomputers at its Yamanashi plant - within six months if possible, Stellar hastwo distributors in Japan, Mitsui Corp and Asahi Chemical Industry Co, andthe exact future relationship between the three companies has yet to beclarified; the Kubota executive responsible for the development of the Ardentbusiness in Japan, will join the board of the new Stardent company.andM;- o -andM;Yokogawa Electric Co, Hewlett-Packard Co's partner in Japan, has become onlythe second company in Japan after Hitachi Ltd to join the renegade OpenSoftware Foundation rather than the true - well not blue - Unix InternationalInc, and while the move makes sense since as well as partnering Hewlett,Yokogawa also works closely with IBM Japan, the industry is abuzz withrumours about Yokogawa possibly setting to compete with Hewlett with its ownseparate computer business - it acquired US-based Digital Computer in October1987 and Supertek Japan in June, and it is expected to use these to enlargeits share of the supercomputer and workstation markets.andM;- o -andM;The automatic teller machine services of Japan's financial institutions willbe linked into a single network for the first time by the middle of next year- currently, the cash-dispenser systems of some banks are linked while othersare not and reject your card: there are more than 68,400 dispensers inoperation around Japan, not including the post office savings accountmachines, which number 8,411: the services of each of the banks will belinked in three stages to Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp's computersystem, with the initial stage, involving the linking of commercial andregional banks, to be complete by early February 1990, followed by the 68second regional banks or mutual financing banks and the seven trust banks;the third stage will involve the linking of credit unions and creditassociations - and Citibank's Japanese affiliate will partipate.andM;- o -andM;While the high investment in production capacity has enabled the supply ofcommodity 1M-bit dynamic random access memory chips to keep pace with demand,the same is not the case for premium high-speed 1Ms, but help is at hand -NEC Corp has decided to try to increase its market share by raising output offast 1Ms, which are in increading demand for use in high-performance personalcomputers; NEC says it will make some 200m units of 60nS to 70nS 1Ms by theend of this year - and also increase output of 100nS access 1Ms.andM;- o -andM;Also betting on fast 1Ms, NMB Semiconductor Corp, soon to go public in Tokyo,will double its current production capacity of about 500,000 a month by nextyear, and taking output up to 2m a month, and most will also be fast oneswith access times of 70nS to 80nS.andM;- o -andM;While most manufacturers are still ramping up output of 4M-bit memory chips,Toshiba Corp is ready with a second generation 4M part to go into productionfrom April, once it has got output of standard 4Ms over the 1m a month mark:the new part is to design rules 0.1 micron better than the first generation4Ms, which means Toshiba can squeeze it into a 1M package, the effect ofwhichis to improve the access time to a racy 60nS, and Toshiba expects thatthe new chip will immediately be attractive to firms already buying 1Ms andhelp it gain the upper hand in DRAMs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
