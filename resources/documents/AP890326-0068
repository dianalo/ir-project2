A British report said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards wereholding the yacht and demanding a ransom.   There were conflicting accounts about the identities of thehostages.   Press reports in the Persian Gulf area said five members ofKuwait's Al-Sabah royal family and four young British women weretaken captive when the yacht was seized Thursday afternoon.   A diplomatic source in Kuwait, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the 82-foot yacht Sailka had four British male crewmembers on board when it disappeared in the northern gulf on a tripfrom Bahrain to Kuwait.   The official Gulf News Agency in Bahrain issued a brief dispatchlate Sunday saying ``responsible sources in Bahrain and Kuwaitdenied the reports circulated by new agencies about the loss of ayacht carrying gulf and foreign individuals aboard.   ``The sources in the two countries affirmed tonight that theofficial quarters had no information about the loss of any vesselor yacht or persons missing at sea.''   A Kuwaiti source said a report carried by a Kuwaiti newspaperabout the missing yacht ``is completely baseless. The governmenthas no information whatever about the reported hijacking of theyacht.'' The source spoke with the condition of anonymity.   Britain's Independent Television News quoted diplomatic sourcesin Kuwait as saying the yacht was seized for ransom after itstrayed into a sensitive area near Iran's Farsi Island.   It did not identify the sources but reported they said Kuwaitigovernment officials had leaked details of the abductions to theKuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa because Iran's Revolutionary Guards weredemanding a high ransom and negotiations between Kuwait and Iranwere going badly. Al-Anbaa reported the story under bannerheadlines.   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Kuwait said, ``We have noinformation yet. We read the report like you in the newspaper.''   A spokesman at the British Foreign Office in London was askedabout the report and he said, ``We've asked our embassies in theregion but they know nothing about it.''   Al-Anbaa said it had the names of the people aboard thecomandeered yacht but would not publish them ``to avoid affectingthe secret contacts going on with Iran at the highest levels to endthe incident.''   But the usually reliable newspaper said that among the captiveswas the son of a prominent Arab who is not from the gulf region.   It said the blue-and-white yacht had departed from France anddocked at Bahrain. A distress signal was picked up at 4 p.m., sixhours after the vessel left Bahrain Thursday for Kuwait, accordingto the report.   George E. Covino, maintenance manager of Bahrain's Marina Club,said a distress signal was received Thursday but the time he gavewas about two hours later than that given by Al-Anbaa.   Covino reported that in the distress call a man speaking Englishwith an Arabic accent said: ``My yacht is burning. What can I do.''The yacht club manager said the caller did not respond to a requestfor his location.   Gulf shipping executives noted that during the eight-year warbetween Iran and Iraq Iranian boats frequently seized vessels ifthey strayed into Iranian territorial waters.   Farsi Island was a base for gunboats used by Iran'sRevolutionary Guards to attack oil tankers and other merchant shipsduring the war, which was halted by a cease-fire last August.   Kuwait was one of Iraq's main financial backers during the war,and Iran claimed the ships its gunboats attacked were providingsupplies to Iraq.   Kuwait registered 11 tankers in the United States and the U.S.Navy provided a war fleet in the gulf to protect shipping. Otherforeign forces also sent warships into the gulf.   Kuwaiti-Iranian relations had been improving since thecease-fire, but friction surfaced March 15 when Kuwait said anumber of fugitives it was seeking for plotting a coup against thegovernment were operating freely in Iran.   Three distant cousins of Kuwaiti's ruler, Sheik Jaber Al-AhmedAl-Sabah, were among 112 passengers and crew aboard a KuwaitiAirways jet hijacked by Shiite Moslem gunman last April on a flightfrom Thailand to Kuwait. The hostages were released unharmed afterthe 16-day ordeal ended in Algeria.</TEXT></DOC>
