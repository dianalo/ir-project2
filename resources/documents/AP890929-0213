(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The images of war wrought by HurricaneHugo conjured up memories of another devastating time in SouthCarolina history when the carcasses of houses dotted the landscapeand the weary mourned for more than their dead.   ``I feel like my forefathers must have felt at the close of theWar Between the States. I think we lost life as we know it,'' saidW. Jean Woods, a councilman in neighboring Berkeley County.   ``Our economy has been laid waste. Our land has been laid waste.We're all emotionally scarred,'' Woods said.   This time, the villain wasn't an invading army, althoughCharleston has suffered its share of natural disaster in itsglorious 319-year history.   This time a way of life was gone with a wind named Hugo, akiller that roared across the Caribbean and struck a bulls-eye onCharleston before it fizzled off the weather radar screens as alow-pressure system in western Pennsylvania.   The hurricane and its remnants killed 33 people in the Caribbeanand 29 in the United States, including 18 in South Carolina. The12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in this century,Hugo caused an estimated $3 billion damage in this state alone.   Charleston, a jewel of the Old South now with 65,000 residents,has weathered much since it was founded in 1670. The Britishoccupied it in the Revolutionary War; the Union bombarded it in theCivil War.   The city survived a disastrous fire in 1861 and earthquakes in1886 and 1893. Now it can add Hugo to its battle flag.   Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were firedby the first state to secede from the Union, fell not toConfederate cannons but to Hugo's tidal surge. It was swamped by a17-foot wave, sustained $1 million damage and is under repair.   ``Charleston just won't ever be the same. When the hurricanehit, it took a piece of Charleston with it,'' said Renee Lappe, 30.``It looked like a bomb had been dropped. If you ride in thestreets, it makes you want to cry.''   In all, 63 buildings in Charleston collapsed and 381 have severestructural damage, officials said. Four of five structures haveroof damage of some degree.   Some buildings in Charleston date back to the 1690s. Itshistoric district sits on a peninsula that sticks out like a tongueinto its harbor, where a fictional Rhett Butler ran the Unionblockade.   About 75 percent of the city's 3,500 building considered to beof historical significance were damaged, including 20 to 30 thatwere severely damaged or razed. Then as the second part of a cruelcombination punch, the structures were hit by several inches ofrain two days after Hugo left.   Damage to those buildings was put in the hundreds of millions ofdollars and could take five years to repair, according to teams ofpreservationists who rushed to the city's aid from all over thecountry.   ``We're not destroyed, but we're hurt,'' said Lawrence Walker ofthe Historic Charleston Foundation, grateful that thepastel-colored antebellum mansions weren't subjected to more ruin.   The mahogany altar at the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul wassplintered by a stone roof support that crashed down when Hugogouged a gaping hole in the roof of the Roman revival structurebuilt in 1815.   ``At least the Yankees aren't shooting at us this time,'' saidthe Very Rev. Nelson Koscheski.   As in any battle, there were heroes.   In McClellanville, a shrimping village of 500 residents in theCarolina Lowcountry, Hugo unleashed its mightiest tidal surge of 20feet. The entire town was devastated. Boats 68 feet long weretossed into yards as if they were toys.   Thomas Colleton, 57, hoisted his family of nine up to the innerrafters of his one-story house as waters flooded in and rose up tohis chest as he lifted the children.   ``I wanted to be the last one (up),'' Colleton said later.``When you hear a man screaming for help and nobody can help him,you know it's terrible.''   ``Lives are just devastated,'' said Jimmy Scott, 45, as hescraped the muck from his home. ``It's really gone with the windthis time. Literally. There's nothing to do but pick up the piecesand start over.''   Frances Graham, 74, stacked her furniture and furnishings on thefront lawn in an attempt to dry them. Water had surged 10 feet intothe house. A building she had never seen before was dumped in theback yard.   ``It was absolute pandemonium,'' Mrs. Graham said ``We may bescrounging around for food just like Scarlett O'Hara. We just don'tknow where to turn.''   Charleston issued an emergency ordinance to prevent pricegouging on items such as ice and chain saws. A fist fight broke outin one ice line.   Some looting was also reported in Myrtle Beach. ``It's likestealing from a graveyard,'' shopowner Connie Brewer said.   But for the most part, people quietly picked up the pieces.   The National Guard enforced a dawn-to-dusk curfew and martiallaw was imposed on the Isle of Palms, one of the barrier islandsthat absorbed the brunt of Hugo's ferocity.   After getting his first look at the devastation, Thomas Harper,a retired Air Force officer, said, ``It looks like what happensafter artillery fire.''   Some island and coastal residents who may have lost everythingthey had to Hugo faced another devastating prospect: a state lawenacted to curb beach erosion may prevent some from rebuilding.   And more than a week after Hugo roared through, 203,000 peoplewere without power, most of them in the Charleston area.Storm-battered residents coped without electricity, without hotwater for showers, without ways to cook hot food as convoys ofelectrical workers strung new power lines.   They queued up for meals, canned food, ice, air mattresses, gaslanterns, shoes and clothes at distribution points.   ``This will keep us alive,'' said a grateful Fesella Ladson, 25,of Charleston, carrying a cardboard box filled with emergencysupplies.   The American Red Cross mounted a $42 million relief effort, themost expensive relief effort in its 126-year history.   Supplies poured in from around the country, but folks in therural areas felt the recovery moved glacier-like.   Mayor Hazel Parson-Starkes of Ridgeville blamed Hugo for ``theworst devastation in any of our lives.''   ``We have no food, water, power or anything. We're pleading forall the help we can get. I just don't know how we're going to getthrough this.''   Hugo's fury recalled the age-old awe of Caribbean Indians whobowed before a god of wind named Hurrican.   In South Carolina, its brute energy created incongruous scenes:boats blown a half-mile inland, roofs sheared off, trees twistedinto spaghetti-like heaps.   ``It really rattled us to our roots,'' said Dr. Linda Austin ofthe Medical University of South Carolina.   Somehow, people began rebuilding their homes and their lives.Some in Charleston found a force more indomitable than the guns ofarmies or nature's mightiest forces.   Kris Holmes waited patiently for a leasing company to put theroof back on her business, Terrible Tom's Pastry Shop. She hoped toreopen soon.   ``It's the spirit of Charleston,'' she said. ``We're survivors.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 1</NOTE></DOC>
