Mainly to Trevino.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TIRADE AGAINST HIS CADDIE EMBARRASSING -- TOTREVINO  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  On Golf  </MEMO><TEXT>     Obviously, in the heat of competition, things are said that are laterregretted. But Trevino, 51, should know better. He had played the par-3 16thhole all week. He said after hitting his tee shot out of bounds, which wreckedany chance he had of catching the eventual winner, George Archer, that caddieHerman Mitchell advised him to hit a 6-iron rather than a 7-iron. When the6-iron went long and out of bounds, Trevino jumped all over Mitchell, hiscaddie since 1977.;   Trevino has been a pro for more than 30 years. It is hisdecision, not his caddie's, on club selection. Golfers like to blame someoneelse, something else, for bad shots and bad rounds. OK, give Trevino that. Buthe should do it in private, not in public.;   Mitchell is back caddying forTrevino this weekend in Napa.;   &quot;I have never fired Herman,&quot; Trevino said. &quot;Imay be dumb, but I'm not stupid. The guy weighs 310 pounds -- how do you getrid of a guy who weighs 310?&quot;;   But another incident like the one at RanchoMurieta may change things -- Mitchell might just &quot;fire&quot; Trevino.; WAKEPROMOTED: Head pro positions at golf clubs long have been a bastion for males,but things are changing.;   Kathy Wake, 27, who grew up in Los Altos andHollister, has been named head pro at Ridgemark. She succeeds Jim Crotz, whohas moved to a similar position at Paso Robles Country Club. Wake, a Ridgemarkemployee since 1985, became the second woman head pro in Northern California.She was preceded by Carol Pence of Mira Vista in Richmond.;   &quot;The membershiphas been very supportive,&quot; said Wake. &quot;I didn't think this opportunity wouldcome along so quickly. I'm delighted it happened in my hometown.&quot;; SOLEYHONORED: Clyne Soley of San Jose, who may be the world's champion hole-in-onemaker, is being honored for something else. The U.S. Golf Association haspresented him with a framed statement of recognition for his pioneering workin handicap research and the slope system.;   A retired engineer, Soley saidhe was &quot;one of the first to get the slope idea going, but a lot of peoplecontributed.&quot;;   The slope system takes course difficulty into account whendetermining the golfer's handicap.;   Soley, 75, who is suffering from cancer,has slowed in his ace-making achievements. His last one came April 17 at TheVillages and was his 86th. He has meticulously documented each hole-in-one.Many were made on The Villages 18-hole par-3 course. But an ace is an ace, andit is considered legitimate as long as it occurs during an 18-hole round andis witnessed by one or more people.;   Despite his ailment, Soley iscontinuing his work in handicap research. &quot;And I'm still giving everybody abad time,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise they'll think I'm sick.&quot;; ETC.: Pine Valley(N.J.) has been named the nation's No. 1 course for the seventh straight yearby a 420-member Golf Digest panel. I question the Pine Valley ranking becauseit has never hosted the world's best players in tournament play. Would itstand up or would they tear it apart? The list of the top 100 courses includes13 from California. The top four California layouts all are in NorthernCalifornia. Cypress Point is No. 3 nationwide, Pebble Beach No. 5, OlympicClub-Lake No. 10 and San Francisco C.C. No. 20.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dan Hruby column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911020  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  640  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 20, 199100294161,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
