Mr. Breeden's disclosure came the day after the FederalNational Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said it waschanging procedures for sales of its debt because of inflatedcustomer orders by Salomon Brothers Inc., a unit of SalomonInc., and other Wall Street firms. Several othergovernment-backed agencies yesterday said they were reviewingtheir rules for selling securities because of the inflatedorders and false reports filed with them.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC and Justice Department had been focusing theircivil and criminal investigations solely on Salomon'sadmitted violations in the Treasury-securities market. But inthe past few days, the probe has broadened to includepossible wrongdoing by Salomon and other firms in the hugemarket for debt issued by government-sponsored, privatelyowned corporations such as Fannie Mae and the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac.   Such agencies as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac providecrucial financing for the nation's housing market. Thoseagencies sell debt through Wall Street firms, use the moneyto buy hundreds of billions of dollars of home mortgages andrepackage them as mortgage-backed securities to be sold toinvestors.   The original debt sales are done through Wall Streetdealers who act as underwriters by telling the agencies howmuch debt they can use. But the firms apparently routinelyhype their customers' level of interest so that they can buyenough of the debt when the agencies ration it.   A Fannie Mae spokesman said the overbidding is widespread.&quot;It's endemic to the system, we are confident of that,&quot; hesaid. &quot;It's a more serious problem than we thought, and itinvolved much of the selling group&quot; of securities firmsthat routinely bids for the offerings.   In testimony before the Senate Securities Subcommittee,Mr. Breeden also disclosed that more subpoenas and requestsfor information will be sent to Wall Street firms andindividuals in the investigation of Salomon. He said he isn'taware of wrongdoing by other firms equal to Salomon'sadmission that it broke bidding rules at fiveTreasury-securities auctions. But, he added, &quot;I'm not aboutto issue a clean bill of health to anybody without furtherreview.&quot;   At the same hearing, Salomon's interim chairman, WarrenBuffett, said that former Chairman John Gutfreund and formerPresident Thomas Strauss &quot;might have been fired&quot; by thefirm's board within two or three days of when they resignedlast month because, he said, they withheld information fromthe board and regulators.   Mr. Buffett said both former officials were told aboutfalse auction bids in April, but failed to report the problemuntil August, after the firm had been contacted bylaw-enforcement authorities. Asked why board members didn'tknow of the wrongdoing until the firm announced theviolations in August, Mr. Buffett said, &quot;It's very toughunder the standard system if the top two people in the firmand the chief legal officer know something and keep it fromyou.&quot;   Mr. Buffett's testimony was directly in keeping with hisapparent strategy of distancing Salomon from its formermanagement and portraying the firm's misdeeds as the acts ofjust a few officials, all of whom have been dismissed. But areport released yesterday by Salomon disclosed that thefirm's treasurer, John Macfarlane, raised questions about thegovernment-trading desk's plan to control a huge chunk of aMay auction. The report says Mr. Macfarlane brought hisquestions to the attention of others. At the least, Mr.Macfarlane's questions indicate that other Salomon executivesknew of the actions during the May auction.   Mr. Buffett also told senators that a remarkable 90Salomon employees earned $1 million or more last year, afigure that led senators to express hopes that Mr. Buffettcould turn the firm into a model for a lower-paid WallStreet.   Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York, said inflated Wall Street salaries may contributeto misdeeds. &quot;Human nature being what it is,&quot; he testified,&quot;compensation practices that hold out the potential formillions of dollars of annual income seem to me to entail theclear danger that reasonable standards of prudence and ethicscan, all too easily, be cast aside for the sake of writingthat next ticket.&quot;   Mr. Breeden described the problem in auctions byquasi-government agencies as widespread. &quot;With respect toother markets, other than the Treasury auctions itself, theredo appear to be other cases in which there has been use offalse information in connection with purchases of securitiesof other federal agencies,&quot; he said. &quot;And we are pursuingquite vigorously that aspect of the investigation.&quot;   Mr. Breeden said, &quot;It's not a small number of firms. Iwould say it is more than a few.&quot; But he quickly added thatthose inflated bids weren't connected to attempts to cornerthe market in those securities, as Salomon apparently triedto do in the May Treasury auction.   Virtually every quasi-government agency that issues debtis scrutinizing its sales practices following the disclosuresby Salomon, which traded heavily in all types of governmentdebt. So far, most are saying they haven't founddiscrepancies.   Freddie Mac said it is stepping up audits of activities ofits dealers over the last three years, but didn't say why orhow. &quot;To date, we felt it was between us and our dealers,&quot;said John Gibbons, vice president of financial research forFreddie Mac. The mortgage-repackaging agency has 25 dealersin its $8.1 billion of long-term debt outstanding.   The Federal Housing Finance Board, which oversees the12-member Home Loan Bank System, said it began an intensereview of its debt sales shortly after the Salomondisclosure. The Home Loan Bank System has $110 billion indebt outstanding. The Government National MortgageAssociation, or Ginnie Mae, also is reviewing its debttrades, but hasn't yet found discrepancies.   Fannie Mae asked its traders for information on tradesdating back three years, and also sought any information thatthe traders' companies might have filed with the SEC.   A bill introduced earlier this week by Sens. ChristopherDodd (D., Conn.) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) would make ita violation of securities law to falsely bid for governmentagency debt, including that of government-backed agencies.Senate staffers said that the Treasury fought the originalinclusion of these agencies in the legislation but backeddown.   Assistant Treasury Secretary Jerome Powell said that wassimply a matter of learning about the market. &quot;At thebeginning of the day, our position was we don't understandit,&quot; he said in an interview last night. &quot;As we understoodthe process better after conversations with Fannie Mae andothers, we determined it was the right position.&quot; TheTreasury now supports the bill.   The actions in the market for government-sponsored agencydebt are further fallout from Salomon's shocking disclosuresa month ago. Since that time, the firm has fired topmanagement and senior traders, scrambled to keep customersand pushed hard to project a new, clean image to regulatorsand the public. At the same time, the firm has been girdingfor law-enforcement agencies to come down with penalties.   In its report to Congress yesterday, Salomon added anotherpiece to the puzzle. The firm disclosed yesterday that itsformer government bond chief, Paul Mozer, contacted thetreasurer, Mr. Macfarlane, who also heads Salomon's financedesk, shortly before the May two-year note auction. Mr.Mozer, who has since been fired, asked Mr. Macfarlane tofinance about $15 billion in May two-year notes, the reportsaid.   Salomon said Mr. Macfarlane believed that $15 billion was&quot;an extraordinarily large position, and it prompted him toquestion the proposed financing.&quot;   Salomon already has admitted that four of its seniorexecutives knew of another unauthorized bid in an earlierauction. That knowledge, coupled with Mr. Macfarlane'squestioning of the May auction, could have signaled toexecutives that problems were escalating -- specifically thatSalomon and its customers were about to corner the market.   In its report, Salomon said Mr. Macfarlane asked Salomon'sin-house lawyers to review the proposed financing and toldMr. Mozer not to proceed without consulting former ViceChairman John Meriwether, who was Mr. Mozer's boss, andSalomon attorneys. The firm said that Mr. Macfarlane'sinquiry prompted a meeting of Messrs. Meriwether; Mozer;Macfarlane; Donald Feuerstein, Salomon's former chief legalofficer; and Thomas Murphy, a former aide to Mr. Mozer.   The financings were done through repurchase agreements,which are short-term loans backed by Salomon assets. Mr.Macfarlane approved $9 billion in financing for Salomon andtwo of its customers, Tiger Fund and Quantum Fund. But arequest by Steinhardt Partners to finance a $6 billionposition was rejected, apparently because Salomon feared thatfinancing so large a position would create an &quot;appearanceproblem&quot; in the marketplace. No one at the meeting raisedquestions about whether Mr. Mozer's desk had done anythingimproper at the auction.   Of the executives who attended the meeting, Mr. Macfarlaneis the only one who remains at Salomon. Messrs. Mozer andMurphy have been fired; Messrs. Feuerstein and Meriwetherwere forced to resign.   Individuals with knowledge of Salomon's internal probesaid yesterday that Mr. Macfarlane didn't have any reason toknow of improprieties committed by the government bond deskbefore or immediately after the auction. While he knew thatSalomon's position was large, the individuals said, he wastold that Salomon had bid aggressively because it believedthe May two-year note issue would be a profitable one.   ---   Laurie P.
