The Saudis want tons of Keddie's sand to use in filtrationsystems for water supplies and swimming pools.   ``Their sand is too round. Ours is cuboid with the cornersrubbed off. Ours is also very hard so it doesn't break down in thefilters,'' said the farmer.   Keddie grows oilseed rape and wheat on 600 acres at Alloa nearthe Forth River in southeast Scotland.   He said he investigated the potential of his local sand twoyears ago and made his first sale of sand for glass-making when hefound he could no longer make a living only by farming.</TEXT></DOC>
