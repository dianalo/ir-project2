 And unlike desktop products such asQuark Xpress and Aldus PageMaker, it isn't a general-purpose desktoppublishing package--the type better suited for the newsletter and generaldocumentation areas.andM;To the contrary, Multi-Ad Creator is a dedicated display ad makeup productfrom a company that just might have its fingers in more newspapers and otherad-making shops than any of the traditional system suppliers.andP;  With itsoriginal clip-art service and now its electronic clip art, it has anexceptionally large user base to capitalize on.andM;Hardware configurationandM;Multi-Ad Creator runs on just about any Macintosh platform.andP;  Obviously, themore power and memory the machine has, the faster the program will run.andP;  Weran most of our testing on a standard Mac Plus with its small 9&quot; screen,which is a little unfair, since we suggest that professional users who willbe building ads on a regular basis will want at least a Mac II.andP;  Moreimportant, as we have pointed out in the past, we expect that most users willopt for larger screens.andP;  For live production use with any display ad packagewe recommend a Macintosh CX or CI with a large monitor.andP;  Professionalsbuilding ads in a design or production environment on a regular basis shouldnot be subjected to the frustration of working on a 9&quot; screen.andM;Because our primary testing of the program was on a relativelylow-performance Mac Plus, our comments about performance should be kept inmind when considering the platform.andP;  In general, we found the program on thePlus to be a little sluggish.andP;  Even simple operations such as deleting emptytext containers from an ad took several seconds.andP;  It just didn't have thecrisp feel of many other Mac-based programs we have tested--a comment wenormally reserve for PC programs running under Windows.andP;  We ran earlierversions of Creator on a Mac II and found the performance adequate.andM;Another consideration for those contemplating Multi-Ad Creator is color.andP;  Ithas incorporated both spot and process color, including color separation.andO;Color separations can be processed with the system along with conventionaltext and line graphics.andP;  If this is your objective, a color screen is a must.andO;But the color screen will not be much help for facilitating the makeupprocess.andP;  So the decision for a color monitor is simply a question of howsoon you plan to produce color ads inhouse.andP;  As with most other products,spot color work is easier with a color monitor, but if you don't mind workingblind, it can be accommodated with a monochrome monitor.andM;Ad managementandM;The Creator doesn't have any special ad management functionality built intoit.andP;  It uses the conventional Mac tools and &quot;folder&quot; concept.andP;  Therefore, itis up to the user to set up his own procedures for managing raw ad copy,scanned images and line work, and completed ads.andP;  There is nothing automaticin the system for purging ads--or, more important, purging the raw text andgraphic content when finished ads are deleted from the system.andM;This is not a difficult task for smaller operations with a manageable numberof ads.andP;  However, for larger newspapers, processing hundreds of display adsper day, the lack of any management tools that specifically address thisproblem should be considered.andM;The more sophisticated systems also manage formats, defaults and otherparameters and relate these factors to specific users.andP;  This is also an areathat Multi-Ad Creator doesn't address as well as some of the larger,dedicated display ad systems.andP;  We must point out that this is not alimitation for most users who will want to try the product.andP;  However, aspotential users get enthusiastic about the very sophisticated functionalityof products such as this one, they sometimes miss the features that stilldistinguish these relatively low-cost products from the more traditionalupper-end systems.andM;Multi-Ad Creator is a good example of this.andP;  At the functional level it hasmost of the features of the top-of-the-line systems, and several functionsthat are implemented in a superior manner.andP;  But where they differ from themore costly systems is in the system area, network management and largedatabases.andM;User interfaceandM;Creator incorporates one of the most intuitive and simple user interfaces ofany product on the market.andP;  Without question, it is the easiest product wehave tried to use without reading the documentation (a nice feature since thedocumentation leaves a bit to be desired).andP;  Just about all the basics can befigured out without lengthy training or reading volumes of manuals.andP;  If wewere to make a criticism of the user interface, we would say it is a bit slowat times, it presents the user with more options than he needs, and itprovides multiple ways of doing things that sometimes gets a littleconfusing.andP;  At times this leads to some inconsistencies, but on the whole theproduct is fairly consistent and very &quot;Mac-like.&quot;andM;We also think Multi-Ad Services should rethink how functions are allocated tomenus.andP;  We would think of several areas where more logical grouping mightmake sense.andP;  However, with Creator, the simple things are kept simple.andP;  Onlythe complexity of the program begins to make the power user a littlefrustrated: answering questions or filling in menus that should be defaults.andO;But here, too, the program is very strong.andP;  Its use of defaults anduser-definable &quot;preferences&quot; are beyond many other products of this type--atany price.andM;The system even makes intelligent decisions from one ad makeup job to thenext, keeping in mind what defaults were used for the previous sessions andcarrying them over to the next session.andM;Creator also is smart about the way it handles color palettes.andP;  If a graphicobject is pasted into an ad from the clipboard and the colors used in thegraphic aren't in the color palette, they are automatically added to it.andO;This makes it easy to transfer graphics from one user to another withouthaving to be conscious of the colors that have been added.andM;All of the commands are implemented directly with the familiar Mac menus,extra tools boxes, and popup dialog boxes.andP;  All of this very closely followsthe strict &quot;laws of Apple.&quot;andM;In addition to fill-in menus, Multi-Ad Creator uses rulers and guides tospecify things such as tab stops and indents.andP;  This is where the program maybe getting a bit too cute.andP;  A simple indent shouldn't require multiplemenus--in fact, newer programs such as Archetype Designer provide handles oneach copy block so that menu picks are not even required.andP;  This is anotherplace where the power user might get a little frustrated with the speed.andM;Multi-Ad Creator does keep the large-screen users in mind.andP;  Most of thedialog boxes appear under the cursor, minimizing the need to move the cursorall over the screen to specify commands.andP;  To minimize further the mousemovement and to quicken the operation, there are short-cut accelerator keysfor most of the commonly used functions.andP;  We found some of these helpful andothers too hard to remember with the use of shift, option and control keys invarious combinations.andP;  Regular users of the product will surely gravitate tomore accelerator keys to speed up the operation.andP;  If you could remember theold WordStar command sequences, you can remember these.andP;  In several areas theproduct allows the user to customize the short-cut sequences.andP;  For example,simple and complex formats can be added to dedicated directories from whichthey can be selected with the mouse.andP;  However, when creating formats that areused often, the operator can assign any key to be used in conjunction withthe control key to make format selections fast and easy.andP;  (You won't findthis key on the older Mac and Mac Plus machines.)andP;  The user types the key andthe format is applied to the defined text.andP;  This level of customization toaccelerator key sequences as well as to pop-up menus is extremely helpful.andM;Screen layout.andP;  Multi-Ad Creator makes extensive use of standard Macpull-down menus, strung across the top of the screen.andP;  For the most part,these are static and don't change.andP;  The only change we noticed is theaddition of composition-oriented menus such as those for text, style, fontand point size, which replace the object and arrange menus whenever text isbeing selected with the I-beam cursor (but not a text container, which willbe discussed later).andM;The tools used most often are displayed in a dedicated &quot;tool box&quot; menu thatcan be positioned anywhere on the screen (which defaults to the upper right).andO;This contains the pointer and text selection tool, a cropping and rotatingtool, and several drawing tools.andM;Below that are two other menus that are semi-permanently displayed.andP;  The toolbox and style and color menus can be moved about the screen or temporarilystored to provide more work space for the ad.andP;  The color menus or palette isused to color objects quickly, either their interior (fill a box with acolor, gray scale or pattern) or the outline of the object.andP;  Like many otheraspects of the program and its menus, this is completely customizable.andP;  Theuser can customize the menu, such as by adding the tint values most oftenused or spot colors needed in an add.andM;We found that rule thickness would have been a nice addition to this menubecause rules are the most common type of object created as part of an ad.andO;The program does provides for rule thickness changes via pop-up menus.andM;Beneath that is the style menu, which displays a directory or listing ofvarious types of styles.andP;  there are three types of styles that can bedisplayed upon request: simple, one-dimensional type styles, paragraph stylesand conventional formats.andP;  (More on these later.)andM;Another feature that could help this program is the ability to make othercommonly used menus fixed or continuously display (controlled via the user).andO;This would save a lot of time in a production environment for operations suchas composition changes that must be applied to every copy block.andM;Dealing with raw textandM;Multi-Ad Creator has done better than average in dealing with the trickyproblem of raw text.andP;  This usually seems to be the last thing developersworry about.andP;  But the rest of the advantages of a good program may be lostunless you have a good scheme for getting raw text into the system,displaying the copy as you want it, breaking the copy apart to best suit thead being built, and editing the copy.andM;As with all other systems, raw text for ads can be generated directly withMulti-Ad Creator.andP;  But Multi-Ad Creator has been primarily designed to acceptraw copy from a front-end system or word processor.andP;  It can directly handletext in a variety of formats including WriteNow, text only, MacWrite,Microsoft Word 3 and Microsoft's Rich Text.andM;The next sticky part relates to how the copy is broken up on input.andP;  Hereagain Multi-Ad Creator is a better than the average system.andP;  It lets theinput typist decide how the copy is going to be broken up and gives the userfreedom to decide what text character is being used to break the raw copyinto separate blocks.andP;  This flexibility on copy block delimiters isaccommodated upon importing copy to an ad.andP;  As the user selects copy to beplaced into an ad, he also specifies the block-delimiting character that wasused to break the copy into manageable blocks when it was typed.andM;We found this to work very well with one exception.andP;  The copy-block delimiteronly works for the initial placing of copy into an ad.andP;  Once the raw text ispart of the ad, the delimiter character can't be inserted into a copy topermanently break or split the copy into separate blocks.andP;  In fact, theinability to easily split and recombine copy blocks on screen is one of theweaknesses of the system.andM;Another part of dealing with raw text involves the method of bringing thetext to the screen.andP;  The weakest systems give no selectivity to this processand bring &quot;all&quot; the text of the ad to the screen at once.andP;  This produces thedifficult task of managing screen real estate as the user tries to mark upcopy.andP;  The better systems provide a menu to select each block of text as theuser wishes -- in whatever order is desired.andM;Multi-Ad Creator is somewhere in between.andP;  It allows the user to bring in thecopy as individual blocks.andP;  But it doesn't go as far as others in displayinga list of these copy blocks (or graphic elements, for that matter) andallowing the user to select the blocks in the order they are to be workedwith.andP;  As a result, the input typist is in partial control of the ad-buildingorder.andM;Editing.andP;  Copy that has been placed into an ad is displayed in WYSIWYGformat.andP;  Using the familiar Mac conventions of selecting text with the I-beamcursor, the operator can edit, delete or insert text as with most other Macprograms.andP;  To help in the typical problem areas (returns, paragraphs, tabs,and so on) Multi-Ad Creator has added a nice touch with its use of aninvisible mode.andP;  As this mode is switched on or off from a menu, thesespecial control characters can be displayed or removed.andP;  We found this to bea big help in resolving differences in the way copy was initially typed vs.andO;how we wanted it prepared for certain mark-up.andM;We should point out here the limitations of the WYSIWYG display.andP;  As you canse from the photos on these pages, the copy on the screen can be a far cryfrom the actual output.andP;  The Mac is partially to blame here, but exactcharacter placement (the true beginning and ending of each character) is notprovided with this program.andP;  This will obviously bother the purist lookingfor true WYSIWYG.andP;  But for most ad work, the screen representation is goodenough.andP;  Each customer will have to determine whether it is acceptable.andM;Although we didn't try the new Adobe Type Manager fonts with this package, itshould go a long way in helping to solve this problem.andM;Containers.andP;  We really do enjoy working with this program.andP;  But if there isone thing we would like to change it is the use of text containers.andO;Containers are more loved by developers than by users.andP;  Although certainfunctions are facilitated by containers, they are far outweighted by theawkwardness and problems they cause.andM;If programmers feel a need to use containers, they should at least make theminvisible to the user.andP;  For example, as a copy block is enlarged by a pointsize, leading or font change, copy shouldn't magically disappear.andP;  Nor shouldempty portions of a container hide text that is in another layer beneath it.andO;These are just a sampling of problems caused by the use of containers.andP;  Usersshould have the flexibility to work with text, not boxes.andP;  There are timeswhen text within a copy block needs to be aligned with other text orobjects--not just the top, bottom or sides of its container.andP;  Text within acopy block also may need to be moved.andM;We would like to be able to change parameters such as font, point size orleading or apply a format to an entire copy block--even if it was selectedwith the pointer cursor (especially since most composition parameters areapplied to entire copy blocks).andP;  This is not necessarily a container problem,but it seems to be a limitation that is particularly inherent in thosesystems that are based on the container philosophy.andM;In general, and Multi-Ad Creator is no exception, display ad makeup systemsthat use containers have significant limitations compared to systems thatdon't.andP;  This is one carryover from the desktop world that has diminished thefunctionality for professional users.andM;Search and replace.andP;  The program has a nice search and replace capabilitythat, like most modern programs, lets you search for attributes in additionto text strings.andP;  These attributes can be the font, point size or style oftype (such as bold vs.andP;  italic).andP;  The replacement string can be either textor user-defined attributes.andM;The approach is simple and uses a very clear set of pop-up menus.andP;  Our onlyreservation has to do with the text that can be selected for the search.andP;  Itisn't possible, for example, to select all the text of an ad (with theconvenient &quot;select all&quot; function) or even multiple copy blocks for thesearch.andP;  Considering the parameters that can be searched for (font and size),we would think a wider search capability would be more useful.andM;Ad-building functionalityandM;Sitting down in front of Multi-ad Creator, almost anyone (with limitedknowledge of Mac conventions) will be able to build simple ads.andP;  Althoughsome of the functionality gets overly complex, most of the basics are wellimplemented and intuitive.andM;All display ads have a given size.andP;  Therefore, the first thing a user seeswhen starting an ad is a list of available ad sizes.andP;  All the standard SAUsizes are listed, along with other standard sizes (such as a postcard size,business card size, several letter sizes, etc.).andP;  There is also a list ofconvenient sizes to address magazines and TV program ads.andM;To make the list easier to use, the sizes can be grouped by publication.andP;  AllSAUs are grouped together, while other sizes for a particular publication canbe in a second list.andP;  Best of all, the list of publications and theiravailable sizes can be easily created and edited.andP;  Ad hoc sizes are alsoeasily selected (or created).andM;So the process of getting started is very easy; pick your ad size from thelist and begin.andP;  The program doesn't go as far as some of the high-endsystems, which automatically pick up the ad size from the front-end (inputcopy), but the procedure is easy to use and well thought out.andM;The process of bringing in text is also relatively easy.andP;  With the placecommand the user can specify the copy-block-delimiter character that was usedby the input typist to separate copy blocks.andP;  Before copy is brought to thescreen, the user must first draw container boxes on the screen to hold eachtext block.andP;  Each time a container is drawn, the next copy block (in itstyped order) is brought to the screen.andP;  The user can perform any type offunction between any two of these operations.andM;Another feature of the place command is the simple way the incoming text canbe formatted.andP;  If a style model (format) is selected (from the stylespalette) before bringing the text to the screen, the text is automaticallyformatted as it is displayed.andP;  This is similar to the way Xenotronhs old XVCad terminals operated.andP;  It was a very quick way to apply simple formattingcommands to copy as it was input and greatly reduced the overall ad makeuptime.andP;  Its simplicity and speed is what makes it effective--a plus forMulti-Ad Creator.andM;Widgets.andP;  Multi-Ad Creator also has the ability to snake copy from onecontainer to another.andP;  By creating multiple containers and not using thecopy-block delimiter to break the copy, copy will automatically flow from onecontainer to another.andP;  At the bottom of each container is a small box thatMulti-Ad Creator calls a widget.andP;  It denotes the order of the snaked text andspecifies whether there is more copy left to be snaked or if all the copy hasbeen brought to the screen.andM;This is a nice feature for column work.andP;  It works well for newsletters,magazines, and so on, but for ad work, where each block is separate and isn'tusually in columns, it becomes a bonus less often used.andM;Text CompositionandM;In general, with the exception of scaling text and flowing it around graphicobjects, all of the composition commands are applied to portions of a copyblock (text lines, words, arbitrary text strings) that are selected with thestandard Mac I-beam cursor.andP;  As we mentioned above, selecting a copy block byselecting its container doesn't make it available for applying compositionparameters such as point size and font changes--a real drawback.andM;If the simplicity of the program and its graphics-handling capabilities arethe strength of the Multi-Ad Creator, composition is one of its weakerpoints.andP;  Most of the basics are there.andP;  But some important features of a gooddisplay ad system are missing.andP;  Point size and font selections are made frompulldown menus, including a new character menu that provides access tovirtually all typographic information.andP;  Here again the program enhances theuser interface or implementation of this basic function by making these menuscompletely user customizable.andP;  The user can add or delete point sizes andfonts to tailor the list to those he uses most often.andP;  Others can be selectedon an ad hoc basis.andM;As we get into measure, leading and vertical justification, the weaknesses ofthe program begins to appear.andP;  There is no actual measure function.andP;  Themeasure of a copy block is controlled by enlarging or reducing the size ofthe text container.andP;  Leading is controlled on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis.andO;There is no simple way to adjust leading between any two lines.andP;  There is no&quot;immediate leading&quot; function or arbitrary line leading for selected textlines.andP;  The paragraph leading is either automatic or user definable.andO;Automatic leading is always a nice feature.andP;  But as point sizes are increasedin the middle of text blocks, the proper leading doesn't always result forthe paragraph.andP;  Lines often overset each other.andP;  However, the program doesgive the user a customizable parameter to increase the auto leading value bya fixed amount.andP;  This alleviates the problem somewhat, but it doesn'teliminate it.andP;  There is also no form of vertical justification of any kind atthis time.andM;Quadding and indents are also controlled on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis.andO;Quadding parameters can also be selected from a pull-down menu and applied toany selected amount of text within a container.andP;  The fill-in-the-blankparagraph menu controls these parameters (as well as the leading values).andO;Currently there are only two types of indents provided: left/right hangingand indent first.andP;  The user can't indent to a text character or select agroup of text lines to be indented.andP;  It's all or nothing.andM;Multi-Ad Creator does have a nice copyfit function where it automatically andproportionally increases the size(s) of text to fill a rectangular area(container).andP;  All the text doesn't have to be one size.andP;  Since this works ona percentage basis, several lines of text with different point sizes will beincreased uniformly.andP;  A second option is to apply this copyfit routine for asingle line (e.g., a headline).andP;  The user can control whether the point sizeof the copy is adjusted proportionally or scaled anamorphically as apercentage of the original point size of the text.andM;Like most desktop programs, Multi-Ad Creator also allows the user to stretchthe text (change its set size) by expanding and condensing the texthorizontally.andP;  This is not done as a set-size parameter, but rather as apositive or negative percentage of the point size.andM;Creator also has a basic tabbing capability.andP;  When text is selected, the usercan call up a tab ruler containing handles that denote the locations of tabs.andO;These can be dragged with the cursor to any location along the ruler.andP;  Inaddition, each tab can be specified via another pop-up menu as either a left,right, center or decimal tab.andP;  The tabs are treated as typewriter tabs asopposed to column tabs.andP;  Text is always tabbed to the next columnhorizontally; there is no way to wrap copy within a tab column before movingto the next tab stop.andP;  This weakness is found in many of the newer PC and Macprograms (and in many of the older traditional systems as well).andM;Lastly, tabs can also be associated with leaders.andP;  We feel this involves afew too many steps to simply insert a leader, but the process works quitewell in conjunction with the tab fields.andP;  The user can select one of twoleader characters presented in the dialog box or can type in any singleleader character.andP;  (There is no provision for multiple leader characters.)andO;The tab field, which has the leader character associated with it, willautomatically leader all text within that tab field until it encounters thetext of the next tab field.andM;Other capabilities.andP;  The program automatically constructs inferior andsuperior characters from any displayable character set.andP;  It also gives theuser the ability to adjust the position (the offset) of these characters fromtheir baselines.andP;  Automatic fraction construction, which often complementsthis function, is not supported.andM;Kerning is also provided.andP;  We thought this was a bit unusual initially, whenthe program didn't support hyphenation (all J, no H in the compositionalgorithms), but it how does hyphenate, as well will discuss below.andP;  Positiveand negative kerning in increments of 1/1000 of an em can be applied to anyselected piece of text.andP;  We didn't find any way of setting up specifickerning pairs or values per font/size in advance.andM;In addition to user control of intercharacter spacing via the kerningcontrol, the user can also affect the word space used in a selected textblock.andP;  The word spacing works on a percentage basis.andP;  As the percentage isincreased, the amount of space between words is increased.andP;  For justifiedtext, the increase affects the maximum allowable space used between words (upto 1000% of the optimum value set in the program).andM;Formatting.andP;  Multi-Ad Creator now has three different types of formatting.andO;All three are controlled via a style palette menu on the lower-right-handside of the screen.andP;  From this menu the user can select either a type style,a paragraph style, or a multi-field format (often referred to as a model).andM;The type style is a single-dimensional formatting capability.andP;  The type styleparameters can be applied to any selected portion of text.andP;  All the typeparameters are applied to all of the text.andP;  This is different from formatsthat vary point size, font and other parameters within a text block (as iscommon with grocery ads, car ads and rug ads).andP;  The type style controls suchattributes as bold, plain, underline, condensed or expanded, size, font,color of type, kerning, horizontal scaling (set-width adjustments), and wordspace.andP;  The styles are named by the user and appear as part of a directorythat is displayed whenever the type style button is selected from the stylesmenu.andM;Creator makes the job of creating, selecting and applying these simple typestyles extremely easy and very user friendly.andP;  As the user selects varioustype parameters as part of the style, a line of text in the selection windowshows exactly what the type will look like.andP;  Trivial for the pro, userfriendly for the novice learning the system.andP;  It also allows the user toselect his own accelerator key to provide a faster alternative for applyingstyles.andM;Lastly, it allows the user to build upon previously created styles--astarting point to further simplify and quicken the process of building alibrary of styles.andM;The second types of format or style is called the paragraph style.andP;  This isvery similar to the first, but controls a different set of parameters.andP;  Infact, paragraph styles build upon existing type styles.andP;  Therefore, eachparagraph style can begin with all the type parameters that have already beencreated and assigned names.andP;  To this the user adds information relating tothe type of leading for a paragraph (fixed or automatic), quadding, indents,hyphenation, and tabbing and leadering.andP;  Specifying and naming all theseparameters constitutes the creation of paragraph styles.andM;The third type of style is a multi-dimensional or multi-field format--thetype used in automotive and grocery ads.andP;  Like better ad systems, the processof creating, naming, storing and applying these formats is relativelystraight-forward.andP;  The user applies type parameters to a sample block oftext, displayed on the screen.andP;  The manually formatted text is selected andvia a menu pick is given a name.andP;  The typographic parameters that have beenapplied to the text manually are stored under the user-specified name.andM;As text to be formatted is brought to the screen, the user can apply thesestored and named formats, just as he does for the simple type and paragraphstyles.andP;  The program uses some intelligence in determining which portion ofraw text gets the appropriate typographic formatting parameters.andP;  At firstthis looks like magic--no merge codes.andP;  But the program is simply usingreturn codes, space bands, etc., to make these determinations.andP;  But obviouslythis only works for very simple and non-varying text strings.andP;  For textstrings with varying numbers of words, space bands and return codes, realmerge codes are needed.andP;  Here again the system lets the user determine whatthe merge code characters are.andM;Overall, we found the simple style formatting to be just that--simple andeasy to use.andP;  For more complex work, the real formats are also easy to use,but come up a bit short in comparison to traditional, top-of-the-line systemsthat can get very complex in what they offer (and how they are used).andP;  Butfor most of the work we are seeing in newspapers, Creator covers at least 90%of the cases.andM;Hyphenation.andP;  Hyphenation is a recent addition to the Creator package.andP;  Wewere surprised to find this missing the first time we looked at the software.andO;But now it's there and offered in a user-friendly environment.andM;From a pull-down menu, hyphenation can be turned on and off for any selectedportion of text.andP;  Hyphenation can also be turned on and off via the paragraphstyles.andP;  When creating paragraph styles, hyphenation is one of the parameteroptions a user can select or deselect.andM;The user also has some control over the hyphenation rules.andP;  Via a pop-upmenu, the user can specify the minimum size of a breakable word, the minimumnumber of characters before a hyphenation break, and the minimum number ofcharacters after a break.andP;  He can also specify the allowable number ofconsecutive hypens ranging from 0 to unlimited.andP;  Hyphenation for capitalizedwords can be turned on or off as well.andP;  The user can also specify words thatare exceptions to these rules.andM;Hyphenation is controlled by a dictionary backed up by rules.andP;  Currently thehyphenation logic is suited only to English.andP;  For word space, Creator workson a fixed target spaceband--somewhat analogous to an optimum word space.andO;Via the type styles (or from a separate pull-down menu), the user can adjustthis space by a percentage value.andP;  For example, for a style called book,which may represent 24-point Century Schoolbook, the user can decrease theword space value to 95% of its normal size.andP;  The user can't directly specifymaximum and minimum spaceband values in relative units.andM;We noticed one other shortcoming: the program doesn't suppress multiplespacebands.andP;  Like a monospaced word processor, ten spaces gives you ten timesthe amount of space as one space.andP;  (Be careful when typing raw text.)andM;AlignmentandM;Alignment capabilities are another critical area for display ad systems.andO;With the exception of aligning individual lines--a feature that shouldn't beignored for quality display ad work--Creator's alignment tools areexceptionally easy to use and very powerful.andM;For alignment purposes, Creator treats a copy block of text as an object--thesame as a rectangle, circle or any other created object.andP;  When you aligntext, you are actually aligning the container for that text.andP;  This is thereason you can't align individual lines of text except by eye (within thelimitations of the accuracy of the Mac).andP;  Because of this, care must be takento make sure that what the user wants aligned is actually aligned.andP;  This ismore often a problem with copy that is ragged right (quad left) andright-aligned with another object.andP;  Justified and centered copy is less of aconcern.andM;Alignment is controlled via a pop-up menu with options to align objectsvertically, horizontally or both.andP;  For each direction objects can have theirtops, bottoms or centers aligned.andP;  It is a very simple process.andM;Another similar alignment feature is the &quot;space object&quot; option.andP;  Thisprovides a menu for the user to specify how a group of objects will bealigned and spaced out across and ad (vertically and horizontally).andP;  Forexample, car ads arranged with five columns of cars (copy blocks and artwork)across the ad and four rows of cars down could be aligned with a singlefunction.andM;An alignment feature that might go unnoticed, but that we find extremelyhelpful, especially for the majority of simple newspaper and magazine ads, isautomatic alignment within the borders of an ad.andP;  By a single menu pick, copyblocks and objects can be centered horizontally or vertically within an ad.andO;Just think of how many ads this applies to for most publications.andP;  This maybe the biggest time-saving feature Creator offers (and many other systemsdon't at any price).andM;To facilitate aligning some objects while others are kept aligned, Creatorhas two levels of grouping: one temporary and one semi-permanent.andP;  By simplylassoing several objects, the operator can temporarily group them foralignment purposes.andP;  However, for objects that should remain as a group (andtherefore respond to functions such as moving objects) there is a&quot;semi-permanent&quot; option.andP;  Once grouped in this fashion, some objects can haveother objects aligned to them as if they were a single entity.andP;  Thecomponents of the group can always be separated (ungrouped) at any time.andM;One thing we had trouble with was the lassoing process.andP;  Unlike otherprograms, which determine what is being lassoed by what is entirely containedby the lasso itself, Creator seems to pick up every object that evenpartially falls into the boundaries of the lasso.andP;  This may seem like a minorpoint, but it can be a real nuisance.andM;Other alignment tools.andP;  In addition to functions that facilitate alignment,Creator has other commonly used aids.andP;  Horizontal and vertical rules can bedisplayed at any time.andP;  Individually they can be specified in inches, points,picas, ciceros, agates and centimeters.andP;  About the only thing missing iscolumns.andM;Guides can also be displayed upon request.andP;  This is a good example of what wemean by a product that makes the simple things simple, while not ignoring thefact that certain types of ads and individual users may need a higher degreeof complexity.andP;  Guides can be displayed on the screen with a single menupick.andP;  They can be easily customized via a pop-up menu that is very basic.andO;For those who want to get fancy, a custom menu allows the user to control andcreate nearly any type of grid layout.andP;  In fact, the system allows multiplegrids to be displayed.andP;  And, of course, objects and text blocks can besnapped to grids (upon command).andM;Other features of objects include the ability to layer them, flip them(including text), and rotate them (including text).andP;  Text can be wrappedaround or within objects (circles, etc.).andP;  An indent value can be applied tokeep the text from touching the object itself.andM;Object drawing tools.andP;  One place this program really shines is in creatingobjects.andP;  It is clearly tailored to the type of ads we see in dailynewspapers.andP;  Very simple, but powerful, functions such as &quot;make a matrix&quot;will make life a lot easier for setting up real-estate and automotive ads.andP;  Asingle function allows the user to duplicate, horizontally and vertically,any type of object, with any amount of spacing between objects, within anyspecified area.andP;  The system automatically scales the objects to fit the area.andO;Additionally this scaling can be specified as anamorphic or proportionalscaling.andM;The program has all the basics for drawing things like boxes, circles,predrawn polygon shapes, arbitrary lines and designs, and many object typesthat other programs don't support.andP;  For example, there is a simple starburstobject.andP;  By selecting the object icon from the tool box and dragging thecursor on the screen, the user can control the size of starburst beingcreated.andP;  There is always the ability to specify precisely the width anddepth of any object (including circles and starbursts).andP;  But starbursts haveother properties and Creator has acknowledged them, too.andP;  All objects(including text) have a status box--a convenient way to change attributes ofany object by double-clicking on it.andP;  These include fill patterns and ruleweight/type and color for the object's frame.andP;  For starbursts, Creator allowsthe user to specify the number of points in the burst and the size/depth ofeach point.andP;  It also allows the user to reshape manually the starburst orhave the program automatically create random-shape starbursts to choose from.andO;This may sound like a trivial feature, but we remember a high-end traditionalvendor only a few years ago telling us that starbursts like these should besketched by hand (offline) and scanned into the system as scanned line art--a15-minute procedure on a $70,000 terminal.andP;  We'll take the five-second optionon the less expensive Mac.andM;Most of the other attention to detail when it comes to object drawing hasbeen accounted for as well, including things such as changing the radius ofrounded-corner boxes, selecting different rule types, smoothing corners onpolygon shapes, and specifying drop shadows for boxes.andP;  Our only criticism inthis area is the extra steps it takes to specify the weight for basic rules.andO;It isn't difficult, but it is a little out of character with the simplicityof the rest of the program.andM;Borders.andP;  Creator also does a better than average job when it comes to adborders.andP;  The simple ad border gives the user several basic options--ruleweight, radius of rounded-corner borders, inset around the ad and the fillpattern and color.andP;  The program also presents a considerable number ofpredrawn fancy borders in a directory for users to choose from.andP;  But predrawnborder shapes don't apply just to the boundaries of an ad.andP;  These fancyborders can be applied to any rectangular shape.andM;Color.andP;  We will use the word color in its broadest sense in this article.andO;That's the way Multi-Ad presents its product.andP;  For example, one of the toolbox menus normally displayed on the screen is called the color menu.andP;  Fromthis menu the user can select different real colors as well as shades ofgray.andP;  These can be applied to text, objects or defined areas on the screen.andO;for objects, these colors can be applied separately to the frame (outer edge)of an object, while applying different colors to the interior (fill) of anobject.andM;This menu is completely customizable.andP;  Users can create new colors, add anddelete them from the menu or rearrange them any way they wish.andP;  When creatingnew colors, Creator presents different models to begin from: a gray model,three color models (CMYK, RGB and a &quot;color picker&quot; or color selection wheel),and a pattern model.andM;From the gray-scale model the user simply defines new gray-level tints bypercentage.andP;  He names the new value (usually by its percentage, such as 21%gray) and adds it to the menu.andP;  If it is only a temporary application of thegray tint, he can directly apply it to an object without adding it to themenu.andM;Using the CMYK and RGB models, he defines colors in much the same way.andP;  Heselects the proper percentage of each base color (20% red, 10% green, 40%blue), names it (Moss green?) and adds it to the menu.andP;  All of this can bedone without a color monitor.andP;  If the user's hardware supports color--andactual colors are visible on the monitor--an additional capability isprovided: using the color picker to select colors to be added to the menu.andO;Here the actual colors are displayed, offering a choice of different valuesof hue, saturation and brightness, with colors again added to the color menuunder a given name.andM;Colors in the menu can be specified as spot colors, which give the user moreflexibility when outputting separations (especially when ads contain bothprocess color and spot color).andP;  Color can be applied to any text or objectscreated using the system.andP;  In addition, color can be added to importedgraphics.andP;  A single color can be applied to EPS, PICT and single-bit TIFFimages.andP;  A foreground and background color can be assigned to MacPaintimages.andM;Scanned graphics.andP;  Creator is very good when it comes to accommodatingscanned graphics from other sources.andP;  Obviously it handles its own, ratherextensive clip-art library.andP;  But it also handles the following industrystandard formats: MacPaint, RIFF, PICT, EPS and TIFF, including the followingTIFF flavors: 1-bit (Bandamp;W) uncompressed, 1-bit (Bandamp;W) compressed with PackBits,4-bit (16 gray levels) uncompressed, 8-bit (256 gray levels), anduncompressed.andP;  These formats in reverse byte order are produced by IBMscanners.andM;With the exception of MacPaint images, all of these graphics can be importeddirectly into ads with a simple place command.andP;  The user can import thegraphic directly &quot;as is,&quot; or scale it precisely (by specifying exactdimensions), proportionately or anamorphically.andM;For MacPaint-formatted graphics the program predisplays these in a separatewindow on the screen.andP;  Within this window, the familiar Mac tools (such as aselection marquee, a lasso and a moving hand) can be used to pan around thescanned image(s) and are available to select just the desired portion andmove it to the ad.andP;  Once on the ad, the size and color of the graphic can beeasily changed.andM;So for these two operations of importing graphics and sizing and coloringthem as they are brought into an ad, Creator does a good job and makes thetask easy.andP;  The two functions it doesn't do are (1) pixel manipulationdirectly on scanned graphics (within the program), and (2) special managementof the graphics in the database.andM;Pixel manipulation is left up to other programs, to be used in conjunctionwith Creator.andP;  This is the trend for most ad and page makeup programs of thistype and is not a problem.andP;  But there are times when it would be nice tochange opaque areas into transparent ones, for example, and to be able toclean up artwork that is &quot;dirty&quot; from scanning.andP;  This is &quot;clean-up editing,&quot;not editing of the content of images.andP;  Creator would gain a plus if itsupported this function.andM;The second missing piece when it comes to graphics is scanned imagemanagement.andP;  As we mentioned above, the program doesn't offer anythingspecial when it comes to managing ads.andP;  This shortcoming gets compounded whenyou are scanning thousands of pieces of artwork each week and have to manageboth the raw artwork and the graphics as part of an ad (purging, correlatingart with ads, standing artwork, etc.).andP;  This again is where the larger,traditional systems differ from the less expensive products oriented towardsingle users.andM;We are sure that several creator programs can be networked without too muchdifficulty, but managing the system would most likely be an intensive manualprocess, with little help from software designed for this task.andP;  This shouldnot affect smaller newspapers, but it becomes a serious concern for themetros.andP;  But with the power of this program, even they will likely findreasons to purchase a few copies.andM;Other featuresandM;Creator is not short on supplemental features.andP;  The program has a fullspelling checker.andP;  It also contains a 220,000-word thesaurus.andP;  Multi-Ad hasintegrated the Microlytics program used by many composition and wordprocessor products.andP;  This is a little odd for an ad makeup product, whichusually relies on getting its ad content from its clients.andP;  But it doesn'thurt to have it and since the program can also build pages and deal withcolumn text as well, it will likely be used to some extent in relatedapplications.andM;Another bonus feature is the multiple-layout capability.andP;  It is very easy toexperiment with ads and ad layouts without destroying the original ad.andO;Creator simply duplicates the work in a second layout (or third or more) andlets you experiment with different styles and layouts, displaying them at thesame time if the user chooses.andM;This could be a very effective tool when the system is being used in a salesor advertising department as opposed to a straight production shop.andP;  It givesthe product a more creative touch.andP;  We also can envision salesmen carryingthe program around on a portable Mac, where the multiple-layout feature wouldbe exceptionally helpful.andM;Creator has obviously given a fair amount of thought to dealing with multiplelayouts.andP;  The nagging problem of what changes and what remains the same asusers modify layouts is dealt with in a reasonable and rational fashion.andO;When you first build an ad and then create another layout, everything isduplicated exactly.andP;  As you add new components to the second layout, they areadded to the first (but on the side of the ad, not directly within it),letting the user decide if he is to add the new components.andP;  As a user makeschanges to objects (and text) in one layout--such as by changing the locationof objects, fill patterns for graphics, and text formats--these are subjectto duplication in all other layouts.andP;  Via a menu, the user can controlexactly which of these parameters affect all layouts and which ones applyonly to the layout being changed.andP;  He can also control whether editingoperations like cutting and clearing affect all layouts or just the one he isworking on.andP;  Not bad!andM;OutputandM;The Creator is geared to output PostScript code--the only output languagesupported.andP;  But PostScript matches well the capabilities of the program andthe artwork it can deal with.andM;The program is very flexible with the options it provides to the user.andP;  Forstraight black-and-white ads, the user can control things such as the tiling(amount of overlap for each section of an ad).andP;  The tiling breaks can beshown on the ad as a selectable option.andP;  The user can also control what isoutput--ad text only, the whole ad, notes, etc.andP;  He can ad crop andregistration marks and adjust the screen frequency.andM;For color work, there are many more options, such as specifying processcolor, spot color or both, the screen angles for each color, the ability toadjust the density of individual colors, to print a color bar, control overundercolor removal and gray-component replacement, and overprint control.andP;  Hecan also specify a custom paper size (which will affect the tiling splits).andM;The program will also allow the user to output in a PICT format, andtherefore include the ad into pages created with other programs.andM;We had a few problems outputting ads we created.andP;  Since we were able tooutput the component parts of the same ads we had difficulty with, we willgive the benefit of the doubt to the program.andP;  Our problems occurred when wetried to output the ad above with two pieces of line art.andP;  We assume ourmemory limitations prevented us from outputting the complete ad, but theerror report indicated a problem with the output driver.andP;  Removing one of thepieces of artwork allowed us eventually to get the ad out.andM;A second problem had to do with the actual size of the ad that could beoutput on our LaserWriter, but that was because of the LaserWriter'srequiring a large margin on all sides (nearly one-half inch).andM;PricingandM;At $995, Creator is clearly in the desktop price range.andP;  It is being soldthrough Multi-Ad's distributor network, which will be expanded.andP;  Multi-Ad isplanning to offer more system support via this network.andP;  It will work throughthese distributors to provide complete multiterminal networked systems.andP;  Fulldatabase solutions for graphics, based on several off-the-shelf packages arepromise for the future.andM;ConclusionandM;We found Multi-ad Creator to be one of the most powerful, yet easy-to-useMac-based professional display ad packages around.andP;  It provides an excellentuser interface, without sacrificing too much speed; a problem manyeasy-to-use packages suffer from.andP;  Sophistication at this level is alsosomething unusual from a new software developer.andP;  Creator has plenty tosatisfy most newspapers at any size.andM;Creator also has its faults.andP;  Containers top this list.andP;  And, performance ofsome individual functions (including output) could be improved.andP;  The menustructures could also be better organized to maximize speed and consistency.andO;But overall, the program is very strong.andP;  Considering its price, pound forpound we don't think there is anything that comes close.andM;We think the high-end newspapers will definitely be giving it a try.andP;  Theymust understand that the product is better suited for single-user,stand-alone applications.andP;  But there is nothing in the product that precludesit from eventually becoming a fully integrated, network solution with a fullgraphic database.andP;  But for now, users should be satisfied with this purestand-alone product that offers a lot for the money.andP;  It may not do all ads,or manage 100% of graphics, but it will surely make a dent in most of them,productively--without requiring a skill level of genius.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
