The Hunts' lawyers argued in court papers last week that there was insufficient evidence to support the $130 million verdict won by Minpeco S.A., the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company. After a six-month trial, a jury on Aug. 20 found Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt, Lamar Hunt and two other defendants guilty of conspiring to corner the world silver markets of 1979-80.    The lawyers included a motion to eliminate the damage award based on the contention that Minpeco's losses in the silver market were covered by a loan from the Peruvian government. The attorneys are concentrating immediately, however, on a motion to reverse the verdict against Lamar Hunt.    Defense attorneys criticized Minpeco for basing its claims against Lamar Hunt on &quot;hearsay&quot; evidence, &quot;clouded by the plaintiff's continual and deliberately vague references to the conduct of 'the Hunts.'&quot;    In its verdict, the jury affirmed Minpeco's allegations that Lamar Hunt and the other defendants committed fraud and violated commodity and antitrust laws. But the jury exempted him from violations of racketeering law.    Shaun Corette, at Cole, Corette andamp; Abrutyn, representing Minpeco, said, &quot;We think the judge will let the judgment stand as it is.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
