(EDS) operates under a 1982 contract.andM;In a recent interview, Richard Colver, the SBIS program manager, said ArmyADP officials agree that DOD should consolidate existing facilities.andM;&quot;But the way we see doing it -- rather than just consolidating existingproprietary systems -- is to gradually move the workload to open systems andshrink the proprietary environment,&quot; he said.andM;Colver said officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense did notoppose the open systems technology in the SBIS plan.andP;  &quot;Maybe there was somedisagreement over timing,&quot; he said.andM;Although Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood will make a final decision onthe ADP consolidation before the MAISRC reviews SBIS again, Colver said thereare still &quot;a lot of tough questions for us to answer about SBIS and ongoingDOD initiatives.&quot;andM;The MAISRC approval for the SBIS program last month &quot;only tells us we have avalid mission need and a valid approach to developing program concepts,&quot;Colver said.andP;  Between now and the end of the year, Army officials hope tofinish a functional description, return to the MAISRC and issue a request forproposals for the first module of the hardware and operating system platform,he said.andM;Army officials recently finished reading the responses to a request forinformation from industry.andP;  Colver said most of the vendors' concerns wererelated to whether OSD supported the program.andP;  &quot;No one said that were opposedto it on technology grounds,&quot; he said.andM;One Army official familiar with SBIS recently said executives of threeprominent ADP companies made their opposition to the program known to Hilmesand OSD after the Army proposed that SBIS replace Viable [GCN, July 23],Spokesman for those companies have taken issue with that report.andM;John Alter, a spokesman for Boeing Corp., said no one from Boeing approachedHilmes.andP;  He said company officials did express opposition to the Army's planto issue an SBIS request for proposal that called on a contractor to continuerunning Viable for an interim period while the open system was developed.andO;The Army recently dropped that section of the SBIS strategy.andM;&quot;It's a misinterpretation to say that we're opposed to SBIS,&quot; Alter said.andP;  Inconversations with Army contracting officials and Colver, Boeing executiveshave expressed concerns over whether the program will be funded, he said,adding that Boeing was responding to Army requests for industry comment.andM;'Inaccurate Portrayal'andM;Mark Holcomb, a spokesman for IBM Corp., said the Army official provided &quot;aninaccurate protrayal of the concerns we've raised with the Army.andP;  We don'thave any conceptual problems with SBIS, and we haven't indicated we have anyconceptual problems with it to anyone in DOD,&quot; he said.andM;Holcomb said IBM officials have spokens to Army and Dod officials about SBISand the ADP consolidation.andM;&quot;A big part of our conversations has been to try to understand how theyenvision consolidation taking place so that we understand it in terms oftrying to tailor what we have available,&quot; he said.andM;George Sibley, president of EDS' Military Systems Division, denied anyone inthe company lobbied against SBIS.andP;  &quot;EDS itself is moving toward open systems,and we support the Army's transition to it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We look at it as anew business opportunity and are ready to go after it [SBIS] when and if theyissue an RFP.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
