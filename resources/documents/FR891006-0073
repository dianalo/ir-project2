Box 3507, Arlington, Virginia22203-3507, telephone (703) 358-2095.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>In accordance with andSection;23.35 of 50 CFR part 23, subpart D, of theFish and Wildlife Service's (Service) rules providing for public participationin the development of negotiating positions for meeting of the Conferenceof the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Speciesof Wild Fauna and Flora (hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention),the Service publishes summaries of the United States' negotiating positionsfor the seventh regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES(COP7) to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, October 9-20, 1989. The Service published summaries of proposed negotiating positions for mostof the matters to be addressed at the Meeting in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 5, 1989 (54 FR 36905 <T3>et seq</T3>). That notice also requested information and comments fromthe public related to the proposed negotiating positions and announceda public meeting for the same purposes that was subsequently held on Friday,September 8, 1989, in Washington, DC. What follows is a summary of U.S. negotiating positions on most of theitems on the provisional agenda of the meeting, a summary of written informationand comments received in response to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of September 5, and the record of thepublic meeting of September 8, 1989, and summaries of the rationales forthe negotiating positions which include where necessary, responses to theinformation and comments received. The words ``change'' and ``no change''are used in parentheses before the summaries of the negotiating positionsand rationales to indicate whether or not there has been a substantialdeviation from the proposed negotiating positions and/or rationales aspublished in the September 5 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Numbers and title correspond to thoseused in the September 5 notice. Negotiating Positions (Summaries) <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Officials Opening Ceremony </ITAG><T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) No position necessary. <T3>Information and Comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> Not necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">II. Welcoming Address </ITAG><T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) As chair of the Standing Committee,the United States will present a welcoming address that will emphasizethe need for the Parties, the Secretariat and nongovernmental organizationsto rededicate themselves and provide the leadership to make CITES one ofthe most important and effective conventions for conservation of wild faunaand flora. <T3>Information and comments:</T3> One commenter stated that CITES, includingthe Secretariat, was not living up to its potential.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) It is believed that CITES has not livedup to its potential and that in light of renewed public concern for theenvironment the time is ripe to reinvigorate the implementation process.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Adoption of the rules of procedure </ITAG><T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (Change) The United States will suggestthat consideration be given to the admission of the press to the proceedingsof Committees I and II in such a manner as not to disturb the normal functioningof these committees. <T3>Information and Comments:</T3> One commenter supported public admittance,and another opposed because it would be disruptive. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) World attention will be focused on COP7 becauseof concern over the serious decline of African elephant populations. Publicawareness of CITES will be enhanced by opening Committee I and CommitteeII meeting. However, limitations on public attendance may be necessaryin order to ensure the normal functioning of these committees. Generally,the Plenary sessions shall be open to the public (Rule 21 of the provisionalRules of Procedure, Doc. 7.3). Sessions of Committees I and II are opento delegates and observers, but no mention is made of public attendance(Rule 22). Decisions taken in Committees I and II are not open for discussionin Plenary sessions unless one-third of the voting delegates support amotion to open debate (Rule 13 paragraph 6). In addition, before COP6,the Plenary sessions were open to debate and open to the public. At COP6the Plenary sessions were generally closed to the public. Thus, the publicwas foreclosed from the debate of most of the issues at COP6 and will beso foreclosed unless the changes here proposed are adopted. This positionwill be asserted by the United States not as the Chair of the Bureau. <ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Election of Chair and Vice-Chair of the Meeting and of CommitteesI and II </ITAG><T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Support the election of Chairand Vice-Chair on the basis of capabilities and regional representation.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) CITES is a worldwide convention. CITESwould benefit from use of human resources from every region of the world.<ITAG tagnum="81">V. Adoption of Agenda and Working Programme </ITAG><T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (Change) The United States favors a fulland fair hearing on the proposed uplisting of the African elephant fromCITES' appendix II to appendix I. Any attempt to deny a full and fair hearingeither by scheduling or by restrictions on debate will be vigorously opposed.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> Four commenters opposed a so-calledfast-tracking of the elephant uplisting issue whereby debate in CommitteeI would open on the first Tuesday of the meeting (October 10) and probablyclose the next day. The Plenary would then vote on the issue on Friday(October 13). One other commenter proposes that Committees I and II meetjointly to consider the uplisting and implementation issues related tothe African elephant ivory trade. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) Conservation of the African elephant is relatedto the observation of other species of wildlife and plants in the Africanregion. The uplisting issue and the ivory trade are a true test of theeffectiveness of CITES as a world conservation agreement. The United Stateswants full and fair consideration of the information and issues and variousopinions and proposals on resolving elephant issues before final votesare taken. While the United States is not prepared at this time to proposea joint session of Committees I and II on elephant issues, it may be auseful procedure to facilitate consideration of elephant issues if developmentsat the meeting warrant its use. <ITAG tagnum="81">VI. Establishment of the Credentials Committee and Committees I andII </ITAG><T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (No change) Support the establishment ofthe Credentials Committee and Committees I and II. <T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Establishment of the Credentials Committeeis a <T3>pro forma</T3> matter. The United States supports the establishmentof Committees I and II provided most Parties participating in COP7 havebeen able to send at least two delegates, or that the rules governing debateof Committee I and Committee II recommendations have been sufficientlyrelaxed to ensure that most delegations will have had an opportunity todebate such recommendations before a final decision is made. <ITAG tagnum="81">VII. Report of the Credentials Committee </ITAG><T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (No change) Support adoption of the reportof the Credentials Committee if it does not recommend the exclusion oflegitimate representatives of countries party to CITES. Representativeswhose credentials are not in order should be afforded observer status asunder Article XI.7(a). If credentials have been delayed, representativesshould be allowed to vote on a provisional basis. A liberal interpretationof the rules of procedure on credentials should be adhered in order topermit clearly legitimate representatives to participate. <T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Adoption of the report is usually <T3>pro forma.</T3> Exclusion of representatives whose credentials arein order could undermine cooperation among Parties which is essential tothe effective implementation of CITES. <ITAG tagnum="81">VIII. Admission of Observers </ITAG><T3>Negotiating position:</T3> The United States supports the admissionas observers of all representatives which meet the requirements specifiedin CITES that they be technically qualified in protection, conservationor management of wild fauna and flora. <T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Participation of qualified nongovernmentalorganizations at COP's is specifically provided by Article XI of CITES.The United States has typically supported the opportunities of all technicallyqualified observers to participate to the maximum extent. Such wide participationhas, on the whole, proven beneficial. <ITAG tagnum="81">IX. Matters Related to the Standing Committee </ITAG>1. Report by theChairman<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) As Chair, the United Stateswill stress the leadership role of the Standing Committee as it relatesto oversight of the development and execution of the Secretariat's budgetand the provision of general policy and operational direction to the Secretariatconcerning CITES implementation.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>Three commenters stressed the necessityof oversight of the Secretariat by the Standing Committee. Two of the threepointed out the possibility of conflicts of interests when personnel secondmentsare made to the Secretariat from Parties that have substantial trade interests.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) The operations of the Secretariat would bemore effective if guided by a set of long-term goals and objectives establishedby the Parties that could then be used to structure short-term work plans.The Secretariat's budget needs to be presented in a comprehensive, clearand concise fashion so that the Standing Committee and the Parties canbetter oversee the Secretariat's budget functions. The Secretariat staffmust be given long-term contracts and full benefits as a matter of thehighest priority. There was consensus at the eighteenth meeting of theStanding Committee that core positions would be better filled from theregular budget if possible.2. Election of New Members<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Support the election of regionalmembers that are willing and able to actively participate in Standing Committeeactivities.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) The Standing Committee has the potentialto become a stronger leader in the development of CITES. Its mandate wassubstantially strengthened by COP6 and its review of the economy and efficiencyof the Secretariat was a good start at using this expanded mandate. Capableand energetic regional members are essential to the development of theStanding Committee's leadership role. In keeping with the principle ofrotation of office the United States will not be standing for re-electionas North American regional member of the Standing Committee and will probablybe replaced by Canada. New Representatives from Europe and Oceania willalso be chosen to replace the Federal Republic of Germany and Australia.3. Election of Alternate Regional Members<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Advocate the adoption of a U.S.proposal to amend the mandate of the Standing Committee to establish alternateregional members.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) Alternate regional members would attendStanding Committee meetings only in the absence of the member of the regionto which the alternate belongs. Because of their representational functionand authority to vote, attendance of regional members or their alternatesis important to the effective functioning of the Standing Committee.<ITAG tagnum="81">X. Report of the Secretariat</ITAG><T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(Change) The United States is willing toconsider comments from the public and from other government with regardto the performance of the Secretariat of its responsibilities under CITES.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>One commenter stressed the need foroversight of the Secretariat. Another asked whether the United States wouldentertain information on the Secretary General's failure ``to provide thekind of leadership CITES needs.'' Another urged the United States, as Chairof the Standing Committee, to communicate any deficiencies of the Secretariatto UNEP. A fourth urged that a process of evaluating the Secretariat andthe Secretary General of CITES (including standards of conduct) be adoptedbefore long-term employment contracts are reestablished for the Secretariat,and that a memorandum of understanding between the Standing Committee andUNEP be drafted to settle any question of responsibility should evaluationof the Secretariat be negative. One commenter was satisfied with the Secretariat'sperformance on an overall basis.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) This agenda item enables the Secretariat tomake a report to the COP of its activities in the immediately prior year.It usually contains such information as an accounting of CITES membership,reservations, Party submission of annual and biennial reports and the like.Normally, the Parties accept the report with little comment. The Secretariat'sreport has not been received by the Service as of this date. Full considerationwill be given to any comments concerning the performance of the Secretariat.As noted under item IX.1, Report by the Chairman (of the Standing Committee),there are certain deficiencies in the operation of the Secretariat thatneed to be remedied. Secretariat staff members are employees of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP), which has the ultimate authorityfor personnel decisions. While the Executive Director of UNEP is responsiblefor providing the CITES Secretariat, it has recognized the need to consultwith the Standing Committee regarding the appointment of the SecretaryGeneral.<ITAG tagnum="81">XI. Financing and Budgeting of the Secretariat and Meetings of theConference of the Parties </ITAG><T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Oppose any substantial increasein the Secretariat's budget representing an increase in its work program;recommend that the Secretariat continue to work with the Standing Committeeto impose economies. Make clear the U.S. Government's position that itscontributions under the financial amendment are voluntary. Continue topress for complete accounting of external revenues and expenditures andfor a more transparent budget presentation. <T3>Information and comments: </T3>One commenter suggested that fees fornongovernmental organization participation at COP's be raised, that a minimumannual contribution for Parties be set at $1000, and that document feesbe charged for large Party delegations to COP's. <T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) A large part of the increase in the 1990-1991budget flows from the Standing Committee's decision to transfer the ivorycontrol unit's budget from external funding to the core budget in orderto exercise closer oversight. UNEP's decision to reclassify most of theprofessional positions in the Secretariat also caused part of the increase.External funding still represents a large part of the Secretariat's budget,and the Parties still need a comprehensive accounting of those funds. TheStanding Committee recently rejected a proposal for a $1000 minimum annualcontribution and could not agree on increasing the participation chargefrom its current $150 level. <ITAG tagnum="81">XII. Committee Reports and Recommendations </ITAG>1. Animals Committee<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) None necessary. <T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received. <T3>Rationale: </T3>The Animals Committee's report may contain informationand/or recommendations on continuation of the review of significant tradein appendix II species, on the draft resolution on first breeding facilityfor bred-in-captivity criteria for a new species, a request for committeeoperating budget, and a summary of marking techniques. These issues arediscussed separately elsewhere in this notice. The overall applicabilityof the Berne criteria may also be discussed but no conclusion/recommendationis expected to be presented. 2. Plants Committee <T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Continue to encourage developmentof the committee, and accomplishment of its tasks identified in the report,to improve the effectiveness of CITES for plants. Tasks include: (1) Strengtheninteraction with other (including regional) plant organizations and institutions;(2) publish identification Guide; (3) publish checklists and develop computerizeddatabases on listed higher taxa; (4) study significant trade in orchids(and selected succulents); (5) assess trade in bulbs, timber, and possiblymedicinal plants; (6) other stated (administrative) items to encourageor assist Parties in implementing CITES and to consistently interpret itsprovisions for plants; and (7) expand educational efforts. <T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received. <T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) The United States has chaired the priorPlant Working Group and the Committee since 1983. Improving CITES effectivenessfor the many listed (and the many possibly qualifying plants is a long-termundertaking. Consider request for operating budget. 3. Identification Manual Committee <T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Continue to foster developmentof the animal and plant identification manuals and the plant guide foruse by port and border enforcement officers and to seek information ontheir usefulness. Renew efforts to recruit a new chairman for the Committee,preferably one from the European region for the sake of continuity. <T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received. <T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) The identification manuals are a long-termundertaking due to the large number of species controlled by CITES. Theformer chairman of the manual for animals, a Swiss Federal Government employee,resigned at COP6 and is acting as a caretaker until a successor can befound. 4. Nomenclature Committee <T3>Negotiating postion:</T3> (No change) Encourage and support the development/adoptionof checklists for all taxa. Support clarification of any taxa not adequatelydescribed by proponents at the time of listing in the Appendices.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> (No change) One commenter raised severalquestions related to how the Parties should deal with listing status questionswhen an inadequate scientific description of a taxon was given at the timeof the listing.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Implementation of the Convention is strengthenedby use of uniform names of listed species by all parties, and adopted checklistsprovide guidance. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Nomenclature Committeehas requested that the CITES Secretariat ``prepare proposed `proceduresfor action' of the Nomenclature Committee in cases requiring interpretationof the nomenclatural status of species in the absence of supporting documentationat the time the listing was adopted by the Parties.'' The Chairman of theNomenclature Committee also requested the CITES Secretariat to ``obtainan independent legal opinion of the limits of authority [that] permanentcommittees hold with regard to interpreting the intent of the Conferenceof the Parties (in relation to the preparation of the procedures for action).''<ITAG tagnum="81">XIII. Interpretation and Implementation of the Convention</ITAG>1.Report on National Reports Under Article VIII, Paragraph 7, of the Convention<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (No change) Support measures that wouldencourage or pressure Parties to submit their annual reports and that wouldupgrade their quality.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received. <T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Approximately 70 percent of the Partiesare submitting an annual report, up from 58 percent in 1981. Accurate andcomplete report data are essential to adequately measure the impact ofinternational trade on the species and can be a useful enforcement tool.2. Review of Alleged Infractions<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (Change) The United States would supportnecessary and appropriate recommendations designed to obtain wider compliancewith the terms of CITES, including measures that would encourage Partiesto submit complete, accurate and timely trade reports and to notify theSecretariat of the name of their Scientific Authority.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> One commenter recommed that the UnitedStates should introduce or support resolutions on infractions includingthe failure to notify the Secretariat of the designation of a ScientificAuthority. Another cited Spain, Italy, Japan and Singapore as problem countriesand recommended that the Secretariat spend more time on infractions andprovide the Parties with more notice of alleged infractions urging theStanding Committee to become involved in the process and Parties to takesanctions on Parties repeatedly cited as infractors. This Commenter alsocalled on the Secretariat to include in its infractions review more informationon shipments of live specimens and to review trade in species subject toreservations before each COP.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (change) Article XIII provides for COP review of allegedinfractions. A COP may make whatever recommendations it deems appropriate.The Service has received a first draft of the Secretariat's InfractionsReport which covers the period July 1987-May 1989, and notes that 15 Partieshave not identified a Scientific Authority and so notified the Secretariat.Inclusion of the Standing Committee in the infractions process may havemerit.3. Trade in Ivory from African Elephants<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (Change) If the African elephant is listedon appendix I, with no populations excluded from such listing, oppose anymove to allow counties to trade in stockpiles of African elephant ivoryor other parts or derivatives for primarily commercial purposes. Supportcontinuation of the trade in trophies with adequate trade and biologicalsafeguards.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> Three commenters opposed allowing tradein stockpiles. Two favored allowing such trade under tight controls becausesuch trade funds some conservation programs and because not to allow tradewould be an unnecessary waste. One commenter recommendded use of so-calledPelly Amendment sanctions on countries that take reservation or whose materialsshow a repeated patten of violations of CITES.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) Except for pre-Convention specimens, importationof appendix I specimens for primarily commercial purposes is not allowedunder the terms of CITES. It is very doubtful that legal trade of ivorystocks could be accomplished without providing cover for illegal trade.In response to a 1981 request to allow commercial trade in appendix I flood-killedlizards, the Parties recommended they be saved in storage or destroyed(Conf. 3.14). Pelly Amendment sanctions are available if the activitiesof nationals of a foreign country diminish the effectiveness of CITES.Certainly, the applicability of such sanctions to the African elephantissue will be considered in the light of the results of COP7. Trophy huntingcan provide a benefit to the species and is recognized for appendix I species(Conf. 2.11).4. Trade in Rhinoceros Products<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (No change) Support reasonable proposalsthat would enhance interdiction of the illegal rhinoceros horn trade andrhinoceros protection in the wild.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Illegal taking and trade of rhinoceroshorn have been further depleting the already endangered species. Furthermeasures need to be taken on the supply side and in the consumer countries.5. Trade in Leopard Skins<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (Change) Advocate stricter controls if necessaryto prevent quota violations. Oppose any further increases in quotas withoutadequate supporting data that includes well documented studies based onsound scientific principles. Oppose allowing exporting countries to setquotas without approval of the COP.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> One commenter favored no increase inexport quotas for leopard skins and recommended a study of the leopardtrade to detect quota violations and stated that the Secretariat's leopardstudy was not subject to proper year review. Another commenter supportedthe present quota system and further studies to clarify the populationstatus of the leopard.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) Trade of leopard skins for noncommercial purposesis allowed under CITES resolution Conf. 6.9. which recognizes killing indefense of life and property and to enhance the survival of the species.The leopard report produced for the Secretariat is inadequate. Thus far,no quota increases have been requested for consideration by COP7. The UnitedStates believes that the Secretariat's recommendation to remove the COPfrom the quota setting process is not supported by information sufficientto show that the biological and trade status of the leopard warrants suchaction.6. Trade in Plant Specimens<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (No change) No draft resolutions or otherdocuments are pending. The Plants Committee will hold its second meetingsimultaneously with portions of COP7. Encourage and be generally supportiveof recommendations and items presented at COP7 that would improve CITESeffectiveness for plants. If an item on certification of orchid nurseriesis presented, consider supporting it provided it remains within the existingCITES framework for issuance of certificates and permits for artificiallypropagated specimens of species.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) As no specific items have been presented,no firmer positions can be adopted. The Conservation Committee of the InternationalOrchid Commission and the Orchid Specialist Group of the Species SurvivalCommission of the IUCN, are seeking ways to expedite trade in artificiallypropagated orchids, as discussed in the first meeting of the Plants Committee.Orchid specialists familiar with various countries may offer advice andassistance to Parties in reaching their decisions as to which nurseriespropagate orchids artificially. So long as certification is based on speciesand certain knowledge of each facility (not just on general informationand without first knowing the facility's full inventory), and so long asthe Parties remain actively responsible in using the advice and assistanceto issue certificates and permits, the effort should be encouraged.7. Marking of Specimens<T3>Negotiating position:</T3> (Change) Support continuing efforts to findnew practical and effective methods of marking animals and plant specimens.Oppose any attempt to weaken current marking requirements for ranched,captive-bred and quota species.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> One commenter was opposed, for ``compellingpractical reasons,'' to regulate marking beyond the current requirements.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) Article VI provides that where appropriateand feasible a Management Authority may affix a mark upon any specimento assist in identifying the specimen. The Animals Committee may presenta paper at COP7 that describes and evaluates current marking systems forlive animals and parts evaluates current marking systems for live animalsand parts and derivatives and that questions the system of marking of ranchedspecimens recommended by resolution Conf. 5.16 (see also item XIII.18,Trade in ranched specimens between Parties, non-Parties and reserving Parties).That paper contains a draft resolution that would, in part, remove markingrequirements for ``very small parts and manufactured derivatives'' and,contrary to Article XIV, paragraph 1, attempts to nullify stricter domesticmarking requirements on specimens from other countries.8. Significant Trade in Appendix II Species<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Support expeditious completionon studies of significantly traded appendix II species. Support regularfunding for the coordination of significant trade study projects.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> Two commenters recommended a suspensionof trade in possible problem species that are being significantly traded.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (Change) It has been 6 years since the Parties recognizedthat some appendix II species may have been traded at levels detrimentalto their survival and without sufficient information to know whether ornot this was the case. Over 85 has been done. Without adequate biologicaldata, the possibility that some of those species are being detrimentallyaffected by trade is rather high. The United States is willing to considerthe possibility of imposing further requirements for trade in such species.9. Sale of Confiscated Specimens of Species Included in Appendix II<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Oppose any proposal that wouldgive the Secretariat general authority to receive confiscated specimensfor the purpose of auction and that would authorize the Secretariat toexpend the proceeds of auction to establish a conservation program withthe confiscating country to study the status of the species and/or assistthe Management Authority of that country.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) The administration of such auctions andproject development proposals would divert valuable resources of the Secretariatto activities best left to the individual Parties. While some governmentsmay have problems assuring that the disposal of confiscated specimens andthe disposition of the proceeds thereof is free from wrongdoing, the Secretariatshould not be seen as a surrogate for such governments and, given the possibilityof a large and continuing supply of such specimens, as a commercial establishmentfor the sale of appendix II specimens.10. Export/Re-Export Permit/Certificates<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Support proposals that a securitystamp must be authenticated on its face and its number printed on the faceof the permit or certificate; that permits/certificates should be refusedif modified without indication that modification was made by the appropriateauthorities; that the date of issuance of the country of origin permitnumber be included on the reexport certificate (if available); that re-exportcertificates indicate country of last re-export with permit number anddate of issuance in block 5 of the standardized permit; that validity ofsuch documents be conditional on transport of live animals in accordancewith IATA Live Animals Regulations; and that each Party send to the Secretariatthree signature specimens of each official authorized to sign CITES exportpermits and re-export certificates.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> None received.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) Printing the number of the security stampon the face of the permit or certificate and cancelling the security stampwould mitigate against removal and reuse of security stamps. Modificationof permits/certificates without official indication of the validity ofsuch modification makes it difficult to distinguish between official andunofficial (sometimes fraudulent) modification. Inclusion of the date ofissuance of the country of origin export permit in some instances wouldfacilitate the search for the permit by the issuing authority. Inclusionof the last country of re-export's permit number and issuance date on thenext re-export certificate would facilitate tracing back of a shipmentof CITES specimens that has entered two or more countries. Current U.S.regulations under the Lacey Act requires shipping containers for live mammalsand birds to meet, at a minimum, space and design guidelines of IATA'sLive Animals Regulations (LAR). These regulations are a stricter domesticmeasure, permissible under Article XIV of CITES. The Service has been conditioningits export permits/re-export certificates on compliance with LAR.11. Treatment of Genuine Re-export Certificates for Illegal Specimens<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Support the proposition thatan importing country has the right to question the validity of a CITESdocument which on its face was appropriately issued, but which may nothave been issued in accordance with all CITES requirements.<T3>Information and comments:</T3> Two commenters supported the U.S. positionas proposed.<T3>Rationale:</T3> (No change) While substantial weight must be givento the official documents of another country, they should not be bindingon the importing country (and exporting country if prospective trade involvesappendix I species) if that country has good reason to believe that issuancewas not in accordance with all CITES requirements. CITES does not statethat the importing country must accept all official documents of the exportingcountry. CITES does provide that each Party may take stricter domesticmeasures regarding the conditions for trade or the complete prohibitionthereof (Article XIV, paragraph 1(a)).12. Transport of Live Animals<T3>Negotiating Position:</T3> (No change) Support modification of resolutionConf. 6.24 if that modification would not weaken resolutions adopted atprevious COP's. <T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) The United States will oppose any attemptto weaken resolution Conf. 6.24 or eliminate paragraph (d) of Conf. 4.24.These resolutions recommend, among other things, a continuing dialoguebetween CITES and IATA on the basis that CITES does not relinquish itsauthority to require humane air transport of wild fauna, and use of aneffective, practical checklist for export/import inspectors to asure thattransport is/was in keeping with CITES requirements.13. Guidelines for Evaluating Marine Turtle Ranching Proposals<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Support the recommendationsof a meeting convened by the International Union for the Conservation ofNature and Natural Resources (IUCN) relating to guidelines for evaluatingmarine turtle ranching proposals, provided they would promote protectionof wild populations of marine turtles.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) While the Parties have considered severalranching proposals, none have been accepted. The meeting convened by IUCNin San Jose, Costa Rica in January of 1988 produced draft guidelines, butnone have been finalized. The guidelines as proposed are extensive, leaveunresolved several issues and may need further review before presentationto a COP.14. Review of Resolution Conf. 5.21 on Special Criteria for the Transferof Taxa from Appendix I to Appendix II<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(Change) Support the continuation of Conf.5.21 (relaxation of the strict ``Berne Criteria'' for downlisting species)only for those species that have already been proposed for downlistingto appendix II by virtue of Conf. 5.21 but only for one or two more COP's,whereupon such species should only remain on appendix II on the basis ofinformation that meets the Berne Criteria for downlisting to appendix II(See Conf. 1.2).<T3>Information and comments: </T3>Alleging several flaws in the tradeand administration of some crocodile populations on appendix II by virtueof Conf. 5.21, one commenter recommended that a four-year limit be placedon downlistings under Conf. 5.21 and imposition of a deadline for submissionof new Conf. 5.21 quota proposals.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) Conf. 5.21 allows an exemption from the strictcriteria for downlisting species placed on appendix I at COP1 or at theoriginal negotiation meeting of CITES in 1973. Conf. 5.21 coupled downlistingwith export quotas to reduce the possibilities that trade would be detrimentalto the survival of the species. Since data were insufficient for meetingthe Berne Criteria for downlisting, export quotas based on such data arenot likely to provide assurance of nondetrimental trade over an extendedperiod of time. Management of the species for export under the quota systemshould enhance the capabilities of Conf. 5.21 countries of origin to obtainthe data necessary to meet the downlisting Berne Criteria. Conf. 5.21 wasonly supposed to be a ``temporary mechanism'' to allow species incorrectlylisted on appendix I to be transferred to appendix II.15. Consideration of Criteria and Applications for Inclusion of New Speciesin the ``Register of Operations Which Breed Specimens of Species Includedin Appendix I in Captivity for Commercial Purposes''<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Support the adoption of reasonablecriteria designed to assure that breeding operations are not establishedor maintained in a manner detrimental to the survival of the species.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>One commenter was critical of the currentU.S. and Canadian proposed criteria for approval of the appendix I captivebreeding operation to appear in the Register of Operations, because theyallow reference to the status of other operations and populations in thewild and would discourage such operations.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(Change) While resolution Conf. 2.12 defines the term``bred in captivity,'' the Animals Committee decided more definition wasneeded to enable Parties to feel more assured that the first breeding operationfor a ``new species'' would meet or would continue to meet Conf. 2.12 criteria.The United States and Canada have submitted like proposals for COP7 considerationthat would provide such assurance. The United States is willing to submitits proposal to further review at the Animals Committee meeting to takeplace on October 8, 1989, in Lausanne, Switzerland.16. Exemption for Blood and Tissue Samples for DNA Studies from CITES PermitRequirements<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Oppose any exemption for bloodand tissue samples that is not within the term of CITES and existing CITESresolutions.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>Two commenters opposed any exemption,one stating that any exemption must be within the terms of CITES and thatany other exemption should benefit the species involved in trade or itssystematics. One commenter urged the United States to keep an open mindon this issue and expand any exemption to include tissue samples for physiologicalinvestigations, reproductive assays and artificial reproductive techniques.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) Presumably, a real problem exists in expeditingCITES formalities to accommodate specimens subject to spoilage or hightrade volume. All reasonable solutions should be explored to resolve theproblem short of negating the requirements of CITES.17. Return of Live Animals of Appendix II or III Specimens<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Oppose any recommendation thatwould favor return of live appendix II or III specimens accompanied byfaulty documents to the country of export without penalty to the importeror exporter.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>Two commenters opposed immediate returnof live animals, one stating that punishment for violating CITES shouldbe done in the normal fashion not imposing the expense of return on theexporter, the other stating that return would put the animals at risk ofharm.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) The application of sanctions for illegaltrade is essential to fostering compliance with CITES rules.18. Trade in Ranched Specimens Between Parties, Non-Parties and ReservingParties<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Oppose any substantial weakeningof the marking and trade criteria of resolution Conf. 5.16.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) The marking and trade criteria of Conf.5.16 were specifically tightly drawn to provide strong assurances thatthe wild appendix I populations related to ranched appendix II populationswould not be impacted by trade in specimens from the ranching operations.Trade was limited to non-reserving Parties (non-Parties and reserving Partiescould not participate in such trade), in part, to prevent the wild appendixI specimens from being traded as appendix II ranched specimens and probablyas an inducement to reserving Parties and non-Parties to become Parties.19. Amendments to Appendix III<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Oppose any move to restrictappendix III listings to coincide with meetings of COP.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) Article XVI allows any Party to unilaterallylist a species in appendix III at any time. Presumably, this proposal isfor purposes of administrative convenience, since it would enable regulatoryagencies to adjust to new species listings all at one time_once every 2years after each COP. However, it would work to postpone appendix III listingsand the protection afforded thereby for up to two years. Perhaps a resolutioncould encourage Parties to consider deferring appendix III listings toCOP's if to do so would not produce biological harm to the species.<ITAG tagnum="81">XIV. Consideration for Amendment of Appendices I and II</ITAG>(Information on negotiating positions for so-called species proposals forCOP7 will soon appear or has recently appeared in a recent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice originated by the Service's Office ofScientific Authority.)<ITAG tagnum="81">XV. Conclusion of the Meeting</ITAG>1. Determination of the Time andVenue of the Next Regular Meeting of the Conference of the Parties<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) Favor holding COP8 in the Pacificarea, provided adequate funding is available and all Parties will be admittedto the host country without political difficulties. Support the holdingof COP's on a biennial basis.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>(No change) As yet, the Pacific area has not hosteda COP. It is an important wildlife and plant area with significant tradeproblems. Holding the COP there would help focus attention in that areaon CITES and stimulate interest in its goals and activities. COP meetingsenergize govenmental and nongovernmental organizations concerned with CITESto reexamine its implementation. Studies have indicated that much needsto be done to bring implementation up to a satisfactory level. Stretchingout meetings to 3-year intervals under these circumstances is not appropriate.It is likely that the apparent cost savings that would result from a 3-yearinterval would be reduced by an increase in committee meetings in the interim.2. Closing Remarks<T3>Negotiating position: </T3>(No change) No position necessary.<T3>Information and comments: </T3>None received.<T3>Rationale: </T3>The United States will make a determination at COP7whether to make a closing statement, and the nature thereof based on theoutcome of COP7.
