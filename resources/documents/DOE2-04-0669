Total subsidies were estimated to exceed DM 10bn in 1987.The Jahrhundert (century) contract fixes the use of domestic coal forelectricity generation and this is designed to peak at 45m tonnes paby 1995. Utilities must take a share of domestic coal before being freeto utilize imports, but the cost is subsidized from the Kohlpfennig levywhich all electricity consumers have to pay. There are further subsidiesfor coking coal and subsidies for export coal. Despite considerable politicalpressure to revise this problematic structure, the Bonn government showsno signs of reducing restrictions on imported coal and it appears thatthere can be no real increases in imported coal until after 1995. TheFederal Economic Ministry favours reducing the Kohlpfennig levy. Thecoal producers want electricity generation from nuclear power reducedby 10% and the coal importers want the restrictions on the use of importedcoal in CHP plants lifted. In this complicated situation, the outlookfor coal in the short term is problematic. 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
