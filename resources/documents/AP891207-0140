Bush announced, in Houston for several speaking engagements,said he would give Barbara Everitt Byrant a ``recess appointment.''   Under the Constitution, an individual appointed by the presidentwhile the Senate is on an extended recess can serve until the endof the following year without requiring Senate confirmation.   Since the every-ten-years census is to be conducted next year,Bush's action would allow Ms. Bryant to serve through the end ofthe 1990 census year with no further action by the Senate.   Ms. Bryant, 63, of Ann Arbor, Mich., was nominated by Bush lastSept. 22. But when Congress quit for the year last month, hernomination still had not been acted on.   She succeeds John G. Keane as Census director.   Ms. Bryant for the past 12 years has been senior vice presidentof Market Opinion Research of Detroit, the polling company foundedby former Bush campaign adviser Robert Teeter.</TEXT></DOC>
