The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 46 major strikes and lockouts in 1987, down from 69 the preceding year and from 54 in 1985, the previous record low. The bureau counts as major work stoppages any strikes by workers and lockouts of workers by employers that involve at least 1,000 employees.    The number of workers involved in major stoppages last year, 174,000, was also a new low, declining from 533,000 in 1986. And the amount of work time lost because of strikes and lockouts also fell to a record low of 4.5 million days from 11.9 million in 1986.    The incidence of strikes has been declining in recent years, with workers being more concerned about job security and companies trying more aggressively to defeat walkouts by bringing in replacement workers. The statistics bureau doesn't provide separate figures for strikes and lockouts in the work-stoppage reports. </TEXT></DOC>
