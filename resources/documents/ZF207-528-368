(newdata-communications algorithm)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Strauss, Paul R.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Researchers using Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) are developing algorithms based on the concept ofconsecutive packet headers to improve throughput in local areanetworks.andP;  The design, called Header Prediction, grew out of agovernment-funded research project at Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory's Real Time Systems Group.andP;  It combines eventprediction and instruction reduction to reduce packet processing.andO;Tests of Header Prediction algorithms on Ethernet LANs showed anaverage increase in throughput of 2M-bps.andP;  The new algorithms alsoreduce the average number of instructions that must be run on allbut the first and last TCP headers in a packet sequence by afactor of 10.andP;  Sun Microsystems, IBM, and other vendors haveexpressed interest in the Header Prediction research and expect tocome out with products implementing the new algorithm after itsintroduction.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     New TechniqueAlgorithmsPerformance ImprovementLocal Area NetworksTransmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (Computer networkprotocol)Packet Switching.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Cycle shucker.
