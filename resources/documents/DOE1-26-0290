The time scale is the timerequired for the fermentor to reach a stable steady state after the disturbanceof cell mass is introduced. When the cell concentration is disturbedfrom the steady-state value, in particular, at the dilution rate nearwashout, the transient period becomes extended significantly, and thesteady state is resumed sluggishly. This sluggish transient behaviorcould be turned to an advantage for enhancing the cell mass output rate.The proposed transient operation is a continuous fermentation wherebya positive disturbance in the cell mass is introduced, so that the cellconcentration is higher than the steady-state value for an extended transientperiod. It is shown that a significantly higher cell mass productionthan that from the steady-state continuous fermentation can be achieved.Simple experiments were performed to demonstrate the improvement of cell(Candida utilis) productivity.
