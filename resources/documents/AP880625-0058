A federal jury said Friday that cigarettes manufactured byAmerican Tobacco Co. were defective prior to 1966 because they didnot have a warning label. But it said the lack of a warning was nota ``substantial factor'' in Gunsalus' death of lung cancer lastyear at age 55.    Gunsalus, a Pall Mall smoker who first lit up at age 11, workedat the Chester shipyards where asbestos was prevalent, and the casebrought by his estate sought to tie the hazards of smoking to thoseof working around asbestos.   Dan Conforti, public information director for American Brands,the Stamford, Conn.-based parent company of American Tobacco, saidthe company was pleased with the verdict.   The case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in Newark,N.J., decided a tobacco company should pay $400,000 to the widowerof a lifelong smoker. It was the first monetary award from acigarette maker after about 300 attempts in courtrooms from coastto coast.   Shein said Friday's ruling poses a ``serious threat to (tobaccocompanies) in the future.'' Attorneys were considering an appeal,he added. The estate had been seeking unspecified damages for painand suffering.   ``We intend to continue this area of litigation and believe thisshould encourage other injured parties who have brought similaractions against tobacco companies,'' he said.   According to testimony from Dr. Paul Epstein of GraduateHospital in Philadelphia, Gunsalus died of cancer caused by smokingand asbestos exposure.   Epstein, a witness for the Gunsalus estate, said the interactionof asbestos and cigarette smoke creates a far greater risk ofcancer than either substance does on its own.   But American Tobacco attorney Edward F. Mannino argued thatGunsalus' health history, not smoking's dangers, were the issue. Hepointed to Gunsalus' history of heavy drinking, multiple stabwounds and three heart attacks.   In closing remarks Thursday, Mannino said Gunsalus smokedbecause he chose to and described him as a ``strong-willed'' personwho ignored six doctors' warnings to quit smoking.   Thomas F. Johnson, an attorney for Gunsalus' estate, respondedby telling the jury the ``unspoken assumption'' of AmericanTobacco's argument ``is what does it matter if we kill a bum?''</TEXT></DOC>
