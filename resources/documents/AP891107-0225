Its star, JackieMason, said he wasn't disappointed and felt ``somewhat relieved'' hecan be himself again.   Mason said in a statement that there have been many ups and downsin his life, ``but one thing that I know is that there are at least20 million gentiles who now know what a real Jew sounds like.''   Tuesday's show was the series finale. Mason, arabbi-turned-comedian whose distinctive, staccato accent is part ofhis act, played a Jewish ex-pajama salesman in love with anIrish-Catholic widow portrayed by Lynn Redgrave.   Although TV critics gave the series mixed reviews when itpremiered on Sept. 12, many said it couldn't miss because itfollowed ABC's hit ``Roseanne'' on Tuesdays. Rival networkexecutives who disagreed were proved right.   ``Chicken Soup'' achieved respectable ratings, averaging an 18.6rating and a 29 per cent share of the audience in its time period,according to ABC. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.   But ABC felt it wasn't holding the audience that had beenwatching Roseanne Barr's preceding comedy, said a network executivewho spoke on condition of anonymity.   In the ratings for the week ending last Sunday, Mason's show was23rd in prime-time ratings, well below ``Roseanne,'' which was infourth place.   Mason's series was a ``well-executed program'' that nonethelessdidn't achieve ABC's hopes that it would help maintain the network'sratings strengths on Tuesday, its key night, ABC Entertainmentpresident Robert A. Iger said in a statement.   The series had three more finished episodes awaiting broadcastwhen it was canceled. No decision has been made yet on what will bedone with them, ABC said.``Chicken Soup'' was the third new seriesaxed this season. NBC's ``Nutt House'' and CBS' ``The People NextDoor'' were the earlier casualties.   ``Chicken Soup'' will be suceeded, starting Nov. 21, by``Coach,'' which premiered last season and stars Craig T. Nelson asa college football coach. The announced end of ``Chicken Soup'' cameon the same day as the New York mayoral election, in which DemocratDavid Dinkins faced GOP candidate Rudolph Giuliani. Mason earliertouched off a controversy while campaigning for Giuliani.   Mason quit the Giuliani campaign in September over remarks hemade about Dinkins, who is black. Among other things, Mason saidJews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.   The comedian apologized for his remarks, which were reported bythe Village Voice, and said he had learned that ``what's funny onstage can be insensitive when it's said off the stage and in theworld of politics. And for my insensitivity, I apologize.''   In his statement Tuesday, Mason praised the staff of ``ChickenSoup,'' and said he would continue to perform club dates, possiblyput on another one-man show on Broadway and work on other projects.</TEXT></DOC>
