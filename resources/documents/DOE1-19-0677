In 1985,various marine and freshwater biological indicators were collected regularlyon the Channel, Atlantic and Mediterranean shores and at the level ofthe lower Rhone river. As in the previous years, the results showed theprevailing effects of the releases from the LA HAGUE reprocessing planton the Channel and of the Rhone waters on the Mediterranean sea. Measurementsat the level of the lower Rhone showed a clear labelling of the Rhoneriver waters by /sup 106/Ru. The monitoring of ruthenium levels in variousbiological indicators from the Mediterranean shore supplied a good representationof the marine areas affected by the Rhone river. At the stations withthe highest levels, the sanitary consequence of man-made radionuclidesremained low, representing a fraction in the range of 10/sup -5/ of thedose limit recommended by the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection.</TEXT></DOC>
