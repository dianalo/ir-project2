Yetdetailed examination of the history of inertial guidance-technology -the key form of ballistic missile guidance - reveals no such straight-forwardtechnological imperative. Furthermore, it is important to recognize theextent to which arms-control measures potentially could restrain thegrowth of missile accuracy. Indeed, the opportunities for this are todayat a uniquely high point. The growth of missile accuracy, far from followinga smooth path of technological necessity, has reached something of aplateau at which, if the political will existed, it could be held. Farfrom being inevitable, further growth of accuracy can be achieved byonly one of two routes: One is by enormous expenditure on further refinementof existing technology, which may well not be cost-effective even inthe most narrow military terms. The other is by introducing radical changesin guidance technology which could be detected by existing national technicalmeans of surveillance, and which could therefore be banned by arms controlagreements. Crucial here is ballistic-missile testing, since both theUS and USSR would be extremely reluctant to make significant changesin existing guidance technology without extensive testing.</TEXT></DOC>
