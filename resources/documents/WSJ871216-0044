Mr. Armstrong's candidacy is further evidence that the administration wants to name a banker, rather than another economist, to the seven-member Fed board. Of the six current members, five have backgrounds as economists. In addition to Mr. Armstrong, the administration has interviewed William Eagleson, retired chairman of Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, for the post.    The only economist under active consideration for the seat is Leif Olsen, a former chief economist for Citibank. Mr. Olsen has been suggested for the job by Beryl Sprinkel, the White House economics adviser.    White House officials have been consulting with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on the appointment, and are expected to make a decision before leaving Washington for the holidays.    The new Fed governor would be nominated for a 14-year term that begins Feb. 1, and would succeed Henry Wallich, who resigned for health reasons in December 1986 before completing his term.    Mr. Armstrong, 58, left Norwest in September 1986, but continues to live in the Minneapolis area. Reached at his home there, Mr. Armstrong declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
