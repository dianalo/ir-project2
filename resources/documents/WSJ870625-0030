The price wasn't disclosed. A Ramada spokeswoman said the Rodeway properties, which are independently owned, earned $440,000 last year for Ladbroke and provided franchise revenue of $8.5 million. A Ramada spokesman said the Rodeway chain's franchise revenue represents 3% of total revenue.    Ramada, which operates or franchises 735 properties with about 118,000 rooms, including 17,800 rooms from the Parkmount acquisition, is a diversified lodging and gambling concern that last year acquired the Marie Callender restaurant operation. Among the 40 hotels it owns and operates directly is the Tropicana hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev.    In 1986, Ramada had net income of $17.2 million, or 46 cents a share, including a $3.2 million tax credit, on revenue of $583.2 million.    Ramada, which joins Marriott Corp. and Holiday Corp. as a recent entrant into the economy lodging business, believes there is &quot;real long-term growth in economy-priced lodging,&quot; said Jerry Manion, president of the Ramada hotel group. He said both leisure and business travelers have been drawn lately to the budget end of the market, where Ramada previously lacked representation. In addition to midpriced Ramada Inns, the company also operates the higher-priced Renaissance properties.    &quot;In the future, we plan to expand Ramada Inns and Hotels, Renaissance Hotels and Rodeway Inns at a steady, targeted pace,&quot; Mr. Manion said. Ramada intends to keep the Rodeway name and to continue its emphasis on budget travelers, he said.    The Rodeway chain, which has its greatest presence in the Southwest, is based in Dallas, the Ramada spokesman said.    In April, Ramada rejected discussions with Florida investor Paul A. Bilzerian, who had said he was interested in a possible acquisition of Ramada and a spinoff of its gambling properties. Mr. Bilzerian, who owns about 4.2% of Ramada's 39.7 million shares outstanding, couldn't be reached for comment on the Parkmount purchase. </TEXT></DOC>
