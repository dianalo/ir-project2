(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Outraged Florida State Universityofficials suspended Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity Friday after a grandjury said an intoxicated, 18-year-old woman student was raped atthe fraternity house and the group's members refused to cooperatewith the investigation.   The young woman was found March 5 with ``crude words'' and afraternity symbol written on her thigh, a Leon County grand jurysaid Thursday in an interim report.   She had been raped by more than one person, her clothing was indisarray, she had suffered multiple scratches and abrasions, andshe was so drunk that her life was in danger, the report said.   ``We informed Pi Kappa Alpha they are suspended immediatelypending a formal hearing which will begin next Wednesday,'' Dean ofStudents James Hayes said Friday. ``They are no longer a registeredstudent organization at FSU. They lose all rights and privileges.'''   The incident marked the second time in a week the fraternity wassuspended on a Florida campus. The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter atStetson University in Deland was suspended April 15 in the wake ofreports of a similar incident.   Stetson Dean of Student Affairs Garth Jenkins has said a youngwoman reported she was sexually assaulted by more than one manduring a fraternity party April 9. He also said he heard reportsthat other people watched the alleged assault.   The executive vice president of the Memphis, Tenn.-basednational fraternity, Ray Orians, said there were roughly 130fraternity members at Florida State and 70 at Stetson.Investigators for the national organization visted both campusesthis week, he said.   ``We're looking at this (Florida State incident), at this point,as an individual incident involving an individual member that hadnothing to do with the chapter,'' he said.   ``In the Stetson case, we do know there was some violations ofschool rules, separate and apart from any sexual allegations,''said Orians. Stetson is a Baptist university.   Hayes said Florida State officials were sickened over policeinformation and the grand jury's interim report on the incidentthere. No individuals have been charged, but the investigation wascontinuing.   ``When you have 25,000 students, you have disciplinary problems,but a situation like this hasn't happened in my nine years here,''said Hayes.   The president of the fraternity, Brant Byrd of Bellair, told theFlorida Flambeau, a student newspaper, that he was advised not totalk in public about the incident.   ``My comment is that I'm very involved with final exams and examweek and my attorney told me not to concentrate on the grand jurybut to concentrate on final exams,'' the Flambeau reported Friday.   The panel's report criticized the fraternity for not cooperatingand urged witnesses to step forward.   ``Possible witnesses have a civic and moral duty to come forwardand report what they have seen or what they have heard from orabout the perpetrators of this sordid incident,'' the grand jurystated.   The 18-year-old Florida State University student was found rapedand ``intoxicated to a life-threatening degree'' early on March 5,the grand jury said.   The victim was found on the floor of the Theta Chi fraternityhouse, about a block from the Pi Kappa Alpha house, at about 5:30a.m. and taken to a hospital for treatment and an examination.   The grand jury said members of Theta Chi and of Sigma Chifraternity, where the victim said she had visited earlier, werecooperative. Campus police determined members of those twoorganizations were not involved and knew nothing about the victimor the crime.   By contrast, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity members wereuncooperative and evasive, the grand jury said.   The victim told authorities she had met a Pi Kappa Alpha memberat a club, where she had been drinking beer and tequila. She saidhe took her to his fraternity house, giving her a bottle of wine,which she consumed.   ``She alleges her host then sexually assaulted her, and shepassed out from intoxication,'' wrote the grand jury.   A medical examination revealed that the victim had a 0.349blood-alcohol level, more than three times the legal limit fordriving, and had been raped by more than one person, according tothe grand jury report.   ``She was comatose,'' said police Lt. Jack Handley, adding thatsexual intercourse had occurred during the time she wasunconscious. ``She was in a life-threatening situation.''   Handley declined to give details on the words or the symbolwritten on the woman's thigh, except to say it was a fraternitysymbol but not the symbol of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.   The woman was released from the hospital March 6. Hayes said shehas been receiving counseling. The drinking age in Florida is 21.   Meanwhile, fraternity and sorority pledging was suspended on theState University of New York at Albany on Friday after a studentwas electrocuted when he waded into a pond during an apparentfraternity stunt.   Bryan Higgins, 20, a sophomore from Mahopac, N.Y., died after hewalked into the pond wearing only his underwear around 6:15 p.m.Thursday.   Albany County District Attorney Sol Greenburg said the deathappeared accidental and the incident appeared to be a non-violenthazing. Two other students were injured by the electric current inthe concrete-lined pond.   The reason the pond had current running through it was notimmediately determined. The current disappeared when switches toelectrical circuits near the pond were turned off Thursday night,officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
