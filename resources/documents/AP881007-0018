CharlesRose, D-N.C., said Thursday at a hearing of his House tobacco andpeanuts subcommittee.   At the heart of the controversy is a program providing exporterswith credit guarantees assuring they will get their money forAmerican agricultural products they send overseas even if theforeign buyers fail to pay.   More than $30 million in such guarantees have been provided fortobacco shipments alone this year by USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService. But farm lawmakers are upset by an array of abuses andother problems besetting the program.   The Justice Department is investigating allegations that 14companies obtained guarantees for exports by saying their shipmentsconsisted entirely of American tobacco when they actually were aforeign and domestic blend.   Lawmakers are irked by a Foreign Agriculture Service policy thatprovides guarantees for exports of blended foreign and domestictobacco, although only for the American portion. They say theprogram is supposed to help farmers by spurring exports and thusshould be limited to 100 percent American shipments.   The Foreign Agricultural Service also stands accused bylawmakers and congressional investigators of not finding fraud evenwhen the service was warned specifically about it two years ago.   And Rose on Thursday clashed with service Administrator ThomasO. Kay, saying his claim that guarantees always were provided forthe American portion of blended shipments was the opposite of whathe told the panel four months ago and at variance withinvestigative findings.   The question is a sore point with tobacco-state lawmakers whocontend that a policy revision from Kay last month opens the doorto credit guarantees for blended shipments for the first time.   ``This is a coverup, Mr. Kay,'' Rose said.   ``I resent that,'' Kay replied.   ``I don't care if you resent it or not,'' Rose said. ``You werecovering up a fraudulent practice in the Foreign AgriculturalService.''   Initial reports of blended shipments covered by guaranteesemerged from Iraq in 1986, bringing congressional demands for aninvestigation.   At the time, the service dismissed the concern as unfounded.Followup by the inspector general, however, determined that tobaccoexports consisting of blended foreign and domestic products hadbeen covered by guarantees as if they were 100 percent American.   ``It makes my blood boil,'' Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said.   Kay said he was ``infuriated'' by the disclosures, but addedthat he had seen no reason to question the assurances of exporters.He said the Iraqi report was put down to a rumor started by a rivalexporter.   The chairman then called on witnesses from the inspectorgeneral's office and the General Accounting Office, aninvestigative arm of Congress, who had testified earlier and werestill among the spectators.   Officials of the inspector general's office of the congressionalGeneral Accounting Office told the hearing that their investigationindicated guarantees were provided only for exports that were 100percent American. They said they were told that the only exceptionwas for a type of baby food that contained a small amount of oilnot produced in the United States.   Kay told the panel the baby food example indicated that ``thepossibility existed'' that blended exports could receive creditguarantees.</TEXT></DOC>
