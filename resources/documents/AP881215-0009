Although he said the information gathered had little practicaluse, the project showed secrecy is a rare commodity in the sky.   In Washington, David Garrett of the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration said, ``We don't comment on secret satellitelaunches.''   Molczan, 35, said in a recent interview that the satellitewatchers are hobbyists who work together informally, tradinginformation through telephone calls, letters and electronic mail.   The secrecy of the Atlantis' early December mission made theirresearch challenging and intriguing ``detective work,'' Molczan said.   ``As space enthusiasts, for us to see the space shuttle is a veryexciting thing,'' he said, adding that he was thrilled by the rareprospect the shuttle would be visible over Canadian skies.   Shuttle orbits generally are farther south.   Molczan is an engineering technologist who specializes in energyconservation. His interest in space is visible in his sparselyfurnished 23rd floor apartment; a computer and charts lie on hisdesk, books on the subject cram a bookcase and high-power binocularssit on a stand near the door.   The binoculars, said Molczan, are more useful than telescopes forsatellite watching because they are easier to point and have a widerfield of view.   Molczan had been in contact with about 150 other satellitewatchers from as far away as Australia about the Atlantis' probableorbit. He circulated information including a ``test yourself'' pageto make sure all participants could handle the necessarycalculations.   The Toronto skies were cloudy on Dec. 2, the day of the Atlantis'launch, and Molczan was unable to see it passing over. Others did,and the calls started coming in while the craft was on its sixthorbit in the late afternoon.   There were two sightings from the Toronto region and one fromAshtabula, Ohio.   ``To get three confirmations like that in the space of half anhour was very exciting,'' Molczan said. ``We had more than a dozenpeople in this area looking for it.''   Knowing the times of the sightings allowed him to calculate theheight of the orbit and, with the computer, he quickly was able todetermine where the shuttle could be seen for the rest of themission.   Molczan said the watchers sighted only the Atlantis on the sixthrevolution, and the satellite was sighted by the seventh revolutionthree miles ahead of it. Continued sightings showed that for twodays the shuttle stayed close to the satellite, which was observedto have a reddish color.   He said it was very satisfying to determine that the satellite,known as Lacrosse, was deployed on the shuttle's first day in orbit.The news media was speculating that it would be released on thesecond day.   ``The mission went the way we hypothesized it would,'' Molczansaid.   The industry magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology reportedlast week, citing Defense Department sources, that the $500 millionradar-imaging satellite's deployment took place on the shuttle'sfifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was launched at 9:30 a.m.EST.   Molzcan suspects the reddish color was from the thermal coveringsof the satellite, because gold coverings in the past have been seenas reddish.   ``It's sort of fun to speculate,'' he said. ``We'll probablynever know, but it added to the whole fun of the exercise.''   His own glimpse did not come until the 37th revolution, abouthalfway through the four-day mission.</TEXT></DOC>
