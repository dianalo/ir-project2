Augusto Pinochet is shrewd,combative and firmly in command of his army, implacable withcritics and tireless in what he sees as a mission from God to builda ommunist-proof society.   The president disdains alcohol, lifts weights and has a boxer'sphysique at age 72 in which he takes extra pride because ofweakness as a child.   He defends his authoritarian style of politics as a bulwarkagainst Marxism and has successfully resisted the current LatinAmerican trend toward elected civilian governments.   Pinochet gained power in a 1973 coup that ousted the electedgovernment of President Salvador Allende, a self-described Marxistwho died during the takeover.   Social unrest and economic chaos created wide support for thecoup and it was commonly believed civilian rule would return in afew years.   Instead, Pinochet banned political activity and purged Chile oftens of thousands of leftists. Most were expelled, but human rightsgroups say hundreds were imprisoned and scores were tortured andexecuted.   The army, navy, air force and national police commanders weresupposed to alternate as head of the junta, but Pinochet usedpolitical maneuvers and the pressure of his army, the most powerfulbranch, to become undisputed leader.   He uses the military tactics of surprise and force in directingthe nation and proudly states that his character was formed in thearmy.   In recent years, especially since escaping an assassinationattempt by leftist guerrillas in September 1986, he has cited thesupport of providence. Pinochet declared last year: ``God put me ontop.''   Another result of that attempt is an obsession with personalsecurity. His motorcade routinely includes four carloads of heavilyarmed bodyguards, a van of army commandos and an ambulance, and ahelicopter gunship often hovers overhead.   Pinochet was born Nov. 25, 1915, in the port city of Valparaiso,one of three children of a customs official. He ignored parentalpleas to study medicine and got into the military academy after tworejections _ the first time because he was too young and the secondbecause of physical weakness.   He filled out to a solid 185 pounds at the academy and earned auniversity degree.   An autobiography published in 1980 says he became aware of aninternational Marxist threat while commanding a camp for communistprisoners in 1948, and later lectured at the national war collegeon the dangers of communism.   When Allende became president, Pinochet remained outwardly loyaland was named army commander in August 1973, less than a monthbefore the coup. Some other participants in the military rebellionsaid later he was an opportunist who joined the conspiracy at thelast minute.   Political repression after the coup earned Pinochet aninternational reputation as a harsh dictator.   That image was bolstered by assassinations of exiled critics.They included Orlando Letelier, a Cabinet minister under Allende,who was killed with an American assistant in 1976 when their carwas blown up in Washington.   The general equated foreign criticism with interference inChile's internal affairs.   He announced plans to reshape Chilean society and build durablesafeguards against communism. A constitution written by hisadministration and approved in a 1980 referendum outlaws ideologiesbased on class struggle.   It also includes a phased return of democracy, but guaranteesPinochet the presidency until 1989 and makes an additional eightyears possible if he wins a presidential referendum later this year.   Pinochet introduced a free-market economic program that, coupledwith heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued peso, producedrecord unemployment in the early 1980s and nearly led to financialcollapse.   Economic hardship inspired protests that threatened hisgovernment. Pinochet moderated his policies, winning internationalapproval and even the grudging praise of opponents after five yearsof steady economic growth and stability.   He ceaselessly lashes the ``old guard'' civilian politicians heconsiders too weak and selfish to protect the nation's interests,and the attacks often are viciously personal. He recently called aprominent but very short political leader ``a human remnant.''   In the style of a stern uncle, Pinochet preaches patriotism,family values and hard work. That appeals to many common Chileans,but his rural vernacular grates on many educated ears.   Lucia, his wife, often appears in public with Pinochet andactively campaigns for his continuation as president. They havethree daughters and two sons.</TEXT></DOC>
