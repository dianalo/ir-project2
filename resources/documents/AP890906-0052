(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A nuclear-weapons protester said she wasable to swim unnoticed into a top-secret Navy research center andbeat on a Trident-missile-firing submarine with a hammer before shewas arrested.   Jacqueline Allen, 24, of Voluntown, discussed the Labor Dayattack on the moored USS Pennsylvania after an appearance Tuesday inU.S. District Court, where she and six others were charged withtrespassing on Navy property and with destruction of governmentproperty.   They were released by a magistrate after signing promises toappear in court to face the charges.   Allen said the protesters wanted to send a message to the Navythat ``these weapons don't make us secure and you can't secure theweapons.''   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., said the incident raises``grave questions about security at the underwater systems center.''   ``From a political standpoint, you wouldn't want to equate an actof protest with an act of sabotage. From a security standpoint,however, the fact that protesters could actually climb up on anuclear sub at a naval installation suggests the potential for farmore serious mischief.''   Security at the Naval Underwater Systems Center was appropriateand no investigation was planned, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. John Ward, aspokesman for the Groton submarine base, which has authority oversecurity at the New London center.   The protesters swam and paddled in a blackened canoe to reach thesub at its berth at the New London center, according to authoritiesand the protesters.   Allen said she swam under the dock alongside the Pennsylvania,reached the sub at about midship, poured a bottle of her blood onthe hull, scratched the word ``death'' in the paint and beganpounding on the ship with a hammer. She said it was the banging thatcaused the guards to notice her.   Two other swimmers, including Anne Montgomery, a 62-year-oldRoman Catholic nun from New York, were discovered shortly beforethey reached the sub, the protesters said. Both pounded the hullwith hammers, an action meant to symbolize the biblical admonitionto beat swords into ploughshares.   The submarine was not damaged and the protesters were preventedfrom boarding, the Navy said.   The ship is to be commissioned into the fleet on Saturday.   The attack was similar to one seven years ago when nineanti-nuclear activists broke into a shipyard across the Thames Riverfrom the research center and vandalized the Trident submarine USSFlorida.</TEXT></DOC>
