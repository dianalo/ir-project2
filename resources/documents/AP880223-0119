White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was questioned byreporters about the memo, which was disclosed on Monday. Lawyersfor Meese said the memo gave no reason to conclude that theattorney general knew of any plans to bribe Israeli officials.   ``Ed Meese has been a friend and adviser (of the president) foryears and years going back to California,'' Fitzwater said. ````Heknows him to be a man of integrity and he stands behind him.''   The memo from longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach describeda plan to funnel a portion of some $650 million-$700 million froman Iraqi pipeline project to the Israeli Labor Party of then-PrimeMinister Shimon Peres.   The Wallach-Meese memo is the focal point of a criminalinvestigation of the attorney general. At issue is whether Meeseknew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the Israelipolitical party and, if so, why he did nothing about it.   Fitzwater turned aside most questions about the case, saying itwas inappropriate to comment while it was under investigation bythe independent counsel.   Asked whether Reagan wanted Meese to remain as attorney general,Fitzwater said, ``Absolutely. He's a good man who does good work.''   ``The president has full confidence in the attorney general andwe don't have any comment on the documents or the case,'' thespokesman said.   Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport was a partner in the proposedpipeline and Wallach was his lawyer. Backers of the project wereseeking assurances that Israel would not bomb the $1 billionpipeline, which was to run through Iraq and Jordan.   Wallach's Sept. 25, 1985, memo to Meese said that Rappaport hadconfirmed with Peres that ``Israel will receive somewhere between$65-$70 million a year for ten years out of the conclusion of thisproject.''   ``What was also indicated to me, and which would be deniedeverywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly toLabor,'' said the two-page memo which Wallach marked ``personal andamp;confidential _ for your eyes, only.''   Meese's lawyers released the memo Monday, along with ahandwritten note from Peres to Meese in which the Israeli leadersaid of the pipeline project: ``I would go a long way to help itout. But then discretion is demanded on our part.''   Peres said today that Israel never opposed laying an Iraqipipeline through Jordan, ``So why would anyone need to use bribes?''   The foreign minister told reporters as he toured a West Bankcity that ``no new documents were published that cause me concernand I have nothing to say.''   But he added, ``We all agree that we favor the laying of thepipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes? Nobody said he(Meese) gave the Labor Party anything or proposed anything to theLabor Party.''   Peres, who had initially denied that he had written a letter tothe U.S. attorney general, said Sunday that he used the highlyunusual diplomatic channel of going through Meese ``because I wasapproached by people who told me that the attorney general willdeal with it.''   In his letter to Meese, Peres said ``I have asked my friendBruce (Rappaport) and Bob (Wallach) to let you know the whole storyand I shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handlethis matter.''   Peres denies he was offered a bribe or anything of value inconnection with the pipeline project.   Independent counsel James McKay, who has been investigating theattorney general since last May 11, is trying to determine whetherMeese violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That lawprohibits U.S. citizens from bribing foreign officials and givesthe attorney general responsibility for enforcing the ban.   In releasing the memo, one of Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin,said in a lengthy statement that ``no one can fairly infer that Mr.Meese or anyone else reading the document should have understoodthat there was a `bribe' or `payoff' scheme to obtain the IsraeliLabor Party's support for the pipeline project.''   ``The words `which would be denied everywhere' did not implyillegality of any kind,'' Lewin added.   ``The fact that Rappaport intended to provide large amounts offinancial support to the Labor Party, or that through some othergovernmental arrangement the Labor Party would be receivingindirectly some of the project's proceeds, could cause politicalembarrassment in Israel and was obviously not a matter to bepublicized,'' the statement said.   ``Mr. Wallach frequently used colorful phrases suggestingintrigue and secrecy in his memoranda, even on subjects that werepatently innocuous.''   Lewin said ``the most reasonable inference'' is that ``BruceRappaport, who had been a substantial financial supporter of theLabor Party, would be sharing the large amounts of money he wouldreceive as a result of the `oil lifter rights' he held with thegovernment of Israel and with the Labor Party.''   The oil lifter rights placed Rappaport in control of the actualproduction and sale of the oil. In return, Rappaport was to makeavailable to Israel substantial amounts of the oil generated fromthe pipeline.   Iraq eventually backed out of the pipeline project and it wasnot built.   Meese has said he doesn't recall reading the reference in theWallach memo to payments to Peres' political party. Meese declinedto comment on the newly released documents at a news conferenceMonday in San Diego, Calif., where he was attending a meeting ofU.S. attorneys.   Meese's lawyers said they decided to release the materialbecause ``speculation in the media ... has so greatly exceededreasonable bounds that the usual policy of confidentiality givesthe public a misleading impression.''   The documents reveal that Wallach was urging Meese to take anactive role in the project.   In a second Wallach-Meese memo released Monday, Wallach hintedthat Meese might speak to Secretary of State George Shultz aboutthe project and that the involvement of then-National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane was needed.   ``I know it goes without saying that a discussion of thissubject with the President would be most desired, and I would thinkmost effective,'' said Wallach.   Meese's lawyers said the attorney general ``took none of theinitiatives suggested by Mr. Wallach.'' In a note to Peres datedOct. 7, 1985, Meese referred Peres to McFarlane, saying Shultz hadremoved himself from the matter because he had worked for BechtelGroup Inc., which was planning to build the project.</TEXT></DOC>
