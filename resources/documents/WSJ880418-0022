Travers said.    He declined to make specific projections, but he said in an interview that costs related to the company's February filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code will be included in the quarter's results.    Thomas J. Albani, chief operating officer, said that, as in the fiscal first quarter, operating profit from consumer products units is growing more rapidly than sales. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, sales at Allegheny's continuing consumer products business climbed 15% and operating profit rose 64% from year-earlier levels.    Typically, Allegheny's second quarter is a strong season for sales of lawn furniture and gas grills, while the first quarter has strong small appliance sales. Mr. Albani said the company's lawn furniture and gas grill units had &quot;a sensational quarter&quot; in the period just ended.    Mr. Travers said the company's bankruptcy-law filing hasn't interrupted its consumer products operations, primarily because of a $175 million bank financing commitment to provide working capital during the company's reorganization. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.    Reorganization plans have been filed for Allegheny's consumer products companies, and a separate plan is expected to be filed by June 30 for the parent company.    The company's Sunbeam unit introduced several products recently in New York, including a new version of its Oskar food processor that is a combination food processor and drink blender. Allegheny says it plans to introduce another product -- reported to be a high-technology oven -- in time for Christmas sales. Most of the financial impact of that product will be felt in fiscal 1989, Mr. Albani said.    Allegheny continues to seek the sale of its industrial specialties and technology-related businesses, its interest in two joint ventures and its real estate. Mr. Albani said he expects the non-consumer operations will be sold by Dec. 31. </TEXT></DOC>
