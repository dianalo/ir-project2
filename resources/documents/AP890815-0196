Five hostages, including a9-year-old boy, were killed.   Among the slain hostages was an Australian missionary who one ofthe freed captives said had been raped at knifepoint the nightbefore she was killed.   Officials reported it was decided to storm the prison after someof the 15 hostages escaped and told them the would-be escapees hadkilled other captives.   ``We were not ... dealing with reasonable people,'' said JusticeUndersecretary Silvestre Bello, who was involved in negotiationswith the convicts. ``We had to authorize a military operation,especially since there was an urgent need to save the five livinghostages.''   The attack began about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firingautomatic weapons and secured the downtown jail in Davao City, 610miles southeast of Manila, after about 40 minutes, witnesses andofficials said.   A few hours earlier, the convicts had tried to escape by usinghostages as shields. During the confusion, a captive was killed andfive others fled. They told police four other hostages had beenslain.   Jacqueline Hamill, a missionary from Sydney, was among thoseslain by the convicts. Her body was found dumped outside thedetention center with a bullet wound in the chest.   The Rev. Fred Castillo, one of the freed hostages, said MissHamill and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Otherfreed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night.   ``Jackie told me about the incident,'' Castillo said Tuesday.   The standoff began Sunday at the Metropolitan District CommandCenter in Davao City. Bello said inmates overpowered a guard duringa Bible session at the prison and then looted additional weaons froman armory.   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, aProtestant group.   The leader of the convicts was identified as Mohammed NaserSamparani, a former air force soldier convicted of murder. He hadthreatened to kill Miss Hamill unless authorities provided a getawayvehicle by 4 p.m. Tuesday. Bella said.   Samparani then changed his mind and said the inmates wanted toflee the prison immediately.   The convicts emerged a few minutes later with their captives andbegan firing, the military said.   Samparani and a 16-year-old female hostage were killed then. Theremaining inmates withdrew into the compound with the other hostages.   Five hostages escaped in the next hour and told authorities atleast four other captives were dead.   They included Miss Hamill, 36, who had been in Davao City onemonth, and a 9-year-old boy.   Officials quoted them as saying the captors also raped some ofthe female hostages.   Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, the regional military commander, saidnone of the hostages was killed in the military assault.   Police said most of the inmates had escaped in April from theDavao Penal Colony and seized several hostages to protest conditionsat the prison.   They surrendered after being promised they would be transferredto the Muntinlupa prison, in a Manila suburb, but they were notmoved.</TEXT></DOC>
