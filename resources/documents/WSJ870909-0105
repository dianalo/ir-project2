This is Kenya's native brew and it does have a carnivorous past. By legend, Tusker's much-despised founder was gored by an elephant much like the prancing pachyderm on the label.    Shortly after the beer arrives comes a plate, not of elephant, but nearly. Joseph, resplendent in a red-and-blue apron labeled &quot;Carver,&quot; brings a gigantic spearlike skewer over to the table, plunks its point down on a plate, and asks: &quot;Ostrich?&quot; He carves a charbroiled hunk, deftly removes his spear without further loss of life, and announces &quot;ostrich&quot; gaily at each place before shaving some off with a fierce-looking blade. Barely has the big bird been digested -- it tastes like a cross between lamb and turkey, and is greatly helped by a little mint sauce -- than Joseph is back, with another spear and the announcement: &quot;Zebra.&quot;    The Carnivore, like several other restaurants here, is the place for gourmands seeking what might be called gnu-velle cuisine, people likely to ask &quot;where's the beast?&quot;    Actually, most of the game meats served with some regularity in Africa are farmed for that purpose, with some supplementing from animals culled from overpopulated herds. Some of the meat on Joseph's skewer may also have come from poachers, although these days most poaching isn't done for food, but rather for commodities like elephant tusks or rhino horns.    Such fancy food is naturally a sensitive subject in places where there often isn't any food of any kind. But like most of the rest of Africa, Kenya has recovered from the 1982-1984 drought, and markets in Nairobi and Mombasa now abound with home-grown corn, pineapple and oranges. Fields and meadows seem full of sheep and cows, which some tribesmen keep in order to drink the animals' blood, and others consume in more-familiar ways.    The state-influenced newspapers abound with arguments about whether it's better to grow more cash crops like coffee and sisal or more food crops, with food usually winning. There is also a debate on the merits of raising camels for milk and meat, rather than grass-chomping cows and sheep, as a way of keeping back the encroaching desert.    One of the problems the government here is having, however, is that so many Kenyans have acquired a taste for hamburger that they won't switch to humpburger. Indeed, these days most munching of exotic species is left to us tourists and Western expatriates who crowd the Carnivore and its ilk most nights.    The Carnivore gets its roast beast from neighboring farms, though not, the owners hasten to say, from the neighboring Nairobi National Park game reserve. Entrepreneurs have begun cultivating such exotica as crocodile croquettes, which South African exporter Magnus Penny swears tastes &quot;a little like lobster,&quot; and giraffe pate, which doesn't.    But it's not so much the taste of these things that distinguishes one from the other, since the Carnivore's vast, open-pit fire, over which the meat is cooked, imparts an overpowering charcoal taste to everything. It's more a matter of consistency, with the meats roughly divisible into those that can be cut with a very sharp knife and those that require a chainsaw.    In the former category fall both ostrich and zebra. In the latter falls hartebeest, which is really more appropriate for shoes than for stews. In a category all its own is what Joseph calls &quot;rabbit&quot; but that may be hare, and whatever it is resists being dented by any known cutting implement. Richard, a nine-year-old from Birmingham, England, wrestles gamely with his rabbit for a while, and then slips it under the outdoor table to the restaurant's massive gray cat, which doesn't seem to have much luck with it either.    Joseph brings over the next spear and declares: &quot;Kidney.&quot; By this time, beginning to catch on, the table asks as one: &quot;of what?&quot; (Of ox, it turns out, and Bob, a banker from Birmingham and father of Richard, eats four.)    For a fixed price of $11.50, the Carnivore's menu also contains such prosaic offerings as beef, lamb and pork, all of which get the roasting and spear treatment, too, and which keep coming until you beg Joseph to stop. There is a Lazy Susan of a dozen sauces, fresh-baked loaves of bread and assorted salads.    And there is a wine list. Nothing in brown, but there is a $10 bottle of something called Papaya Wine. They say it marries beautifully with the saddle of jackal. Another Tusker, please.    ---   Mr. Revzin is the Journal's Paris bureau chief. </TEXT></DOC>
