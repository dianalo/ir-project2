Col. William R. Higgins is dead but that aU.N. envoy sent to investigate Higgins' fate was unable to say whenor how he was killed.   The envoy, Marrack Goulding, returned to New York on Wednesdayafter a visit to Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, where he tried todetermine Higgins' fate and find his body.   ``In spite of extensive conversations with various parties whomight be in a position to know the facts, Mr. Goulding could notobtain definite proof of Col. Higgins' fate,'' thesecretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, told reporters onWednesday.   ``Having heard his report, however, I have regretfully come tothe conclusion that it is almost certain that Col. Higgins is dead.I shall continue to try to establish with certainly what happenedto him, and if my fears are confirmed, to recover his body.''   A pro-Iranian group in Lebanon said July 31 it had hangedHiggins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free Sheik AbdulKarim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman kidnapped by Israelicommandos July 28.   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape showing a manwho appeared to be Higgins hanging, but there was no way of tellingwhen he died. Some reports have said Higgins was killed last year.   Higgins' wife, Robin, and the FBI say they believe Higgins isdead. He was on U.N. peacekeeping duty when he was kidnapped Feb.17, 1988, in south Lebanon.   ``I can only repeat my profound sorrow and outrage at the tragicfate of a courageous and dedicated officer who was serving thecause of peace in Lebanon under the flag of he United Nations,''Perez de Cuellar said.   He said he assured President Bush he would ``remain in close andcontinuous contact with all those who may be in a position to helpresolve this problem, as well as the wider problem of all thehostages.''   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eightAmericans.   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
