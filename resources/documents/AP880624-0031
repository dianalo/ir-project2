Instead, the weather troubles now affecting much of the UnitedStates could be the result of normal climate fluctuations, severalscientists told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committeeon Thursday.   ``It is not possible to blame a specific heat wave-drought onthe greenhouse effect,'' said James Hansen, climatalogist at theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institutefor Space Studies in New York City.   However, Hansen and other scientists said the current hot, dryweather is an example of things to come.   The four globally warmest years on record have all fallen in thecurrent decade, and 1988 is practically certain to break allrecords at close to nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit warmer thannormal, defined as the 1951-1980 average.   Many scientists have said that they believe the long-predictedgreenhouse effect has begun. In the most definite statement yet,Hansen said it has.   ``Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribewith a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationshipbetween the greenhouse effect and the observed warming,'' he said.   He said there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong inblaming rising temperatures around the world on the buildup ofman-made gases in the atmosphere.   Syukuro Manabe, soil specialist at the Geophysical FluidDynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, said the current drought ``is an example of thekind of drought that will occur more frequently as the globalwarming becomes larger.''   Computer models predict more frequent droughts in the AmericanMidwest and Southeast, and the latest models predict a best-guessestimate of an increase in global average temperature of about 0.54degrees Fahrenheit each decade into the middle of the next century.   Temperature increases in high latitudes could be more thandouble that. This could mean growing cotton in Siberia and orangesin British Columbia. Tropical temperatures would hardly change,although precipitation would increase at high and low latitudes.   The warmer weather would also mean a rise in sea level of abouta foot, which has been about the increase on the U.S. AtlanticCoast over the past century, a period in which the averagetemperature worldwide rose about nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit.   Hansen earlier had published predictions of what this would meanfor several cities in terms of the typical number of days each yearwith temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit: Washington, 12instead of one; Dallas, 78 instead of 19; Memphis, Tenn., 42instead of four; Chicago, six instead of none.   It reached 101 degrees in Washington on Wednesday.   The greenhouse effect is the result of gases emitted by moderncivilization reducing the heat normally radiated by the globe intospace, just as the glass in a greenhouse raises the temperatureinside.   Several gases contribute, and last year's treaty calling for ahalving of chlorofluorocarbon emissions should reduce futurewarmings by 10 percent. But half the effect is the result of carbondioxide formed in the burning of fossil fuels, like coal.   The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by10 percent since 1958 and 25 percent since about 1790, roughly whencoal-fired steam engines set off the industrial revolution inEngland. Currently, 3 billion tons of carbon are added to theatmosphere every year.   Reducing emissions by 3 billion tons or 50 percent to 60 percentof current levels ``could stabilize the content of theatmosphere,'' said George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods HoleResearch Center in Massachusetts. ``It is well within reach, noquestion about that.''   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., concerned about his state's coalindustry, asked physical chemist William R. Moomaw of the WorldResources Institute, a Washington-based policy researchorganization, if technology could reduce the harmful emissions.   Moomaw replied, ``I would argue the resource we have in mostabundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficientlyat much lower cost than building any form of power generation.''</TEXT></DOC>
