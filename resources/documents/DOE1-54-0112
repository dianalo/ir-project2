A discussion ofpotential effects of dry and wet deposition of acidic substances on soilsand vegetation provide the basis for an analysis of acidic precipitationas a possible causative agent for forest decline in Central Europe andNorth America. Through an evaluation of various factors the study comesto the conclusion that wet deposition of acidic substances is not theprimary cause for forest decline.</TEXT></DOC>
