GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FORGNCONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the Iran-Contra hearings ended in August, President Reagan called for a renewed bipartisan spirit in foreign policy. &quot;The biggest lesson we can draw from the hearings is that the executive and legislative branches of government need to regain trust in each other,&quot; he said in a televised address.    Instead, the bipartisanship he hoped would &quot;grow and blossom&quot; is wilting on the vine. Mr. Reagan is involved in an unusual number of foreign-policy fights with Congress. The battles exhaust the president's already-diminished political capital and make U.S. policy look confused and inconsistent.    Mr. Reagan and Congress bear joint responsibility for this contentious state. The president might have avoided some of the fights, and Congress, firmly democratic and growing bolder in the twilight of the Reagan years, is involved in excessive management of policy. The White House quarrels with Congress include fights over more aid for the Nicaraguan Contras, further sanctions against South Africa, arms control issues and the U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf.    Mr. Reagan's major foreign-policy goal for the remainder of his presidency is to negotiate an intermediate-range nuclear missile agreement with the Soviet Union. It is widely expected that the Senate would ratify such a pact, but White House officials worry privately that the vote could turn out to be closer than originally thought, as the growing perception of Mr. Reagan's weakness makes it easier for critics to speak out.    Hard-liners believe that the White House is too anxious to achieve an arms agreement with the Soviets. As a result, there is likely to be a battle in the Senate when conservatives push for tougher verification standards.    Following last summer's speech, Mr. Reagan made his first bipartisan foray with a Central America peace plan with Rep. Jim Wright (D., Texas), the speaker of the House. Days later, the five Central American nations signed their own peace plan, which Rep. Wright quickly endorsed. Mr. Reagan, however, was uncomfortable with the plan, alternatively calling it fatally flawed and a good beginning, but one that didn't sufficiently take into account U.S. security interests.    The president's inconsistency has further soured relations with Congress. Right-wingers say his acquiesence in a &quot;bipartisan&quot; Central America peace plan is a sellout of the anti-Communist Contras; supporters of the plan say the president's potshots at it, including a speech last week, show he isn't really interested in peace.    Some critics also question Mr. Reagan's timing in picking fights with Congress. Under a bill passed last year imposing economic sanctions against South Africa, the president is required to report to lawmakers and recommend further sanctions if Pretoria hasn't made progress toward dismantling apartheid. Earlier this month, Mr. Reagan submitted his report, which found that there hadn't been significant progress.    But he didn't recommend further penalties, saying that &quot;additional measures would be counterproductive.&quot; The decision irritated lawmakers, many of whom are bent on increasing the pressure on Pretoria. And it sent an ambiguous signal abroad about U.S. policy.    Meanwhile, Congress is involving itself in the tiniest details of foreign policy. Last week, as the Senate debated whether to instruct the secretary of state to negotiate with guerrillas in Mozambique, Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) asked his colleagues &quot;does the role of the U.S. Senate in foreign policy extend to constantly tinkering with everything, fine-tuning everything?&quot; He warned that &quot;the rest of the world cannot make out what the policy of America is&quot; under such conditions.    In a classic case of congressional micromanagement, the Senate, after a three-minute debate, last week approved a resolution condemning China for human rights abuses in Tibet. The senators hadn't bothered to ask the State Department about Tibet, however. The department complained that the resolution &quot;fails to take into account changes in Chinese policy toward Tibet since 1980.&quot; The Chinese complained bitterly about the Senate action.    Presidents usually win most of their foreign-policy battles with Congress if they stick with their positions. That's because a president can initiate actions, while the power in Congress is diffuse. In the current climate, Mr. Reagan will win approval of the big prize, an arms-control pact, but could suffer a string of foreign-policy defeats in his last year in office. </TEXT></DOC>
