In October, the group led by Daniel Abraham, chairman and chief executive officer, proposed to buy 2.25 million shares for $15 a share, or about $34 million, but later withdrew the bid. Mr. Abraham said the group dropped the bid for the New York-based maker of nonprescription drugs because &quot;it didn't want to incur substantial debt in light of the current economic uncertainty.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Thompson rose $1.125 to close at $15.25.    Among Thompson's drugs are Dexatrim, a weight-loss product; Ibuprin, an ibuprofen-based pain-relief product; and Cardi-Omega 3, a fish-oil capsule to help prevent heart disease. </TEXT></DOC>
