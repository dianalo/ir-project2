For comparison coal and oil are analyzed as well.Because of the fact that the total market is growing in time, the totalamounts extracted during the life cycle increase in the order: coal,oil, and gas. In absolute terms it is hypothesized that the world energymarket is growing logistically. The results of the simple calculationsthat follow from this hypothesis are given. Then the figures for integrateddemand compared with resources and reserves are discussed. Finally someaspects considering the transportation of gas (pipelines, tankers), inparticular in Europe, are commented. 16 figs., 10 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
