 Infonts, the wars reached a climax, as Adobe repelled Apple (for now) with aringing endorsement of PostScript from IBM and followed through on itspromist to publish the Type 1 specifications.andP;  In color, the battle is beingfought in the labs of end users as much as it is among vendors.andP;  The issuesof color production for desktop publishers are crystalizing, just as productsare becoming more stable.andM;Organization of this issue.andP;  Our full coverage of the Seminar sessionsappeared in the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, along with our commentson the high-end equipment that appeared in the New Product Showcase.andP;  In thisissue, we present an overview of two key topics (fonts and color) that hasbeen condensed from the SRPS article, along with complete coverage of desktoppublishing equipment.andP;  The coverage of Maple Picture Publishing, a product weview as especially significant, is separated in its own article that startson page 21.andP;  The remaining equipment coverage begins on page 16.andM;Fonts: still center stageandM;The September Conference was notable for drama, confusion and confrontationin the font arana.andP;  By contrst, the March Seminars were remarkably calm andrational, although the atmosphere was competitive.andP;  It is obvious thateveryone concerned has been very hard at work in the intervening time, andthe results promise real benefits to everyone in the industry.andM;IBM picks ATM.andP;  The opening session of this year's Seminars began with asurprise appearance by Lee Reiswig, the new vice president of system softwarefor IBM's Entry Systems Division.andP;  His message: IBM will use Adobe fonts andthe Adobe Type Manager rasterizing technology across its entire productline--PCs, the AS/400 minicomputer family, the 370-series mainframes and theAIX workstations (which will use the NextStep and Motif user interfaces andDisplay PostScrip to drive the screen).andP;  IBM will also use Adobe technologyin all its printers--including the non-PostScript printers.andP;  IBM's goal is tolet users &quot;print anywhere&quot; using PostScipt printers attached to IBM computersand networks.andM;A difficult decision.andP;  IBM's decision was not an easy one.andP;  On the one hand,it did not want to alienate Microsoft, its partner in the development ofOS/2.andP;  On the other hand were its customers, who made it clear that theypreferred Adobe-based technology.andM;In the middle was IBM's own development needs.andP;  The more it delved into theissue, the more IBM realized that the choice of font technology hadfar-reaching implications.andP;  It needed to have a common font technology toensure that customers could even move formatted documents from one IBMcomputer to another, let alone exchange documents with other, non-IBMsystems.andP;  Every significant IBM product division had a stake in the decision.andO;It needed to be able to use common fonts on all IBM computers, display themon all IBM graphic screens, and print them on all IBM printers, bothPostScript and non-PostScript.andM;Despite the strong endorsement of Adobe, IBM is not ignoring Royal (orTrueType, as it is now called).andP;  The OS/2 PCs that IBM sells will alsosupport Royal fonts, since Microsoft is building that into the OS/2 operatingsystem.andP;  But wherever it is important to move documents from PCs to largercomputers (which is the case wherever IBM's large computers are used), itwill be necessary to use Adobe fonts.andM;This is not another schism in the PC world, like the split between the EISAand Micro Channel buses, nor a way of keeping clone PCs out of IBM shops.andO;Adobe will itself provide ATM for the Windows and OS/2 environments,presumably in the form of installable modules and probably available throughretail channels just like the Mac product.andM;Adobe resurgentandM;John Warnock made the understatement of the week by saying that Adobe was&quot;extremely thrilled&quot; with IBM's announcement.andP;  Put on the defensive lastfall, Adobe has had to hustle as never before, but it is now the clearfront-runner in the font technology race.andM;Type 1 is public.andP;  True to its word, Adobe delivered the Type 1 fontspecification, handing out copies at the Seminars.andP;  The book is now availabledirectly from Adobe and can ordered by calling (800) 833-6687 that's83-FONTS) or (415) 961-4400.andP;  The price in the U.S.andP;  is $14.95 plus $5.00 forUPS ground shipping.andM;Adobe said that it has been very careful to make the specification accurate.andO;The material had been &quot;beta tested&quot; by both Altsys and Letraset beforepublication.andP;  Altsys used the information to prepare an updated version ofFontographer that can make Type 1 fonts.andP;  (Last fall, Altsys releasedFontographer 3.0, containing Nimbus Q hint insertion technology.)andP;  Letrasethas updated both LetraStudio (the letterform distortion program) andFontStudio (the font design and creation tool) to handle Type 1 fonts.andM;The release of the Type 1 spec book does not necessarily mean that PostScriptimplementers will have an easier time.andP;  The spec tells what a rasterizerneeds to do, but not how to do it.andP;  Particular implementations may do thisbetter or worse, depending on the skill of the programmers and thethoroughness of their testing and quality-control procedures.andP;  It isimportant to keep in mind that from here on out, a rasterizer will be judgedon its ability to produce type not just at 300 dpi, but also at the lowerresolutions used on computer screens, ink-jet printers, dot-matrix printersand other devices.andM;ATM takes over.andP;  Adobe announced that the rasterizer used in its MacintoshATM product, which is a distinct improvement over its earlier rasterizers,will be used in all future Adobe RIPS.andP;  The ATM rasterizer is alreadyincluded in IBM's OS/2 version 1.2; the first discrete product to use it willbe the HP PostScript upgrade cartridge for the LaserJet IID, IIP and III.andO;Adobe will be licensing ATM technology to other PCL printer makers and toWindows application software developers.andM;Adobe also said that it has licensed ATM to Agfa Compugraphic for use in aforthcoming X11/New driver that will be part of CG's new generation ofprofessional color publishing systems.andP;  They run on Sun workstations, but usethe ATM font technology instaed of Sun's own Folio software.andM;If you count only unit shipments, ATM is the most popular software productAdobe has ever offered.andP;  It claims that it has sold more than 100,000 copiesof ATM for the Macintosh, and that 80% of its ATM customers had not usedoutline fonts previously.andP;  Adobe said that it had an installed base of 23million fonts; if ATM goes over in the Pc world the way it has in the Macworld, that may be just the beginning.andM;Font cross-licenses.andP;  Adobe has reached cross-licensing and marketing dealswith Monotype and Agfa Compugraphic.andP;  Both vendors had earlier licensed theAdobe font-making tool set, and both have begun to deliver Type 1 fonts fromtheir own libraries.andP;  The deal means that Adobe will include Monotype and Cgfonts in the Adobe Type Library, which heretofore had included only Linotype,Bigelow andamp; Holmes and ITC designs.andM;Royal becomes TrueTypeandM;&quot;Royal&quot; was never more than a code name used during the development ofApple's font-scaling software.andP;  It has, we were told, now been given anofficial product name: TrueType.andP;  (The old name may be hard to kill, however.andO;In a straw poll taken at the Font Free-for-all session, an overwhelmingmajority of attendees said they preferred Royal.)andP;  The font subsystem's nameis thus colsely identified with the Microsoft PostScript interpreter in whichit will run (discussed below), which is named TrueImage.andM;TrueType,, said Apple, is on schedule and will be part of System 7, due forrelease sometime this summer.andP;  It has already been extensively tested by themajor font foundries, and prerelease versions will be available to softwaredevelopers this spring, probably in April.andP;  As a result of the early testing,at least one jamor improvement--dropout control to prevent disjoint lines atsmall sizes--has been added to the rasterizer (see No.andP;  7, pp.andP;  3-8).andM;Apple has obtained trademark licenses from Linotype and ITC, so it will beable to offer a core set of the 35 LaserWriter Plus brand-name faces whenSystem 7 is shipped.andP;  The ITC faces will be converted into TrueType formatfor Apple by Bitstream.andM;Promised compatibility.andP;  But Apple was at pains to emphasize that its currentinstalled base will not be left behind.andM;* Deownloadable fonts--Apple will supply a method to download TrueType fontsinto current LaserWriters.andP;  No details werre provided on how this is beingdone, and Apple cannot yet offer any promises on whether the technique itdreams up will work in non-Apple PostScript devices such as LinoTypeimagesetters, Agfa Matrix slide recorders or other Adobe-licensed laserprinters.andP;  (Our suspicion is that the technique should work in most Motorola68xxx-based Adobe controllers.)andP;  We do not know what the legal ramificationsof this are, or what--if anything--Apple plans to do about future AdobeRISC-based controllers.andM;* Adobe can put ATM into System 7--Adobe should be able to adapt ATM forSystem 7 based on the advance informatioon it is getting from Apple.andP;  Currentusers may need to get an upgraded vesion of ATM, but all their fonts shouldcontinue to work.andM;* TrueImage will run Adobe fonts--The TrueImage PostScript interpreter thatApple is licensing from Microsoft will be able to run Adobe Tupe 1 fonts aswell as TrueType fonts.andM;Microsoft fleshed out the picture with further details.andP;  First, TrueType willbe available for Windows this year, but it won't be in OS/2 until version2.0, which still has n o public timetable.andP;  Second, TrueImage, a Royal fontpage description language and rasterizer developed by Bauer and licensed toApple, will also be available for Windows.andP;  It will provide on-the-flyrasterizing of outline fonts and yet will take only 50K of RAM.andP;  (The realquestion, of course, is whether users who run DOS networks can afford even50K).andM;Third, Microsoft (or HP) will make available a TrueType cartridge for the HPLaserJet printers--the first announcement of Royal fonts fro the LaserJet.andO;No timetable was announced.andP;  Fourth, Microsoft will support Type 1 fonts inOS/2, but it is not committing to support them in Windows.andP;  Instead,Microsoft will rely on Adobe to provide ATM for Windows.andM;The last announcement was that Microsoft will license TrueImage to vendors ofhigh-resolution imagesetters.andP;  Predictably, reaction to this announcement wascool.andP;  Service bureaus may now look forward to buying yet another RIP fortheir imagesetters, if they intend to support Royal users in the future.andM;TrueType speed.andP;  Microsoft and Apple took some pains to demonstrate why theythink the Royal (TrueType) technology is superior to Adobe's technology.andP;  Inthe opening session, Microsoft senior vice president Steve Ballmer ran aside-by-side speed comparison of Royal vs.andP;  ATM.andP;  Running on identicalMacintoshes with everything (including cache memory) tuned to be as equal aspossible, TrueType display was noticeably faster than ATM 1.2 display.andP;  Thesample jobs included both the &quot;waterfall&quot; we reported on in the last issue ofthis report and a PageMaker page.andM;Adobe's response to the demonstration was twofold.andP;  Adobe pointed out thatATM is available now, while TrueType is still months away.andP;  Adobe thensaidthat by the time TrueType is available, ATM will have improved its speed andwill be very competitive.andP;  These are valid points, and are commonly raisedwhenever a newcomer shows technology that works better than the currentmarket leader.andP;  (To paraphrase, &quot;You're showing futures, not real product;but our futures are going to be better than your futures.&quot;)andM;Of course, Apple will probably be fine-tuning TrueType's speed at the sametime.andP;  This leads to an important point: even if it does nothing else,TrueType will keep pressure on Adobe to improve ATM.andP;  Conversely, Apple willhave to make TrueType very good if it is to overtake ATM in the market.andM;TrueType quality.andP;  In the Font Free-for-All the following evening, MatthewCarter of Bitstream extolled the virtues of the Royal technology.andO;Ultimately, he contends, font foundries will be able to use the TrueTypecommand language to do things that are not now possible, including non-linearscaling of type (adjusting the character shape for best design andreadability at different point sizes).andM;For the moment, however, the challenge remains to get TrueType output onscreen displays and 300-dpi printers up to the quality level of Adobe ATM.andO;Bitstream has developed automatic tools to convert its entire library intoTrueType format, complete with base-level hints.andP;  (The base level providesroughly the same degree of hinting as Adobe puts into its fonts.andP;  Nonlinearscaling, context-dependent variants and so on use higher-level hintfunctions.)andP;  Taking advantage of the dropout-control function recently addedto the TrueType repertoire, Bitstream can now automatically generate Royalfonts that, Bitstream says, produce screen display and 300-dpi printer outputthat are approximately as good as those produced using Bitstream's own Speedotechnology.andM;The problm is that Adobe ATM currently produces output that looks appreciablybetter.andP;  To get to parity with ATM quality, Bitstream will have to addinstructions to its faces.andP;  No one is entirely certain yet how much work thiswill entail.andP;  Bitstream feels that it will not be too time-consuming.andM;Most of the other major font foundries are still less far along.andO;Compugraphic, Linotype and Monotype reported that they are still findingproduction arduous.andP;  All expect to have a modest number of Royal fonts readyfor the market by the end of the year.andM;Still lurking: PCL 5andM;The other force in the office market is Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet seriesprinters (and clones), which outsell PostScript printers by five to one.andO;Until recently, the publishing community could ignore the LaserJet, since itsPCL language was simply too underpowered for graphic arts.andP;  Anyone who neededgraphics and scalable type had to use PostScript.andP;  With the introduction ofPCL Level 5, that has changed.andM;PCL 5 gives most office users as much graphic flexibility as they are likelyto need: scalable and rotatable type, bitmapand vector graphics.andP;  The thingsthey don't get--halftone screening, arbitrary anamorphic distortion ofobjects, clipping images to a path--are not all that crucial in officedocuments.andM;These users already like the speed and low cost of PCL printers.andP;  With theinclusion of the Resolution Enhancement technology in the LaserJet III, theyare going to think that the quality they get out of PCL is better than theoutput of most 300-dpi PostScript printers, and they are going to feel verylittle incentive to pay extra for PostScript.andP;  Because a large amount ofpublishing originates in the office environment (and document interchange ismuch more important there), publishers cannot ignore the impact of PCL anylonger.andM;PCL 5 uses Compugraphic's Intellifont technology for rendering type.andP;  Intransferring PCL documents into a PostScript environment (or into an OS/2 orMac screen environment), it will be necessary to have CG fonts available thatmatch the PCL fonts in widths and glyphs, and to have a mechanism for dealingwith the HPGL/2 plotter commands that make up the PCL graphic functions.andP;  Webelieve that, simply because PCL 5 printers are going to be ubiquitous in theoffice, PCL will be a key fact of life to publishers.andM;Users win at lastandM;The big winner in the latest font battle is the user.andP;  There is no questionthat the competition has forced Adobe to run harder.andP;  It is rapidly improvingits products.andP;  It is becoming more competitive in its business practices.andO;Similarly, Adobe is setting the standards that Royal has to meet or better inorder to earn its place in the market.andM;PostScript survives.andP;  From the user's standpoint we now have a de factostandard in the form of the Adobe technology and the Adobe library, with thebenefit of an aggressive competitor that is pushing Adobe and that could wellturn out to offer a superior product.andM;The Adobe fonts will be supported out-of-the-box by all IBM computers andprinters (including non-PostScript printers) and by all PostScript printers(including clones) from any source.andP;  They will also be supported (at extracost) on all Macintoshes and Mac printers (including QuickDraw devices), PCsrunning Windows and non-IBM PCs running OS/2.andP;  Adobe fonts are currentlysupported on DEC, Next and IBM workstations but not yet on other Unixworkstations, including those that run Sun/ATandamp;T Unix V.4 (and Sun/Foliotechnology) or those running X Window (which by itself supports only bitmapfaces).andP;  Support from Unix vendors is more likely to come now that IBM hasmade its move.andM;We may soon have an ISO-approved standard in PostScript also.andP;  The ISO fontstandard committee recently voted for Type 1 as the model for representingglyphs, or font shapes, in ISO 9541.andP;  (See our article on 9541 in theFebruary issue for details on this standard.)andP;  Likewise, the ISO effort toestablish a standard page description language (SPDL) is now cloe to adoptinga specification that will be a superset of PostScript but very close toPostScript in many ways.andM;Most important of all, there is a huge--and rapidly growing--library ofAdobe-format fonts.andP;  All of those fonts should run on all of the machineslisted above.andM;If Royal catches on, we would expect other vendors (including Adobe) to addsupport for Royal as well as Adobe-format fonts.andP;  Users should be able tointermix the two kinds of fonts in the same job.andP;  In the meantime, users cannow rest assured that their investment in Adobe fonts and rasterizers willnot be in vain.andM;TrueType awaits the challenge.andP;  This means that TrueType will arrive in themarket with a much smaller type library and facing an established standard.andO;The fact that the Royal technology will be built into every Mac with 2 MB ormore of memory and every Windows and OS/2 PC will give it a boost, but in theend, we think TrueType will have to win its position on technical merit.andM;It will have to show real speed or quality advantages.andP;  Font foundries willalso have to be able to make Royal fonts, with quality at least comparable toAdobe ATM standards, relatively quickly and painlessly.andP;  If not, the libraryof Royal faces will remain comparatively small, or of poor, quality, or both.andM;In short, even though a major turning point in the font wars has been reached(with an outcome that is a lot less messy than it might have been), a fewissues still remain to be hammered out.andP;  If all of this works as planned,TrueType and ATM will compete on a more or less level playing field, withneither technology locked out of any significant part of the market.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
