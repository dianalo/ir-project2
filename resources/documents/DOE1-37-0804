Natural prostaglandins (PGs) and their analogs have been shownto protect intestinal clonogenic cells (stem cells) in vivo from radiationinjury. To further investigate structure and activity relationship inPGs as radiation protectors, studies were done with four E-series PGs:E1, E2, 16,16-dimethyl (dm) PGE2, and 15-deoxy, 16-methyl, 16-hydroxyPGE1 (misoprostol). No protection was seen with PGE1 at doses rangingfrom 1-100 ug/mouse given from 15 min to 3 hrs before 15.0 Gy137Cs. Incontrast, the other three E-series PGs increased intestinal clonogeniccell survival when given 15 min before irradiation. The optimum pre-irradiationtime of PG administration was 1 hr for PGE2 and 16,16-dm PGE2 and 2 hrsfor misoprostol. The degree of maximum radiation protection was markedlydifferent among the four PGs. PGE2 increased survival to 200% of controlvalues and 16,16-dm PGE2 increased survival to about 400% of controls.The greatest radioprotection was seen with misoprostol, which increasedsurvival to 600% of control. These results suggest that molecular alterationsin the side chains of PGs change the efficiency of PG-induced radiationprotection. The highest protection to date has been observed with misoprostol.This important finding warrants clinical investigation in patients subjectedto radiotherapy.</TEXT></DOC>
