MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Of course President Reagan is playingpolitics these days, George Bush's protestations notwithstanding.Bush would have a lot more to lament if the White House wereplaying it any other way.   The vice president said the other day that he guessed it wasinevitable for people to see political motives behind Reagan'sdecisions on Cabinet appointments, vetoes and policy decisions.``But I certainly won't add any validity to the charge,'' Bush said.   It really isn't much of a charge. It is so standard as to be anelection-year cliche. Politicians are always accusing each other ofplaying politics, which is rather ironic since that's what they dofor a living.   Besides, there's really nothing wrong with it. That is the wayissues are defined and put to the voters. If they don't like whatthey see, they can vote for the other candidate.   Presidents have not always been so helpful to their vicepresidents in campaigns to succeed them. Dwight D. Eisenhowerdidn't do a lot for Richard M. Nixon in 1960. Lyndon B. Johnson'shandling of Vietnam war issues in his final months probably hurtHubert H. Humphrey's ticket in 1968.   Both those vice presidents lost.   No president can deliver nomination, let alone election, to hisvice president or any other candidate. But presidents certainly canhelp, and Reagan is.   He has promised Bush two campaign appearances a week from LaborDay on, and his White House actions in these waning days of hisadministration are at least as significant an assist.   ``I'm just still working on the job here,'' Reagan said Tuesdaywhen questions were raised about political motivation in hisappointment of a Hispanic educator to become secretary ofeducation. A month earlier, the vice president had promised anassociation of Latin citizens that he would choose a Hispanic for aseat in a Bush Cabinet.   Bush said he was consulted before Lauro F. Cavazos, president ofTexas Tech University, was appointed to the education post. But hesaid he wasn't claiming credit or responsibility for it.   The influence, or interests, of the vice president were evidentin an assortment of other Reagan moves, including:   _His decision not to veto a bill to require advance notice toworkers when there are to be plant closings or major layoffs.Reagan let the bill become law without his signature, rather thanrevive an issue the Democrats welcomed in congressional as well aspresidential politics.   _The selection of Nicholas F. Brady, a Bush confidant, to becomesecretary of the treasury, succeeding James A. Baker III, who leftthe Cabinet to take command of the Bush campaign.   _The veto of a $299.5 billion defense budget bill on grounds itsought to lock the administration into weapons programs favored bythe Democrats. Defense and foreign policy are issues on which Bushbelieves he can master Democratic presidential nominee MichaelDukakis; the veto guarantees a new round of action on defensespending during the campaign.   _The signing on Wednesday of a bill to pay reparations toJapanese Americans because of internments during World War II.That's particularly significant in California, which is where Bushendorsed the idea during the primary election campaign. Reaganoriginally objected to the cost, but embraced a bill with a ceilingon appropriations.   _An apparent switch in signals on a Contra aid bill that passedthe Senate Wednesday night over solid Republican opposition. TheDemocratic bill provides $27 million in so-called humanitarian aid,but no arms for Contras fighting the government of Nicaragua. Themilitary aid issue was left open for possible action later.   Bush favors the full array of Contra aid. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has voted for it in thepast. Dukakis is opposed to military aid to the Contras. Republicancampaigners don't want that ticket split forgotten.   Not that the Democrats are without resources of their own. Theydo run Congress, and as opportunities arise this fall, they willuse that control to the advantage of their candidates and thedisadvantage of Republicans.   And, in turn, Republicans will accuse them of playing politics.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
