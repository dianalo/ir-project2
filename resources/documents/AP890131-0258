The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, including 15additional assistant U.S. attorneys, will be located in six cities:New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kansas City andDenver.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York and U.S. AttorneyAnton Valukas in Chicago already have undertaken substantialinvestigations of the markets in those two cities.   ``We are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bearon behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of beingdefrauded or lose confidence in the market,'' Thornburgh said.   He said the task forces were being formed to ``combat what canaptly be called crime in the suites.'' Fraud is being committed``under the guise of respectability in the financial and securitiesmarkets,'' he said.   In addition, Thornburgh said the Treasury loses more than $90billion a year as a result of tax fraud, and white-collar crime hasbeen a factor in many recent business failures, including many ofthe bank and savings and loan closings.   There was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost.Those involved in the task forces will be senior, experiencedprosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by newattorneys, Edward S.G. Dennis, assistant attorney general in chargeof the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a newsconference.   The task forces will concentrate on the most complex anddifficult frauds, including stock loan frauds, precious metalsfraud, ``parking'' of securities with buyers concealing how much ofa stake they have in a company's stock, and major bank and brokeragefrauds, plus tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury,Thornburgh said.   ``These investigations are difficult and require thesophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors,'' Thornburgh said.``They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing theevidence.''   Agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the InternalRevenue Service, the Postal Inspection Service, the FBI and theCommodity Futures Trading Commission also will be involved in theprobes.   Giuliani, who is leaving his post today after five years, made aname for himself in part by attacking insider trading on Wall Streetand has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in thesecurities markets.   Valukas of Chicago supervised a two-year undercover investigationof the nation's largest commodity markets, resulting in allegationsthat as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheatedcustomers and profited themselves in illegal trades.   Under the new task forces, the U.S. attorney's office inManhattan will get six additional assistant U.S. attorneys, whilethe offices in Chicago and Los Angeles will get three each, and SanFrancisco, Kansas City and Denver will get one apiece. Anunspecified number of investigators, paralegal workers and othersupport personnel will be added to those offices as well.   In addition to Giuliani, Valukas and Dennis, Thornburgh wasjoined at the news conference by Benito Romano, who becomes interimU.S. attorney for Manhattan on Wednesday after Giuliani steps down,and Robert Ulrich, U.S. attorney in Kansas City and chairman of theattorney general's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
