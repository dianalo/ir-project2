David Ilchert, regional director of the Immigration andNaturalization Service, earlier ruled against bond for Hoy Yu Yiafter a doctor reported her to be in good health. But later Ilchert``had a change of heart,'' said Hoy's spokesman, Bob Ryan. Theregional director is the only person who can approve bond inimmigration cases.   Federal Immigration Judge Bernard Hornbach suggested the checkuplast week after a hearing in which Hoy appeared pale, grimaced andsaid she was suffering from severe ulcerlike symptoms.   Hoy and her fiance, Luo Jian Guang, 32, were taken into custodyAug. 7 when they arrived in San Francisco saying they fearedreprisals for anti-government protests if they return to theirhomeland. Immigration officials have the right to detainasylum-seekers who arrive without visas or to release them on bond.   While the INS said it has not taken a position on the asylumrequest, the State Department has filed a report saying it does notbelieve the students have proven they have a well-founded fear ofpersecution if they go back to China.   Their attorney, Eugene Wong of San Francisco, said he willcontinue to fight deportation and pursue bond for Luo. He said Hoyhas relatives with whom they could stay.   President Bush decided after the Beijing massacre in June toallow the estimated 73,000 Chinese students in the United States toremain even if their visas expired. But that decision did notaffect people who arrived later.   Hoy and Luo were studying in Tokyo when they helped organize arally deploring the June 4 massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousandsof people by government troops on their way to recapture TiananmenSquare from pro-democracy students.   They said Chinese Embassy officials in Tokyo took pictures ofthem, and they received phone calls at home that threatened themfor their protest.   Both students' fathers were jailed during the CulturalRevolution in the '60s, and they testified last Friday that theyexpect to be jailed if they return to China.</TEXT></DOC>
