Experimental evidence shows that misfit dislocationsources become active almost immediately as the layer thickness exceedsthe equilibrium critical thickness. These dislocation sources do notseem related to obvious causes, such as threading dislocations or homogeneousnucleation at surface structures. It is argued here that the dislocationsources are inhomogeneous in nature and result from local stress concentrationsnear the surface.</TEXT></DOC>
