Grain prices also were depressed because a break in therainy weather allowed farmers to come closer to completingthe long-delayed spring planting season.</LP><TEXT>   At the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the corn contractfor July delivery fell seven cents a bushel to settle at$2.3875. The contract touched a life-of-contract low beforerising slightly by the close.   The soybean contract for July delivery dropped 11 cents tosettle at $5.725 a bushel.   After the close of trading, weekly planting reportsreleased by several Corn Belt states confirmed that farmersdid make significant progress.   The biggest delays had been in Iowa and southernMinnesota. But by Sunday, Iowa farmers had planted 92% oftheir corn fields and 75% of their soybean fields. During theprevious week, Iowa farmers had managed to plant only 82% oftheir corn acres and 50% of their soybean acres.   Normally, the planting season is nearly complete by earlyJune. While the unusually wet spring delayed fieldwork inIowa and Minnesota, corn-growing conditions have been idealin states such as Illinois.   Nationwide, 96% of the corn crop has been planted comparedwith an average of 97% for this time of the year, accordingto the Agriculture Department.   &quot;We are still a little behind a year ago,&quot; said RobertLekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain andamp; Livestock Corp.,Chicago. &quot;But what did get planted is mostly in good shape.&quot;   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price declinessnowballed late in the session after traders interpretedstatements by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to meanthat the Bush administration might take as long as severalmore weeks to act on the longstanding Soviet request for $1.5billion in export-credit guarantees.   Traders have been speculating for several weeks that aidto Moscow would boost U.S. grain exports from their depressedlevels. The Soviet Union had been a major customer of U.S.farmers until it ran into credit problems.   If the Soviet Union used $500 million of an aid package tobuy U.S. corn, for example, it could conceivably importroughly 188 million bushels at current prices.   Reports continued to circulate yesterday about the poorquality of the soft red winter wheat crop in states such asIllinois, where the harvest begins shortly. The wet and warmspring apparently triggered a fungus outbreak that isexpected to reduce yields and perhaps make at least some ofthe crop unfit for human consumption.   The drop in corn prices was exacerbated by speculationthat some of the soft red winter wheat crop will have to beused as livestock feed. Corn is primarily used to feedlivestock.   It isn't clear whether the winter wheat report scheduledfor release by the Agriculture Department today will reflectthe disease problems with the soft red variety grown in theMidwest. The outbreak was detected only the past few weeks.   Most traders expect the Agriculture Department to continueto predict a total winter wheat harvest of about 1.49 billionbushels. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested inthe early summer. The hard red winter wheat variety is grownin Southern Plains states such as Kansas.   The harvest forecasts by traders for the troubled soft redwinter wheat crop, which is traded at the Chicago Board ofTrade, are unusually wide. Several traders are predicting aharvest of 422 million bushels but others are predicting acrop as small as 380 million bushels.   In May, the Agriculture Department predicted a soft redwinter wheat crop of 461 million bushels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices slipped to a three-monthlow yesterday in light trading at the New York MercantileExchange. Crude for July delivery fell 44 cents a barrel to$19.84, the lowest settlement price since April 3. Traderssaid data released by the American Petroleum Institute lastweek showing an increase in inventories confirmed beliefs inthe market that U.S. stocks of petroleum are higher thandemand necessitates. Selling based on that belief was delayedonly by trepidation that members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna last weekmight cut back their output, a move that would have tightenedup supplies. Activity may have been lighter than usual assome local traders at the exchange left the floor to attendthe New York City parade welcoming home troops from OperationDesert Storm.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices continued to strengthen.Gold for August delivery jumped $7.10 an ounce to end at$376.60. July silver extended its total gain of28.5-cents-an-ounce in its rally last Thursday and Friday byanother nine cents yesterday to finish at $4.56. Julyplatinum lagged the other precious metals, rising $1.20 anounce to $384. Analysts and traders tied yesterday's activityto strong demand for physical gold and silver in Zurich andLondon. Middle Eastern and European investors bought gold andsilver based on technical chart indicators, said JamesKneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial Management, aninstitutional money management firm. Also contributing to thestrength of the metals are &quot;honest&quot; signs an economicrecovery is in the works, he said. Inflation fears may alsohave sparked some buying after reports that Bengt Dennis, thepresident of the Bank for International Settlements, saidworld governments &quot;may be in danger of underestimating&quot;continuing inflationary pressures in the global economy. Mr.Dennis, who is also governor of the Swedish central bank,made the comments in a speech to shareholders in Switzerlandyesterday. Gold is often bought by investors as a hedgeagainst inflation. Mr. Kneafsey predicts prices will continueto rise: Silver could run up to near the $5 level and gold upto $400 within the next two to four weeks.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Prices of soonest-to-expire futures traded in awide range, reflecting uncertainty over immediately availablesupplies. July sugar ended 0.15 a pound higher at 8.88 cents.October sugar lost 0.06 cent to end at 8.14 cents. Suppliesavailable for delivery against nearby sugar futures areperceived to be tight, said Harri Schwartz, an analyst withCargill Investor Services. But, he adds, &quot;It's been myexperience that a well-advertised tightness usually doesn'tmaterialize.&quot; Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers agreed, saying the high premium of July sugar islikely to draw supplies into the market. She also notedconcerns about the effects of unseasonably cool weather inEurope on supplies over the longer term.</TEXT></DOC>
