It was the first time since last December that Belgium hasreduced its short-term interest rates.   The move reflected a recent stabilization in internationalinterest rates following a steady rise since the beginning of 1989,analysts said.   However, the key three-month rate is still almost one point aboveits level of December 1988 when it stood at 7.5 percent.   The bank did not comment on the rate cuts. It left the interestrate on four-month certificates unchanged at 8.4 percent but raisedthat of the six-month paper to 8.4 from 8 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
