 I just sent in my subscription for two more years ofinteresting articles.andP;  Your piece on memory chips in the first issue(October, 1990) and hard drives in the second have made reading PC Sourcesworthwhile.andP;  Plus, you have the mail-order ads every PC user needs, in acompact and easy to store format.andM;CATERING BY MAILandM;I like your magazine.andP;  At last someone caters to mail-order purchasers.andP;  I dohave two ideas you could try out....andM;Winn Rosch's article, &quot;Turbo Charge Your System,&quot; in the November issue was agood start, but what is needed is a side-by-side comparison (by processortype and speed) of the various motherboards available, listing the quality,performance, dimensions, and drawbacks of each.andM;Challenge the major mail-order manufacturers to justify their right to mybusiness by producing an audited financial statement for the last five years.andO;I recently got orphaned by the demise of a mail-order company, so I'm verysensitive to the financial strength of those I buy from.andM;KEEP ME POSTEDandM;I subscribe to several PC magazines but I have learned more in the past twoissues of PC Sources than in all the others combined.andP;  The technicalinformation and the reviews are well written, timely, and informative.andP;  Iexpect that the advertisements and articles in future issues will keep meposted on all the exciting changes taking place in the PC world.andM;A BUDGET APPROACHandM;I think your magazine takes an excellent approach.andP;  As one reader stated,save us the fluff and tell us how to take advantage of what we already have(as you do in Upgrade Clinic).andP;  Myself, I would love to buy the latest intechnology, but I have other expenses to consider.andM;I'm glad to see Dave Rowell and Hardin Brothers with articles in yourmagazine.andP;  You definitely have one new follower.andM;CONVERTER CAVEATSandM;With regard to the reader who wished to take a monitor to Europe (&quot;From theExperts: Frequent Questions about Monitors,&quot; November, 1990): Most electricaloutlets in Europe are 220 volts 50Hz.andP;  Most outlets in the US are 110 volts60Hz.andP;  A converter should be used only with an appliance such as an iron or alamp that can be powered by DC.andP;  Computers and monitors require stepdowntransformers.andP;  To find out what size transformer to buy and where to buy it,call the equipment's manufacturer.andP;  Take an outlet tester to Europe as well:With the round European outlets, the high and low sides of the power line canbe reversed.andP;  Don't take any items with synchronous AC motors, such as clocksor turntables.andM;Another possibility: The monitor can probably be converted to run on 220volts if you can find a technician to change a connection or switch in thepower supply.andP;  In this case only an outlet adapter would be needed.andP;  Again,contact the manufacturer for information.andM;THOSE ELUSIVE PAGE NUMBERSandM;In the future, I would like to see a larger Ombudsman section in yourmagazine.andP;  It would be helpful to see by name which companies behavereputably after the sale--not just the ones who don't.andM;Also, please consider putting a page number on every page.andP;  In a publicationwith as many ads as you have, it's annoying to look for a certain page whenthere are no numbers for many pages.andM;Some of our readers have enthused about mail-order companies they've dealtwith successfully.andP;  February's Letters column contains a couple suchtestimonials, and we'll include more in the future.andM;With regard to page numbers--we certainly understand your frustration.andO;Numbers appear on as many of our pages as possible, but a few advertisementsare designed in such a way that page numbers cannot be placed over them.andM;PLAN TO SCANandM;After receiving the first three issues of my subscription, I'm pleased to saythat I think you have a winner.andM;Here is an idea for a future article.andP;  I would like to see an in-depth studyof reasonably priced full-page scanners.andP;  An affordable scanner with thereliability to copy all kinds of text and typesetting would be a boon to manytypes of businesses.andP;  Another suggestion for the magazine: Assemble all thewritten articles together in the front or back.andM;SAME BUT DIFFERENTandM;Could you please clarify the two graphs in your November issue (page 40) andyour December issue (page 41)?andP;  They are from the same source yet seem toshow different data.andP;  December's graph seems to be way off.andP;  Also, what does&quot;PCs/Worldwide&quot; mean?andP;  Does it include PCs in the United States?andP;  That's whatthe term means to me.andM;The graph in November's issue refers to PCs already in use.andP;  The graph inDecember's issue should have been labeled to show that it refers to shipmentsof new PCs.andP;  The term &quot;worldwide&quot; does, as you surmised, include PCs in theU.S.andM;CORRECTIONSandM;Aamazing Technology's Aamazing CM 61428S monitor, pictured on page 420 of theDecember issue, comes with a one-year warranty on parts and labor.andM;The Ultra 386-SX from Ultra-Comp (reviewed on page 297 in January's issue)provides space for five half-height storage devices; it also uses a systemBIOS from AMI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
