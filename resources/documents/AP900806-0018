KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress is on summer recess after a weekendmarathon that produced a Pentagon spending blueprint in the Senate,campaign finance overhaul in the House and final passage ofemergency relief to cities hard hit by AIDS.   Left hanging after the burst of legislative activity were thedelicate _ and politically testy _ negotiations between Congressand the White House on a deficit-reduction plan to avert mandatory,across-the-board budget cuts.   Also awaiting action when the House and Senate return afterLabor Day are conference talks on the first major clean air bill inmore than 13 years, a measure to boost aid for child care and apossible new fight over family leave legislation that PresidentBush vetoed earlier this year.   Lawmakers also face the usual election-year deadline pressuresof trying to complete the major spending bills in time to hit thecampaign trail as early in October as possible.   The Senate and House face particularly acute differences overthe defense bill. These include policy divisions on how much tospend on B-2 stealth bomber production and the future of theStrategic Defense Initiative, once the glittering cornerstone ofReagan administration defense policy but now dimmed by warmingU.S.-Soviet relations.   In approving a $289 billion defense bill on Saturday, the Senateleft intact Bush's proposal to build two B-2 bombers in the 1991fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the Senate cut $1 billion from hisStar Wars request, leaving $3.7 billion.   While the Senate pegged total defense spending at $18 billionless than the $307 billion Bush sought, the House favors evensteeper cuts of $24 billion.   But even though the Senate version represents the likelyhigh-water mark in defense spending in Congress this year, theWhite House said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is likely torecommend a veto.   Cheney objects to the reduction in the Star Wars program and tothe Senate's call for a 100,000 reduction in U.S. militarypersonnel. The Senate also voted to eliminate $1.6 billion inprocurement money for the MX rail-mobile missile program.   In their rush to leave the city's August heat behind, the Houseand Senate approved a number of measures, including a campaignfinance package backed by the House Democratic leadership making anumber of changes and limiting House campaign spending to $715,000a candidate.   The House bill _ which seeks to curb contributions by ``fatcat'' corporate political action committees _ must be reconciledwith a differing Senate version.   The AIDS measure would provide more than $4 billion over fiveyears to help U.S. cities hardest hit by the disease.   The bill authorizes nearly $900 million per year in AIDSspending for five years, with $275 million authorized to be dividedamong the cities in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and ``such sums asmay be necessary'' through fiscal 1995.   A similar amount would be authorized for distribution to thestates for improving quality and availability of care for peoplewith the AIDS-causing HIV virus.   A major portion of the money for the cities would be earmarkedto help provide health and social services.   The first half of the money, about $137 million, would bedivided among the 16 areas singled out for special assistance. Theother half would be redistributed in fiscal 1992 based on thenumber of AIDS cases at that time.   The cities authorized to receive the assistance are Atlanta,$3.8 million; Boston, $3 million; Chicago, $4.2 million; Dallas, $3million; Fort Lauderdale, Fla., $2.7 million; Houston, $5.6million; Jersey City, $2.8 million; Los Angeles, $13 million;Miami, 5.3 million; New York, $51.3 million; Newark, $6.3 million;Philadelphia, $3.6 million; San Diego, $2.4 million; San Francisco,$20.4 million; San Juan, P.R., $4.1 million and the District ofColumbia, $5.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
