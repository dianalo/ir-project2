Public Comments</ITAG>A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 23, 1988 (GSAR Notice 5-173, 53 FR47551). No public comments were received. Comments from various GSA officeshave been considered and where appropriate incorporated in this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by memorandum datedDecember 14, 1984, exempted certain procurement regulations from ExecutiveOrder 12291. This exemption applies to this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The GSA indicated in GSAR Notice 5-173 that this rule may have an economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities and invited comments fromthe public. No comments were received on the impact of the proposed rule.The final regulatory flexibility analysis which is available from the officeidentified above indicates that the rule may affect small business firmsawarded contracts by GSA that require source inspection. GSA awarded approximately4,570 contracts that required source inspection during FY-87. Of this total,2,630 were awarded to small business. The rule will have a beneficial impactin that it will reduce the intrusion by Government inspectors at the productionpoint of supplies by permitting the contractor to certify that the suppliesbeing shipped under the contract are in conformance with the contract requirements.The Government will inspect the contractors inspection system to ensureit meets Federal Standard 368 and may periodically inspect a sampling ofsupplies shipped under the contract. Normally, the contractor will inspectsupplies for conformance and simply certify conformance to the Governmenton the DD Form 250. Currently, contractors prepare the DD Form 250 fordeliveries to military agencies or the GSA Form 308 for deliveries to civilianagencies, and give it to the Government inspector who inspects the itemsand signs the form which is then distributed by the contractor. Under theproposed rule, the contractor will prepare the forms as before. However,if the contract contains the clause at GSAR 552.246-70 Source Inspectionby Quality Approved Manufacturer, the contractor will certify in block16 of the DD Form 250 that the shipment of supplies shown on the form wereinspected and found to comply with all requirements of the contract. Ifthe contract contains the clause at GSAR 552.246-72 Source Inspection,the Government inspector will continue to inspect the supplies before shipmentand sign the form.A further beneficial aspect from the contractor's perspective is the revisionto the GSAR clause at 552.212-72 Availability for Inspection, Testing andShipment/Delivery. The clause and prescription for its use are revisedto eliminate the requirement to notify the Government that supplies areready for inspection when the contract provides for source inspection bya Quality Approved Manufacturer.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Status Report of Orders and Shipments clause at GSAR 552.242-70, theSource Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer clause at GSAR 552.246-70,and the Source Inspection clause at GSAR 552.246-72 contain informationcollection requirements which have been approved by OMB under section 3504(h)of the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090-0027.The title of the first collection in this rule is ``Status Report of Ordersand Shipments.'' The clause requires contractors to submit a monthly reportshowing the status of processing of orders received under the contract.The contracting officer responsible for administering the contract usesthe information to ensure that orders are shipped in accordance with thedelivery terms established in the contract and to initiate appropriateaction when orders are delinquent. The respondents are contractors awardedindefinite delivery or requirements contracts for stock replenishment itemsby GSA. The estimated annual burden for this collection is 4,570 hours.This is based on an estimated average burden hour per response of .083,a proposed frequency of 12 responses per respondent, and an estimated numberof likely respondents of 4,570.The title of the second collection in this rule is ``Material Inspectionand Receiving Report (DD Form 250 and GSA Form 308).'' The clause at GSAR552.246-70, Source Inspection by Quality Approved Manufacturer, requiresthe contractor prepare, sign and distribute a DD Form 250 for each shipmentunder the contract. The clause at GSAR 552.246-72, Source Inspection, requiresthe contractor to prepare for signature by a Government inspector the DDForm 250 for deliveries to military agencies or the GSA Form 308 for deliveriesto civilian agencies. The contractor distributes the forms after signatureby the Government inspector.The information contained on the DD Form 250 or GSA Form 308 is used byvarious contract administration and other support offices to document contractquality assurance, acceptance of supplies, shipments, and to support payments.The information is essential to effective contract administration. Therespondents are contracts awarded supply contracts by GSA that providefor source inspection. The estimated total annual burden for this collectionis 263,000 hours. This is based on an estimated average burden hour perresponse of .5, an average proposed frequency of 115 responses per respondent,and an estimated number of likely respondents of 4,572. Any comments concerningthe accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing thisburden may be directed to the Director, Office of GSA Acquisition Policyand Regulations (VP) 18th and F Street NW.
