Tuesdayannounced two new personal computers, one that is slightly cheaperthan before and another that is slightly lighter.   Neither machine broke new ground, but IBM, the world leader inpersonal computer market share, is hoping the models will attractmore customers to its 2-year-old Personal System-2 line.   In another step, IBM is expected to tie its PCs more closely toits bigger computers next week by announcing programs that have thesame look and feel across the product spectrum.   One of the machines announced Tuesday, the Model 55 SX, uses asimplified version of Intel Corp.'s 80386 chip, which several otherpersonal computer makers including Compaq Computer Corp. havealready adopted.   IBM said the model would be its cheapest 80386-based personalcomputer yet, with versions listed at $3,895 and $4,295.   The other new machine, the P70 386, is the first portable modelat the high end of IBM's line. It is bigger and heavier than alaptop and cannot run on batteries. It weighs 20 pounds andmeasures 12 inches by 18 inches by 5 inches. Versions are listed at$7,695 and $8,295.   IBM also announced rebates ranging up to $800 on the base-layersoftware, Operating System-2, which runs on many PS-2 computers andother makes of high-powered personal computers.   The rebates are to offset the expense of buying the extrainternal memory that the complex base-layer software requires.   IBM plans to announce next Tuesday a collection of programsunder the Officevision Family label that should make computingsimpler by standardizing the appearance and format of the software,the New York Times reported Tuesday.   IBM executives declined to comment on the report, but the ideafits in with the company's stated strategy.   For example, IBM is working to make it possible for someone at anetworked personal computer to issue commands at the keyboardwithout knowing what computer is doing the work or where theinformation is coming from, executives said.   By reducing complexity from the user's point of view, ``Itlevels the playing field, so to speak,'' Robert Carberry, vicepresident of systems in IBM's Entry Systems Division, said in aninterview.</TEXT></DOC>
