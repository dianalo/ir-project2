OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Police on Saturday arrested nearly 600 abortion opponents whotried to blockade clinics around the nation, including one in LosAngeles disrupted by shouting and shoving matches between protestersand abortion rights advocates.   Protests also took place in Philadelphia, Fort Wayne, Ind.;Milwaukee; Ann Arbor, Mich., and Richmond, Va.   Police arrested 250 of the approximately 500 members of thenational anti-abortion group Operation Rescue who staged a sit-inthat blocked doors to the Los Angeles Midland Medical Clinic, saidPolice Officer Robert Plourde.   The demonstrators, who prayed and sang hymns, were faroutnumbered by about 1,000 chanting abortion rights advocates led byorganizers using bullhorns.   ``This is disgusting! This is a baby!'' Lorna Casey shouted asshe thrust a picture of a fetus at counterdemonstrators.   ``This woman's ignorance is the mass ignorance of her movement!''an abortion rights advocate yelled from the crowd, apparentlyreferring to the debate over when life begins.   The ill will prompted pushing and shoving as well as angryshouting matches before about 300 police, including several onhorseback, moved in. It took them about three hours to clear thesidewalk in front of the clinic, which offers pregnancy counseling,family planning advice and abortions.   ``It's a little bit scary today, there's a lot more fighting,''said Operation Rescue spokeswoman Elaine Bingham. ``Our people arewilling to be beaten or arrested to save the lives of the babies.''   Among those arrested was Operation Rescue national field directorJoseph Foreman, said Scott McGuirk, another group spokesman.   The protest was the latest in a series by Operation Rescue as theU.S. Supreme Court considers a challenge to the Roe vs. Wadedecision legalizing abortion.   Among the abortion rights advocates at the rally were NormaMcCorvey, 41, of Dallas, who was ``Jane Roe'' in the high court'slandmark 1973 ruling, and Eleanor Smeal, president of the FeministMajority and past president of the National Orgniazation for Women.   ``Rescue the homeless; rescue the many thousands of hungry peopleand children that are already here today,'' Ms. McCorvey saidoutside the clinic in a message to the protesters. ``Think not aboutthe women who choose to have the right to control their own bodiesand destinies. You cannot choose their destinies for them.''   Those arrested were booked on trespassing charges, and manyrefused to post $500 bail or to identify themselves, Plourde said.Without positive identification, detainees cannot be released ontheir own recognizance.   ``Our standard policy is, `Don't post bail,''' McGuirk said.``Don't accept probation or plea bargaining. Everyone stays (injail) until they all get out.''   In Philadelphia, police arrested all but 10 of the 150anti-abortion protesters who blocked the doors to the NortheastWomen's Center.   Protesters surrounded woman trying to enter, said clinic actingdirector Diane Straus.   ``Several women left very upset, in tears, crying and instress,'' she said. ``Their health has been endangered.''   The protest organized by the Pro-Life Non-Violent Action Projectof Southeastern Pennsylvania came three months after a federal judgeissued a permanent injunction against disruptive abortiondemonstrations in the Philadelphia area.   U.S. District Judge Clarence G. Newcomer's order includes a$5,000 fine for each violation.   The center will return to court to accuse the protesters ofviolating the injunction, said Straus.   Michael McMonagle, executive director of the Pro-Life Coalitionof Southeast Pennsylvania, said the protesters ``don't letinjunctions keep them from saving lives.''   The center also was involved in a case considered the first inthe nation accusing protesters of violating anti-racketeering laws.Last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a juryverdict against 27 leaders of the Philadelphia-area movement.   The leaders and Operation Rescue have been been fined about$110,000 in the case, which has been appealed.   In Milwaukee, about 90 of the 225 anti-abortion protesters whoturned out at Affiliated Medical Services, a downtown clinic, werearrested, police said. Officers had to carry away many, who sat downand refused to move.   Nearly 40 abortion rights advocates staged a counterdemonstrationacross the street.   In Ann Arbor, Mich., police arrested 63 of the 100 to 200protesters who turned out a Planned Parenthood clinic, said Lt.Craig Roderick.   The protesters, who were arrested on trespassing charges, werereleased after giving officers their names, Roderick said.   In Richmond, Va., police arrested about 45 anti-abortiondemonstrators who were blocking entrances to a clinic.   Police Maj. Charles W. Bennett said the protesters were chargedwith obstructing public passage to a building. ``They come andpicket a lot, but this is the largest number of arrests,'' Bennettsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
