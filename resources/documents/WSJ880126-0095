Higher crude oil prices and strong chemical operations contributed to the gains.    Among the biggest oil companies reporting results, only Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp. showed a decline, mainly because of huge gains on asset sales a year earlier. Unocal's profit dropped 39%.    But Exxon Corp., Amoco Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. posted higher profit. New York-based Exxon, the nation's biggest oil company, had the smallest percentage increase. Its net income climbed 5.1%, even though gains from asset sales contributed 34 cents a share to year-earlier profit.    Chicago-based Amoco's net more than doubled, while Arco's quintupled. For Los Angeles-based Arco, net included a gain of $185 million from a public offering in October of Arco Chemical Co. shares, although that gain was offset by several charges.    The increase in refining margins was an important factor in each company's results -- and was particularly evident at Ashland Oil Inc. of Ashland, Ky., which is chiefly a petroleum refiner. In its first quarter ended Dec. 31, net nearly tripled to $71.1 million, or $2.50 a share, after a $31.1 million gain from an accounting change.    Analysts had generally expected refining profits to swell in the fourth quarter -- and in some cases the results exceeded Wall Street expectations. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Arco surged $2.75 to $75.375, Amoco jumped $2.625 to $73.50, Exxon climbed $1.125 to $40.75, Unocal rose 50 cents to $31.25 and Ashland fell $1 to $54.25.    For the first nine months of 1987, petroleum-refining margins were severely depressed because of the increasing costs of crude oil. But in late 1987 crude oil prices softened somewhat, thus firming refining margins. The decline in the value of the dollar also helped the foreign refining operations of international companies such as Exxon, whose fourth-quarter results reached their strongest level since the brisk 1986 first quarter.    &quot;The combination of lower crude supply costs and relatively firm product prices led to an improvement in refining and marketing margins -- in contrast to the situation earlier in the year when higher supply costs depressed margins,&quot; said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman of Exxon.    For 1987, however, Exxon's earnings fell despite higher revenue. Exxon's revenue rose 18% to $22.59 billion in the quarter and 10% to $84.12 billion for the year.    But for the quarter, Exxon's earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to $376 million -- their highest level of 1987. Earnings from world-wide exploration and production totaled $993 million, or $185 million higher than a year earlier.    Exxon sharply boosted capital and exploration expenditures in the quarter to $2.98 billion from $1.59 billion a year earlier. For all 1987, however, spending was flat at $7.18 billion.    Although crude prices began tumbling in late 1987, average prices for the year climbed sharply from the severely depressed levels of 1986. Exxon, like several other oil companies, also cut operating expenses throughout 1987. Exxon's chemical profits reached a record level, reflecting stronger demand industrywide for certain petrochemicals and a sharp rise in petrochemical exports as the dollar tumbled.    At Amoco, Richard M. Morrow, chairman, cited a rise of $3 to $4 a barrel in the average price of crude, as well as improved refining margins and continued strong demand for chemical products. Revenue for the quarter rose 22% to $5.92 billion.    For the year, Amoco's earnings jumped on a revenue increase of 11% to $22.39 billion, reflecting, among other factors, the higher crude oil prices and lower exploration expenses. Capital and exploration expenditures for 1987 fell slightly to $3.1 billion from $3.2 billion in 1986, although Amoco previously has announced a spending budget of $3.8 billion for this year.    At Arco, fourth-quarter earnings included gains totaling $205 million. These were largely offset by $193 million of charges, including a $95 million charge for future environmental cleanup costs. Revenue increased 26% to $4.59 billion. In 1987, revenue increased 12% to $16.83 billion.    At Unocal, fourth-quarter earnings included a gain from asset sales of $2 million, compared with a $79 million gain in the 1986 quarter. Revenue for the quarter increased 13% to $2.33 billion. For 1987, revenue increased 12% to $9.39 billion.    Unocal continued its debt-reduction program in 1987, lowering debt by $452 million to a total of just under $5 billion. &quot;We expect to continue to make significant debt reduction in 1988 and beyond,&quot; said Fred L. Hartley, chairman.    ---                     1987              1986                 in        per     in        per         %               millions   share  millions   share       chg.
