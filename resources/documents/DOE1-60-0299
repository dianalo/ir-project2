National energy statistics generally identify onlythe &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; by surveying traditional supply sources (e.g.electric utilities) and group the renewable energy contribution intothe &quot;other&quot; category. Because of their decentralized application, thedirect contribution of these technologies and their displacement of conventionalenergy sources are often overlooked. The Annual Renewable Energy TechnologyReview: Progress Through 1984 marks the second effort by the RenewableEnergy Institute to quantify the contribution of renewable energy. Thepublication has been greatly expanded from the previous edition. Informationon total resources availability, international activities, and stategovernment incentives has been added. Also, sections which appeared inthe previous edition on technology status, industry status, and marketstatus have been enhanced to provide readers with vital information forevaluating the status and prospects of each technology.</TEXT></DOC>
