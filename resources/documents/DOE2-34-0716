<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0716 </DOCNO><TEXT>Monte Carlo simulation results are presented for a two-dimensional Euclidiannonlocal sine-Gordon lattice field theory. This particular field theoryis identical to a statistical-mechanical model called the Ginzburg-LandauCoulomb gas, a model designed to describe thermal vortex fluctuationsfor a two-dimensional superfluid. The Monte Carlo data obtained are througha chain of relations compared to the experimental data for the scalingfunction describing the resistive tail for thin superconducting films.The agreement found strongly supports a Ginzburg-Landau Coulomb-gas vortex-fluctuationexplanation of the resistive tail.</TEXT></DOC>
