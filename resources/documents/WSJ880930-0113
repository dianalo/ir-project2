The opposition of these lawmakers indicates Congress would probably try to reverse a major deregulatory move by the FCC in the waning days of the Reagan administration. The controversial price-cap proposal has been a personal crusade of FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick.    The commission believes its plan to cap rate increases for long-distance service at three percentage points less than an annual measure of inflation would save consumers more money than traditional regulation, which governs profit margins.    But business consumers, small telephone companies and state regulators strongly dispute that claim, arguing the plan would ensure much greater profits to the big companies and effectively deregulate the industry.    The agency could take final action on its proposal before the end of the year. A spokesman said the agency takes the lawmakers' concerns seriously.    Hoping to forestall any action, Sen. Daniel Inouye, (D., Hawaii), Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) all released letters to the FCC listing inadequacies of the plan.    Messrs. Markey and Dingell said they'd make the new proposal the first telephone policy they take up next year if the commission doesn't address their objections to the price-cap proposal. Mr. Markey is chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee, and Mr. Inouye heads the equivalent panel in the Senate.    The congressmen said in their letters that the commission hasn't provided adequate evidence that consumers would benefit from price-cap regulation.    At a news conference, the Consumer Federation of America charged that the FCC plan could let long-distance rates increase as much as 5% annually without any review. Gail Garfield Schwartz, deputy chairman of the New York State Public Utility Commission, said that although some states are experimenting with price-cap regulation, New York and most other states combine them with regulation of the industry's profits.    Larry Garfinkel, ATandamp;T's vice president for marketing, said the consumers federation took some cost estimates from its FCC filing out of context. </TEXT></DOC>
