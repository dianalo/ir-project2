Among those who are upset are Secretary of State George Shultz and National Security Adviser Colin Powell, administration officials say. They have chided the agency for allowing its raw intelligence to be used by Congress to justify the incorporation of stiff penalties against Toshiba in the pending trade bill. The administration opposes such sanctions, contending that the U.S. can more effectively block the transfer of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc through voluntary allied cooperation.    The pressure has been strong enough to compel the CIA to back off from its most serious charge, that Toshiba indirectly supplied East Germany in 1986 with an assembly line to manufacture 256-K DRAMs, a type of computer memory chip that can enhance the accuracy of weapons.    But the pall cast by the CIA over Toshiba's record lingers. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), one of the more relentless Toshiba-bashers, says he will continue to arrange &quot;intelligence briefings&quot; for other lawmakers who can influence an imminent vote on Toshiba by Senate and House conferees. The outcome is still uncertain because Mr. Duncan and his allies interpret the CIA's findings as they wish -- mostly in the harshest possible light -- while the agency is bound by its own rules of public silence.    At the center of this muddle is Guy DuBois, director of the CIA's Technology Transfer Assessment Center, or TTAC. Before Rep. Hunter began to leak Mr. DuBois's allegations against Toshiba to the press in November, Mr. DuBois had riled the export-control bureaucracy last spring by proposing a plan that would have thrust TTAC into a major role in determining the exportability of important technologies. The Commerce Department now has most of that responsibility.    TTAC worked with the Pentagon's Defense Technology Security Administration, or DTSA, to expose the only proven Toshiba export-control violation, the shipment by a Toshiba subsidiary of computerized propeller-milling machines to a Soviet shipyard. But the Pentagon later allied itself with the more conciliatory policy of the State and Commerce departments, leaving TTAC the only bureaucratic player seeking retribution against Toshiba.    By many accounts, Mr. DuBois has made damning conclusions about other Toshiba transactions at the prompting of Rep. Hunter and other Republican conservatives. Other federal agencies dismiss the CIA charges. Stephen Bryen, the head of the Pentagon's DTSA, and Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, have informed the trade-bill conferees that they have &quot;carefully examined&quot; the same evidence the CIA gave them and have determined that it isn't &quot;compelling.&quot;    The State Department has warned CIA Director William Webster of the policy chaos that could ensue if his analysts bypass the formal committee structure and do most of their business with the administration's critics, as Mr. DuBois appears to have done. A CIA spokeswoman says neither Mr. DuBois nor any other agency employee is authorized to discuss the Toshiba cases with reporters.    Mr. DuBois appears to have the backing of CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates. Mr. Gates can't comment publicly, but an article he recently wrote for Foreign Affairs magazine could explain the agency's position, according to other administration officials. The CIA's role, Mr. Gates wrote, is to remain &quot;poised nearly equidistant between the executive and legislative branches&quot; and to &quot;poke an analytical finger in the policy eye.&quot;    Pentagon and Commerce officials say TTAC's charge that Toshiba illegally supplied a computer-chip assembly line to East Germany was based on circumstantial information. The CIA apparently tied together two separate pieces of information, Toshiba's announcement in 1985 that it had agreed to provide technology for making one-megabit DRAMs to Siemens AG of West Germany and a subsequent claim by East Germany that it had acquired the capability to manufacture 256-K DRAMs.    TTAC claimed these two events added up to technology diversion because of earlier suspicions about Siemens being an unwitting conduit of microelectronic technology to the East bloc. But the CIA had to retreat after hearing contradictory evidence from other U.S. agencies.    West German officials and Siemens executives admit that Siemens had been under CIA scrutiny, but they dismiss the agency's suspicions completely. Bonn's opinion is that the East Germans developed the 256-K DRAMs by themselves. &quot;After all, they are Germans,&quot; the Bonn official says.
