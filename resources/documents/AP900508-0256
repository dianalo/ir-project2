Texaco spokesman Max Hebert said the leak in the 20-inchpipeline apparently had stopped and oil was breaking up in roughseas. The largest slick is about a mile long and 400 yards wide,though still far from shore, he said.   The leak from the Texaco-operated Eugene Island pipelineoccurred about 100 miles off the Louisiana coast.   Winds of 25 miles per hour and four-foot to six-foot seasprevented Texaco's three skimmers from removing any oil from thewater. More bad weather was forecast for Thursday.   The 112-mile-long pipeline, which serves 36 drilling platforms,is operated by Texaco and owned by Texaco, Marathon Oil Co., ExxonCorp., Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Conoco Inc.   The system, in which oil from offshore wells is piped to shore,was shut down early Monday. The pipeline normally handles about95,000 barrels a day.   Texaco Chairman Alfred DeCrane mentioned the spill at thecompany's annual meeting Tuesday and said Texaco was committed tothe environment and had has practiced ways to deal with spills.   Separately, Texaco President and Chief Executive James Kinnearsaid the company plans to invest in new technology to increasereserves from existing fields by 14,000 barrels a day in 1990 and1991.   In addition, a total of $365 million will be invested inrefineries to allow production of an additional 85,000 barrels aday in the United States and 39,000 abroad, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
