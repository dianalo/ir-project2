It said the cease-fire is necessary ``to stop the bloodshed andestablish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the return ofsecurity, stability and national reconciliation.''   The call followed a night of savage shelling duels in Beirut thatkilled 12 people and wounded 72 others. Saud could offer noguarantee for the success of this latest in a string of cease-fireefforts by the 22-member Arab League.   ``The committee possesses no weapons with which it would imposeits will in Lebanon,'' Saud said.   But he said Syria, whose troops are battling the Christians inLebanon, supports the new peace plan.   The declaration called on all parties to stop supplying weaponsto the combatants and said the committee already has received``positive responses in this regard.''   Iraq has been arming the Christians. Syria backs Lebanon'sMoslems, who want a bigger share of power in the countrytraditionally dominated by the minority Christians.   A ``Lebanese Security Committee'' to be headed by Algeriandiplomat Lakhdar will implement and oversee the cease-fire,monitoring all ships reported to be carrying weapons or ammunition,Saud said.   As soon as the security body begins its work, naval blockadeswould be lifted and Beirut International Airport reopened, thedeclaration said.   Ibrahimi is expected in Beirut on Sunday and also is to negotiatethe location of a Sept. 30 meeting of the Lebanese parliament ``todiscuss and prepare the National Reconciliation Charter.''   The Arab League has blamed the failure of previous peace effortsmainly on Syria's refusal to withdraw its 40,000 troops fromLebanon. Damascus wants to link such a pullout to the withdrawal ofIsraeli troops in southern Lebanon.   ``In the final analysis all foreign non-Lebanese forces will haveto leave Lebanon,'' said Saud.</TEXT></DOC>
