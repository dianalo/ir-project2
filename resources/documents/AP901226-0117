In the past, Sheriff Sherman Block said, a homicide report wouldbring news media running to the scene.   ``Now, they call and ask, `Is it a routine murder?''' Blocksaid. ``We have routine murders. ... Homicides become box scoreslike the baseball games. ... There doesn't seem to be the level ofoutrage I think there should be at these events.''   Block called 1990 a year of ``pluses and minuses'' for hisdepartment, the largest minus being the conviction of six deputysheriffs on charges of skimming drug money. But he said he wasproud of the majority of honest people who make up his12,000-member department.   Block said the year's most troubling development was theexplosion of gang-related homicides responsible for pushing murderfigures up 32 percent in areas of the county policed by thesheriff's department.   There were 158 gang-related homicides within the sheriff'sjurisdiction during the first 11 months of this year, way up from104 during the same period last year and shattering the record of116 set for all of 1989.   The sheriff said a report that 22 people died violently over theChristmas weekend was ``not unusual.''   ``What troubles me is the apparent tolerance of violence that wehave developed in this community,'' Block said.</TEXT></DOC>
