What wascalled the Warren Court could as well be called the BrennanCourt.   On a personal level, we join the chorus saluting JusticeBrennan. He did have the decency of candor in his opinions.His resignation at age 84 is similarly honest andclear-headed. Justice Brennan was the only justice left whotook the time to read all the appeals to the Supreme Courtinstead of leaving the task to young clerks. And unlike otherliberal judges, he was not afraid to admit there was no clearconstitutional justification for much of what he did.</LP><TEXT>   His ideology was that courts can decide all issues,whether or not they are legal issues. The Constitutionenvisions capital punishment in several clauses, but thisdidn't stop Justice Brennan from invoking his own view of&quot;human dignity&quot; to declare all death penaltiesunconstitutional. Justice Brennan's expansion of theexclusionary rule helps explain why we so rarely convictcriminals. His creation of broad due-process rights forgovernment benefits locked in the welfare state.   It is fitting that Justice Brennan's enormous influenceextends to defining the debate about his successor. With allthe issues that our court system must confront, somehow thebiggest impact of his departure is supposed to be overabortion. Yet this is not mentioned in the Constitution, andeven an outright reversal of Roe v. Wade would have only aminimal effect on the actual availability of abortion. Thisis a Supreme Court issue only because Justice Brennan and hisallies made it one.   For many years the activist view prevailed over the ideathat judges should strictly construe both the Constitutionand their own roles, but the pendulum is swinging back.President Reagan's brilliant nominations to the lower federalcourts created a long list of qualified potential nomineeswhose views begin with the certainty that Brennan-stylejudicial activism is illegitimate. Their intellectual leaderis Robert Bork, defeated for the court by a smear campaign bythose now demanding that President Bush look for &quot;balance&quot; inchoosing a new nominee.   This time, in short, the fight has started even before thenominee has been named. But the Bork experience should be alesson to the left, for they ended up with Anthony Kennedy, amore consistently conservative vote. We don't know whomPresident Bush will pick for the seat, but if his firstnominee is knocked out for political reasons we'd say a finesecond choice would be Senator Orrin Hatch, confirmablebecause of Senatorial courtesy and more conservative than anyother likely nominee.   More broadly, President Bush won a mandate by running onthe clear platform that he would pick an original-intentjustice, that it's time to close the activist era personifiedby Justice Brennan. The electorate's view must count forsomething; the selection of a nominee is the only time thevoters get their say on the Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
