<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-0423 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lattice field theory is developing into a productive subfield of high-energyparticle physics and statistical mechanics. Both the high-energy andthe statistical-physics communities have been enriched by this coming-together.The particle physicists are particularly interested in understandinghow nonperturbative dynamics work in gauge theories as well as calculatingthe mass spectrum and the low-energy properties of the strongly interactingparticles. Statistical mechanicians are interested in the physics behindphase transitions, dynamical systems and chaos. In these lectures weshall concentrate on the foundations of the lattice approach to someof these topics. Applications and recent trends will be ignored. However,although we will begin with the formal connections between field theoryand statistical mechanics, we end with the latest ideas on fermion computersimulations - both stochastic and molecular-dynamics approaches to includingthe effects of fermion vacuum polarization on gauge field dynamics. Onthe way we will consider asymptotic freedom, nonperturbative renormalizationgroups methods, lattice strings, topological excitations and chiral symmetry.</TEXT></DOC>
