The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,accounting's major professional body, reached the newposition after sponsors in Congress proposed language thatwould put a greater responsibility on companies to reportalleged illegal acts of corporate officers that have beenidentified by auditors.</LP><TEXT>   Congress in recent months has explored whether accountantshave failed to disclose evidence of possible illegal acts bymanagement that is uncovered during audits, particularly inlight of the savings and loan debacle.   In the past, auditors have argued that making them policecorporate behavior would harm their relationships withclients and saddle them with an unfair burden ofresponsibility for the acts of others.   Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who has sought to requireaccountants to report wrong behaviors for several years,asserts that the stiffer rules would &quot;give us a chance topick up more problems at the earliest possible stage.&quot;   Under existing requirements, when an auditor uncoverspossible illegal acts on the part of a client, he is expectedto inform the corporate audit committee and directors, andassess whether proper corrective steps have been taken; ifnot, the auditor resigns the account, which triggers anotification to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under the latest proposal, a company that received aletter from an auditor, expressing concern about failure totake proper steps, would have to notify the SEC of thedispute. If the company failed to do so, the auditor wouldhave to furnish the SEC a copy of its report. The auditorwould continue to have the option of resigning.   The accounting institute this week notified Rep. JohnDingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy andCommerce committee, that it supports proposed changes to theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. The legislation could beattached to other pending legislation as early as next week.   In a letter to Rep. Dingell, accounting instituteofficials said the proposed changes would &quot;improve investorconfidence in the integrity and reliability of financialstatements issued by those who access public capitalmarkets.&quot; The proposal also has the support of the six majoraccounting firms.   Critics have asserted the current rules don't requireprompt enough disclosure of potential problems uncoveredduring independent audits. In the latest proposal, if anauditor writes a letter questioning whether appropriateaction has been taken, the company would have one day toreport receipt of such a letter; if the company failed to doso, the auditor would have to notify the SEC on the followingbusiness day.   The changes include a new requirement that companies intheir annual reports discuss whether any &quot;materialweaknesses&quot; have been identified and remain uncorrected intheir system of internal controls.   Though previous proposals required auditors to addresscompliance with all laws and regulations, the latest changesrequire them to report on potentially illegal acts that havea material effect on a company's financial statement, whichaccountants say they already do.   Separately, the proposal requires all publicly held banksand thrifts to report to the SEC; current rules permit banksand thrifts that aren't part of holding companies to reportto financial regulators rather than the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
