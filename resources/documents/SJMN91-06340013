President Bush signed legislation Wednesdayenlarging for some states the unemployment benefits that were expanded justlast month. The additional measure was worked out by Congress andcongressional leaders after several senators protested that their states weregetting short-shrift in the main unemployment benefits bill that became lawNov. 15.;   The earlier unemployment bill Bush approved was a $5.3 billionpackage to give further jobless benefits to people who have used up the 26weeks they were allowed under the old law. The bill he signed Wednesdayimproves on that to give all eligible people 13 extra weeks, instead of onlysix weeks that would have been extended to those in 23 states.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MORE JOBLESS NOW ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Washington News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  134  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 5, 199100340013,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
