More than 15,000 Americans lost a total of $450 million in the past five years in bogus money-making schemes promoted by religious charlatans, according to a report to be released today by the North American Securities Administrators Association and the Council of Better Business Bureaus.    &quot;Religiously oriented swindles are one of today's hottest tickets for investment con artists,&quot; said John C. Baldwin, president of the securities administrators' group and director of the Utah Division of Securities.    There has been an &quot;alarming increase&quot; in complaints about self-proclaimed &quot;born-again&quot; financial planners, con artists claiming to be endorsed by local and national church officials, and givers of &quot;divinely inspired&quot; investment advice, he said.    Victims of the scams include worshipers of all persuasions. Lutheran ministers, members of Baptist, Jewish, Mormon and Greek Orthodox congregations, as well as black churchgoers and Hispanic Catholic parishioners, have all fallen prey.    In one example cited in the report, more than 600 investors in 20 states entrusted $10 million to a former Sunday school teacher at a large Baptist church in Los Angeles. The report said the man, Roy L. Comstock, who is serving a four-year prison sentence for securities law violations, promised a &quot;no-risk&quot; 36% annual return on U.S. Treasury bill investments.    Instead, millions of investor dollars were diverted into a phony &quot;suitcase bank&quot; in the Marshall Islands as part of a scheme in which the initial investors were paid off with money raised from new investors, the report said. It added that investigators found that many of the victims were fundamentalist Christians who believed they were dealing &quot;with a man blessed by God with extraordinary business abilities.&quot;    William McDonald, director of securities enforcement for the California Department of Corporations, said in an interview that the tightly knit structure of many religious groups is a perfect environment for con artists. The con artist joins a church or temple and &quot;establishes a position of trust&quot; that leads members to drop their normal skepticism. Sometimes, Mr. McDonald said, the con artist recruits an &quot;opinion leader&quot; in the group and gives that person shares or commissions to persuade others to invest. Even when the fraud is discovered, he said, many members of the group refuse to believe it.    Another factor contributing to the vulnerability of religious groups is the growing number of religiously oriented publications, radio stations and cable-TV outlets, said Mr. Baldwin of the securities administrators' association. These specialized media make it easy for con artists to target the faithful, he said.    The report mentions a Washington state promoter who sold $56 million of real estate securities by advertising on Christian radio stations. When the promoter's company collapsed, the report said, 7,000 investors were left holding $50 million in defaulted notes. In another case cited in the report, nearly 200 investors gave an estimated $18 million to an Alabama church treasurer who promised to pool the funds in stock-market investments with returns of 8% to 30% a month. &quot;It was sort of comforting to see a Bible verse printed at the end of the monthly statements,&quot; said an investor quoted in the report.    Carl Salle, securities investigator for the Alabama Securities Commission, said the former church treasurer, Stephen Streit, is now serving two consecutive 10-year prison sentences. Mr. Streit generated phony monthly statements on his home computer showing spectacular returns for investors, Mr. Salle said. But he placed the real money in certificates of deposit and bought a new home, cars and jewelry and traveled extensively, Mr. Salle said.    Altogether, the new report cites about a dozen scams from as many states. But state securities regulators said they think these are only the tip of the iceberg.    Separately, the Idaho Department of Finance recently filed a civil lawsuit against Lawrence W. McGary and his Shama Resources Limited Partnership in Sun Valley, Idaho, charging fraud and misrepresentation in the sale of $4 million of partnership interests. State securities regulators said Mr. McGary sold partnership interests and promissory notes to members of a fundamentalist church to which he belonged.    Mr. McGary's prospectus describing the partnership's gold-mining and oil-and-gas drilling plans is filled with Biblical quotations and references to divine inspiration. &quot;As we acquired this block, we believe we were led by the Holy Spirit,&quot; it said of one piece of property. Referring to an oil-and-gas plan, the prospectus said, &quot;God is leading us to move ahead in this very area when no one else is interested.&quot;    In February, Mr. McGary and Shama filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law. &quot;If God told him where to drill, God must be either wrong or bankrupt,&quot; said Wayne Klein, chief of the Idaho finance department's securities bureau.    C.P. Hoover, a 60-year-old Challis, Idaho, geologist, who said he loaned $250,000 to the partnership, said in an interview he became involved in the partnership because of Mr. McGary's church membership. &quot;He was a Christian businessman,&quot; Mr. Hoover said.    Blair Clark, an attorney for Mr. McGary, said he had no comment on the Idaho finance department's charges because the litigation is pending, and &quot;it's in a settlement posture.&quot;    Securities regulators recommend that members of religious communities take steps to protect themselves from investment swindles. Among the precautions they suggest:    --Be wary of investments that seem closely tied to a particular religious belief. It makes little sense that an investment opportunity would be available only to members of a specific church or faith. &quot;If you are approached by a self-proclaimed 'Christian' financial planner, hold him or her to the same standards you would apply to anyone offering investment advice,&quot; said Mr. Baldwin of the North American Securities Administrators Association.    --Be cautious if the promoter of an investment opportunity tries to capitalize on connections or a leadership position within a religious group.    --Be on your guard for a new member of your church who springs up out of nowhere with a &quot;sure-fire&quot; investment scheme.    --Look closely at investments promoted by fellow church members. &quot;One of the con artist's most persuasive tools will be the testimony of your friends and fellow believers,&quot; said Scott Stapf, director of investor education for the securities administrators' association.    --Ignore claims that religiously based investments are unregulated. &quot;Virtually all investment opportunities, including church bonds, come under the scope of state and federal securities or commodities laws,&quot; said Mr. Stapf. </TEXT></DOC>
