Then it went on a spendingspree fed by junk bonds and ended up owning many major U.S.department store chains.   Today, Campeau can't pay debts and has been forced to put itsprized Bloomingdale's on the block.   Ten years ago, the federal deficit stood at $663.6 billion, andmany thought it a disgrace the nation was living beyond its means.Then the deficit ballooned out of control during the Reagan years,quadrupling to $2.8 trillion today.   About 200,000 Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979.By last year the figure topped 540,000 after a credit-card bingethat led one bank to issue plastic to children.   The 1980s was the decade of debt. Junk bonds, gold cards,leveraged buyouts, deficit spending _ all became standards of theage as companies, consumers and the government loaded up withborrowed money as never before.   ``This certainly will be the decade that America exploded indebt,'' said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for the economicconsulting firm DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.   ``Leverage is a word that may be forever linked with the1980s,'' added John Lonski, senior economist with Moody's InvestorsService Inc.   Corporate debt nearly tripled, from $774 billion at the start of1980 to more than $2 trillion as the decade closed.   Much of that is due to a takeover and buyout frenzy thatreshaped corporate America and left many industrial titansteetering atop mountains of IOUs.   High-risk, high-yield securities, labeled ``junk'' bonds,ushered in the dominance of debt as a way for corporations to raisecash, pushing the old standby of stock offerings into thebackground.   Junk bonds made possible such megadeals as the record $25billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. They also led to thedownfall of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its chief junk-bondtrader, Michael Milken.   Debt in the 1980s also became a way for corporations to avoidthe clutches of takeover artists. By loading themselves up withdebt obligations through selling bonds, companies made themselvesless appealing targets and made their shareholders happy withspecial dividends.   While Milken and other dealmakers praised the power of debt tosqueeze efficiency out of bloated old-line corporations, the debtbinge inspired doomsday scenarios in the minds of others.   Some economists predict that corporate America will be deeplyscarred by a recession. A wave of bankruptcies, plant closings andlayoffs could be the price of the all the borrowing, they warn,when leaner economic times make it difficult to pay bondholders.   But others, such as Brinner, are less pessimistic, and say onlythe most highly leveraged companies would collapse.   Many economists say the broader question about the nation's debtbinge is whether the borrowed money was wisely spent.   When it was used to improve plants and machinery, to introducenew products and to build bridges, schools and highways, it was agood investment. But when it was used by corporate financiers to``churn'' money by taking companies private, selling parts of themand then going public again, there was little or no benefit to theeconomy, these economists argue.   Brinner said he is particularly troubled by the federal deficit,which he calls ``a disease that is going to weaken us for years.''   The federal debt ``is going to reduce our standard of living byabout a quarter of a percent a year,'' Brinner said. ``We borrowedthis money not to finance expansion but to finance consumption.''   Household debt mushroomed from $1.31 trillion at the start ofthe decade to about $3.27 trillion as of this June, according toMoody's. About two-thirds of that debt represents mortgages, whilethe rest is credit-card and other personal borrowing.   While junk bonds and leveraged buyouts stole the spotlight,banks and financial houses learned new tricks with other forms ofdebt during the 1980s, such as repackaging loan and credit-cardportfolios into bonds that were sold to the public.   The decade also saw the explosive growth of mortgage-backedbonds from Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, threegovernment-created entities that buy mortgages from savings andloans and repackage them as bonds. Wall Street firms earned hugeprofits dealing in these issues.   As the '80s came to a close there were signs that the nationalborrowing binge was losing steam.   Credit-card spending by consumers appeared to slow as it lostits tax-deductibility under the 1986 tax code revision. Federaldeficit spending was reined in by the Gramm-Rudman law. Thejunk-bond market skidded as some of the LBOs of the 1980s becameunglued.   But the years of deficit spending will take many more years tobe paid off _ if they ever are. Some say the United States alreadyis paying for its live-for-today attitude, which has been blamedfor a dearth of research and development investment and a declinein the nation's technological edge.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
