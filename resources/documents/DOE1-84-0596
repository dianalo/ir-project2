In 1986, Australian coal exportstotaled an estimated 5.3 billion Australian dollars, about 15 percentof all Australian exports, and approximately 2 percent of the gross domesticproduct. The value of these coal exports exceeded the value of the country'swool, wheat, iron ore or beef exports. Australia is the world's largestcoal exporting country--exporting 92 million tons in 1986, or 33 percentof world seaborne-traded coal. This compares to 76 million tons exportedby the United States, 45 million tons by South Africa, and 26 milliontons by Canada. The question now facing all Australian coal producersis whether we can maintain, and hopefully increase, this market sharein an increasingly competitive market. I believe we can--but it willnot be an easy task and will require a concerted and coordinated efforton behalf of the country's coal producers, labor unions, and government.</TEXT></DOC>
