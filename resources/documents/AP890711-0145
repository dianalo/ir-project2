The bill, apparently the first of its kind in the nation, hadfaced an unfriendly reception in Congress, which has the power toreview and reject any law passed by the council.   Councilmember Wilhelmina Rolark said she was withdrawing the billbecause court cases in which plaintiffs are suing handgunmanufacturers have not yet been resolved.   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent critic of the districtgovernment, had threatened to block the legislation. He likened thebill to an attempt ``to hold Black and Decker responsible for `TheTexas Chainsaw Massacre.'''   Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., told the council in a letterdelivered on Monday that the bill was likely to be rejected by theHouse.   ``There were simply not the votes to support the bill,'' saidcouncilmember Charlene Drew-Jarvis. ``It could cause problems ... onthe Hill.''   ``The council's action shows enlightened foresight,'' Parris saidin a statement released after the bill was pulled back.   Richard Gardner, state and local affairs director of the NationalRifle Association, had contended the bill was unconstitutional. Hesaid it would limit interstate commerce, a regulatory right reservedfor the federal government.   The bill, given preliminary approval by an 8-4 vote two weeksago, was created in an attempt to stem a drug-related wave ofmurders and other violent crime.   Through Tuesday, 229 persons had been killed in Washington in1989, compared with 159 by the same time last year. In 1988, arecord 372 persons were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
