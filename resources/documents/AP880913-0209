A U.S. Air Force C-130 plane with international and U.S.officials aboard went to Jamaica to set up a satellitecommunication system to coordinate help in the giant hurricane'saftermath.   ``This hurricane from what I can gather is about the worst inits (Jamaica's) history,'' said Percival R. Todd, Jamaica's deputyconsul-general in Miami. ``It just souped up over the entirety ofJamaica. There's no place on the island that escaped.''   Gilbert missed most of Florida, bringing strong winds, rainsqualls and tides 1 to 2 feet above normal to the Florida Keys. Butofficials of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, a British colony, werepreparing to hear the worst.   ``We experienced Hurricane Charlie, so we're accustomed tosavage attacks by tropical storms,'' Todd said. Charlie was thelast major hurricane to strike the island directly, claiming 111lives in 1951, he said.   Serious flooding had already swamped the Cayman Islands byTuesday afternoon, and officials there expected heavy damage, saidErina Nichols, a spokeswoman for the Cayman Island Department ofTourism in Miami.   Nichols said a relief center for the Caymans was acceptingdonations in Miami, and three centers in Dade County werecollecting food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaicans lefthomeless or injured by the hurricane.   Three Air Jamaica planes full of supplies were ready to fly fromMiami International Airport to Jamaica once an airport there wasconfirmed to be safe, said Rupert Williams, commander of the St.John Ambulance Brigade of Jamaica's Army Medical Corps.   ``With 150 mph winds lasting 10 hours over Jamaica, it has to beserious,'' Williams said. The relief effort was being coordinatedby the Jamaican Consulate and Metro-Dade County, Kingston's``sister city,'' he said.   Both of Jamaica's major airports were reported to be seriouslydamaged, but the Air Force plane was able to land. Aboard was ateam of U.S. State Department disaster specialists, Metro-Dade FireRescue communications experts, Pan-American Health Organizationofficials and Jamaica's Miami Consul-General Marie Wray.   In Broward County, Ingrid Brice said the Jamaican community wasresponding to pleas for help with promises of food and clothing,and volunteers including nurses and doctors.   ``It's been overwhelming,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
