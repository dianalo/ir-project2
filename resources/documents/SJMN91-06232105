And listen, that Montmartre stuff is alla myth anyway. Those people were too busy complaining about their problemswith their agents to talk philosophy. Pass me the sugar. Thanks.;    &quot;Oh, comeon now,&quot; former newsman and mystery writer Bob Irvine replied. &quot;We discussedDostoevski last week.&quot;;    This being Carmel, this is not your everydaycoffee-break crew. Campbell and Irvine, both refugees from Hollywood andMalibu, have a few dozen books and screenplays and awards between them.;    Acartoonist named William Bates is a regular, and artist Keith Lindberg, whosework hangs in the home of former President Gerald Ford, among others, is oftenthere. There are movie critics and actors who drop in more than occasionally.And a local photographer who seems to know everything and everyone in Carmeldrops whatever he is doing at 2:30 p.m. sharp and rushes over to his coffeeand his friends.;    The clan's members meet regularly and bring back storiesof the latest cookbook they illustrated, the latest quarrel with an editor,the latest idea for a new script. They guffaw over neighbor Clint Eastwood'slatest moves and debate local issues and dispute politics with an intensitynot usually seen in this region of the retired and relaxed.;    They havebecome an institution at the 40-year-old coffee shop across the street fromthe Carmel Art Association, and they make up a tight-knit group of sincerefriends in a town where life usually runs more on whom you know than onwhether you like them.;    In deference to the schisms of artistic cliquespast, they have their rifts. But in Carmel, the great divide is not betweenthe expressionists and the cubists or between adherents of Beckett vs. Joyce.They split over something much more 1990s -- smoking.;    Which explains whythe oil painters and watercolorists and Carmel Art Association types who arewell-established members of the group have recently taken to a table away fromthe customary corner. Though the thing that really drives the painters awaymay be the incessant writer-talk of word processors and modems and quietprinters (&quot;Really? Oh, I have got to get that, my daisy wheel is driving mecrazy. Hey, has your agent seen the new version yet?&quot;);    While theconversation often runs more to new styles of Nike than to new styles in art,they tell their tales with the flair of artists -- and the ease of old friendswho have succeeded and left the frenzied, competitive lives of places such asHollywood and New York behind.;    &quot;We really do sit and talk about writing,though,&quot; Campbell said, trying to catch a waiter's attention for another cupon a recent afternoon. &quot;We wouldn't dare back in Hollywood. Someone mightsteal your stuff. Here, well, Bob here could be writing a hell of a story, butit's personal; I mean, who's gonna take it from you?&quot;;    &quot;It's unusual,&quot; saidAdele Langendorf, a Carmel writer trying her hand at her first mystery.&quot;What's neat about it is anybody in the group will kill for anybody else inthe group. There's a tremendous amount of loyalty. You just don't find thateverywhere.&quot;;    Loyalty is a prized thing to writers and artists of thecutthroat Hollywood school. So is looking forward to the camaraderie of thecoffee break, which keeps the friends going through the long mornings ofcreating. Not to mention that driving the waiters crazy with one coffee in twohours is part of the fun.;    Besides, one of the friends is always ready tosupply a favorable quotation for the jacket of another's latest book, or tospread the word about an exhibition or a performance (even by the ones whosmoke). What are friends for anyway?  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ESTHER SCHRADER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910819  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  911  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 19, 199100232105,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
