(fourth and fifth generation programminglanguages) (object-oriented development systems)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Finkelstein, Richard.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Some people think the era of the fifth-generation programminglanguages (5GLs) has begun and that object-oriented programming(language) systems (OOPS) are part of that era.andP;  But it isdifficult to discuss 5GLs when fourth-generation programminglanguages (4GLs) and third-generation programming languages (3GLs)cannot be defined.andP;  4GLs packet often used procedures and can beeffective when used in conjunction with 3GLs.andP;  OOPS have a levelof functionality and flexibility missing from previous programminglanguages and should not be compared with any 4GLs.andP;  OOPS workwell with relational DBMSs and Structured Query Language (SQL).andO;The combination of relational DBMSs, SQL and OOPS provides anopportunity to advance data processing theory and createsopportunities in database management.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fourth-Generation LanguagesFifth GenerationObject-Oriented Data BasesProgramming LanguagesData BasesProgrammingObject-Oriented LanguagesStructured Query LanguageRelational DBMS.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
