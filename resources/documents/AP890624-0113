The government banned the sale of the slippers and seized unsoldstocks on Friday, the same day angry Moslems attacked shops owned bythe manufacturer, the Canadian-based Beta Shoe Co.   Some Moslems consider the rubber slippers offensive to Islambecause they bear a logo resembling the Arabic characters for Allah.   Clashes with police Friday in Dhaka and Mymensigh, a town 70miles to the north, left at least 30 people injured, police said oncondition of anonymity.   On Saturday, riot police guarded the 10 shops owned by Beta andabout 2,000 protesters called for a worldwide boycott of theCanadian company. Riot police were stationed at strategic points ofthe city but no clashes were reported.   Islam is the state religion of Bangladesh, and 90 percent of thecountry's 110 million people are Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
