Tiempo, a Waco-based weekly, published an article Thursdayalleging that Ms. Richards referred to illegal aliens as``wetbacks'' in a speech text written during her successfulcampaign for Travis County commissioner in 1976.   Ms. Richards, whose no-holds-barred oratory drew wide attentionat the Democratic National Convention in 1988, denied using theterm.   ``Mattox has always got other people to do his dirty work whenhe could,'' Ms. Richards told The Associated Press.   Mattox' press secretary, Kelly Fero, denied that the campaignhad any connection with the article.   ``We did not plant this story with anybody. We know nothingabout this story. And that's all we have to say about it,'' Ferosaid.   Recent polls have shown Ms. Richards leading the Democraticprimary field and Mattox running third behind former Gov. MarkWhite in the race to the March 13 primary election. Mattox and Ms.Richards, however, have run a particularly heated campaign againsteach other.   Republican Gov. Bill Clements isn't seeking a another term.   Ernesto Fraga, publisher and author of the article, said hepersonally supports Mattox but that had nothing to do with thestory.   ``If any other candidate had written something like this, Iwould have printed it,'' Fraga said.   Fraga made available to the AP a facsimile copy of the two-page,handwritten speech text on which he based his article, but declinedto say how he had obtained it. Above the text is what appears to beMs. Richards' letterhead.   A sentence in the text said: ``If it takes a man to hirenon-union labor, cross picket lines and work wetbacks then I saythank God for a woman or anyone else who is willing to take over.''   Shown a copy of the Tiempo story and the paper's reproduction oftwo sentences from the handwritten text, Ms. Richards said that theopening sentence of the text was her handwriting, but the sentencecontaining the word ``wetbacks'' wasn't.   ``I can't tell you any more than what you can see here, thatthere are obviously two handwritings and that Jim Mattox'ssupporters put that out,'' Ms. Richards said.   Ms. Richards came under similar criticism after a debate inHouston earlier this month, when she was heard by some to say, ``Nolegislator, no judge and no bureaucrat has any business indetermining whether a white woman has an abortion or not.''   Ms. Richards has insisted she was misunderstood, that she said``why a woman'' rather than ``white woman.''</TEXT></DOC>
