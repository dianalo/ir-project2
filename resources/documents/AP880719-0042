Less impressive were temperatures that soared high into the 90seach day. ``Outside is utter hell,'' he said. ``Hot and humid _ Wedon't have that in Lesotho,'' he said.   Pholo is one of more than 300 foreigners from nearly 100countries to visit the convention as guests of the NationalDemocratic Institute, a government-funded organization affiliatedwith the Democratic Party. Money for the trip was raised privately,however.   ``It is a rare opportunity for a Chinese to see your system,''said Zhu Hongqian, a researcher at the Institute of AmericanStudies in Beijing.   Like others in this city for the hoopla, the foreigners weredisappointed they were unable to visit the convention floor becausespace was so tight. Instead, most watched the proceedings ontelevision.   Nonetheless, they managed to get caught up in the excitement ofthe moment.   ``There is an air of confidence (among the Democrats) that wasnoticeably absent at the last two conventions,'' said Bill Walker,a Conservative member of the British Parliament from Blairgowrie,Scotland. Walker, a fan of the United States, said 1988 is hisfourth Democratic convention.   Even so, he predicted Republican George Bush would win theelection. ``They still have problems,'' he said of the Democrats.   David Steel, who is retiring as head of Britain's Liberal Party,disagreed. ``I am impressed compared to four years ago,'' he said.``They have gotten their act together.''   Steel was also impressed with the ``zap behind Jesse Jackson'scampaign.'' The issues that Jackson addresses are legitimate, hesaid.   Raquel Cerezo, the wife of Guatemala's president, VinicioCerezo, had the same impression. ``It seems like we have commonproblems,'' she said. ``Child-care problems, housing problems,health problems.''   But Mrs. Cerezo acknowledged that democracy as an institution isnot as healthy in Guatemala as in the United States.   Generally, the international guests were eager to talk about thepros and cons of the democratic process, but Vitaly Churkin of theinternational department of the Communist Party in Moscow wasclose-lipped.   ``I'm sorry, I really can't talk with reporters,'' he said.   Pholo said he was a less than impartial observer because ofconcern about Democrats' supporting a platform that calls for tougheconomic sanctions against South Africa.   Pholo, principal secretary to Lesotho's cabinet, said hiscountry is ``totally engulfed by South Africa'' so sanctionsagainst the Pretoria regime would ``have a very deleterious effecton us.''   J. Brian Atwood, the institute's president, said the group's aimwas to give leaders from abroad ``an in-depth exposure to thepolitical system,'' and allow them a preview of what a Democraticforeign policy might look like.   Human rights would play a much larger role in policy ifMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis wins in November, he said.   The foreign guests have received briefings from well-knownDemocrats like former Vice President Walter Mondale, theinstitute's chairman, and Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and touredAtlanta's landmarks, particularly those connected with the civilrights movement.   They've also been wined and dined; one party for Africans andFrenchmen was hosted by businessman Maurice Tempelsman, a some-timeescort of Jacqueline Kennedy with mining interests in Zaire.</TEXT></DOC>
