On that day, the government starts taxing the interest on previously tax-free savings deposits, eliminating one of Japan's biggest incentives to save. Every banker, stock broker, insurance salesman and postal savings official hopes the money will flow out of the savings accounts and come to them in search of higher returns.    In the long run, the new tax conditions could change how and where the Japanese stash their nest eggs, economists say. That, in turn, could have a major impact on the fortunes of some of the world's largest financial institutions, which are pitching for a share of the investments.    Nonetheless, Japanese savers don't appear ready to become big spenders or shift large sums soon. As manager of her family's finances, Mineko Ishibashi, a 49-year-old Tokyo housewife, has invested some money in blue-chip stocks but says she doesn't plan to increase her portfolio. Instead, she started putting savings into variable life-insurance policies two years ago. &quot;I wanted a higher return,&quot; says Mrs. Ishibashi. Despite the new tax, she will keep her bank and postal savings accounts.    While speculation that the money will flood into the stock market is already buoying share prices, most analysts believe the flow into equities will be constrained. But if only a fraction of it trickles in, that is still a lot. Equities are popular because capital gains are largely tax free, and while dividends are taxed, they are miniscule. Equities will be the &quot;only untaxed game in town,&quot; says William Sterling, an economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in Tokyo.    The tax-exempt programs have helped the Japanese become one of the world's biggest savers; they stashed away 16% of their disposable income in 1986, compared to 4% for the U.S. That hoard provides funds for domestic expansion and contributes to the strong yen that has allowed Japanese corporations to buy foreign assets at bargain-basement prices.    When it voted last September to abolish the tax-exempt accounts, Japan's parliament was reacting to a growing imbalance between corporate and individual tax burdens, rampant abuse of the accounts, and U.S. pressure on the Japanese to stimulate domestic demand. Another motive, say Japanese bankers, was to put the commercial banks on a more equal footing with the powerful postal-savings system.    The tax-exempt pie is huge. Japanese investors had about 294 trillion yen ($2.31 trillion) parked in tax-free savings schemes as of March 31, 1987, according to Nomura Research Institute, a unit of Nomura Securities Co. That includes 164 trillion yen in so-called maruyu accounts in private commercial and regional banks, 110 trillion yen in Postal Savings System deposits, nine trillion yen in special accounts for the purchase of Japanese government bonds and 11 trillion yen in special employee payroll-deduction plans. Individuals can have a total of 14 million yen ($110,000) spread among the tax-free accounts.    To evade that limit, savers often opened multiple illicit accounts under false names. One investment banker admits to having them in the names of his wife, daughter, son and even deceased grandfather. Tax authorities turned a blind eye -- partly, contend analysts, because politicians used the accounts to hide campaign funds.    As of April 1, all interest income will be taxed at 20%. Exemptions include single mothers, the handicapped and those over 65 years old. Other exceptions include funds set aside for housing and pensions.    Though the tax will discourage it, that doesn't mean the Japanese, who like to plan for education and retirement, will stop saving. But just about every financial institution is gearing up for the change by holding investment seminars, pitching consulting services by phone, and peddling pamphlets door to door. (Foreign banks and brokerages aren't; they haven't pursued retail business.)    Some Japanese already have switched, but many savers are waiting until their time deposits or government bond funds mature. &quot;The new tax will put everyone on an equal footing, so there is no need for a major shift in funds,&quot; says Haruhiko Kato, a deputy director in the Ministry of Finance's taxation bureau. Susumu Taketomi, a senior financial economist at Industrial Bank of Japan, adds that large sudden shifts of funds would be unhealthy for the Japanese financial system.    &quot;No one knows how much money will move. But everyone will be fighting for a chunk of the business,&quot; says Shunichi Tokuda, chief manager of Mitsubishi Bank's individual-banking division. Commercial banks, say analysts, have the most to lose. Their demand deposits yield only 0.26% and six-month accounts 2.64%. To hold on to accounts, the banks are urging customers to consolidate them for efficiency.    The postal savings system, which currently pays 2.26% on a six-month account, could also be on the defensive, particularly because it can't make loans. Even so, a national network of 20,000 postal branches offers convenience; postal accounts have government backing; and for giving up tax-exempt accounts the system won the right to sell government bonds.    Other competitors include the trust banks and long-term credit banks, both of which market debentures with maturities of as many as five years. Meanwhile, life insurance companies are attracting savers with policies that generally yield more than trust-bank products. The instruments are so popular that the Ministry of Finance reportedly advised the companies to tone down their sales pitches.    Meanwhile, brokers are telling investors that no savings account can compete with the allures of the stock market. &quot;When postal savings accounts paid 8%, you could double your money in 10 years,&quot; says Hirao Matsuki, general manager of the market planning and sales promotion department at Nomura Securities Co. &quot;But at current rates, it will take 22 1/2 years -- unless you invest in stocks.&quot;    Individuals have played a bigger role in the Tokyo stock market in the past year. And despite the October crash, investors have been reassured by the Japanese economy's strength. Brokers, meanwhile, are suggesting that maruyu money will add a burst of energy in April.    But analysts believe it will prove difficult to pry Japan's conservative savers away from the maruyu game. They note, for example, that the tax law won't stop people from transferring money to tax-free accounts in their grandparents' names.    A Posts and Telecommunications Ministry official says he hasn't any idea how many postal savings account holders are over 65, and there aren't any plans to check. &quot;It's rude to ask a woman how old she is,&quot; the official says.    ---   Michael R.
