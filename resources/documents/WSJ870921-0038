Dederick, executive vice president at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said.    Mr. Dederick said the question isn't whether rates will rise, but when. He expects long-term Treasury bond yields, now about 9 1/2%, to climb to about 10% by year end. &quot;This is an inflation-prone economy,&quot; he said.    The Fed's policy-making arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, meets about eight times a year to review credit strategy. The committee consists of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board and five of the 12 presidents of Fed district banks. Because there is one vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board, there will be 11 members at tomorrow's meeting.    Fed officials, as usual, declined to speculate on what, if any, changes might be made.    The Federal Reserve Board this month approved a discount-rate increase to 6% from 5 1/2% to try to prop up the dollar. That was the first rise in the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions since April 1984.    &quot;The Fed already has raised its flag once, and it isn't going to raise it again anytime soon,&quot; Mr. Dederick, a former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said. &quot;I think they would be justly criticized as doing too much too soon if they did anything further right now.&quot;    The economy's moderate growth and the dollar's recent stability in the currency markets argue against any immediate policy changes by the Fed, analysts say. Another reason some favor no change is the slow growth of the nation's money supply in recent months.    Although some analysts fear that further rises in borrowing costs could undermine the economic expansion, most agree that the economy still seems to be in excellent shape.    &quot;The interest-rate outlook really depends on the dollar outlook,&quot; Mr. Hudson of Morgan Guaranty said. &quot;My gut feeling is the dollar will go down some more -- and it needs to go down some more to correct our trade deficit.&quot;    Some Fed officials say privately they wouldn't be alarmed by further declines in the dollar as long as the declines are gradual. But they are eager to prevent a precipitous drop in the dollar, fearing that would intensify investor concerns about inflation and frighten away foreign investors from the U.S. bond market.    Foreign investors have purchased huge amounts of U.S. Treasury securities in recent years, helping the government to finance its budget deficits and keeping interest rates lower than they otherwise would be. If the flow of foreign money dries up, analysts fear even further declines in the depressed U.S. bond market.    A few analysts argue that the Fed should administer stronger medicine to help the dollar.    &quot;I think another discount-rate increase would give the Fed more influence over the foreign exchange market and prevent speculation against the dollar,&quot; said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president of Eickhoff Economics Inc., an economic consulting firm in New York and Washington. She says the Fed should raise the rate to 6 1/2% and possibly even 7%. Such a move could help ease fears of inflation and lead to declines in bond yields, she said.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Most interest rates wound up little changed in quiet activity, a sharp contrast to the frenetic activity earlier in the week.    The latest 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late Friday at a price of 93 1/4 to yield 9.56%. That compared with 93 11/32 late Thursday, with a yield of 9.55%.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell slightly to 95 4/32 from 95 11/32, while the yield rose to 9.39% from 9.36%. An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 1.97 to 1189.70. It ranged between 1185.85 and 1191.42. But corporate bond prices posted strong gains.    Among short-term rates, the federal funds rate averaged 7.04%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc., compared with 7.09% Thursday and an average of 7.21% in the week ended Wednesday.    The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, is watched closely by economists and bond traders because it influences many other borrowing costs. It also often provides early clues to changes in Fed policy.    The latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose to 6.43% bid Friday from 6.37% Thursday. The latest six-month bill rate increased to 6.69% bid from 6.64%, while one-year bills were quoted at 7.08% bid, compared with 7.06%.    Although a huge volume of U.S. Treasury borrowing tentatively is scheduled to be sold this week, a Treasury spokesman said the sales will have to be postponed unless Congress quickly provides assurances that it will increase the nation's borrowing limit.    In addition to today's regular weekly sale of $12.8 billion of new short-term bills, the Treasury has announced tentative plans to sell $9.25 billion of new two-year notes tomorrow. The government also is slated to auction $7.25 billion of four-year notes Wednesday and $6.75 billion of seven-year notes Thursday.    &quot;It's all up in the air&quot; because of uncertainty about when Congress will increase the debt ceiling, the Treasury spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
