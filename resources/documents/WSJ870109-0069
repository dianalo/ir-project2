And an unusual condition in the mortgage markets may indicate somewhat higher rates in the weeks ahead.    Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.37% interest rate on 30-year conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. This was marginally up from the 9.30% rate for the week ended Dec. 26 but substantially lower than the 10.8% rate a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Michael Lea, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said the interest-rate spread between yields on the primary and secondary mortgage markets has been shrinking lately and that the relationship flip-flopped last week. The secondary market refers to the purchase and sale of existing mortgages, mostly by government agencies. Freddie Mac, for example, buys mortgages from lenders, packages them into securities and sells them to investors.    Rates on conventional mortgages normally are about 30 basis points above rates in the secondary market, Mr. Lea said. The spread reflects certain service charges that mortgage bankers and thrift institutions apply to home loans.    But last week, secondary rates were slightly higher than primary rates. For example, Freddie Mac's 30-day required yield on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.39%, two basis points above the U.S. average rate of 9.37%. A basis point is one 1/100th of a percentage point.    &quot;I'm a bit puzzled,&quot; Mr. Lea said. &quot;I expect it's a timing phenomenon.&quot; He said he expected the two rates to reestablish their normal relationship soon,&quot; resulting in somewhat higher mortgage interest rates.&quot;    A separate monthly survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board showed mortgage rates continued falling late last year. The Bank Board said the average rate on all loans closed by major lenders fell to 9.68% in early December from 9.86% a month earlier. A year earlier, the rate was 11.08%. Last December's figure was the lowest in more than eight years.    The report put the average effective interest rate for commitments on fixed-rate mortgages in early December at 10.01%, down from 10.31% in early November and 12.01% in December 1985. The fixed-rate figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 15 years or more.    On the most popular form of adjustable-rate home loans -- those that limit rate increases -- lenders were asking 8.79% on average in December. This compares with 8.90% in November and 10.39% a year earlier. The average for adjustable-rate mortgages without rate limits dropped to 8.43% last month from 8.53% in November and 10.07% in December 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
