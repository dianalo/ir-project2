Attitudes toward immigrants, which historically have not beenwelcoming, have remained unchanged in spite of two years ofunprecedented attention during the government's amnesty andemployer sanction programs, the Times said.   Experts, government officials and immigrant advocates said theywere disappointed that immigration reforms haven't altered thesituation.   ``A lot of our old prejudices are still at work,'' said MauriceA. Roberts, editor of Interpreter Releases, a Washington-basednational immigration journal.   Despite extensive publicity about the 1986 immigration reformlaw, a large part of the population is not aware of thegovernment's efforts, according to the Times Poll. But among thosefamiliar with the changes, the public generally approves thelegalization of about 2 million immigrants while giving low marksto the early effectiveness of employer sanctions.   The Times Poll was conducted four months after the one-yearlegalization program ended and two months after the federalImmigration and Naturalization Service began full enforcement ofsanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.   The poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, was conducted by a nationwidetelephone survey of 1,418 respondents last weekend. The margin oferror was plus or minus 4 percentage points.   Figures don't add up to 100 percent because the poll excludedthose who didn't have a clear opinion.   Asked if immigrants get more from the U.S economy through socialservices and unemployment benefits or contribute more through taxesand work, 64 percent said that immigrants take more than they give.Only 19 percent said immigrants contributed more, while fourpercent said immigrants benefitted and contributed equally to theeconomy.   Asked if immigrants have made a contribution in the last decadeto American culture, 46 percent said they haven't, while 40 percentsaid immigrants have enriched the culture.   Most experts and officials said the poll results were notunexpected. They say it is reflective of anti-immigrant opinions ina country of immigrants.   ``The fact is that the country tends to have unwelcomingattitudes, but at the same time they're ambivalent because of theirown immigrant backgrounds,'' said Charles Kamasaki of the NationalCouncil of La Raza, a Washington-based Hispanic rights organization.</TEXT></DOC>
