Just ask First Boston Corp. On Friday, the investment banking firm pulled a $475 million junk bond offering for Ohio Mattress Co. after it became clear that investors were shunning the high-yield, high-risk bonds.    &quot;There's a substantial degree of uncertainty in the market that is causing a number of people to stay away&quot; from some junk bond offerings, said Robert Long, a First Boston managing director. &quot;The market has a narrow focus right now.&quot; He said the firm will probably restructure the deal and offer the bonds &quot;when market conditions&quot; improve.    The withdrawal underscores how skittish junk bond investors have become in recent months. Ever since the possibility of a recession became more real to many economists and investors, portfolio managers have sifted very skeptically through new junk bond offerings.    While there has been strong demand for some recent junk bond issues -- Sealed Air Corp.'s $170 million 12 5/8% senior subordinated note issue was oversubscribed -- others have been hard sells. Junk bonds are often issued to finance costly restructurings or leveraged buy-outs, which makes them riskier than investment-grade bonds. Investors worry that an economic downturn would make it difficult for highly leveraged companies to meet their debt obligations. As a result, many junk bond portfolio managers have limited their buying to higher quality bonds of companies considered recession-resistant, such as those in the food and entertainment industries.    That's bad news for a company like Cleveland-based Ohio Mattress, which loses on two counts: Its bonds were considered to be in the lower tier on the quality scale, and the company's fortunes are partly tied to the recession-sensitive housing industry.    Moreover, some investors say they were uncertain about the tax consequences of buying Ohio Mattress's zero-coupon bonds, which made up $225 million of the three-installment issue. Such bonds pay no interest but are issued at a deep discount. Investor gains come from the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value received at maturity.    Congress has considered eliminating or reducing the tax benefit associated with certain non-investment grade zero-coupon bonds and so-called piks, or payment-in-kind bonds that pay out more of the security instead of interest.    Other investors complained that the wording in the Ohio Mattress prospectus was complicated, which made it difficult to ascertain how much protection bondholders would receive in case of possible event risks, such as a merger or other events that could affect bond prices.    As the date of the offering approached, the expected yield on the new bonds rose from a starting point of about 13.5% to about 15%. First Boston even restructured the offering and increased the amount of senior paper by $25 million and decreased the amount of subordinated paper by an equal amount.    But, &quot;when you have a deal that's complicated or poorly structured, no matter what the rate is, you still have a poorly structured transaction, and that makes investors nervous,&quot; said Michael McNelley, a portfolio manager at Caywood-Christian Capital Management in San Diego. He said Caywood-Christian passed on the bonds primarily because of doubts about possible event risk. &quot;This company has been recapitalized, re-leveraged, restructured, re-everything,&quot; he said. &quot;It wasn't clear if there were covenants to protect against further changes.&quot;    This wasn't the first time First Boston, a unit of CS First Boston Inc., had to withdraw a large offering because of lackluster demand. Last year, the firm pulled back a $1.15 billion offering of Federated Department Stores Inc. junk bonds. They were later reoffered after the firm reduced the offering's size to $750 million and boosted yields to as high as 17.75%.    Some investors are wondering whether Ohio Mattress will be a repeat of that troubled transaction. The nation's leading bedding manufacturer was taken private in a $980 million leveraged buy-out by a group led by Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Limited Partnership, a New York concern specializing in management buy-outs. First Boston had a $5 million investment in the buy-out, which was announced in March and completed last week.    The proceeds from the Ohio Mattress bond issue were to be used to prepay a $457.3 million bridge loan provided by First Boston that was used to acquire the company. The bridge loan matures Oct. 23.    At the time of the acquisition, some analysts estimated that the Gibbons Green group paid 14 times Ohio Mattress's fiscal 1988 earnings of $70.2 million before taxes and interest charges. Considering that some other leveraged buy-outs had been priced at seven to 10 times earnings before interest and taxes, some analysts said the group paid too much.    But Mr. Long at First Boston said investors should focus on the company's potential. He said opportunities for Ohio Mattress, the market leader with more than 25% of domestic bedding sales, will improve markedly as the company expands domestically and internationally. He noted that the company, whose brand names include Sealy and Stearns and Foster, recently became the leading bedding supplier to Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. The company also could capitalize on its relationship with one of its major investors, Flex Group, the largest bedding maker in Europe.    ---   Friday's Market Activity    Prices of Treasury bonds ended lower after a roller-coaster session that saw prices on long-term bonds fluctuate in a range of almost three points.    The existing benchmark 30-year bonds ended 1 3/8 lower, or down $13.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was quoted late at 8.15%. The price on the long-term bond was quoted at about 107 30/32. The new 10-year notes were quoted in when-issued trading at about 99 14/32 to yield 8.065%.    Only the new 30-year long bond that was auctioned Thursday posted an increase. But dealers said they were discounting that gain in when-issued trading because it was calculated against the auction average price of 99 27/32. And the new bond finished the Thursday session at a price that was much higher than the auction average, they said.    Short-term rates moved higher. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.93%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.182%. Six-month bills were quoted at a discount rate of 7.66%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.056%.    The bond market started out on a strong note, with prices jumping by as much as 1 3/4 points in response to the unexpected sharp 0.4% decline in the July producer-price index. That was the sharpest drop since July 1986 and followed a 0.1% decline in June. The index measures inflation on the wholesale level.    The decline led to speculation that the Federal Reserve might ease credit conditions further. &quot;People initially jumped on the notion that the Fed would ease&quot; after the data were released, said Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd.    But later in the morning, prices began to fall as investors sobered up after &quot;the initial euphoria from the PPI data&quot; and realized that the central bank wasn't likely to ease immediately after the data was released, said Mr. McGee.    The profit-taking accelerated after the Fed unexpectedly drained reserves from the banking system around midday, which reinforced the idea that a Fed easing isn't likely anytime soon.    Meanwhile, mortgage-backed securities held at lower levels after a sharp midday reversal erased early price gains.    Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for August delivery ended at about 97 17/32, down 7/32. The issue's yield was about 9.483% to a 12-year average life assumption, placing it 1.42 percentage points above the new 10-year Treasury note.    In the new-issue market, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. group priced a $752 million issue of National Credit Card Trust 1989-5 participation certificates.    Municipal bonds ended as much as 5/8 point lower. The movement in Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority's 7 1/8% bonds due 2019 showed the whipsaw action of prices. The bonds, bid early at 98 1/4, jumped to 98 5/8 bid after the producer prices data, then tumbled to 97 3/4 around midday. They were quoted late at about 97 5/8, 5/8 point lower on the day. </TEXT></DOC>
