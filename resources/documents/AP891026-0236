But ironically, junk bonds sold a few months later by RJRNabisco's new owners to finance the record-breaking takeover areconsidered ``quality'' junk issues in today's troubled high-yielddebt market.   That $4 billion junk bond issue _ the largest-ever corporatebond offering _ was a hit. Investors snapped up the securities whenthey were sold in May.   Analysts say the inherent value of RJR Nabisco brands, such asOreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Winston cigarettes, gave investorsconfidence in the ability of the company to make money and sellassets to reduce debt and repay the bonds.   But RJR Nabisco's earlier experience with bondholders wasn't aspleasant.   Shortly after announcing the $24.53 billion leveraged buyout byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. last October, the market price ofexisting RJR Nabisco bonds plunged on news of the huge amount ofnew debt the company would assume in the transaction. At the sametime, bond-rating agencies dropped their credit rating of RJRNabisco bonds to the low-grade, junk-bond category.   Several major bondholders, including Metropolitan Life InsuranceCo., sued the company, contending they were treated as second-classinvestors to RJR's shareholders, who reaped a bonanza when theysold their shares.   Met Life contends in its lawsuit, which is pending, that RJRNabisco recklessly quadrupled debt through the buyout. RJR Nabiscoalso faces a class-action lawsuit from bondholders and a similarsuit from the insurance unit of ITT Corp.   Met Life said news of the buyout slashed more than $1 billion inmarket value from RJR Nabisco's bonds. The insurance company saidits own portfolio of about $340 million in RJR Nabisco bonds lost$40 million in value.   A tenet of corporate finance is that bondholders enjoyprecedence over shareholders, argues Met Life President John J.Creedon.   ``This basic concept of corporate priorities was turned upsidedown by the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout. Substantially all thecompany's net worth was paid out to its shareholders and thebondholders received nothing,'' Creedon said in a speech earlierthis year. ``The payment to shareholders was funded by enormouslevels of new debt.''   Concern over plunging bond prices resulting from the RJR Nabiscodeal and other takeovers at the time brought new awareness of``event risk,'' or corporate restructurings that deteriorate thevalue of a company's securities.   No longer could it be presumed that high-grade corporate bondswere a relatively safe investment. Many institutional investors,such as insurance companies and pension funds, said at the timethey were steering clear of all corporate bonds.   Since the RJR Nabisco buyout, one of the major credit-ratingagencies, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., has started ranking corporatebonds by the degree of protection they provide against event-riskprice drops.   The buyout ``made it more important to consider event risk asone buys investment-grade securities,'' said James C. Goss, ahigh-yield analyst for the Chicago investment firm Duff andamp; PhelpsInc.   Added Sandamp;P analyst Bill Wetreich: ``What it brought home was thatsize is not a protection against event risk. Prior to RJR there wasa sense that the size of certain deals would preclude them frombeing done.''   While holders of existing RJR Nabisco bonds weren't pleased bythe buyout, the new junk bonds have done well in the market whileother LBO-related junk issues have plunged.   That's due to several factors, including the sheer size of theRJR Nabisco bond issue, which gives it built-in liquidity; thecompany's predictable cash flow; its strong, no-frills consumerproducts, which should fare well in a recession; and its ability tosell divisions for a good price, analysts say.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
