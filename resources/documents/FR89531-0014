Introduction </ITAG>The OER, a component of the DOE, is today proposing to revise its SpecialResearch Grants Program Rule for the purpose of providing a more uniformedand streamlined regulation as it pertains to the receipt, review, evaluation,and pre- and post-award administration requirements. In the period since10 CFR Part 605 became effective on April 15, 1985, OER has participatedin the Florida Demonstration Project (FDP) that sought to reduce FederalResearch Grant administrative requirements yet maintain adequate stewardshipof Federal funds as a result of this Demonstration. OMB issued a memorandumon May 18, 1988, that authorized agencies to make use of four of the mostsuccessful subsets of the FDP Procedures. Since DOE is implementing OMB'sdirective into its Financial Assistance Regulations (10 CFR, 600.103, 600.106and 600.108) repeating the rules in 10 CFR Part 605, was deemed unnecessary.Moreover, since this proposals seeks to amend numerous sections of 10 CFRPart 605, the Special Research Grant Program Rule, OER proposes that thisrevision will supersede the existing 10 CFR Part 605 in its entirety. Thespecific proposed changes are discussed in the following section:<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Changes to 10 CFR Part 605</ITAG>Section 605.1 No change.Section 605.2 Paragraph (a) of this part is revised in order to explain that the amendedrules will be effective for awards issued by DOE after the final revisedrule is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Paragraph (b) has no change.Section 605.3The definition for ``basic and applied research'' is changed to reflecta more concise, yet enhanced meaning of the term. In addition, OER is usingthis same definition in its current research contract announcement. Thisconsistency of the definition will allow for a more uniformed understandingof the term for OER grant and contract recipients. No other changes areproposed in this section.Section 605.4Paragraph (a) has no change. However, paragraph (b), that established adeviation criteria for andSection; 605.7, has been deleted in concert withthe proposed deletion of andSection; 605.7Section 605.5Paragraph (a) has no change. Paragraph (b) is amended to provide for thefollowing scientific program area name changes and additions that are includedunder this section and the Appendix A; Biological Energy Research Divisionis now Division of Energy Biosciences; Applied Mathematical Sciences isnow Scientific Computing Staff; and Field Operations Management is an additionto this regulation. These changes appear in this section and in AppendixA.Section 605.6No change.Section 605.7The dollar award limitations established under the Special Research GrantRule issued April 15, 1985, have caused considerable misunderstanding amonggrant applicants, OER program staff and contracting offices. In addition,OER has internal policies that provide for review and clearance of largedollar awards. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to delete this section.Section 605.8No changes to paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g). Paragraph (b)is revised to incorporate language that reflects OER's long-term policyof accepting applications for research funding in specific scientific areas(see andSection; 605.5) at anytime unless specific deadlines are issued inother Notices of Availability. The April 15, 1985 regulation was misinterpretedand recipients tended to submit applications by April 15th of each fiscalyear which caused a workload imbalance. Also, to assist in clarifying OER'sgrant application process, language is included that informs grantees ofOER's policy of notifying applicants of any funding decision within twelvemonths from OER's receipt date of an applicationSection 605.9No changes to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (j). Paragraph (a)now indicates that seven copies of an application are required when requestingfunding. The April 15, 1985 final rule indicated an incorrect number andthis revision clarifies the number due. Paragraph (b) proposes to allowgrant requesters to utilize a face sheet form developed by OER and approvedby OMB under Control Number 1910-1400. This form was developed in orderto obtain program information needed for reviewing, evaluating and fundingof research support requests. State and local governments and Indian tribalgovernments will continue using the OMB facesheet, Standard Form 424, approvedby OMB under Control Number 0348-0043. Paragraph (b)(i) has been revisedto incorporate language that indicates the proper budget form for use byState and local governments and Indian tribal governments under the OMBA-102 common rule implementation issued on March 11, 1988. Paragraphs (h)and (i) have been changed to increase the renewal and continuation applicationsubmission dates from four to six months prior to the scheduled expirationdate of either the budget or project period. This revision is sought toallow for additional time in processing and reviewing applications forcontinued funding. Four months has proven to be inadequate for obtainingpeer review and documentation preparation.Section 605.10This entire section has been revised to provide a more detailed descriptionof OER's evaluation and selection process. In addition, the evaluationcriteria has been amended in accordance with input from the OER programstaff. Through this more detailed explanation of OER's review and selectionprocess, the grantee community will derive a better understanding of theSpecial Research Grants Program and its requirements.Section 605.11The changes to this section include providing the latest publishing datesof the DNA and Animal Care Guidelines.Section 605.12Paragraph (a) provides editorial changes to the first sentence and deletesthe sentence that sets a policy to allow only 12 months for support ofconference grants. Since implementation of 10 CFR Part 605 in April 1985,it became apparent that some conference grants needed additional time beyondthe 12-month limitation and by restricting the awards OER was causing unnecessarypaperwork burdens for recipients and staff. Paragraph (b) has no changes.However, Paragraph (c) has been deleted in accordance with DOE's proposedFDP changes to 10 CFR 600.106.Section 605.13This section as originally issued caused numerous questions regarding costsharing under the Special Research Grant Program. Therefore, the currentrevised language seeks to clarify the OER policy with regard to cost-sharingon Special Research Grants.Section 605.14This section has been revised to include only that paragraph that pertainsto limitation of DOE liability. The remaining paragraphs have been deleteddue to DOE's decision to adopt that part of the Department's financialassistance regulations section (10 CFR 600.108), that allows for carryoverof funds without DOE prior approval on research awards. It was felt thatto have another similar type of carryover policy would defeat the purposeof the Florida Demonstration Project and since 10 CFR Part 605 supplements10 CFR Part 600, the need to repeat the carryover section was not necessary.Section 605.15The change in paragraph (a) clarifies that the DOE Contracting Officerdetermines whether a fee to small business recipients is appropriate. Priorto this clarification, DOE Contracting Officers were, in fact, determiningfee appropriateness; however, this change specifies the responsibility.All other paragraphs remain the same as originally issued under 10 CFRPart 605 on April 15, 1985.Sections 605.16 and 605.17These two approval policy sections have been deleted due to DOE's financialassistance regulation changes that adopt the OMB approved policy subsetsderived from the Florida Demonstration Project (FDP). The DOE FinancialAssistance Regulations (10 CFR Part 600) will now allow recipients of financialassistance research awards authority to carry over funds from one fundingperiod to the next without prior approval, limited authority to approvepre-award costs, extensions of project periods without additional fundsand expanded prior rebudgeting approval. Therefore, deletion of the moreburdensome policy requirements under the current Special Research GrantProgram Regulations is in line with OER's efforts to streamline and reducepaperwork burdens, yet continue to safeguard Federal funds.Section 605.18No change.Section 605.19No change.Section 605.20No change.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Review Under Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This rule has been reviewed by OMB under Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13192,February 17, 1981).Prior to publication of the proposed rule, DOE concluded that the ruleis not a ``major rule'' because its promulgation will not result in (1)An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, (2) a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, Stateor local government agencies, or geographical regions, or (3) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete in domesticor export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Review Under Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 95 Stat. 1164) which requires preparation of a regulatoryflexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, i.e., small business,small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. DOE concludedthat this proposed rule would only affect small entities as they applyfor and receive grants and does not create additional economic impactson small entities. Accordingly, DOE certifies that this proposed rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen approved by OMB under control numbers 1910-0400 and 1910-1400.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>DOE has concluded that promulgation of these proposed procedural rulesclearly would not represent a major Federal action having significant impacton the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq. (1976)), the Council on EnvironmentalQuality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), and the DOE guidelines (10CFR Part 1022) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impactstatement pursuant to NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is generally not subject to the intergovernmental review requirementsof EO 12372 as implemented by 10 CFR 1005. However, certain grant applicationsmay be.All applications from governmental or non-governmental entities which involveresearch, development or demonstration activities when such activities:(1) Have a unique geographic focus and are directly relevant to the governmentalresponsibilities of a State or local government within the geographic area;(2) necessitate the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement underNEPA; or (3) are to be initiated at a particular site or location and requireunusual measures to limit the possibility of adverse exposure or hazardto the general public are subject to the provisions of the Executive Orderand 10 CFR Part 1005. Those planning to submit covered applications shouldimmediately contact OER for further information.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Review Under Executive Order 12612</ITAG>Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed forany substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between thenational government and the States, or on the distribution of power andresponsibilities among various levels of government. Today's proposed regulationswill amend existing regulations for a financial assistance program to stimulateresearch and development. There will not be any substantial direct effectson States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 605</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Applications, Copyright, Educationalinstitutions, Eligibility, Energy, Financial assistance, Forprofit organizations,Grant programs_energy, Grant programs, science and technology, Individuals,Inventions and patents_nonprofit organizations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Research, Solicitations, Science and technology, State_localand Indian tribal governments.In consideration of the foregoing, Chapter II of Title 10 of Code of FederalRegulations is proposed to be amended by revising Part 605 as set forthbelow.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on February 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert O.
