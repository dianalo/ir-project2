Eight patients with large superficial brain tumoursand eight healthy volunteers were examined with /sup 31/P spectroscopyusing an 8 cm surface coil for volume selection. Seven frequencies wereresolved in our spectra. The spectra from patients with brain tumoursshowed a great scatter, but generally they overlapped those obtainedin normal brain tissue. No characteristic pattern of the spectra wasseen in the tumours. One patient with a metastasis from a small cellcarcinoma of the lung was examined before and after chemotherapy. Thespectra showed considerable changes during chemotheraphy. It is concludedthat /sup 31/P spectroscopy using surface coils is of limited value fortumour characterization, but may add useful information in monitoringthe effect of chemotherapy.</TEXT></DOC>
