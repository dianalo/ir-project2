The settlement could draw on Texaco directors' liability insurance.    Meanwhile, as expected, the attorneys yesterday filed an objection to a reorganization plan that would allow Texaco to emerge from bankruptcy-law proceedings. The attorneys claim in court papers that the reorganization plan, which must be approved by holders of two-thirds of Texaco shares, shouldn't be confirmed because it &quot;abandons the immensely valuable shareholder derivative actions.&quot;    The attorneys are challenging broad-reaching indemnities and releases that would free officials and advisers of Texaco and Getty Oil Co. from any liability in Texaco's acquisition of Getty.    The attorneys are seeking to recover for shareholders the $3 billion settlement Texaco has promised to pay Pennzoil Co. Houston-based Pennzoil, claiming it already had an agreement to buy an interest in Getty Oil, in 1985 won a $10.3 billion court judgment against White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco that ultimately threw the oil giant into bankruptcy-law proceedings. That litigation was settled in December.    Even as they pursue litigation, the shareholder attorneys are attempting to resolve the derivative suits before a March 22 hearing scheduled to confirm Texaco's bankruptcy-law reorganization plan. At a meeting yesterday, shareholder attorneys met with Texaco attorneys to discuss how a fund could be created to satisfy their claims. The shareholder attorneys would receive a percentage of the funds recovered, possibly as much as 25%, said one attorney close to the bankruptcy-law case.    Among options discussed was drawing on $100 million of Texaco's director-liability insurance. The attorneys also may ask third parties named in the derivative suits to contribute to a fund. The parties include, among others, First Boston Corp., Texaco's adviser in the Getty transaction, as well as Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., adviser to Getty.    The attorneys also asked the bankruptcy court for permission to interrogate individuals who may have been involved in setting up the indemnities and releases. A hearing on this issue will be held Thursday morning.    Court papers show that the shareholder attorneys are looking to question a number of individuals including Texaco Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear and Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane, Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's litigation counsel, Joe Jamail, the New York investor and Texaco holder Carl C. Icahn, and Gordon Getty. </TEXT></DOC>
