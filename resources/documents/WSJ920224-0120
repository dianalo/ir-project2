The Japanese, Mr. Nevins said, seem to work bestwithin a disciplined corporate structure.   Moreover, rivalry and fear of losing face make peoplereluctant to ask questions, so on-the-job communication isworse than in many U.S. offices, said an American executive.                                                                                                          CALL FOR AUSTERITY IN ITALY                                                                                                          The governor of Italy's central bank called for economicausterity so that the country will fully reap the benefits ofEurope's economic and monetary union. Carlo A. Ciampi urgedthe government to impose rigorous budget and spendingpolicies, and called for cooperation between unions andemployers on wage controls to limit inflation and boost thecompetitive edge of Italian industry. Italy's cost of livingis running at 6.1% annually, about twice the Europeanaverage, while the government budget deficit is about 150trillion lire ($121.47 billion), or about 10% of the grossdomestic product.                                                                                                          TOURISTS ATTACKED IN KENYA                                                                                                          Armed bandits have terrorized and robbed tourists, and inone case raped a German woman, in a series of attacks in apopular game reserve. The attacks in the vast Masai Marareserve in Kenya's southwest have worried foreign diplomats.German officials have protested to the Kenyan governmentabout inadequate security in the reserve, which is owned andmaintained by the local Narok County Council and isn't partof the Kenya Wildlife Service. The U.S. Embassy also hasexpressed its concern to Kenya's government and has urged theState Department to issue an advisory warning to Americantourists.                                                                                                          FOREIGNERS TRADE CHINESE STOCK                                                                                                          For the first time since its communist revolution of 1949,China welcomed foreigners back to its Shanghai stock marketFriday and the lone stock traded by foreigners zoomed up morethan 20%.

AUSTRIA AWAITS EC TALKS                                                                                                          Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said negotiations forhis country's entry into the European Community were unlikelyto start before next year. Mr. Vranitzky said Austria wasready to join the EC at any time, but that the Communitywanted to wait until the Jan. 1, 1993, deadline forimplementing its single-market plans before discussingenlargement.                                                                                                          BLAME DENIED IN CHOLERA CASE                                                                                                          An Argentine airline suspended all flights to Peru Fridayafter more than 60 passengers showed symptoms of cholerafollowing a flight from Lima to Los Angeles. One elderly mandied. But yesterday, Peru suspended the airline's license tofly to and operate in Lima, saying the carrier madeunsubstantiated claims that bacteria-tainted food was takenaboard there. The catering company pointed out that otherflights it serviced weren't affected. The AerolineasArgentinas flight Feb. 14 originated in Buenos Aires and tookon passengers and food in Peru, which has been hard hit bythe year-old Latin American cholera epidemic.                                                                                                          ILLITERACY DOGS INDUSTRIAL WORLD                                                                                                          A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment paints a picture of widespread functionalilliteracy that, according to the 24-nation think tank, ishandicapping economic performance in the industrial world.   &quot;Estimates vary widely according to definitions, but it isconceivable that about one-third of workers could do theirjobs better if they were able to use basic reading andwriting skills better,&quot; the report concludes.   The OECD sees the problem not as one of fallingeducational standards but of rising literacy requirements atwork. &quot;New jobs requiring new mixes of skills are beingcreated while unskilled industrial jobs are declining,&quot; thereport says.   The OECD said more and more employers now recognize thatdeficient basic skills and functional illiteracy cost themmoney. One researcher cited by the OECD said U.S. companieslose $40 billion a year because of illiteracy.
