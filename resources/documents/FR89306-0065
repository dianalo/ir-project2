Zilka, Education Specialist,Early Childhood Program, Telephone: (202) 343-3559.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2> The authority for this Memorandum ofAgreement is the Snyder Act (25 U.S.C. 13), Pub. L. 94-142, Education ofthe Handicapped Act (EHA) (20 U.S.C. secs. 1400-1485), as amended by theEducation of the Handicapped Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-457), and theEconomy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535). Pub. L. 99-457 (The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986)amended the Education of the Handicapped Act (Pub. L. 94-142), reauthorizedthe discretionary programs under the Act, and authorized a new early interventionprogram for handicapped infants and toddlers and their families. Under existing regulations (34 CFR 300.600), a State Education Agency (SEA)may utilize interagency agreements as a means of implementing its generalsupervision requirements. The 1986 Amendments require that State plansinclude policies and procedures for developing and implementing interagencyagreements between the State and ``other appropriate State and local agencies.''The BIA, while not a State, is required to submit a State plan that meetsthe requirements of Pub. L. 99-457 sec. 1413 and an application which meetsthe requirements of sec. 1414, as well as, sec. 1484 of Part H (Infantsand Toddlers Program). This Memorandum of Agreement reflects the BIA's understanding of section613(a)(13) of the statute that ``other appropriate'' agencies are thoseFederal, State, and local agencies other than the BIA that provide or payfor special education or related services for Indian children with handicappingconditions. The MOA describes the role that the BIA and IHS have in providingor paying for those services. The MOA also describes the responsibilitiesof each agency and establishes a mechanism for resolving interagency disputes.The 1986 Amendments state that Part B shall not be construed to limit theresponsibilities of agencies other than educational agencies for providingor paying for services provided to children under Part B. The 1986 Amendmentsalso state that Part B shall not be construed to permit a State to reduceassistance or alter eligibility under programs supported by Federal Medicaidand Maternal and Child Health Programs. This is intended to ensure thatno child is treated differently under those two programs because the childis receiving services under an individual Education Plan (IEP), or forany other reason related to the existence or applicability of Part B. While States have until 1990-1991 to provide services for handicapped children,ages three through five, the BIA was mandated under Pub. L. 99-457 to beginproviding services for these children during the 1987-1988 school year.The Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-457)added a new State formula grant program to assist States in establishinga statewide system of early intervention services for infants and toddlerswith handicaps and their families. This new program (designated as PartH of the EHA) replaces, and substantially expands, the State grant provisionsestablished in 1983 under the Handicapped Children's Early Education Program(HCEEP). Part H focuses on similar activities, but limits the age rangeto children from birth through two years of age. Part H is the only program administered by the Department of Education(DOE) that focuses exclusively on meeting the needs of infants and toddlerswith handicaps. Children in this age group have been traditionally servedthrough programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.The BIA has been designated as the Lead Agency under Part H. The Lead Agencyis responsible for: (a) Submitting applications for, and receiving fundsunder this program, and (b) serving as the lead agency responsible forthe general administration of program and activities carried out underPart H. The BIA is mandated under Part H to develop a comprehensive systemof early interventio services for handicapped Indian infants and toddlersby 1990-1991 that fits the individual characteristics of the BIA.Each comprehensive system of early intervention is to be planned and carriedout as a coordinated, interagency, multidisciplinary program. Generally,no one agency has the funding resources, services, or authority to provideall appropriate early intervention services for all infants and toddlerswith handicaps. The legislative history of Pub. L. 99-457 emphasizes theconcept of interagency coordination, by acknowledging that even in Statesrequiring a free appropriate public education from birth, no single agencyprovides all services to all children with handicaps. Rather, existingservice delivery systems represent interdependence among public and privateagencies and organizations at the State and local levels. While the BIA is the Lead Agency under Part H, it does not have availablewithin its system, the full complement of services needed by handicappedinfants and toddlers and their families, e.g., developmental disabilityprograms, health services, education, social services, and mental health.Currently, the BIA has available special education, related services, andsocial services. The IHS provides, within the scope of its health program,direct medical, social, and mental health services to handicapped Indianinfants and toddlers, children, and youth. This MOA provides the mechanism for the development of a coordinated, multidisciplinary,interagency program between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the IndianHealth Service for the provision of services for handicapped Indian infants,toddlers, children, and youth. The MOA will remain in effect until suchtime as agreed upon by both parties. The MOA will be reviewed annuallyand modified as needed for compliance with law and regulation. A BIA andIHS Task Group will develop an Action Plan which will include: goals, objectives,related activities or products, names of responsible agency/person, timelines,and evaluation criteria for each objective. The Action Plan will be reviewedquarterly by the task group of appropriate BIA/IHS representatives andthe Plan will be revised annually.

The House Report (Report 99-860)at page 11 states:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24"> In State's serving significant numbers of Indian handicapped infantsand toddlers, the lead agency must consult with and obtain input from Tribaleducation offices/committees, BIA schools, tribal schools, head start programsand other providers of service at the local and State level to ensure thatthe needs of these infants and toddlers are considered and accounted forin the statewide system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Handicapped Indian infants and toddlers are clearly included withinthe intended statewide system of services and in carrying out its responsibilitiesthe BIA is acting as part of the statewide system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The IHS provides health services to Indians under the discretionaryauthority of the Snyder Act, some of which overlap with <T3>related services</T3> and <T3>early intervention services</T3> as defined in the EHA. The IHS hasno responsibilities as such under the EHA. It is not an education agencyfunded under said act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The BIA and IHS in recognizing that neither agency can provide a comprehensiveprogram that would satisfy all the needs and services for different agegroups and handicapping conditions further confirms their respective beliefthat services within their jurisdictions require a comprehensive, multidisciplinary,interagency approach to meet the needs of handicapped Indian infants andtoddlers, children and youth. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In keeping with the intent to provide appropriate services and toextend present collaborative efforts, the purpose of this MOA is to identifyareas of national and local cooperation needed to serve the needs of handicappedIndian children and youth within our joint jurisdictions. Local BIA/IHSagreements are to be developed based on the identified areas of this MOAto ensure the purpose of the MOA is fulfilled. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Tribal organizations, other Federal and State agencies providing servicesare to be included in agreements for handicapped services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">IV.
