It is shown that an optimum positioning exists,leading to an energy increase on the rotors of about 25%, due to theacceleration of the flow by the tower, with an acceptable irregularityof the flow through the windrotors. Furthermore, it is shown that ona realistic system with ten windrotors, the cost of the tower can becompensated by the increase in energy production due to the tower concentrationeffect and due to the increase of wind velocity with height.</TEXT></DOC>
