Someday in the current congressional session, Democrats will have to bite the bullet and vote on whether to renew military aid to the contras.    It's a touchy subject because we imagine that in spare moments when they haven't been detailing the life and times of Albert Hakim, Fawn Hall and Southern Air Transport, the Iran-Contra committee members probably have been keeping up on press coverage of life in Nicaragua. It's not a pretty picture. Sandinista Nicaragua is now being described as a place of increasing political oppression, censorship, human-rights abuses and economic deprivation. But hardly anyone in Washington has time for any of that these days.    Instead we have the daily spectacle of a Congress -- which keeps saying it wants a role in the formation of U.S. foreign policy -- fixated on an investigation of the foreign policy bureaucracy. That means, of course, that the foreign policy bureaucracy itself has to set aside its normal responsibilities so it can share in the fixations of Congress. Over the weekend, for instance, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker was describing how his operation has combed through all of Oliver North's wanderings around the building to prove that he never had direct, private access to the president.    Now, we have no particular complaint if Congress wishes to spend the bulk of its current session trying to discover whether the executive branch violated an amendment to a 1984 or 1985 appropriations bill. Certainly the Constitution doesn't deny Congress the right to be affronted at great length -- though as Gordon Crovitz describes nearby, the legislative record shows that the meaning or intent of five Boland amendments is somewhat less than clear. (See related editorial: &quot;Congress Is Hoist by Its Boland Petard&quot; -- WSJ July 7, 1987.) But what about Nicaragua?    Somewhere in the ozone of the Iranamok committee's agenda there must be some connective tissue linking this recurring committee phrase, &quot;the contras,&quot; with what is going on right now in Nicaragua. A recent sample of press coverage out of Nicaragua would include the following:    In a series of articles, James Lemoyne of the New York Times has reported on the Sandinistas' forced uprootings of villages, displacing perhaps 100,000 Nicaraguans; human-rights abuses, including the shooting of fleeing refugees; and peasant defections to the contras (the series also described instances of contras forcibly impressing peasants into their forces).    In May, William Branigin of the Washington Post produced a lengthy description of &quot;a pattern of human-rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and torture.&quot; A recently formed Managua group, Movement of Mothers of Political Prisoners, has been the subject of government crackdowns.    The Journal's Clifford Krauss last month described the deep antipathy among the local population toward the policies and surveillance techniques of the Sandinistas' Internal Trade Ministry. In the Americas column published on this page last Friday, Douglas Payne described Nicaragua's growing economic integration with the Soviet bloc. And yesterday on the Washington Post's op-ed page, La Prensa publisher Violeta Chamorro described the extent of press censorship. &quot;The reaction from the free world,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and the leaders who call themselves democrats has been little.&quot;    Well, the democrats in Washington are busy. Today they will interrogate Col. North and some other day they will interrogate Adm. Poindexter. But eventually Mrs. Chamorro will get her reaction from Capitol Hill. The contra reauthorization will come up and the Democrats will vote either to pull the plug on the contras or to rearm them. The House's recent 213-201 vote forbidding U.S. citizens from traveling to Nicaragua to assist the government's military operations suggests some recognition of the nature of the Sandinista regime.    In its most recent vote on the contras, of course, Congress supported military aid. Will Congress really reverse itself once again, with evidence of the totalitarian nature of the Sandinistas growing daily? Either Congress is going to overturn administration policy and let Danny Ortega work his will, or it is not. If it is, it takes responsibility for what happens in Nicaragua. If not, it tacitly admits that in 1983 and 1984 Congress was wrong on the central issue, and Ronald Reagan and Oliver North were right. </TEXT></DOC>
