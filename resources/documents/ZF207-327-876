G. B., Russia's spy agency, for cash and drugs.andP;  The leader ofthis group, Marcus Hess (also known as Mathias Speer) is the &quot;Wily Hacker&quot;featured in the May 1988 issue of this magazine.andM;According to the Norddeutsche Rundfunk news reports, the Hess spy ringpenetrated computers at Thomson C. S. G., a French military and electronicssupplier; CERN, the European High-Energy Physics Research Institute; theEuropean Spacee Agency; the Max Planck Institute, as well as U.S.andP;  systemsincluding those of NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department ofDefense, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Argonne National Laboratory.andM;Stories like these have galvanized the public and lawmakers.andP;  Legislaturesacross the country are reacting by passing laws that can be restrictive,harmful, or at least worrisome to computing professionals.andP;  For example, onJanuary 20, 1989, California State Assembly Senator Torres filed a bill (SB304) to amend section 502 of the California Penal Code, relating tocomputers.andP;  According to the legislative counsel's digest:andM;This bill would provide that any person convicted of any computer crime shallbe automatically excluded from computer-related employment for 5 years afterthe first conviction, and permanently after a subsequent conviction.andP;  Thebill would also provide that no community college, state university, oracademic institution accredited in California may award any academic degreeor certification relating to electronic data processing or computer scienceduring the pendency of computer crime charges or during any sentence orexclusion from employment.andM;Senator Torres is proposing a system similar to the International Driver'sLicense (IDL) for computing.andP;  An international driver's license allows you todrive in any country which hasn't specifically revoked your right to drivethere.andP;  The IDL is fairly pessimistic, in that it provides a dozen pages forrevocation stamps.andP;  Senator Torres' plan assumes that anyone can be asoftware engineer until he proves himself a felonious practitioner.andP;  That isa pessimistic assessment of our profession.andM;More generally, Jay Bloombecker, chairman of ACM's Legal Issues Committee,estimates computer crimes cost over half a billion dollars in the U.S.andP;  alonelast year, not including losses of personnel and computer time.andP;  Arrests forthese crimes are projected in the thousands.andP;  Not surprisingly, Bloombeckerreports that all the states, except Vermont and Virginia, already havecomputer crime statutes.andP;  Congress has been busy too.andP;  Library of Congressreport CRS 89-185 SPR states that 317 federal laws concerning informationtechnology were enacted in the last 12 years.andM;If we, the leaders of the computing profession, do nothing, there will soonbe a crazy quilt of state laws regulating the computing profession in fiftydifferent ways.andP;  State regulations will inevitably be haphazard, inconsistentand conflicting.andP;  Worse than that, the regulations governing computing willbe written by people knowing nothing about computing.andM;State regulation of computing would be a nightmare.andP;  Computing is almostuniquely independent of geography.andP;  Programs can be written in one state, runon a computer in another state, processing transactions and data from acrossthe nation or around the world.andP;  Jurisdictional disputes under stateregulation would be Byzantine.andM;Dick Hespos, ACM's Executive Director, compares state regulation of computingto a classically bad example--the insurance industry.andP;  For reasons which areobscured by antiquity, the industry is regulated by state, not federal laws.andO;The result is a dog's breakfast of conflicting, inconsistent laws that havemade the industry a disaster, varying only by degree from state to state.andO;Except for lawyers, almost no one thinks the insurance industry is a model tobe emulated.andP;  The voters in many states, most recently California and NewJersey, are so disgruntled that they have taken insurance reform to the pollsin referenda.andP;  Is the future of the computing proession to be decided byfifty state commissions or by the voters?andM;It it too late, and too Utopian, to pursue the ideal of self-regulation--anideal which no real professions enjoy.andP;  We are faced with a more mundanechoice.andP;  We can accept growing piecemeal regulation and licensing by statelegislatures (which have many lawyers, morticians, and tavern keepers, butfew computer professionals) or federal regulation.andP;  At the minimum, federalregulation would assure geographic consistency and a higher quality ofregulation is likely, because all of the available talent can be concentratedon one target.andM;It is time for ACM, in cooperation with IEEE and others if possible, topropose and strive for adoption of appropriate federal standards for thecomputing proessions.andP;  If you are interested in working on this problem,please drop me a line at: ACM c/o Proessional Standards and PracticesCommittee 11 West 42nd Street New York, NY 10036</TEXT></DOC>
