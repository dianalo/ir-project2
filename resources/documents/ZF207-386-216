 It also freesusers from using multiple finicky commands to reformat images for differentprinters.andM;PostScript is not the only page-description language.andP;  Many laser printershave proprietary ones or use the Printer Command Language developed byHewlett-Packard Co.andM;But most photocomposition system suppliers have adopted PostScript, making itan industry standard for typesetting.andM;One result in that phototypesetters, except for their high resolution andpaper-handling methods, have become indistinguishable from the laser printersused with desktop computers.andP;  However, typesetting machines usually output tofilm or special roll paper because press platemaking demands high durability.andM;PostScript has 240 commands, also called primitive operators.andP;  Like BASIC,PostScript is an interpreted language, meaning the commands are typed in aline at a time for immediate execution by an interpreter.andP;  Usually theinterpreter is a dedicated microprocessor added to the laser printer.andP;  Theinterpreter accepts PostScript commands via parallel or serial port,developing a rater dot-by-dot description of an entire page.andP;  It delivers thepage image to the printer before developing the next page in memory.andM;The interpreter needs considerable computing horsepower, not to mention twiceas much random access memory if the next page is to be developed while theprinter is receiving the first page.andP;  RAM in the 2M to 6M range is notunusual.andM;Thus a PostScript processor might be more powerful than the user's own PC.andO;Chips in PostScript engines are commonly the Intel corp. 80286 or 80386 orthe Motorola Inc. 68000 series.andP;  Motorola's series is the most popular.andM;Beware of FudgeandM;Interpreting commands is slow even for a fast machine, and transferringmultimegabits of data to an electromechanical printer bogs things down evenmore.andP;  Thus speed probably is the most critical parameter after cost inchoosing a PostScript printer.andM;Many printer manufacturers seem to fudge their speed numbers a bit.andP;  The mostreliable way to determine throughput is to time it personally, from start tofinish, with a multipage document.andM;PostScript is an operator-based, stack-oriented language following thereverse Polish notation scheme of mathematics.andP;  The arithmetic operationexpressed as SUM = 3 + 4 in BASIC would be written in PostScript as 3 4 ADD.andM;In other words, the operands 3 and 4 are pushed onto the &quot;stack&quot; of temporaryinformation, after which the operator ADD pops them from the stack and pushesthe result, 7, onto the top of the stack.andP;  postScript commands that causeprinter actions are written in a similar fashion.andM;PostScript also has a dictionary that lets the user define vocabularyelements, which are actually new PostScript operators.andP;  This might beregarded as a subroutine capability with simple call and return procedures.andM;Because PostScript works in units of a printer's point,1/72nd of an inch, onefrequent use of the dictionary is to convert inches to points.andP;  Theconversion is /INCH 72 3/5 MUL 4/5 DEF, which declares the command INCH to bea dictionary word with the definition: &quot;Multiply the second element on thestack by 72, which is on top of the stack, and put the result back on thestack.&quot;andM;It takes three PostScript commands to draw a line from a point 3 inches fromthe left of the page and 2 inches from the top, to a point 6 inches from theleft of the page and 2 inches from the top -- in other words, a 3-inchhorizontal line 2 inches below the top of the page: 3 INCH 2 INCH MOVETO 6INCH 2 INCH LINETO STROKEandM;Fortunately, most users never have to worry about writing such PostScriptprograms.andP;  Many high-end word processing and desktop publishing packages havePostScript drivers that send commands directly to the printer or write aPostscript program file on disk that can be sent to a PostScript interpreter.andM;The most popular way to get PostScript functionality is to buy a PostScriptprinter with a built-in interpreting.andP;  One drawback can be that aPostScript-only printer lacks other emulation modes for application packagesthat do not have PostScript interfaces.andP;  For example, Lotus 1-2-3 and dBasedrive only plain-vanilla printers that accept ASCII.andM;Most printer vendor provide at least one conventional ASCII mode.andP;  AppleComputer Inc., for example, has a Diablo 630-compatible mode forplain-vanilla printing.andM;Beyond Plain VanillaandM;Another way of getting PostScript capability is to add a PostScript boardinside the printer.andP;  A few boards are designed to fit inside theHewlett-Packard Laserjet printer body, but the growing number of laserprinter manufacturers use a variety of packaging.andP;  Users who already own aHewlett-Packard printer, however, may find adding a board the easiestapproach to PostScript.andM;A less traumatic variation on this approach requires only that the printerhave a raster video input port, or else a simple plug-in card, to which acoprocessor board inside the desktop PC can be connected.andP;  Many of the newerlaser printers have video input ports.andP;  Adding the small interface card, ifnecessary, is far easier than rebuilding the printer to accept a board.andM;Still another avenue to PostScript is to run the interpreter on the desktopPC.andP;  The software drives the printer through its nomral serial or parallelinput port, typing up the PC while it processes the PostScript file.andO;Printing becomes a three-step process: the user must exit from the wordprocessor or publishing package, execute the program to interpret thePostScript print file, then re-enter the application.andM;Adobe Systems Inc. has held a lock on the PostScript interpreter marketbecause its interpreters were used in all the early PostScript printers.andP;  Butlanguages are not immune to cloning as long as the implementation softwareitself is not copied.andP;  A number of PostScript clones are beginning to appear.andM;The question to ask about clones is how faithful their emulation is.andP;  In somecases, results can be more pleasing than Adobe's.andP;  The reason is that AdobePostScript has only its own proprietary typefaces while other vendors providea choice of fonts from suppliers such as BitStream Inc.andM;PostScript is just as adept at handling images and graphics as it is attypefaces.andP;  In all cases, the ultimate output to the printer is a dot-by-dotdescription of the page to be printed.andP;  This graphic adroitness makesPostScript a natural choice for desktop publishing, high-end graphics andadvanced word processing.andM;Most of the sophisticated graphics and text-processing packages for the AppleMacintosh offer only PostScript output, while many PC-based packages give achoice of PostScript or direct printer drive, usually Hewlett-PackardLaserjet-compatible.andM;A mix of graphics, halftones and text appears in the high-end desktoppublishing packages such as Xerox Ventura Publisher and Aldus Pagemaker.andO;High-end CAD packages like the latest AutoCAD have PostScript output drivers.andO;So do advanced graphics packages such as Harvard Graphics and LotusFreelance.andM;Full-featured word processors like Microsoft Word 5.0 and WordPerfect 5.0also mingle boxes and rules with text and images.andP;  Using PostScript withthese packages to proof documents on a laser printer, then forwarding themelectronically to a PostScript-compatible typesetter, guarantees that thelayout can be tuned to perfection before it goes to press.andM;All printers listed in the accompanying chart are fullyPostScript-compatible.andP;  They accept PostScript as an input language, and mosthave other emulation modes for packages that do not support PostScript.andM;A non-PostScript laser printer costs less in the beginning.andP;  But ifPostScript capability becomes necessary in the future, the overall cost willbe higher to upgrade with boards or software than to invest in the PostScriptprinter from the start.andM;However, certain circumstances may argue for buying a non-PostScript printer:special paper-handling needs, unusual resolution or speed requirements andspecialty printing such as bar codes.andM;PostScript laser printers cost more because they must have a healthy internalprocessor and a significant amount of memory.andP;  Most of the printers listed inthe chart have as much as 1M extra ROM for the PostScript interpretersoftware.andM;Talkin' 'Bout Font GenerationandM;Many of these printers have optional extra memory to hold more type fonts.andO;PostScript generates fonts from a basic set of outlines.andP;  These generatedfonts must remain in RAM while the job is printing.andM;The more fonts required and the higher the resolution, the more RAM is usedup.andP;  High-end machines like the Kodak, Linotype and Varitype offer a 20M, 40Mor 80M optional hard disk.andM;All the add-on cards listed in the chart will operate inside a conventionalPC and produce video output for a laser printer.andP;  But bear in mind that notall laser printers have video input capability.andM;These cards also require large amounts of memory just as PostScript printersdo.andP;  Furthermore, some of them turn PostScript printing into a two-stepprocess.andP;  First the PostScript output is printed from the desktop publishingpackage or word processor to a file on disk, then the file is processed bythe PostScript add-on board.andP;  Special drivers are available for packages likeVentura Publisher and Pagemaker to drive the PostScript processor directly.andM;Two different flavors of Host-resident software for processing and printingPostScript to non-PostScript laser printers are available.andP;  PostScript usesup memory so prodigally that extra memory becomes necessary in one place oranother.andM;In the case of Softscrybe, from Advanced Vision Research Inc., San Jose,Calif., between 512K and 2M of EMS memory must be added to the PC.andP;  Also,AVR's Megabuffer card must be added to hold the bit-map image developed bythe interpreter.andP;  A special laser printer interface card also is needed,depending on printer type.andM;To cost winds up in the same range as the PostScript add-on processor cards,but with the advantage of being able to drive a laser printer that does nothave a video interface port.andM;Special arrangements are necessary for users who prefer packages such asLotus and dBase that do not generate PostScript output, but who neverthelessown PostScript-only printers.andP;  Translator packages can convert non-PostScriptoutput for PostScript printing.andM;One package, Trading Post, from Laser Tools Corp., Berkeley, Calif., is forPCs and the other, Outpost, from Trax Softworks Inc., Los Angeles, is for IBMCorp. mainframes.andP;  Both work with any PostScript printer.andM;P.S.andP;  You're WrongandM;One interesting footnote about PostScript printers gets little attention inmanufacturers' specifications.andM;Because PostScript is an interpretive language, its syntax analyzer looksconstantly for errors in language structure.andP;  The interpreter, on findingsuch errors, generally issues a message of the &quot;Error 156 line 42&quot; type.andM;The question is whether the application software that produces PostScriptoutput is able to recognize and do something about such messages.andM;If the printer is interfaced to a parallel line-printer port, the applicationcannot see the error messages; all parallel PC ports are unidirectional foroutput only.andP;  A serial port, on the other hand, is bidirectional and willaccept messages coming back from the printer during a print job.andM;Considering the price of PostScript printers, users often want to make themshareable or network devices.andM;Many listed printers have network server versions available.andP;  Apple'sprotocol is the most popular.andM;Others have Ethernet interfaces or multiple input ports and print-queuing toavoid printer switches and the scheduling problems that inevitably crop up ina shared environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
