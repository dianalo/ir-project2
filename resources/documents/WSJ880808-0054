A White House official said Mr. Reagan authorized the State Department to &quot;continue negotiations aimed at ensuring U.S. participation in the protocol.&quot; In so doing, he embraced a compromise worked out by negotiators in April and debated since within the administration. The agreement on nitrogen oxide, one of the pollutants in acid rain, is scheduled to be signed by Canada, European nations and the Soviet Union in October.    Some environmentalists regard the president's decision as a reversal of the administration's acid rain policy. The administration had balked at signing a 1985 agreement on sulfur dioxide emissions that didn't give the U.S. credit for reductions in emissions of that pollutant. However, under the April compromise, the nitrogen oxide agreement would take into account U.S. gains in controlling emissions from motor vehicles and electric power plants, according to administration officials.    The nitrogen oxide freeze isn't expected to have any immediate effect on U.S. industry. Nitrogen oxide emissions are decreasing but are projected to climb again in the mid-1990s because of population growth and industrial expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
