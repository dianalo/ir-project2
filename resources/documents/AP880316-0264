Its resolution asked for a stay of the executions, scheduled forFriday, and said South Africa's ``practice'' of executing opponentsof apartheid has harmed the search for peace.   On Tuesday, President Reagan issued a personal appeal for thelives of the six.   They were convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black townshipcouncilman stoned and burned to death in the Sharpeville townshipsouth of Johannesburg. An appeals court judge ruled that they didnot kill him personally but had common purpose with the mob.   Dragoslav Pejic of Yugoslavia, Security Council president forMarch, said death sentences for the ``African patriots'' had caused``undivided international condemnation and uproar.'' He also saidthousands of innocent black South Africans have been detained andtortured.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent a telegram toPresident P.W. Botha of South Africa asking mercy be shown the fivemen and one woman on humanitarian grounds.   He said clemency would help reduce tensions in South Africa,where 5 million whites control the government and the 26 millionblacks have no voice in national affairs.   The council resolution spoke of the ``Pretoria racist regime'sdecision to execute the Sharpeville Six ... in defiance ofworldwide appeals.''   Ambassador A. Leslie Manley of South Africa issued a statementcriticizing the council, which frequently condemns his country.   He said the government ``strongly objects'' to council actionthat interferes ``not only in an internal South African matter butalso a matter which is the result of the due process of law.''   South Africa ``is not insensitive to the feelings aroused bycapital punishment but must respect the independence of thecountry's judicial system,'' his statement said. ``Murder is acommon law crime. It has nothing to do with the color of a person'sskin.''   It said South African courts ``are highly respected'' and thatthere are few countries ``if any, where the courts enjoy a higherdegree of independence from the executive authority.''   This was the council's second action in a week of a resolutioncondemning apartheid, the official South African policy of racediscrimination. Last Tuesday, the United States and Britain vetoeda resolution that would have imposed economic sanctions.   Wednesday's resolution said the executions would ``furtherinflame an already grave situation in South Africa.''   It urged South Africa to commute the sentences and asked allcountries and organizations to ``use influence and take urgentmeasures to save the lives of the `Sharpeville Six'.''   The United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China arepermanent members of the council, with veto power. Other nationscurrently serving are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan,Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
