Using phased array radars, highspeed computers and precision guidance systems, the Patriotis doing brilliantly against Iraq's Soviet-supplied Scudmissiles. Star Wars technology is proving to be a clearwinner over a liquid fueled missile developed in the 1950s.   The real story, however, is that Scuds are continuing tooperate at all, despite the coalition's air supremacy. Thesimple truth is that although the Scuds' fixed launched padswere destroyed in the Jan. 16 air strike, the coalition can'tfind the mobile Scud launchers. In fact, it doesn't even knowhow many launchers Iraq has.</LP><TEXT>   For a full five months before the Jan. 15 deadline, theU.S. focused its intelligence gathering capabilities onIraq's 170,000 square miles. Using satellites, high-altitudeaircraft, electronic eavesdropping equipment andstate-of-the-art analysis techniques, the U.S. patientlyexamined nearly every square inch of Iraq and listened to thevoice communications of its military and civilian leaders.From this massive surveillance the military concluded thatIraq had no more than 36 to 40 mobile Scud launchers. Israel,which probably has the best intelligence gathering capabilityin the Middle East, put the number at 70. Today, no officialsource will give a Scud tally.   When hostilities began, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's DesertStorm staff gave top priority to the destruction of Iraq'sair defenses and air force. Once air superiority wasestablished, Scud launchers would be easy prey, or so theplanners thought. Traveling in convoys of at least eightvehicles -- five transport-erector-launchers, two propellanttankers and a command truck -- the Scud units would besitting ducks in the open desert. If the convoys reacheddeployment sites, the Scuds' lengthy fueling and countdownoperations would allow ample time to call in an air strike.   Obviously, the Scud war isn't sticking to the script. Heatdetection and imaging sensing devices couldn't see throughthe fog and clouds that hung low over the desert in the earlydays of the war. The Iraqis may have significantly reducedthe Scud countdown cycle with the aid of commerciallyavailable American equipment.   Iraq is known to have purchased briefcase-size GlobalPositioning System receivers, giving them access to Navstarsatellites, the U.S. world-wide navigation system. Using thisconstellation of electronic stars, the Iraqis can instantlycompute the position of their deployed launchers (requiredbefore target data can be fed into the missiles), knockingvaluable time off the old method that depends on traditionalsurveying techniques. Camouflage netting and heat dissipatingdevices purchased from Europe may have been deployed to helpconceal the launch sites.   The coalition's failure to handle the Scud threat hasstrategic importance for one simple reason: the intelligencegathering apparatus that can't find Scuds in California-sizeIraq is the same technology we depend on to enforce armscontrol agreements.   Even though the Cold War is allegedly over, the militaryfact remains that the only country capable of lobbingwarheads onto American cities is the internally troubledSoviet Union. Unlike those falling on Riyadh and Tel Aviv,the Soviet warheads carry nuclear explosives.   Significantly, the Soviets have deployed at least 30rail-mobile 10-warhead SS-24 ICBMs and have put more than 100single-warhead SS-25 long-range missiles on trucks. Thesefourth-generation rockets roam a land mass 50 times largerthan that of Iraq.   Before the U.S. goes any further with the Strategic ArmsLimitation Treaty, both the administration and Congressshould reassess the &quot;national technical means&quot; that allegedlymake arms control treaties verifiable. Satellites may provideadequate surveillance of stationary military areas such asshipyards, airfields and missile silos, but Iraq's Scuds arecompelling evidence that reconnaissance sensors can't findmobile targets.   The second lesson worth pondering is this: Land mobilemissiles are exceptionally capable deterrent systems. If Iraqhad nuclear weapons and was able to deploy them on theirScuds, would the coalition, knowing as it now does thedifficulty of detecting and destroying mobile launchers, haveattacked Saddam's war machine? Probably not.   The Soviet Union's 130-plus mobile missiles are effectivedeterrents against a first strike. Why, then, hasn't the U.S.countered by putting wheels under its silo-fettered ICBMs?Taxpayers have spent more than $25 billion developing theextremely accurate MX missile but political compromises havestuffed all 50 of the 10-warhead MXs into Wyoming silos thatwere already in the crosshairs of the growing Sovietstrategic forces.   Well developed Strategic Air Command plans to redeploy theMX on railcars have been shelved to fund the peace dividend.For $7 billion, the U.S. could have 500 modern missileswarheads deployed in a rail-mobile system. Not a badinsurance policy against a first strike. Saddam Hussein issending America a wake-up call.   ---   Mr. Boldrick, a retired Air Force colonel, is a former MXtest director.</TEXT></DOC>
