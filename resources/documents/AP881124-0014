In the latest incident Nov. 15, a white gunman opened fire onblacks at random in downtown Pretoria, fatally wounding sevenpeople. Authorities arrested Barend Strydom, a 23-year-old formerpoliceman linked to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.   President P.W. Botha's government, which warned extremist groupspreviously, responded by banning the White Liberation Movement, asmall group that has held a few public rallies in the past year. Itis the first white extremist group ever banned in South Africa.   The White Liberation Movement advocates ``clearing out'' blacksliving in white urban areas. The government described its members as``fanatical right-wing extremists (who) favor an active form ofviolence to take racism to its extreme.''   Johan Schabort, a biochemist who formed the group in 1985, saidbanning it reduces the ``outlet for frustration of white SouthAfricans.''   ``Now we cannot control people who are worried about their racesurvival,'' said Schabort, who claims about 1,000 members and manymore sypathizers.   Although no white extremist organizations had been banned, thegovernment has declared 23 anti-apartheid groups illegal anddetained or restricted hundreds of black activists this year alone.   Right-wing white groups have increased in both numbers andprominence in recent years as the National Party governmentimplemented gradual race reforms and proposed limited power-sharingwith blacks.   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in nationalaffairs, and the official apartheid policy of race discriminationpreserves power and privilege for the 5 million whites.   Officials did not say why they acted only against the WhiteLiberation Movement, which is much smaller than the AfrikanerResistance Movement led by Eugene TerreBlanche.   TerreBlanche has built his organization into the largest of thefar right. Nearly all its members are Afrikaners, the descendants ofwhite settlers who dominate the government.   Thousands of rural and blue-collar whites attend the movement'srallies, at which TerreBlanche delivers spellbinding speeches aboutan all-white state and rejects any concessions to the black majority.   Despite repeated threats, the government has not yet actedagainst the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, possibly because of worryabout its vow of violent resistance to any reduction of whiteprivilege.   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said recently: ``There are whites inthis country who can put together a more efficient violentorganization than the African National Congress,'' the mainguerrilla group fighting white domination.   Asked why the government does not detain whites as often as blackanti-apartheid activists, he said: ``It is not a question ofarresting a few people and that's the end of it.''   The government portrays itself as a haven of stability in theincreasingly militant struggle by blacks and extremist whites.   About 170 bombings have occurred since a nationwide state ofemergency was imposed June 12, 1986. Officials have blamed most ofthem on the African National Congress, but the targets of severalrecent explosions have been anti-apartheid groups.   ``There should be no doubt that right-wing violence is quite asevil and destructive as that of the left,'' the government-run SouthAfrican Broadcasting Corp. said in a recent editorial.   Black activists have raised the possibility of involvement bygovernment security forces in attacks on anti-apartheid activistsand organizations.   After receiving several death threats in March, the Rev. AllanBoesak said many anti-apartheid leaders ``have been assassinated inSouth Africa. I want the world to know the light of suspicion shouldfall on the South African government and the police if somethingshould happen.''   Police often boast of their success in capturing ANC guerrillasand pre-empting their attacks, but have announced no progress inrecent cases of violence widely blamed on white extremists.   Among them: A bomb destroyed a Johannesburg building that housedseveral anti-apartheid groups, fire damaged offices ofanti-apartheid church groups in Pretoria, a bomb exploded in aJohannesburg disco frequented almost exclusively by blacks and afire was set in an anti-apartheid group's offices at the Universityof the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.   The Conservative Party, which opposes all concessions to blacks,split from the National Party in 1982 and now is the largestopposition in Parliament. Some of its Parliament members belong tothe TerreBlanche's organization.   Other groups preaching an all-white homeland are the BoerestaatParty and the Orangeworkers.   Hercules Booysen, chairman of the Orangeworkers, said of theaction against the White Liberation Movement: ``The government willkeep on banning organizations until only itself is left.''</TEXT></DOC>
