The method has the advantages that thecomparative standard spiked with interesting elements has the same matrixas that of the sample, and that the absolute concentrations of the elementsto be determined can be evaluated easily by using a very simple equationeven though the sample and comparative standard are irradiated separatelyby a different number of protons. The applicability and reliability ofthe method was successively studied by analyzing two biological standardreference materials, i.e., spinach and orchard leaves. As a result, simultaneousdetermination of Cu, Zn, Rb and Sr using the Ag internal standard wasdemonstrated to be sensitive, highly reproducible and reasonably accurate.(author). 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
