<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0643 </DOCNO><TEXT>A description is given of the tests undertaken to characterize the technologicaland utilization conditions of case-hardening steels, namely, F-1522,F-1550 and F-1580. The temper diagrams show the mechanical propertiesof core. The data obtained are set out in a table which also providesdata required in order to choose the heat-treatment, the mechanical propertiesto be obtained and the possibilities of the steel for its industrialuse. The corresponding micrographs show the efficiency of the treatmentscarried out.</TEXT></DOC>
