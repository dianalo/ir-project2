Exxon's attempts to develop the Santa Ynez project, which has proven reserves of 300 million to 400 million barrels of oil, have been mired in years of litigation. The approval, however, was the result of a negotiated settlement that had the endorsement of local environmental groups, including Get Oil Out, which was formed in the wake of the huge 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara, Calif.    New York-based Exxon said it also needs approval from the Mineral Management Service of the U.S. Interior Department, but expects to begin construction by April. Exxon, the world's largest oil concern, hopes the project will produce 125,000 barrels of oil a day. The total includes production from an existing offshore platform, known as Platform Hondo, whose production is about 30,000 barrels a days but declining.    Platform Hondo, which was built in the early 1970s but didn't begin production until 1981, was the original source of much controversy surrounding the Santa Ynez project. Exxon located the platform more than three miles offshore and built an offshore oil storage and treatment vessel to avoid regulation by the coastal commission.    However, under the plan approved late Tuesday, Exxon will build an onshore oil processing facility in northern Santa Barbara County that will handle production from Platform Hondo and three new platforms. The processing facility, which will be located on a site in the Las Flores Canyon, will be able to accommodate additional processing plants built by other companies to handle their offshore oil production from the area.    Exxon said the project's $2.5 billion cost will be spread over the next four years. Last year, Exxon's total capital expenditure budget was $7.2 billion. San Francisco-based Chevron Corp., another major oil company, has a working interest in the project of about 20%.    A major issue in the negotiations between Exxon and the coastal commission was the amount of air pollution that the platforms and processing facilities will produce. The plan, approved by the commission by an 8-2 vote with one member abstaining, calls for all the drilling platforms to use electrical power rather than diesel engines.    During the negotiations, the estimated amount of air pollution from the project was reduced by 83% to about 340 tons of nitrous oxide per year from 2,000 tons per year, according to a spokesman for the commission.    Exxon noted that its application for a permit for the project has been pending for five years and has been the subject of about 130 public hearings.    &quot;We have listened very carefully to the community and the state, and we have negotiated very hard to arrive at a project design that meets our needs and the standards established by Santa Barbara County and the state of California,&quot; an Exxon spokeswoman said.    Currently, there are about 22 oil drilling platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel area, the coastal commission said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Exxon closed at $42.25 a share, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
