The V-22 Osprey, the world's first production tilt-rotoraircraft, remained in helicopter mode throughout the flight,according to officials of Bell Boeing of Fort Worth, a consortium oftwo companies which built the craft.   Bell Boeing officials described tests in aircraft mode as ``amilestone soon to be accomplished.''   The V-22 Osprey performed both a slow taxi liftoff and a verticaltakeoff during the landmark maneuvers and made conventional``run-on'' landings, the officials said. Its top speed during thetests was limited to 20 knots, less than 25 mph.   The aircraft combines the operational capabilities of ahelicopter with those of a fixed-wind turboprop. With its enginesand prop-rotors vertical, the V-22 takes off, hovers and lands likea helicopter.   With its prop-rotors in forward position, the Osprey would becomea fast, fuel-efficient, high-altitude turboprop airplane capable ofreaching speeds of more than 345 mph.   Boeing Helicopters President Don Chesnut said the Osprey givesthe U.S. military ``the ability to develop new missions and tacticsthat cannot be accomplished by any existing helicopter or airplane.''   Six flight-test prototypes are being built by Bell HelicopterTextron Inc. in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia, adivision of Boeing Co., under a $1.8 billion full-scale developmentcontract issued by the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command.   The versatile Osprey is the first modern weapons system designedfrom conception to meet requirements of all four U.S. armedservices, with deliveries expected to begin in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
