The public was given 30days in which to comment. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) questionedthe exemption of the Civil Division Case File System under section (j)(2)of the Privacy Act. The Department has advised OMB that the Consumer LitigationBranch of the Civil Division has responsibility for the prosecution ofcriminal statutes, such as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21U.S.C. 301 <T3>et seq.</T3>), as well as civil statutes. Accordingly, this systemof records is appropriately exempted pursuant to subsection (j)(2). Withoutthe exemption, the criminal law enforcement records in this system couldnot be legally protected from disclosure.This order relates to individuals rather than small business entities.Nevertheless, pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, it is hereby stated that the order will not have``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 16 Administrative Practice and Procedure,Courts, Freedom of Information, Privacy and Sunshine Acts. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> The authority for this rule is 5 U.S.C. 552a.
