The results from PacTel and Ameritech had been expected byanalysts. Nevertheless, they underscore the damage thatrecession has inflicted on even the nation's more resilientcompanies.</LP><TEXT>   PacTel, based in San Francisco, experienced its firstdecline in its rate of growth since the 1984 breakup ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. that created the BabyBells, said Frank J. Governali, telecommunications analyst atFirst Boston Corp. PacTel's phone-line growth was 2.7% in thequarter, compared with &quot;an already slow&quot; 3% in this year'ssecond quarter, he said, and the Baby Bells &quot;are entering newbusinesses which won't pay off for some time.&quot;   &quot;Significant changes are taking place in the economy andthe industry,&quot; said PacTel chairman Sam Ginn. &quot;But we areresponding to them by growing new businesses, developing newservices, competing harder and holding down our costs.&quot;   PacTel's third-quarter net income fell 3.5% to $275million, or 70 cents a share, from $285 million, or 72 centsa share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 1.2% in the quarter to$2.5 billion from $2.47 billion.   Net for the first nine months rose 2.8% to $857 million,or $2.17 a share, from $834 million, or $2.09 a share.   At Ameritech, based in Chicago, third-quarter net washelped by a one-time after-tax gain from the initial publicoffering of Telecom Corp. of New Zealand shares. Net was up22% to $379.4 million, or $1.43 a share, from $311.2 million,or $1.18 a share. But without the special gain, net wouldhave been $305.8 million, or $1.15 a share, a 1.7% decline,Ameritech said. Revenue rose 1.4% to $2.7 billion from $2.67billion. Phone line growth was weak at 1.7%, &quot;a function ofslow housing starts,&quot; a spokesman said.   Ameritech's net for the nine months was essentially flatat $966.3 million, or $3.64 a share, compared with $967million, or $3.64 a share. Excluding the one-time gain, itwas down 7.6% to $892.7 million, or $3.37 a share. Revenuewas $8.1 billion, a 1.4% increase.   The lackluster profits are an indication that cost-cuttingprograms at both companies aren't keeping pace with sluggishrevenue growth. At Pacific Bell, PacTel's largest phonecompany, net dropped 6% to $263 million from $280 million ayear earlier on a 1.6% increase in revenue to $2.24 billion.   PacTel's cellular service revenue was $151 million, 24%more than $122 million a year earlier. Profit grew 4.2% to$22.2 million. Ameritech doesn't report its cellular-serviceresults separately.   All of this contrasts sharply with the performance of GTECorp., which continues to outrun the Baby Bells, thanks to amassive cost-cutting program. GTE reported this week that itsnet rose 5.7% to $462 million, or 51 cents a share, from $437million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. It said netwould have risen 9% if results had included cellularproperties it added in last year's fourth quarter. GTE'srevenue was $5.36 billion, up slightly from $5.33 billion ayear earlier.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,PacTel shares were quoted at $41, down 37.5 cents, whileAmeritech shares were quoted at $60.625, down 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
