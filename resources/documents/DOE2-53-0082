It is only in relatively recent years that the myriadof parameters bearing on daughter retentivity have been estimated sufficientlyprecisely to allow thermal as well as chronological information to beinferred from minerals in simple cooling systems. A variety of mineralages from a plutonic rock often yield a spectrum of dates. When plottedagainst a measure of their respective closure temperatures, these datacan reveal the cooling trajectory of the terrane permitting some insightsinto the underlying physical processes responsible for crustal evolution.In cases of multi-stage thermal histories, the paired U-Pb decay systemin accessory phases and the {sup 40}Ar/{sup 39}Ar age spectrum approachcan see through this complication by providing an additional dimension:assessment of the degree of disturbance recorded by the mineral system.For example, the authors laboratory experiments defining kinetic parametersnever free us from the nagging doubt that a different diffusion mechanismmay dominate on geological timescales. Nevertheless, many successfulapplications of radiometric data to problems of thermal history havebeen published including such diverse aspects as cooling rates (speedometry),uplift (odometry) and burial history of sedimentary basins (oil thermometry).</TEXT></DOC>
