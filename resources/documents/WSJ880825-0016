Total output of the 13 exporters reached a new peak for the year of more than 20 million barrels a day only last week, according to the latest surveys by leading monitors of OPEC production. For the month, production is expected to average well over 19 million barrels a day, according to figures compiled separately by Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva and Petroleum Economics Ltd. of London.    That will be sharply higher than in July and as many as two million barrels a day above OPEC's theoretical production ceiling. Such high output in the seasonally weak third quarter could shake oil markets out of their listless August doldrums, analysts said.    Yesterday, world oil prices continued to drift in a relatively narrow trading range. On European spot markets, North Sea Brent crudes ended the day's sluggish trading unchanged to five cents a barrel lower. On U.S. futures markets, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery closed at $15.68, down two cents a barrel.    But petroleum analysts expect prices to weaken further in the weeks ahead as the increased flow of OPEC oil reaches consuming nations. As many as one million barrels a day will have to go into already burdensome inventories, some said. Nevertheless, many still expect some price recovery later in the year because of the usual fourth-quarter seasonal increase in oil consumption.    Charles L. McSpadden, manager of petroleum analysis at Bonner andamp; Moore Market Consultants, said that while the current high OPEC output &quot;precludes any price hike back up to $18&quot; -- the cartel's official benchmark based on several crudes -- &quot;we think $16 can still hold for the basket for the end of the year.&quot; That would be up from the current average of around $14 a barrel for the OPEC crudes. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, is generally priced $1.50 to $1.75 a barrel higher than the OPEC basket average.    Because of OPEC overproduction, Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., has again lowered his West Texas Intermediate price estimate for the full year. His new estimate calls for an average 1988 price of $16.60 a barrel, down from his earlier projection of $17.75 a barrel. But he expects the 1988 low point to be in the third quarter -- with the fourth-quarter price rising more than $1 a barrel.    According to trackers of OPEC output, neither Iran nor Iraq yet shares in the production surge despite last Saturday's cease-fire in their eight-year war. But production does run above quota in most other Mideast countries, including Saudi Arabia, which has been actively chartering tankers, perhaps for storage.    &quot;The fixtures (tanker charters) are extremely high for future loadings in the Middle East,&quot; said Robert Boslego, whose Winchester, Mass., consulting firm monitors tanker activity.    Although estimates vary widely, production in Kuwait is said to be 40% above its quota of one million barrels a day. But the pacesetter is the United Arab Emirates -- the controversial subject of the meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee early this month. That nation, which previously proclaimed that it would ignore its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels a day, is estimated to be producing as many as 1.7 million barrels daily, well above a targeted 1.5 million.    OPEC's excess output should be selfcorrecting eventually. Because of high profit margins this summer, refiners have been snapping up OPEC's bargain-priced crudes. But they may have to slow their buying soon either because of a softening in petroleum product prices or because crude storage tanks will be full.    Paradoxically, that could suggest some firming of petroleum prices unless the producers discount even more to maintain the higher volumes. &quot;As buyers back off, they will work down their inventories, and the drawdowns could stabilize and strengthen the (crude) market,&quot; said Ken Miller, a senior principal in Purvin andamp; Gertz energy consultants. </TEXT></DOC>
