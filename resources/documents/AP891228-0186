ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumers are paying more than $1 a gallon forhome heating oil in many parts of the country as cold weathercontinues to deplete supplies and drive prices higher.   But oil users aren't the only ones in a bind. Prices are risingfor other fuels and some utilities are asking natural gas customersto limit consumption.   In Philadelphia, a gallon of heating oil at one distributor wentfrom $1.35 Wednesday morning to $1.40 in the afternoon. InWestchester County, N.Y., just north of New York City, the averageprice of home heating oil was $1.35 a gallon, up 27 percent in justa month.   The cold weather has kept demand, and in turn, prices, runninghigh. Transportation problems and refinery shutdowns havecomplicated the situation.   ``The increases are incredible and they're coming just aboutevery day, from a penny to a nickel per gallon,'' said W. ClaiborneCoupland Jr., marketing director for Papco Oil Co., a supplier insoutheastern Virginia.   Oil prices are high even in places where the weather has beentemperate.   In Seattle, where temperatures have been running in the 40s,slightly above normal for this time of the year, heating oil wasselling for nearly $1.02 a gallon. In Portland, Ore., wheretemperatures ranged from the 30s to the 50s, heating oil costs asmuch as $1.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, home heating oil fordelivery in January soared 7.23 cents Wednesday to 99.71 cents agallon _ 37 cents higher than the Nov. 30 price and up sharply from53.77 cents a gallon a year earlier. On Tuesday, the contract rose10.74 cents.   In early trading today, the contract rose another 2.29 cents to$1.02 a gallon.   A contract comprises 42,000 gallons of oil, which means onecontract for heating oil would cost $41,878 at Wednesday's price.However, the price paid by most distributors _ the people whodeliver oil by tanker truck to residential customers _ was $1.15 agallon Wednesday in what is known as the New York spot, or cash,market.   ``It's very cold outside and the inventories of heating oil gotdangerously low and it's difficult to get heating oil here prior tothe second half of January,'' said James Fiedler, an analyst withE.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   Shutdowns at many refineries have worsened supply problems anddriven prices even higher.   The most prominent shutdown was of a huge Exxon facility atBaton Rouge, La., where a weekend explosion killed two workers. Butproduction at many Gulf Coast refineries has been slowed because offrozen water pipes _ just when the oil companies were trying tostep up their output to meet the increased demand.   ``It seems like every refinery was affected,'' Fiedler said.``Most of the refineries have got some of their units back tonormal ... and most were talking that they'd be back to fulloperation by the weekend.''   Oil companies continued to report low heating oil supplies atsome terminals.   At Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate, supplies weretightest in the Boston area, spokesman Top Ingram said. Star hasbegun limiting the amount of oil its customers can buy, he said.   Freezing temperatures also have increased the demand for propaneand kerosene.   In South Carolina, deliveries of the two fuels have beenhampered by icy roads and a shortage of supplies, dealers said.Some suppliers said they were raising their prices and givingpriority to long-time customers.   Propane prices have risen about 10 cents to $1 a gallon duringthe last two weeks, while kerosene prices have risen 20 cents agallon, to 80 cents, dealers said.   In Iowa, state officials said prices for liquid propane forresidential consumers have increased from under 50 cents a gallonlast month to a range of 80 cents to 95 cents a gallon.   Natural gas customers, while not facing delivery problems ofoil, propane and kerosene users, also suffered shortages because ofincreased demand.   Philadelphia Gas Works, a city-owned system, on Wednesday askedits 517,000 residential, commerical and industrial customers to cutback consumption.   PGW spokesman Don Kenley said the company's two main suppliers,Texas Eastern Corp. and Transcontinental Pipeline Corp., cutsupplies by 28 percent because of higher demand.   Even wood was in short supply in some areas.   Walter Holdsworth, owner of Wakefield Firewood Inc. inWakefield, Va., said his wood lot was empty Friday for the firsttime in 10 years. The rush began, he said, about three weeks agowhen the cold weather first set in.</TEXT></DOC>
