Inspectors for the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the company, a major Navy contractor, on allegations of unsafe practices including exposing workers to asbestos-laden dust, radiation and raw sewage in some work areas.    The agency said that investigators documented more than 3,000 instances in which Bath allegedly failed to meet federal safety and health requirements.    The fine, the largest ever proposed against one concern, also listed 641 record-keeping violations. Among them were charges that shipyard officials failed to record serious injuries and illnesses such as amputations, fractures, and respiratory diseases resulting from overexposure to toxic substances.    John Pendergrass, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said the proposed fine is a result of &quot;a complete breakdown in the shipbuilder's safety and health program.&quot; He called conditions at the shipyard a &quot;serious threat&quot; to workers.    Bath Chairman William Haggett called the proposed fine &quot;grossly excessive&quot; and said he's confident it will be substantially reduced either as a result of informal conferences with OSHA officials or through a formal appeal to the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The company has 15 working days to appeal the citations.    Mr. Haggett called it &quot;sickening&quot; that Bath Iron Works would be the target of such a large fine after its recent efforts to improve safety conditions. &quot;A fine of that magnitude should be reserved for businesses that operate with a criminal intent or gross disregard for the well-being of people. That has never been the case here,&quot; he said.    OSHA inspectors, who began their investigation May 4, alleged in their report that the following conditions existed at the shipyard:    --Asbestos-laden dust was found in areas deemed free of the substance by Bath supervisors.    --Employees doing plumbing repairs on ships were routinely sprayed with raw sewage because the company refused to drain the lines before work began or provide personal protective equipment.    --Workers were required to enter confined spaces that weren't adequately tested for flammable or toxic vapors.    --Proper respirators were unavailable to employees who removed asbestos or cleaned with toxic solvents.    --Radar and microwave antennae were routinely tested with workers nearby, exposing the workers to radiation.    --The company erected a new kind of prefabricated scaffolding that it knew was defective after assuring OSHA inspectors it wouldn't be used until repairs were made.    OSHA's previous record for a proposed fine against a single company was for $2.6 million against IBP Inc., a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp.    ---   Diane Tracy in Boston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
