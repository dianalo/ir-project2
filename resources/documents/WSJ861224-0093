The department proposed a $244,960 fine.    The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Shell for 61 instances of &quot;willfully&quot; violating federal record-keeping requirements. The company allegedly failed to report injuries including burns, strains of the back, cervical, groin and shoulder areas, contusions and inhalations of toxic substances.    The agency also cited the firm for three &quot;serious&quot; violations involving respirator hazard information and shower and wash facility requirements.    Shell denied the allegation of willful record-keeping violations at its Deer Park Manufacturing Complex, which is located along the Houston ship channel. The company said it will challenge the charges.    OSHA said the citations resulted from an inspection begun last June at Shell's hydrogen sulfide manufacturing units at Deer Park, a refinery and chemical manufacturing complex that employs 2,800 people. Shell Oil is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The inspection was part of a special agency effort to look at the chemical industry.    A &quot;willful&quot; violation is defined as one in which an employer knew rules were being violated, or was aware that a hazardous condition existed and yet made no reasonable effort to eliminate it. A &quot;serious&quot; violation is one where there's a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result, and the employer knew or should have known of the hazard.    The company has 15 days to contest the citation to an OSHA review board.    Shell cited a difference in interpretation of what data it must report to federal officials. &quot;In 32 previous visits over more than 10 years, OSHA has never challenged our (Deer Park facility) record-keeping procedures,&quot; the company said. Shell added that the 61 citations &quot;have nothing to do with worker health and safety.&quot;    The federal action follows several similar citations issued recently by OSHA. Earlier this year, the agency cited USX Corp. for alleged record-keeping violations and proposed $130,000 in penalties. Similar citations were issued against Monsanto Co., and Chrysler Corp., with proposed penalties of $55,000 and $910,000 respectively.    Last spring, OSHA proposed a $1.4 million fine, the biggest penalty in its history, against Union Carbide Corp. for alleged health and safety violations, including record-keeping infractions. </TEXT></DOC>
