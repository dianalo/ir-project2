Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush won nearly every Super Tuesday contest and set off down the path to the Republican presidential nomination.    Left gasping in his wake were Sen. Robert Dole, who finished a distant second in the race for 753 delegates in 17 states, and former Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, who came in third and even lost the vote of evangelical Christians to the vice president.    The fourth contender, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, came in last and is expected to drop out of the race tomorrow.    Southern Republican voters, who overwhelmingly approve President Reagan's performance in office, simply transferred their support to Mr. Bush, the man they consider his logical heir. Mr. Bush won just about everything in sight, including one state Mr. Dole had specially hoped to carry, North Carolina, the home of the Senate minority leader's wife, Elizabeth. The only state that was really close was Missouri; late last night results from the Washington state caucuses weren't available.    Because eight of the GOP contests are winner-take-all by congressional district (and by statewide totals for at-large delegates), Mr. Bush was on course to roll up a huge number of delegates for next summer's national convention.    Estimates indicated the vice president's bag after Super Tuesday will be more than 600 delegates. He needs 1,139 to win the nomination, so he's more than halfway there and leads his nearest rival, Sen. Dole, by a lopsided 3-to-1 margin.    The vice president said yesterday's results &quot;exceeded my fondest expectations. I'm going to be the next president.&quot;    Sen. Dole and his campaign team knew Super Tuesday and its 14 primaries in or on the edge of the South spelled trouble, but the results were catastrophe. He tried to put the best face on it, looking forward to next week's Illinois primary.    &quot;I'm going to start my road to recovery again in Illinois, just like I did 40 years ago,&quot; Sen. Dole said. Forty years ago, he was still hospitalized, recovering from grievous wounds he suffered during World War II.    If Mr. Dole doesn't win Illinois -- and, given yesterday's result, winning there seems a towering challenge -- his campaign is finished.    His first reaction to his defeat was a classic loser's move: He challenged Mr. Bush, the winner, to a series of town-hall debates, one-on-one without a moderator, in Illinois.    Mr. Bush rejected the challenge. &quot;We have a strategy that has been highly successful,&quot; said Mr. Bush's spokesman, Pete Teeley, &quot;and we plan to pursue it -- and that doesn't include having one-on-one debates with Bob Dole.&quot;    Mr. Bush not only was carrying nearly every state, he was carrying them big. For instance, he was winning over 60% of the vote in Texas, Florida and Alabama. South or North, it didn't seem to make much difference: He was winning in Massachusetts with more than 55% of the vote.    The man critics had called &quot;the wimp&quot; was running a political juggernaut that was crushing the opposition.    One thing Mr. Bush can do, it turns out, is run (or let his appointees run) a smooth, well-oiled organization. From the start, he was better organized than his opponents, so well organized that he could survive a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and come back to win the New Hampshire primary.    Mr. Bush has brought no special message to voters, except that he is the president's loyal vice president. His favorite issue seems to be that he champions a budget line-item veto. But he always has been self-possessed, moving imperiously from place to place in Air Force Two.    Sen. Dole's campaign, on the other hand, has been chaotic. He failed to capitalize on its victory in Iowa and appeared handcuffed in trying to respond to Mr. Bush's comeback in New Hampshire. Sen. Dole has always had trouble running smooth operations. He is sometimes an angry man, and as the campaign has drawn on, he has grown increasingly weary. He has let his anger show.    He is also a pragmatic politician, so he hasn't had much of a message either. He argues that he gets things done as a congressional leader, while Mr. Bush has left no footprints on White House policy.    Underlying Mr. Bush's success, 80% or more of Southern Republican voters approve of President Reagan's performance, according to NBC News figures. About two in three GOP voters said they thought Mr. Bush is tough enough to be president. Mr. Bush scored well with voters who consider themselves &quot;very conservative&quot; -- anywhere from a fifth to a third of Tuesday's voters. And he led in every state among voters who consider themselves born-again Christians, a group Mr. Robertson had expected would support him.    Those who voted for Mr. Dole felt less enthusiastic about their candidate than those who voted for Mr. Bush and Mr. Robertson, according to NBC poll figures.    Mr. Robertson, the early phenomenon in the race, vowed, &quot;I can carry all the way to New Orleans.&quot; He said he failed to concentrate as hard as he should have in some states and that, while his campaign wasn't bad for an amateur, it wasn't as good as he expected.    He said, &quot;I right now am going to be the rallying point for those who don't want George Bush as the nominee of the party. If they want a conservative alternative, I'll be the one.&quot;    He said he is pledged to support the party's nominee. But there is a question of how enthusiastic he would be if Mr. Bush heads the ticket.    ---   Rich Jaroslovsky contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
