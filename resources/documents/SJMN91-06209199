An extraordinary congress, the party's highest decision-making body,has been called for November or December to ratify the most sweeping changesin communist ideology since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SOVIET COMMUNISTS ENDORSE PLURALISM, PRIVATEPROPERTY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;We face the need for deep-rooted changes in our entire understanding ofsocialism. We are not going to find the answers to our questions within theframework of the old model,&quot; Gorbachev told the Central Committee in aconcluding speech. &quot;The model that was imposed on the party and society duringseveral decades has suffered a strategic defeat.&quot;;    The closed-door meetingappears to have taken place in a remarkably conciliatory atmosphere, belyingwidespread predictions that hard-line Communists would use the occasion toprovoke an open split in the party. In contrast to earlier sessions, therewere no demands that Gorbachev step down from his position as generalsecretary of the party.;    Central Committee members did, however, reactangrily to a recent decree by Russian republic President Boris Yeltsinoutlawing Communist Party cells in the republic's factories and governmentinstitutions. Gorbachev agreed to use his constitutional powers as Sovietpresident to overturn the decree, which would deprive the party of a majorsource of revenue and political authority.;    Despite Gorbachev's success atthe party meeting, some analysts said the unity may be more apparent thanreal. The analysts said conservatives seemed from their comments afterward tobe intent on mounting a full-scale assault on Gorbachev and his policies atthe party congress.;    &quot;This is a tactical victory for Gorbachev, but onlytactical,&quot; Alexander Buzgalin, a leading conservative member of the CentralCommittee, told reporters as he left the Kremlin. &quot;This is formal unity, notreal unity, with the majority conforming. If a split occurs, it will be at thecongress.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910727  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  387  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 27, 199100209199,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
