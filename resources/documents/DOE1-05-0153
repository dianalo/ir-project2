The following stages of systemsanalysis are evaluated: development of information retrieval systems,classifiers and thesauri of equipment failures and downtime, methodsfor planning and conducting reliability tests of new elements, partsand subsystems of mine haulage equipment. Mathematical experiment theory(hypothesis adoption principle) is used. The following elements of thereliability control system have been developed: software for automaticon-line data processing, an algorithm and optimization program for controlof spare part consumption, a model for automatic control of equipmentservice, operation and fault detection, a model for analysis of equipmentdurability and determining economic service life of mine haulage equipment.The elements of subsystems that reduce equipment reliability are selected.Methods for increasing their reliability are recommended (electric sparkhardening, plasma spraying, powder metallurgy methods). When these methodswere used service life of the elements characterized by high wear increased2 to 3 times.</TEXT></DOC>
