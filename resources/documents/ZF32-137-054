(P.C. letter offers educational discount; willbegin electronic distribution; has new office address)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>EDUCATIONAL DISCOUNT: Since becoming involved in a project to create softwarefor classroom use  called the Foundation for Educational Software), I'vebecome much more sensitized to just how little money is available ineducational institutions for staying informed about computing, even thoughthe need is greatest.andP;  So we are going to do our little bit by offering asubstantial discount on subscriptions to P. C Letter sent to educationalinstitutions.andP;  Effective immediately, anybody who works for a non-profit,educational institution can now acquire a regular, one-year subscription tothe newsletter for a special price of $95.00.andP;  (We are offering this to anyeducational institution, private or public, at any level - elementary,secondary, graduate, or post-graduate.) Since we are offering what iseffectively an 80% discount on the newsletter, we are not offering anyservice on these orders: they must be prepaid in full by check or credit cardbefore we will begin fulfilling the subscription.andP;  In addition, we will bediligent about policing the discount to ensure that the subscribers really dowork for educational institutions and that they're non-profit.andM;We have already made an effort to identify our existing educationalsubscribers and will renew them automatically at the new price (we are unableto provide any refunds on existing subscriptions), but it would be in yourbest interest to send us a note telling us that you qualify so that we won'tshow the wrong price on your renewal notice.andM;ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION: We have decided that we can begin generaldistribution of the newsletter through at least one electronic-mail service.andO;As many readers know from past coverage, we made the decision some time agothat we did not want to distribute the newsletter by electronic means becausewe were not willing to lose all of the newsletter's text formatting and pagecomposition.andP;  We think that the appearance of the newsletter has as much todo with how people feel about the letter as the content and we want to beable to preserve that appearance in an electronic medium.andM;After much experimentation (much to the chagrin of our corporate subscribersat Apple Computer Europe), we have finally figured out how to reliablydistribute the newsletter on Applelink, the electronic mail service thatApple maintains for its employees, dealers, large accounts, and softwaredevelopers.andP;  Effective immediately, we are offering any subscriber the optionof getting the electronic edition of P. C. Letter via Applelink We've decidedthat this is a service we should offer to our subscribers in the normalcourse of business, so we are offering Applelink distribution as a no-costoption for any paid subscriber.The Applelink edition is exactly the same asthe print edition (which we will continue sending to subscribers that choosethe electronic edition), with one exception - we have had to use fonts thatevery Macintosh user has in their system folder and have substituted Timesfor the Century Old Style that we use in the body text and headlines andHelvetica for the Avant Garde that we use in the callouts and boilerplatetext.andP;  The other difference is that subscribers will get the Applelinkedition from two to ten days earlier than the print edition, depending onwhere they are located in the world (two days earlier around San Francisco,where we mail the print edition, and up to ten days earlier in Europe and theMiddle East, even though we send the letter by airmail to destinationsoutside North America).andM;The file format in which we are distributing P. C Letter is called Linksaver,which is a utility bundled with Applelink that creates a bit-mapped image ofa document.andP;  Since Linksaver comes with every Applelink package, we candepend on every Applelink subscriber being able to view and print theApplelink edition of P. C Letter.andP;  There are other ways to view this fileformat: Linksaver is also bundled with America Online's software.andP;  Inaddition, the developer of Linksaver, Solutions Inc., sells a superset ofLinksaver as an independent product called Super Glue Il.andP;  As well, Solutionshas developed a way to send binary attachments to MCI Mail messages using aformat originally developed for Lotus Express.andP;  We will also send theApplelink edition to subscribers via America Online, if they would prefer.andO;And we will also send it via MCI Mail, if the subscribers have eitherCommgate, Solutions'  MCI Mail gateway for Microsoft Mail and Quickmail, orDesktop Express, Solution's custom interface for MCI Mail, developed for DowJones.)andM;To sign up or get further information, please contact our PublicationsManager, Tammie Schmutzler via Applelink: SCHMUTZLER.T, MCI Mail: 437-4291,or America Online: TammieSchm.andM;PHYSICAL MAIL: In case you have ignored or missed our notices, we have movedour office to a new building across the street.andP;  While our phone and faxnumbers remain the same, we have a new street address which is: 301 IslandParkway, Suite 201, Belmont, CA 940024109 USA Please update your mailinglists, updates, black books, and other forms of address keeping.andP;  The lasttime we changed offices we still had people sending us mail at the oldaddress nearly two years after the move.andP;  Let's see if the computer industryhas gotten any better at managing its data in the past three years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
