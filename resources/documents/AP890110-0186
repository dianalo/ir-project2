Charles S. Whitehouse, assistant defense secretary for specialoperations and low-intensity conflict, said the 131-page book brokelittle new ground in describing terrorist groups around the worldbut should be helpful as a comprehensive reference document.   ``This is not an intelligence document, but rather a compilationof open-source material that has been verified by classifiedsources,'' Whitehouse added.   ``Copies will be distributed starting today to public governmentagencies, to public libraries as well as to government libraries. Itwill also be distributed to law enforcement activities, diplomaticposts and domestic and overseas Department of Defense components andactivities,'' he said.   Whitehouse said the publication had nothing to do with recentReagan administration claims that Libya is building a plant thatcould supply chemical weapons to terrorists.   Work on the book began in mid-1987, he said, adding the UnitedStates has no evidence that any terrorist group has actually triedto use chemical weapons in an attack.   ``But the fact that weapons of this kind have been used in therecent past (in Iran and Iraq) and are available makes thelikelihood of their being used (by terrorists) greater than it was ayear or two ago,'' he said.   The book, ``Terrorist Group Profiles,'' describes the Abu Nidalgroup in the Middle East as ``the most dangerous terroristorganization in existence.''   A second Defense Department official with ties to theintelligence community, who appeared with Whitehouse Tuesday oncondition he not be identified, said Abu Nidal received thatdescription because of ``the indiscriminate nature of theirtargeting.''   ``When Abu Nidal wants to send a message to a government ... wehave not seen for the most part select assassinations of thatgovernment's leaders, but attacks on the population of thecountry,'' the official said.   ``That kind of indiscriminate targeting, and the tremendousoperational security under which Abu Nidal operates, makes it a verylethal, dangerous group,'' the official said.   The official declined to discuss details of the investigation ofthe recent bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland. But he saidthe United States knows of ``eight different groups that havesuccessfully detonated a bomb on an aircraft in flight that resultedin 11 different aircraft (incidents).''   ``So the technology ... (of building such a bomb) is morewidespread than I think is generally understood by people,'' theofficial said.   The official said that while Libya appears to be increasing itssupport of terrorism around the world, Iran must still be consideredthe world's top supporter of terrorism.</TEXT></DOC>
