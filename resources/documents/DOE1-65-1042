<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-65-1042 </DOCNO><TEXT>The determination of uranium series disequilibria in fluvial environmentsis proposed as a method of calculating catchment mass balances. The techniqueis based on two main principles. Firstly, /sup 234/U is more mobile than/sup 238/U, especially during the early stages of weathering. Secondly,uranium is far more mobile than either thorium or protactinium. Consequently,leaching during weathering results in the loss of the uranium found inthe fresh rock, leaving the two immobile daughters behind. The ratioof uranium carried by sediment to that dissolved, Usub(s)/Usub(w) can,therefore, be determined from river water and sediment isotopic activityratios. Fluxes of uranium can then be calculated from average concentrationsin the water and the associated sediment, from which a sediment yieldcan be inferred. The Witham catchment in Lincolnshire has been used totest the proposed method. A Usub(S)/Usub(W) ratio of between 5 and 7is determined and a sediment yield of 2.51 +- 2.12 tonnes yr/sup -1/km/sup -2/ is proposed. The validity of the approach is confirmed bythe close correspondence between the results and those inferred by earlierworkers using more conventional methods.</TEXT></DOC>
