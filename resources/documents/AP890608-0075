The short, paid advertisement included a telephone number inEngland, an apparent effort to initiate contact with Waite'skidnappers.   The message, wishing Waite a ``belated happy birthday'' fromcolleagues in London, appeared on page three of the independentAn-Nahar daily.   Waite, a Church of England envoy, was on his fifth Beirut missionto seek freedom for hostages when he disappeared Jan. 20, 1987.   He had left his hotel in Moslem west Beirut for a rendezvous,apparently with representatives of Islamic Jihad, or Islamic holywar, which holds U.S. hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.   Waite never returned, and no group has claimed responsibility fortaking him hostage. He is among 15 foreign hostages, including nineAmericans, held captive in Lebanon. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the longest held of theforeign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
