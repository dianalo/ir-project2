In addition to prompt thermal effects and fire starts,spread may also be an important factor on the battlefield. In this report,a model describing the initiation and spread of battlefield fires ispresented. The initial ignition distribution is related to the weaponyield, slant range, local atmospheric properties, fuel type, and ignitionthreshold. The fire-spread analysis is based on an established U.S. ForestService prediction algorithm. The present tactical ignition and fire-spread(TIFS) model predicts the fire movement over variable terrains and accountsfor ambient wind vectors, moisture, changing vegetation, and an arbitrarynumber of firebreaks. An example calculation illustrating the initial-firearea and subsequent spread in a complex terrain is presented for a 10-kTexplosion. The results show the fires extending the effective weapon-damageradius and identify regions to which the fires do not spread.</TEXT></DOC>
