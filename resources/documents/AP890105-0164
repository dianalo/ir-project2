SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The narrow case that Independent CounselLawrence Walsh has carved out against Oliver North targets thecover-up of the Iran-Contra money diversion and contains the chargeseven Walsh's critics thought were most likely to succeed.   But the former White House aide would no longer be charged with adirect crime for diverting money from Iranian arms sales to theNicaraguan Contras.   Walsh proposed Thursday to skirt a raging dispute over whatclassified documents can be introduced by defense and prosecution bydropping charges of conspiracy and theft of government property.Those were the only remaining counts which charged a crime indiverting the money.   But if U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell accepts Walsh's motion,North would still face 12 charges.   Those 12 carry a cumulative, maximum penalty of 60 years inprison and $3 million in fines, although federal judges simply donot sentence first offenders to consecutive, maximum penalties onall counts which produce guilty verdicts.   Nine of these counts charge North with trying to preventdiscovery of his activities on behalf of the Contras, includingmisleading Congress and Attorney General Edwin Meese and shreddingand altering government documents.   The three other counts charge North with accepting a gratuity,converting money to personal use and scheming to defraud theTreasury of tax revenue.   Of the nine cover-up-based counts, four relate directly toconcealing the diversion of arms sale money.   It is these four that longtime government prosecutors, speakingprivately, always thought were Walsh's strongest charges.   From the outset, Walsh confronted some legal problems. The Bolandamendment barring aid to the Contras did not carry its own criminalpenalties; some had argued it did not apply to the National SecurityCouncil where North worked.   The conspiracy charge that Walsh fashioned to embrace the entirediversion effort was by no means unprecedented but it was anaggressive use of the law to deal with these legal problems. Evenformer top Justice Department officials were more comfortable withthe theft of government property charge which was based on thediversion of the arm sale money.   But Walsh's allies and critics alike were most impressed withfour cover-up charges based on North's actions after the sale ofU.S.-built missiles to Iran was disclosed in early November 1986.   These counts charge North with obstructing Congress, obstructinga presidential inquiry by Meese, false statements and removing,falsifying and destroying official documents.   The obstruction of Congress count charges North helped draft afalse chronology to guide testimony by administration officials toCongress. Walsh charges he did this by having the document falselyclaim that no U.S. official learned before January 1986 that Hawkmissiles had been sold to Iran in November 1985. This count alsocharges him with altering, destroying and removing National SecurityCouncil documents between Nov. 21-25, 1986, that discussed the armssales and aid to the Contras.   The count of obstructing Meese's fact-finding inquiry forPresident Reagan charges North with falsely telling Meese in theattorney general's office on Nov. 23 that the National SecurityCouncil had no involvement in the diversion. This count alsomentions the document destruction and removal.   The false statements count charges North with falsely tellingMeese at the same meeting that the Israelis determined how much ofthe arms sale proceeds went to the Contras. This count also chargesthat North falsely advised Meese that he had told Contra leaderAdolfo Calero to open Swiss accounts to receive that money when heknew that the money had gone in accounts controlled by theSecord-Hakim enterprise.   The document destruction count says that from mid-November untilNorth's office was sealed by security agents on Nov. 25, 1986, healtered, destroyed and removed documents about the arms sales andaid to the Contras.   For the document case, Walsh gave immunity early on to North'ssecretary Fawn Hall in return for her description. Later, the publicheard her describe the shredding for Congress. To document the moneyflow, Walsh has Swiss bank records and the cooperation of Hakim'sassociate Willard Zucker.   Meese testified at length to Walsh's grand jury, surely includingwhat North told him. Other participants in drafting the phonychronology have recounted North's role.   The other five cover-up-based accounts charge North with falselydenying or causing others to falsely deny to Congress that North wasusing other means to help the Contras with cash and military advicebesides the arms sale diversion. These counts are all based onevents before the arms sale was disclosed.   The final three counts charge North with:   _Taking a $13,800 security system for his home from Secord inreturning for steering the Iran-Contra business to Secord.   _Paying personal expenses out of $4,300 in traveler's checksgiven to him by Calero to help free U.S. hostages in Lebanon.   _And conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue on $3.2million donated to the right-wing National Endowment for thePreservation of Liberty by telling donors gifts were tax-exempt whenthey were actually used for the non-tax-exempt purpose of militaryaid to the Contras.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Michael J.
