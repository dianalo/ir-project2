The bankruptcy threat came as part of an announcement thatthe debt-swap offer, which was to expire at midnight Tuesday,would be extended for a fourth time, to Oct. 22, as well assweetened in a way designed to attract minority holders.</LP><TEXT>   Ito-Yokado Co., operator of the company's 7-Eleven storesin Japan, also extended to Oct. 22 its offer to buy 70% ofSouthland for $430 million, cash desperately needed by thedebt-laden convenience store operators.   To complete the bailout, Southland needs tenders frombondholders representing 95% of each of five classes ofnotes. But Tuesday night it remained far short of that.Approvals from one class, the 16.75% notes, remained as lowas 45.6%.   To get around the 95% approval requirement, Southland saidit is considering filing a prepackaged bankruptcy plan. Insuch a case, a company enters court with a reorganizationplan already approved by 50% of its bondholders representingat least two-thirds of its debt. If the court approves theplan, minority holdouts are legally bound to it.   Southland predicted that it could complete a prepackagedbankruptcy within six months. It also said that Ito-Yokado&quot;presently&quot; was willing to consummate its bailout &quot;within thecontext of a prepackaged reorganization,&quot; if necessary.   Southland said it amended the debt-swap offer to include acash-election option for holders of less than $300,000 of itsnotes. The option gives such holders the right to trade theirexisting notes for cash instead of new debt. For instance,for each $1,000 principal amount of Southland 16.50% notes, aholder could receive $227.87 in cash. Such holders wouldstill participate in the proposed transfer of 25% ofSouthland common stock to bondholders. Observers say the cashoption is designed to bring hard-to-find minority holders outof the woodwork.   In July Southland, operator of about 6,700 7-Eleven andother convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went intodefault on debt taken on in its $4.9 billion 1987 leveragedbuy-out. Under its proposed bailout plan, Ito-Yokado wouldget 75% of the company, bondholders would get 25% and thefounding Thompson family of Dallas would see its stake shrinkto 5%.</TEXT></DOC>
