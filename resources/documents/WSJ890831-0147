Inside the terminal, the first of many long lines is at the currency exchange. The lady at the counter doesn't want to cash $300. She smiles and says &quot;too much, too much.&quot; I won't find enough to buy for that amount, she explains, exchanging only $200.    In town, in the square before the Hotel Victoria, stands a monument to Poland's war losses. The square is called &quot;Victory Square,&quot; but the eternal flame commemorates mainly defeats -- for example, the long days 50 years ago, in September 1939, when Poland resisted Hitler and Stalin.    At the hotel, two American senators, Paul Sarbanes and Alan Cranston, are talking excitedly in the lobby. &quot;There seems to be a recognition that Marxism-Leninism is not working,&quot; says Mr. Cranston. At the bar, a pack of Marlboros costs 7,000 zlotys, or one-quarter of a pensioner's monthly social security check.    Sunday, Aug. 20: As the 6 a.m. express for Gdansk prepares to depart, mounds of baggage line the platform. Potatoes and bread peek out of the pockets of suitcases -- in this uncertain economy, Poles choose to carry their dinner with them. When the train reaches the countryside, the flat brown-and-green landscape makes it easy to understand why so many Poles settled around Chicago. Foreign reporters fill the dining car, and an audience of amused Poles listens as they practice pronouncing the name of the prime minister-designate: &quot;mah-zo-VYET-ski.&quot; By the end of the three-hour trip some of us have opted for a nickname that's easier to enunciate: &quot;Maz.&quot;    &quot;God Save Poland&quot; and &quot;God Save Your Soul&quot; reads a cross outside Lech Walesa's home church, St. Brygida's, a friendly brick structure. Among the crowds waiting for Mr. Walesa and Maz are veterans sporting red-and-white armbands marked &quot;P,&quot; which stands for Pawiak prison, where they were put for fighting Hitler and Stalin. For decades these fighters have been ignored by the Communists. They are now getting their first recognition. Suddenly the crowd gets nervous. Maz is arriving in a Peugeot. Bells ring as Poles crowd into the church, along with reporters and TV crews. White-robed boys push the press back from the altar. Mass begins and a priest throws a splash of holy water on the press pack, dampening some cameras. A wilting Maz receives communion, and the sanctuary resounds with the clicks and whirs of camera shutters. Outside after Mass, a now-exhausted Maz is pushed forward to the front of a balcony that has reporters and local children clinging to its rails. An older lady in a knit-pink outfit behind me lectures a friend, &quot;In democracy you can do what you want.&quot;    Monday, Aug. 21: Back in Warsaw, where the offices of Tygodnik Solidarnosc are the center of much that is happening here. Until now, Maz has served as editor of this weekly newspaper. It became legal, as did Solidarity, only a few months ago. Wanda, the secretary, is a typical Solidarity veteran. She is a doctor, but hasn't been able to practice medicine since she was dismissed in 1981 for supporting Solidarity.    Rumors have it that the Communist Party is thinking of walking out on its new partnership with Solidarity. At Interpress, the government press agency, I copy down the Communist communique. &quot;The situation has been dangerously aggravated in Poland,&quot; it reads. &quot;The initiators of the rift will carry historic responsibility for losing a chance for the country's transition.&quot; Is this a crisis? An interpreter says &quot;no,&quot; the Communists are just rattling the bars on the new cage that has locked them out of absolute power.    Tuesday, Aug. 22: The interpreter turns out to be right, I learn at the office of Andrzej Barcikowski, a functionary in the ideological offices of the Central Committee. Six green telephones sit silent by his desk -- across from a bust of Lenin. Mr. Barcikowski had a hand in writing the communique; he says, with embarrassment, that it has &quot;perhaps been misinterpreted.&quot; He offers a lesson on dealing with Communist rhetoric. &quot;When you read a socialist document,&quot; he says, &quot;you have to disregard the words and see the meaning. Here the meaning is that we will work with Solidarity.&quot;    Actually, it's hard to find a Communist in Warsaw this week. All the officials I meet talk like Milton Friedman. In the morning I have coffee with Jerzy Jozwiak, the leader of the Democrats, who have, until recent weeks, spent decades as a Communist satellite party. &quot;The Democratic Party, which has always spoken for independence, has for the first time filled its words with substance,&quot; Mr. Jozwiak says proudly.    This afternoon I go to the Polish Parliament, the Sejm, a pleasant white building with marigolds bordering the lawn. Andrzej Bratkowski, a reformer Communist, says, &quot;The question does not concern whether to make the economy a market economy, but how to do it.&quot; The government's decision to index wages to inflation is &quot;the political rape of the economy.&quot; In my mind I dub him &quot;Mr. Small Is Beautiful,&quot; for he focuses on helping smaller companies. He is pessimistic about the government's chances. Outside, Poles also seem pessimistic. Photographers search in vain for mass demonstrations in support of Solidarity.    Wednesday, Aug. 23: In the green-walled hall at the Sjem, Maz is answering questions. One of the first is a complaint of the Solidarity Farmers. They are hurt because Solidarity has teamed up with the Peasants Party, until now also a partner of the Communists. &quot;We will make our own section in the Sejm,&quot; the spokesman for the Solidarity Farmers announces. When will the Solidarity government free the press? Soon, Maz says. He wants a model that's more objective, &quot;like the BBC.&quot; As for the 900,000 Communists who hold management positions in Poland, he says, &quot;We are going to have pluralism. I am not going to hunt witches. But I will take a look at their competence.&quot;    Maz gives me an interview in the afternoon. Close up, behind his editor's desk, the 62-year-old intellectual looks even more tired than in Gdansk. As he talks, he chainsmokes Marlboros and fingers his red paisley tie. Maz seems a careful man; he talks slowly. Asked about abortion, he puts his arms up behind his head and reflects. His conclusion: He personally is opposed to abortion, but is against stopping it with &quot;repressive means.&quot;    The office workers who helped the reporters to get in are as excited as we are. &quot;Write a good report of Poland,&quot; Wanda tells me as I go out.    Thursday, Aug. 24: A morning's shopping in Warsaw. Some 60 tired Poles queue in the lobby of Super Sam, a big food market. They haven't reached food lines yet; this is a line for shopping carts. Lots of items are for sale. Some prices: A container of yoghurt goes for about one American cent; jam goes for about four cents a pint; a liter of whole milk costs around three cents. It's easy to see why Poland's milk subsidy is greater than its defense budget. There is no sugar. To pay for their purchases, shoppers stand in yet another line.    At an outdoor flea market known as the Praga Bazaar, every imaginable denim product is available: skirts, jeans, change purses, handbags. A pair of Lee jeans goes for 85,000 zlotys, or two-thirds the average monthly salary. Some signs of the old Poland are here, too. One stand is doing brisk business in lacy wedding gowns. Prices: 130,000 and up. My interpreter tells me that when she got married, her mother failed to make it to the wedding. Mom had ordered a taxi, but it never came.    Back at the Sejm, the nation votes in a new government. The hands go up and the tally is clear: 378 for Maz, 4 against, and 41 abstaining. In one corner two colonels sit side by side. One votes for Maz, and one votes against him. Later, Col. Jozef Blaszcz explains why he voted against Maz. He fears Maz will be like his Communist predecessor. This is reported by a Solidarity leader, who quotes the colonel as saying of Maz: &quot;He is a journalist. His predecessor was a journalist, and look what happened.&quot;    Friday, Aug. 25: To visit Warsaw's Old Town is to see what Poles can accomplish. The Nazis razed the historic old section of the town. Poles built it again after the war, from old blueprints, old maps and memory. The gabled roofs, ochre walls and the cafes in this new old town are prettier than anything James Rouse, America's outdoor mallmaker, could have redeveloped. For a bit more than a dollar, I buy a Solidarity T-shirt from a boy selling them in the main square. On the way back I stop along the fishless Vistula, the river choked by pollution. I pause to look at the other side, where in August 1944 the Red Army sat and waited while the Nazis massacred the free Polish forces.    Saturday morning, Aug. 26: At the Victoria, I buy another pack of Marlboros. Now the price is 8,000, up a thousand from the beginning of the week. At the airport, a German businessman, who has been selling machines to make cigarettes, says he has &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about doing future joint ventures here.    As my plane lifts off the ground, my eye catches some words I'd heard and recorded in my notebook earlier in the week. They are a joke about the economic challenge facing Poland. &quot;Capitalism is to communism as an aquarium is to fish soup,&quot; a communist had told me. &quot;You can always turn the aquarium into fish soup -- all you have to do is cook and salt it. But try reversing the process, and turning fish soup into an aquarium of live creatures -- it's nearly impossible.&quot;    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial features editor of the Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
