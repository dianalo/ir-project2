But she was surprised and outraged when she was billed $5.78 fora two-minute phone call from St. Petersburg, Fla., to her home inProvidence, R.I., by a company she had never heard of.   ``When I saw this, I said what's going on? Their rates aretriple ATandamp;T rates,'' said Ms. Rossi. ``But it wasn't just themoney. I thought someone should explain'' why the call hadn't beenhandled by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., whose credit cardnumber she gave the operator and whose price for the call wouldhave been less than $2, she said.   The company that handled the call was Central Corp., based inFort Lauderdale, Fla., one a few dozen ``alternative operatorservices,'' or AOS, companies that are raising concerns amongfederal and state regulators because of an increasing number ofconsumer complaints of price-gouging.   The companies are providing operator services to hotels,hospitals, universities and private pay-phone vendors in a $7billion a year market that until recently was handled almostentirely by ATandamp;T.   AOS companies blame the complaints primarily on billing errors,and they say theirs is a young and growing industry that customershaven't gotten used to yet.   ``We deserve some of the criticism,'' said Lester Freeman,president of Central. ``We've had a shrt but precipitous learningcurve. We've made a lot of mistakes, but we've done a lot right,too.''   At an establishment served by an AOS company, callers who dial``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator getsbilling information and then sends the call over a line the AOSleases from one of the long-distance carriers.   Many of the callers who get connected to an AOS company arethose using a credit card issued by a local Bell operating companyor ATandamp;T, since those cards require callers to start by dialing``0.'' AOS companies say their operators identify their companiesand that callers can request that they be transfered to an ATandamp;Toperator at no charge.   Callers using other a card from another long-distance companydial a local or 800 number to reach their network, bypassing AOSoperators.   ``The problem is that people are just dialing as theyhistorically have done and their call is being intercepted and theydon't realize what's happening'' until they receive the bill, saidJ. Alan Taylor of the Florida Public Service Commission.   The Federal Communications Commission, with control over theinterstate long-distance telephone industry, has authority toregulate resellers who buy and sell time from long-distancecarriers like ATandamp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and US SprintCommunications Co. But the FCC has not set limits on AOS rates.   ``We're looking into the service as a whole,'' said Kathie Kneffof the FCC's telephone enforcement division, which received itsfirst complaint about an AOS company six months ago and now hasabout 80.   Jeffrey Sklaver, a consultant at McLean, Va.-basedTeleStrategies Inc., said AOS companies are posing ``an interestingproblem to the FCC because no one has ever charged more than ATandamp;T.All the resellers were in business to charge less than ATandamp;T.''   The FCC can fine AOS companies that don't answer consumercomplaints, but Ms. Kneff said the companies generally have beenresponsive. Most consumers, like Ms. Rossi, who have complained tothe FCC about an AOS bill have received refunds, Ms. Kneff said.   In Florida, the Public Utilities Commission is consideringrequiring AOS companies to charge rates no higher than thoseallowed for ATandamp;T.   Tennessee regulators are proposing to prohibit the local phonecompanies from providing billing services for AOS companies thatcharge rates higher than ATandamp;T's.   The Virginia utilities commission in January advised consumerscalling from hotels, hospitals and pay phones to ask operators whatcompany they work for and how much they charge.   ``If it is not the long-distance phone company with whom younormally do business, the commission warns that you are dialing atyour own risk,'' the commission told consumers.   Gabe Battista of National Telephone Services, an AOS based inRockville, Md., rejects charges of price-gouging, saying hiscompany is trying to compete with ATandamp;T in price and quality ofservice. He declined to release the company's rates, but said itscharges for a call are usually within $1 of ATandamp;T's price for thesame operator-assisted call.   Central's Freeman said regulatory efforts to tie AOSlong-distance rates to those of ATandamp;T are unjustified.   ``The traveling public does not expect to pay the same for along-distance call from a hotel as they do at home,'' he said,adding that ATandamp;T's rates are not ``sacrosanct.''   AOS companies, less than 2 years old, found their niche in themarket after ATandamp;T stopped paying commissions to hotels on thelong-distance calls made by their guests.   These companies now are offering 15 percent and 20 percentcommissions to attract that business, along with hospitals,universities and pay phone vendors.   Callers generally can make credit card, collect and third-partybilled calls through an AOS company. Bell phone company cards areaccepted since the AOS companies have billing agreements with theBell companies, and some companies accept Mastercard, Visa andother credit cards.   The AOS' charge for the call is then included in the caller'slocal phone bill, though it appears on a separate page with the AOScompany's name.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Feb. 29</NOTE></DOC>
