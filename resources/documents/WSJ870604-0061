Leon Sullivan's call for a mass U.S.exodus from South Africa.   The government had denied a visa request by Mr. Sullivan to visit the country in May. Privately, government officials said then that they didn't think it was right for him to come to South Africa to make his announcement. Last night, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the exodus call wasn't in the best interest of South African workers, or in the best interest of the U.S. He said South Africa wouldn't allow itself to be influenced by outside demands.    Both the government and business community figure that the country has already suffered through the worst phase of disinvestment, when International Business Machines Corp., General Motors Corp., Eastman Kodak Co. and Coca-Cola Co., among others, announced their disinvestments at the end of last year.    Several local business associations said they were disappointed by Mr. Sullivan's decision, noting that the Sullivan Principles have been a positive force in South African society.    Representatives of American companies operating here said they will continue with their Sullivan programs of social responsibility, even if Mr. Sullivan is no longer behind them. They said any disinvestment decisions would be made at corporate headquarters in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
