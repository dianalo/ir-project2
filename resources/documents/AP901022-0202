The show, now at the BaltimoreMuseum of Art, features examples of folk art in a variety of media- pottery, sculpture, textiles, furniture and painting. It marksthe first time any objects have been presented for touch in a majorfolk art exhibition.   The display, an overview of American folk art, is the brainchildof Irma Shore, director of Access to Art. She is losing her sightand believes a few steps can make many types of art available topeople who are in wheelchairs, deaf or vision-impaired.   ``The idea really was to create an exhibit that would beavailable to all ages and abilities,'' Shore said. ``It's not aboutpeople with disabilities or for people with disabilities but tocreate an exhibit that can be experienced by everyone.   ``Touching enhances people's understanding of art and artobjects. Touching seems to draw people a lot closer to the objects.I think it breaks down the barriers that people sometimes feel inan art museum.''   The pieces of folk art were selected from a special collectionat the Museum of American Folk Art in New York. When it leavesBaltimore Nov. 11, it will travel to Portland, Ore.; Indianapolis;Louisville, Ky.; Madison, Wis.; Muscatine, Iowa; New London, Conn.;Huntsville, Ala.; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Memphis, Tenn.   Twenty-seven of the 28 objects can be touched. The displayincludes a late 18th-century Shaker rocker from upstate New York, abottle-cap snake made in New Mexico in 1985 and a life-sized woodenand plaster lumberjack that once served as a roadside sign.   The only display that is marked ``Do Not Touch,'' is an unsigned19th-century portrait of a rural New England family's toddler,rendered by an itinerant painter. Rural and middle-class familiesrelied on these traveling painters for likenesses of their lovedones.   Every object in the room is at a level that can be easilyreached from a wheelchair. The accompanying booklet is in largetype and in Braille for blind people or those with limited sight.   The audio tape for visitors describes each object, including itscolors, and gives clear instructions about how to walk from onedisplay to another in the room. A written version is alsoavailable, and can be used as an aid by deaf people.   Each display features a white beam on the gray carpeted floor soblind people with canes will know when to stop. Because the beam isin stark contrast to the floor, it aids those who have difficultyseeing.   A large, laminated black and white photo is attached to eachpiece of art for close examination by those who have visionproblems.
