In a 1983-86 study of 86 AIDS patients in Paris and Miami, 18had heart disease and seven of those had heart disease before otherAIDS-related ailments, Dr. Evlin Kinney of the University of MiamiSchool of Medicine said Wednesday at the ACC meeting.   ``Heart disease was present in 5 percent of all AIDS patients _that's our estimate based on the patients we have seen,'' she said.``Cardiologists need to be aware of AIDS heart disease.''   While little could be done for AIDS patients suffering fromtumor-based heart disease, she said, cardiac disease stemming fromopportunistic infections such as tuberculosis _ rather than fromtumors _ can be treated, prolonging the lives of terminally illpatients.   ``There were patients who, with treatment, survived as long as(AIDS) patients without heart disease,'' Kinney said. ``Some ofthese patients, we did manage to prolong their lives for manymonths.''   AIDS cripples the body's ability to fight off disease, allowinga variety of ailments _ including heart disease _ to cause death.   Fourteen of the 18 AIDS heart patients were dead within fourmonths of diagnosis, but the other four _ all withinfection-related heart disease _ lived for about two years, shesaid.   Another participant in the study, Dr. Jean-Jacques Monsuez ofHopital St. Louis in Paris, said early, specific diagnosis of theailments plaguing AIDS patients can help physicians prolong life.Tuberculosis, for instance, is a frequent ailment in AIDS patients,and it can be treated.   ``If we can treat each organ involved, it's a very importantthing,'' Monsuez said.   Kinney noted that there were only eight women among the 86 AIDSpatients studied, but half of them were suffering from AIDS-relatedheart disease. While noting that the number of female patients wassmall, she said, ``Females seem to be more susceptible to AIDSheart disease ... the women were represented disproportionately.''</TEXT></DOC>
