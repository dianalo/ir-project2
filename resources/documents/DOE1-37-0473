The paper discussesthe conditions for scientific-technical institutions to establish environmentalstandards. Any government relief on the part of institutions proves tobe dependent on support and help on the part of the government. On onehand, the legal validity granted private standards by the governmentboth guarantees the observance of private standards and motivates thestandard address to take active part in the establishment of standardsin order to have a say in the very environmental regulations he himselfwill have to observe. On the other hand, the government threatening toestablish (legal) regulations in case other suitable regulations arenot being provided for, is putting pressure on the address and makeshim subject himself to the 'private government' of the scientifics-technicalinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
