Sea lions normally would eat their way through the winter, thenhead south in the summer.   An environmental assessment issued Monday by the National MarineFisheries Service and the Washington state Wildlife Departmentfavored capturing the sea lions at the Ballard locks and sendingthem back to the Channel Islands, about 30 to 40 miles off SantaBarbara, rather than doing nothing or killing the marine mammals.   The report rejected killing, or the ``lethal removalalternative,'' largely because of the need to prepare anenvironmental impact statement and review potential legal, policyand technical issues.   ``Some segments of the public would be opposed to lethallyremoving even a limited number of problem animals,'' the reportsaid.   The animals find easy pickings at the bottom of a fish ladder atthe Ballard Lock, the sole passage for valuable salmon andsteelhead, a seagoing rainbow trout, to reach Lake Washington andupstream spawning grounds.   The 500- to 600-pound animals gorge themselves and severelydeplete the number of fish that succeed in getting upstream tospawn. Even two to five sea lions ``can easily account forpredation of over 400 fish,'' the report said.   Federal officials expect 40 to 60 sea lions would have to beremoved.   The animals have flourished since passage of the federal MarineMammals Protection Act of 1972 and now number more than 177,000animals.   Removal would have so little impact that an environmental impactstatement is unnecessary, the report said.   Efforts to preserve fish runs through the Lake WashingtonShipping Canal by using firecrackers, rubber bullets, nets, playingof recorded sounds, harassment by boat and foul-tasting fish tochange the sea lions' dining preferences all have failed in recentyears.   Last year 39 sea lions were trapped. Two died and the rest werereleased near the mouth of the Columbia River.   Thirteen returned to the locks, a journey of about 200 miles orroughly one-fifth the distance between Seattle and the ChannelIslands, in an average of 15 days.   Doing nothing would result in continued loss of as much as 70percent of the number of wild steelhead needed for spawning in theSammamish and Cedar rivers, the study found.   In 1988-89, sea lions let less than 700 fish through to spawn,about 900 less than what wildlife officials set as a target.   Joe Scordino of the federal agency said capture and removal toCalifornia could begin by the end of the month or early January, ata cost of as much as $150,000 to $175,000.   Public comment on the plan is being solicited through Dec. 15,but only court action or an administrative denial of funding couldblock the effort, he said.   In California, fishing interests and some state officials havevoiced strong opposition to the proposal. Rolland A. Schmitten,Northwest regional director of the National Marine FisheriesService, said he hoped to persuade them the plan would have no morethan an inconsequential effect in their state.   ``We don't want to ram anything down anybody's throat,''Schmitten said.</TEXT></DOC>
