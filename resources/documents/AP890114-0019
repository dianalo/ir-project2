Leon Pallais, a Nicaraguan priest whoruns the Nicaraguan Assistance Center in Little Havana.   The Central Americans began arriving from southern Texas by thebusload Thursday and Friday following a federal judge's ruling thatthe government could not keep them there while their applicationsfor political asylum were being processed.   Since the judge's decision Monday, some 400 people have comehere, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of themNicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more over the next 18months.   Pallais said the new group is different from the first wave ofNicaraguans that settled in southern Florida.   Roberto Arguello, head of the Nicaraguan Bankers Association,disagreed, saying the time has come to forget the differences thatseparate the first group from the second.   ``The bottom line is we are all Nicaraguans,'' he said. ``Back inNicaragua, there was no in-between. Here we just have to forget it.... The objective is to help all Nicaraguans.''   The latest group is coming to town with no guarantee of food,shelter or social services, and officials are warning there will bevery little support once they arrive.   Isidoro Cuevas, the Cuban-born mayor of Sweetwater, a heavilyNicaraguan city in western Dade County, said his city will havetrouble absorbing the aliens.   ``We've been trying to gather clothes and food to pass it on tothem,'' he said. ``But there are many dwellings shared by more thanone family already. People are sleeping on the front porches,sleeping on the couches.''   In Miami, about 250 immigrants have been staying in a sportsstadium, but the Baltimore Orioles baseball team arrives Jan. 25 forspring training, and the immigrants will have to be relocated, mostlikely to private shelters and churches.   Mayor Xavier Suarez sought an emergency meeting with PresidentReagan, and other officials urged President-elect George Bush, whois fishing in the Florida Keys this weekend, to come to see thesituation for himself.   Bush told reporters he would examine immigration policy when hetakes office. He said the newcomers are ``causing an overburdeningof facilities like schools and hospitals, and this is a sorrycommentary on what's happening in Central America and Nicaragua.   ``The United States has to be generous, but no one community cansuffer an overload without some support in some way,'' he said.   A delegation of community leaders visited southern Texas onFriday to warn those awaiting transportation to Miami.   ``If people come down there (Miami), they need to know thatthey're going to have to fend for themselves,'' Dade CountyAssistant County Manager Tony Ojeda said in Harlingen, Texas.   He estimated the Miami area has 75,000 to 125,000 Nicaraguans,along with thousands of other recently arrived Central Americans.   More than 30,000 Central Americans passed through south Texas in1988 seeking political asylum, according to the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service.   The best way for Miami to deal with the influx would be to allowmore of the immigrants to get work permits, Arguello said.   ``With work permits for every Nicaraguan, the private sector canstep in and help,'' he said. ``We don't want to create a welfaresociety.''</TEXT></DOC>
