These measuresfor stationary sources are outlined in EPA's Control Technique Guideline(CTG) series as to how they apply to particular source categories. Surfacecoating processes at Richmond Tank Car Company are a Set II CTG VOC source.TACB adopted RACT regulations for Set II CTG source categories as revisionsto Regulation V, Control of Air Pollution from VOC's. The rule applicableto Richmond Tank Car is Regulation V, Rule 115.191(9), Miscellaneous MetalParts and Products, and this Rule has a final compliance date of December31, 1982. These regulations were approved by the EPA on July 10, 1981 (45FR 35642), and September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47544).Since the 1979 Ozone SIP acknowledged that Harris County could not attainthe ozone standard by the end of 1982, Texas was required to adopt furthercontrols for Harris County in preparation of an Extension SIP (extensionof the attainment date for areas with severe ozone problems), demonstratingattainment by December 31, 1987. The State developed this 1982 Ozone SIPfor Harris County. Following the state's submittal of final revisions,the Harris County 1982 ozone plan was approved by the EPA on June 26, 1985(50 FR 26359).Harris County has continued to show monitored violations of the ozone standardduring 1984-1986 as well as during 1985-1987 (see Appendix A of the November24, 1987, proposed Post-1987 Ozone and CO Policy (52 FR 45100)). Therefore,the State was notified on May 26, 1988, that the ozone SIP for Harris Countywas substantially inadequate to achieve the NAAQS (this notification istermed a SIP-Call).During a March 15, 1983, inspection of Richmond Tank Car's Sheldon facility,TACB witnessed violations of TACB Regulation V, Rules 115.191 (SurfaceCoating Processes, Emission Limits). A Notice of Violation (NOV) (includingpermit reporting and recordkeeping requirements) was issued by TACB onFebruary 13, 1985, to Richmond Tank Car for violating TACB rule 115.191(9).Pursuant to section 113(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, EPA Region VI issueda similar NOV Letter to Richmond Tank Car on September 9, 1985, citingdaily violations of the coating solvent content rule.TACB's surface coating rule includes an exemption provision which allowsalternative emission limitation requirements for any facility demonstratingto TACB that those alternative requirements will result in the lowest emissionrate that is technologically and economically reasonable. All exemptionspursuant to this exemption provision, Rule 115.193(c)(6), are submittedto EPA as SIP revisions to be reviewed and evaluated by EPA. Richmond TankCar requested an exemption under TACB rules 115.193(c)(6) in an August27, 1985, letter to TACB. EPA explained to Richmond Tank Car in an October2, 1985, meeting that no exemption from current emission limits is alloweduntil the State and EPA approve a SIP revision.TACB submitted to EPA a draft Board Order adopting an exemption for RichmondTank Car on February 7, 1986. In EPA's comments of March 11, 1986, deficienciesin the draft exemption were cited. These included the failure of the revisionto adequately demonstrate that it provided the lowest emission rate thatwas economically and technologically feasible, and to demonstrate maintenanceof RFP in Harris County. TACB submitted to EPA in a letter dated June 11,1986, a Notice of Public Hearing slated for July 17, 1986, and copies ofTACB Board Order No. 86.05 which addresses the issue in question. EPA Region6 identified deficiencies regarding the draft public hearing proposal ina letter to the TACB on June 20, 1986. These comments were reiterated ina July 23, 1986, letter to TACB Hearing Examiner for inclusion in the PublicHearing record. The TACB revised the SIP revision request and approvedit on October 24, 1986. Notice of the TACB's approval was sent to RichmondTank Car in a December 18, 1986, letter. The SIP revision proposal wasformally submitted by the State to EPA's Administrator on January 12, 1987.Details of this proposed revision are discussed in the following Section.During the pendency of the exemption before EPA, Richmond initiated a Chapter11 bankruptcy proceeding. This action could render the exemption requestmoot; however, EPA is aware of interest in continuing to operate the Richmondfacility. Consequently, EPA continues to act upon the exemption request.<ITAG tagnum="84">Operations</ITAG>Richmond Tank Car (Richmond) operates a rail car manufacture, repair, andcoating facility in Sheldon, Texas which is in the ozone nonattainmentcounty of Harris. During the early 1980's, the facility manufactured andrepaired railroad tank and hopper cars. The manufacture of railcars atRichmond decreased from a production rate of approximately 4800 new carsin 1980 to 150 in 1984, and all manufacturing operations were suspendedin 1986. Notwithstanding the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, the repairand maintenance operations are expected to continue to function under newmanagement. The facility has the capability of manufacturing and coating/paintingnew tank cars and hopper cars, and repairing and recoating used tank carsand hopper cars.Coating of new and used rail cars is conducted within the confines of onebuilding at the Richmond facility. Two railroad tracks run parallel throughthe length of the building to facilitate the transfer of the cars througheach of the five process steps. Step one involves cleaning and preparationof the metal surfaces by slag blasting, VOC solvent rinsing, or water rinsing,as is required. Step two involves the actual spray coating conducted ineither a Devilblis Water-wash spray booth in the case of exterior coating,or in an open flash-off area immediately following the spray booth in thecase of interior coating. In step three, cars are left to dry, either partiallyor fully, in a flash-off area. Dependent upon the curing requirements ofthe coating, step four involves the car being either baked in one of twoovens (maximum temperature of 200-250anddegrees;F), air dried, or forced-airdried with portable heaters. Step five involves stenciling of the completedcar.While all coating processes are housed in one structure, no control ofVOC emissions from the cleaning, flash-off, and stenciling areas is provided.Air output from both spray booths are vented to the atmosphere. Emissionscaptured in both ovens are routed to a thermal oxidizer (incinerator) withprimary heat exchange. This incinerator is designed for 1656 SCFM exhaustfrom each oven for a total of 3312 SCFM.Tank car coating operations at Richmond are controlled under TACB RegulationV, Rule 115.191(9), Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products Coating. Pursuantto Rule 115.191(9), coatings used by Richmond in the coating of railcarsare classified as extreme performance coatings and are therefore subjectto a VOC emission limit of 3.5 pounds per gallon of coating (less water)based on a daily (24 hour) weighted average. Rule 115.191(9) further statesthat all VOC emissions from solvent washings shall be considered in the3.5 pount per gallon limit, unless directed into containers to preventevaporation. This 3.5 lbs. of VOC/gallon of coating (minus water) is theemission limitation specified in EPA's control techniques guideline (CTG)documents for such facilities. Rule 115.193(c)(6) allows the ExecutiveDirector of the TACB to approve, for a specific facility, requirementsdifferent from those in Rule 115.191(9) based upon his determination thatsuch alternate requirements will result in the lowest emissions rate thatis technologically and economically reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Proposed SIP Revision</ITAG>Pursuant to Rule 115.193(c)(6), the TACB has granted an exemption to Rule115.191(9) for Richmond Tank Car.In TACB's proposal, solvent content limits are specified for coatings tobe used in three distinct coating categories: exterior coating of new railcars,exterior maintenance and recoating of used railcars, and interior liningof railcars (new and used). Proposed content limits are 3.5, 4.63, and5.11 (pounds VOC/gallon of coating), respectively. These content limitsapply to each individual coating used in a given category. Therefore, nocoating for a given category of use will be allowed if that coating exceedsthe limit specified for that category. The exemption provisions furtherspecify that the weighted average of all coatings, including the aforementionedthree extreme performance coating categories, is limited to 3.5 poundsVOC per gallon in any 30-day (monthly) period. Additionally, total dailyemissions from all coatings applied shall not exceed 0.6 tons per day.Records are required indicating the quantity and average VOC content ofall coatings applied at the facility and shall be maintained for two yearsat the Richmond facility in Sheldon, Texas. These are to be made availableto the TACB and local air pollution control agencies upon request.Every three years beginning in January, 1990, a report is to be submittedto the TACB demonstrating that the conditions of the exemption still existas represented. This report shall demonstrate ``the nonavailability ofcompliant coatings, or shall describe significant changes in the company'sproduction rate or operating conditions, coating technologies, or otherrelevant factors affecting VOC emissions.'' In response to this informationTACB shall consider revision or revocation of the exemption.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Deficiencies</ITAG>The State's proposed SIP revision would allow relaxed emission limits forRichmond's Sheldon facility. As is previously stated, EPA is proposingto disapprove this revision because of several deficiences in the State'sSIP revision submittal allowing this exemption for Richmond. Each of thesedeficiencies is discussed below:1. <T3>Nonavailability of Low Solvent Coatings: </T3>TACB bases its adoptionof an exemption for Richmond upon the nonavailability of low solvent contentcoatings for the railcar coating industry that meet the 3.5 lbs VOC/gallonof coating (less water) limitation when averaged over total daily usage.Richmond and TACB cite the need for extreme performance coatings capableof protecting equipment from harsh exposure to constant weathering, detergents,abrasives, solvents, corrosive atmospheres, and in some cases temperaturesgreater than 95anddegrees;C, and capable of ensuring product purity. TheState's submittal maintains that low solvent formulations are not availablefor certain types of exposure.Communication with coatings manufacturers by EPA in July 1987 indicatesthat low solvent alternatives are available for extreme performance dutiesoutlined in the State's submittal. Specifically, the State's submittalcites one type of extreme performance coating as having no low VOC contentsubstitute. This coating, a phenolic formaldehyde resin produced by oneparticular manufacturer, is used on interiors of tank cars in sulfuricacid service. EPA, however, has found that since the time of Richmond TankCar's exemption request, a low VOC content substitute for this coatinghas been introduced by the same manufacturer. Further details are outlinedin the Evaluation Report. EPA's position is that suitable low solvent coatingalternatives are more readily available than are presented in Richmond'srequest.2. <T3>Economic Infeasibility of Add-On Controls: </T3>TACB also bases itsexemption for Richmond upon the prohibitive cost of installing and operatingadd-on pollution control equipment. The Richmond facility currently isable to control (destroy) VOC emissions only from its two curing ovensby ducting these exhausts to a thermal incinerator. These ovens are onlyin use in the curing of certain ``low temperature-bake'' coatings. If thoseovens are to also be used in the curing of other ``high temperature-bake''coatings, the increased baking temperature will require the installationof a new incinerator and the resultant annual costs will be prohibitivewhen compared to the incremental VOC reductions it will achieve. This exemptiondemonstration is unduly limited to the destruction of oven exhaust. EPA'sdisapproval is based upon the failure to consider other control optionssuch as electrostatic spray equipment, capture of spray booth and tankcar interior exhaust gases for destruction in the existing or newer incinerator,increased use of ``low-bake'' coatings, and improved process procedures.3. Compliance Requirements: Emissions from all coatings applied are limitedto 0.6 tons VOC/day as a condition of the exemption. While such a dailyemission ceiling or ``daily cap'' is a useful tool in ensuring controlof pollutant emissions, EPA feels that this daily cap is unenforceablefor two reasons. First, as stated, emission reductions from add-on controldevices may be considered in meeting the daily cap. However, Richmond TankCar has provided no testing results showing the destruction efficiencyof its control devices. Without such testing, the appropriate credit foradd-on controls cannot be determined. Prior communication with the companyindicates that it is assuming an incineration efficiency of 90%. When coupledwith an unspecified capture efficiency, the company has claimed overallemission reductions of up to 80%. Therefore, to be acceptable, the dailycap should either be specified based on uncontrolled emissions (ignoringthe reduction achieved by add-on controls), or the company should be requiredto conduct capture efficiency and incineration efficiency testing to determineexactly what add-on control credit can be claimed. Second, the recordkeepingprovisions of the exemption require recording monthly quantity and averageVOC content of all coatings. No requirement is made for daily recordkeepingto demonstrate compliance with a daily cap. This effectively makes thedemonstration of compliance with the aforementioned daily cap an impossibility.Therefore, daily records of coating usage quantities, VOC contents of eachcoating used, and total VOC usage quantities should be required.4. Demonstration of Reasonable Further Progress (RFP): The aforementioneddaily cap is tied directly to the VOC emissions from Richmond as reportedin the 1980 Emission Inventory that was used in devising the control strategyfor the 1982 Ozone SIP Harris County. Emissions of 0.6 tons VOC per day(uncontrolled) over 250 work days per year nets 150 tons VOC per year.This value approximates the value calculated in the 1980 Emission Inventoryof 157 tons VOC per year. Achievement of reasonable further progress (RFP)would dictate reductions in emissions (from the 1982 Ozone SIP baseline,157 tons VOC) for sources controlled under a Group II CTG document suchas Richmond. The objective of the Harris County Ozone SIP is to bring aboutreductions from the baseline emission inventory (see 50 FR 26359 as publishedon June 26, 1985). While Richmond appears to have operated at well below157 tons VOC per year in emissions (estimated at less than 60 tons VOCper year in 1984), allowing, as a ``cap'', an increase to its previousallowable level or beyond could jeopardize the RFP plan for Harris County.Again, Harris County was demonstrated to reach attainment in 1987, butcontinues to show monitored violations. Based upon this concern and thepreviously noted lack of daily recordkeeping requirements to comply witha daily cap, EPA believes that the State's exemption granted to Richmondfails to demonstrate that it will not conflict with RFP for Harris County.5. Long Term Averaging of Coating Solvent Content: TACB further justifiesthe relaxed emission limits by limiting the weighted average of the VOCcontent of all extreme performance coatings applied in any 30 day periodto 3.5 lbs VOC/gallon of coating. VOC's are a precursor for ozone, a pollutantwhose National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is based on hourlyattainment. Thus, Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires that VOC emissioncontrol be reasonably consistent with protecting this short term standard.Further, since VOC control plans contemplate the actual application ofRACT, regulatory actions that incorporate longer term averages to circumventthe installation of overall RACT level controls cannot be allowed. Therefore,reporting and monitoring requirements of a SIP should be supportive ofthis short term standard. A January 20, 1984, memorandum of John R. O'Connor(then Acting Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards)explains that the use of 30 day averaging of emissions to support or justifyan alternative RACT demonstration should be evaluated under certain requirements.Briefly, these requirements for justification of long-term averaging andthe evaluation of the State's submittal with respect to each are as follows:<T3>Criteria 1:</T3> The source's operations must be such that VOC emissionscannot be determined on daily basis, or the application of RACT for eachemission point is not technically feasible on a daily basis.<T3>Response:</T3> The State's SIP revision request for Richmond Tank Carcompany is based on TACB's position that the application of RACT for eachemission point is not technically feasible on a daily basis, but the Statehas not adequately demonstrated this.<T3>Criteria 2:</T3> The area in which the facility is located must notlack an approved SIP, and there must be no measured violations of the ozonestandard unless the State revises the SIP to demonstrate attainment ofthe NAAQS and maintenance of RFP (reflecting the maximum daily emissionsresulting from long-term averaging).<T3>Response:</T3> While Harris County did have a federally approved SIPfor attainment by December 31, 1987, it has had measured violations ofthe ozone standard since 1987 and received a SIP Call in May of 1988. Thisissue is further discussed in item 4 under the section of this notice titled``Review of Deficiencies''.<T3>Criteria 3:</T3> The State must demonstrate that the use of long-termaveraging (greater than 24-hour averaging) will not jeopardize either attainmentof the NAAQS or RFP. The State may make this demonstration by showing thatthe maximum daily increase in emissions associated with monthly averagingis consistent with the approved ozone SIP.<T3>Response:</T3> The State has not made this assurance that the dailyemission cap for the facility will not jeopardize the RFP plan. This issueis discussed in item 4 under the section of this notice titled ``Reviewof Deficiencies''.<T3>Criteria 4:</T3> Averaging times must be as short as practicable andin no case longer than 30 days.<T3>Response:</T3> The State has not demonstrated that 30 days is the shortestaveraging period practicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is today proposing to disapprove the exemption submitted as a SIP revisionfor Richmond Tank Car Company in Sheldon, Harris County, Texas for thefollowing reasons:1. The State has not demonstrated, based on the nonavailability of lowsolvent coatings, that the requested exemption constitutes the lowest emissionrate that is technologically and economically reasonable as is requiredby Rule 115.193(c)(6) of the Federally approved SIP for Texas. In fact,EPA has found that alternative coatings containing less solvent are available.2. The State has not demonstrated, based on the economic infeasibilityof installing add-on controls, that the requested exemption constitutesthe lowest emission rate that is technologically and economically reasonableas is required by Rule 115.193(c)(6) of the Federally approved SIP forTexas.3. The conditions of the exemption inappropriately allow the considerationof incineration credit in complying with the daily cap, and fail to requiresufficient recordkeeping provisions to demonstrate compliance with a dailycap.4. The State has not demonstrated that the requested exemption will notjeopardize the RFP plan for Harris County.5. The conditions of the exemption inappropriately allow long term (30-day)averaging of coating solvent content without a demonstration that RFP willbe maintained.Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities because it affects only one source. In addition, this actionimposes no additional requirements on the source beyond what is alreadyrequired under the current State Implementation Plan.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmentalrelations, Lead Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Pariculate Matter, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
