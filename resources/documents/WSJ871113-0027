William Seidman, in a speech before the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, also said the banks would be required to report accounting irregularities to regulators.    Currently, banks aren't required to obtain outside audits. And when they do have such audits, they aren't required to notify regulators of the results, as they are in Britain. An annual audit requirement was proposed by the Comptroller of the Currency in 1985, but has languished in the face of strong opposition from banks, according to Karen Shaw, a bank consultant.    The audit requirement would give much needed assistance to bank regulators, who have complained that they lack enough examiners to monitor banks' books adequately. Criminal activity, such as fraud and insider loans, is a factor in nearly 15% of all recent bank failures, Mr. Seidman said.    Failing banks are less likely than others to have an outside audit, Mr. Seidman said. But a study of failed banks shows that of those that did get audits, 40% turned up qualified opinions that could have helped bank regulators spot trouble in advance.    Mr. Seidman said the discussions are aimed a coordinating the policy of the three federal bank-regulatory agencies: the FDIC, the comptroller and the Federal Reserve.    Mr. Seidman said that an auditing threshold in the range of $100 million to $150 million in assets is being discussed. For small banks below the threshold, he said he hopes to develop a requirement for a less complete review of banks' books. He said this would be like a &quot;checkup rather than a complete physical that smaller banks would find affordable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
