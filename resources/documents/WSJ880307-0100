The Department of Trade and Industry has sent the results of its year-long investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service, a spokesman for the prosecuting agency said Friday. The inquiry concerns a possible leak of market-sensitive information from officials at one or more agencies: the department, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. All three regulate aspects of takeovers in Britain, and their employees have access to nonpublic information, which could be used unlawfully as the basis for profitable share trading.    The Times newspaper here reported Friday that London's Stock Exchange has uncovered a ring of possibly more than 20 people who had traded on inside information for several years. An exchange spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. But some government officials speculated the newspaper story may have been prompted by the completion of the trade department investigation.    The prosecuting agency's spokesman declined to comment on the likelihood of a prosecution and said he didn't know when a decision would be made. The Conservative government has been criticized by opposition politicians for not moving faster to investigate and prosecute insider-trading cases under new laws passed in 1985 and 1986.    Besides the government case, the trade department currently is investigating 13 other cases of suspected insider trading and is considering inquiries in eight more cases, according to a department spokeswoman.    Only four cases have reached the courts since passage of the new laws. The most publicized involved Geoffrey Collier, a former director of the securities unit at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the big U.K. merchant bank. Mr. Collier received a oneyear suspended sentence and a #25,000 ($44,250) fine last July after pleading guilty to two charges of insider trading. </TEXT></DOC>
