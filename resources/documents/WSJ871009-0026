Garcia</HL><DD> 10/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   A sharp rise in short-term interest rates added more gloom to an already nervous stock market, knocking share prices down in active trading yesterday.    Interest rates rose amid concern that the Federal Reserve Board was tightening monetary policy to combat fears of runaway inflation as the economy picks up strength. Thirty-year Treasury bond yields hit their highest levels since Dec. 5, 1985.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which weakened throughout the day with the bond market and the U.S. dollar, ended down 34.44 at 2516.64. The industrial average dipped below 2500 in late afternoon, but the market bounced back from there.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.38 to 314.16 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 2.23 to 176.32.    Although the market indexes recouped some of their losses in the final minutes of trading, the damage in the market was still widespread -- 1,193 Big Board issues declined and just 404 advanced.    General and specialty retailers were among the hardest hit. Auto, chemical, mining, oil, forest products and computer technology stocks were also in the losers' column. Some Japanese, British, gold and advertising issues were among the better performers.    General Electric reported higher third-quarter earnings Wednesday and Ford Motor raised its quarterly dividend and announced a stock split yesterday, yet both stocks moved down with the rest of the market. Some traders were disturbed by investors' negative reaction to such news and they're worried that higher interest rates are beginning to take a toll on this stock market.    &quot;Those were the kinds of positive things that (investors) were expecting to hear,&quot; yet both GE and Ford declined, said Dick Kehne, a managing director in the equity trading department at S.G. Warburg in New York. &quot;I have to feel these higher yields are weighing down on the market.&quot;    Mr. Kehne is concerned that although portfolio managers might not be selling stocks and buying bonds right now, because the bond market is also in turmoil, new cash might be invested in bonds. That's because the higher bond rates offer better returns than managers might get in the stock market.    Again yesterday, sell programs, driven by strategies tied to stock-index futures, accounted for many of the sell orders that brokers and traders had to process. One Big Board floor broker said many of the orders for the sell programs are routed automatically to the exchange specialists' posts and brokers found yesterday only a moderately active day.    Several traders noted that despite the big drop in stock prices this week, institutional investors haven't been desperate to sell stocks. One trader believes many might be waiting to see whether third-quarter earnings reports contain any surprises before they act. Another suggested that portfolio insurance, a technique that allows managers to shield their portfolios from some losses by selling index futures and options, &quot;has given managers a certain amount of complacency.'    Volume on the Big Board rose to 198.7 million shares from 186.3 million shares Wednesday.    Although several analysts said that most of the September sales increases reported by major department stores yesterday were within expectations, many retailing stocks posted big declines. Some analysts blamed the drop on the general market's gloom; others cited an article in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal in which industry officials discussed the possibility of a shakeout among retailers.    &quot;Clearly, this industry is no longer in favor with institutions,&quot; said one New York-based stock trader. He is seeing his clients also selling other consumer-oriented stocks such as food, beverage, tobacco and auto issues.    However, Walter Loeb, who follows the retailing industry for Morgan Stanley, had a more sanguine view. He said the September sales reports at least showed that consumers were still spending, but on a moderate scale. He concluded from some reports that sales appeared to pick up in the latter part of September and he expects a strong October for the retailers.    Limited fell 2 1/8 to 29 1/8 on more than 3.6 million shares; Gap sank 2 1/2 to 32 1/4; Sears declined 1 1/8 to 48 7/8; Federated Department Stores moved down 3/4 to 51 3/8 and Dayton Hudson slid 1 to 58.    Wal-Mart dropped 1 1/8 to 35 7/8; J.C. Penney lost 2 1/4 to 56 1/4 and F.W. Woolworth was unchanged at 47 1/2. Edward Weller at Montgomery Securities said sales for these companies were even better than expected.    Alexander's fell 1 7/8 to 54 1/2. Late Wednesday, New York investor Donald Trump and Interstate Properties, a New Jersey real estate developer, reached a standstill agreement under which neither would buy or sell shares of Alexander's without the other's consent. In recent days, both had applied for permission to increase their holdings in the company.    In yesterday's jittery market, some analysts' recommendations had a big impact. Pennzoil, recommended by Cyrus J. Lawrence andamp; Co., rose 2 5/8 to 73 5/8. Himont tumbled 3 3/4 to 44 after being downgraded by First Boston.    Ford Motor closed down 7/8 at 94 1/2 after trading as high as 96 3/8. The company raised its quarterly dividend to $1 from 75 cents and approved a 2-for-1 stock split.    Other auto stocks also were weaker. General Motors was down 2 to 76 1/4 and Chrysler off 1 1/2 to 38 1/8. GM has been downgraded by several Wall Street analysts in recent days.    Harcourt Brace Jovanovich inched up 1/8 to 9 3/4. The book publisher said it has found buyers for several of its major publishing units and might be able to complete the sales and receive cash by the end of November. Harcourt is making the sales to offset its costly recapitalization plan.    Comcast Corp. rose 1 1/8 to 25 1/4 and Safety-Kleen gained 1 1/4 to 38 3/8. These two stocks bucked the market trend, largely because they were added to the Sandamp;P 500-stock index yesterday. Money managers who pattern their portfolios to match the performance of this index usually have to buy the new additions to stay in line with the index.    Cummins Engine sank 2 1/4 to 78 after the company said it could show a possible loss for the third quarter but that it should be profitable in the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected the company to turn a profit for the third quarter.    Apollo Computer lost 3 1/4 to 17 3/4. The computer maker said it will post a loss for its third quarter because a charge from unauthorized foreign exchange transactions will be larger than it had expected. Analysts also calculated that operating earnings for the third quarter would be lower than previously expected.    Genentech moved up 3/4 to 51 3/4 on more than 1.3 million shares in the OTC market. Smith Barney, Harris Upham upgraded the stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;strong sell,&quot; expecting the company to get approval for some limited use of TPA, Genentech's anti-clotting agent. </TEXT></DOC>
