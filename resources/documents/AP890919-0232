Everett Koop today denouncedefforts to export U.S. cigarettes as ``the height of hypocrisy.''   Koop, who is retiring Oct. 1, testified at a hearing of the U.S.trade representative against a request by the cigarette industry forgovernment intervention to force Thailand to allow sales andadvertising of American cigarettes.   ``When we are persuading foreign governments to stop the flow ofcocaine, it is the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco,'' saidKoop, who has conducted a vigorous anti-smoking campaign throughouthis tenure.   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association has requested theintervention and the trade representative is to decide the issue bynext May.   In 1988, U.S. tobacco exports contributed a record $3.5 billionto helping reduce ``this country's onerous trade deficit,'' saidexport association President Owen Smith.   ``People throughout Asia will continue to buy and smoke billionsof cigarettes each year with or without U.S. presence in themarketplace,'' said Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C. ``The real issue iswhether American companies will be allowed to compete, or if theplaying field will be abandoned to other foreign manufacturers andlocal monopolies.''   But Rep. Chester A. Atkins, D-Mass., said the real issue ``isabout the American government using leverage and tax dollars tocoerce countries into allowing marketing practices that wereoutlawed long ago'' in the United States.   The petition seeks to force Thailand ``to overturn a policy ofbanning cigarette advertisements'' in print and broadcast media,Atkins said.   The export association represents three major cigarettecompanies, Brown and Williamson, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.   Since 1986, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have opened markets toU.S. cigarette brands after being accused of unfair trade andthreatened with retaliation against their products.   ``I believe that most Americans would be appalled to learn thattheir government, which banned cigarette advertisements on TV,required warning labels on cigarettes ... is aggressively pushingcigarette addiction overseas through the trade representative,''Atkins said.   ``It is simply inexcusable for the U.S. to exert its greatinfluence to force Thailand to reverse its health policy,'' he said.   Atkins is sponsoring legislation to require that U.S. cigarettebrands sold abroad carry warnings and advertising restrictionsequivalent to those in the United States.   The industry argues that foreign countries are competent to maketheir own regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
