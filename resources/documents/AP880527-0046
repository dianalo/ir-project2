The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday thatheart-disease rates were generally highest in concentrated,urbanized areas of the Northeast or Midwest, while the West had thelowest rates.   ``We're talking about thousands of deaths difference between thelow states and the high states,'' said Dr. Patrick L. Remington, aCDC researcher.   Heart disease is the leading killer in the United States, takingmore lives each year than all other causes combined, according tothe American Heart Association. In 1985, 540,800 Americans died ofischemic, or blocked-artery, heart disease _ most commonly heartattacks, according to CDC statistics.   Remington said the stress of urbanization itself is probably notto blame for the high rates in the densely populated Northeast andMidwest, but many people in those regions probably have lifestylesthat could lead to more heart attacks.   ``Just living in a big city doesn't appear to be a riskfactor,'' he said. ``But more desk jobs, and greater reliance onautomobiles, all are part of a sedentary lifestyle that contributesto greater risk of a heart attack.''   He said lack of exercise contributes to weight gain, highercholesterol levels, stress and high blood pressure _ all factors inheart disease.   ``Lack of exercise can be directly connected to all thesefactors,'' Remington said.   Another likely cause of significant state-to-statediscrepancies, Remington said, is the prevalence of cigarettesmoking.   ``These (Northeast and Midwest) states are the states that havehigh rates of cigarette smoking,'' he said. ``And we do know thatcigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of heartdisease. Most deaths from smoking are heart attacks _ not lungcancer.''   In contrast, ``the lowest rates of smoking are in the West,'' hesaid.   The five worst states for men and heart disease _ New York, NewJersey, Rhode Island, Michigan and Ohio _ are all in the Northeastor Midwest, where other states with the highest rates wereclustered, the CDC reported.   The best rates are clustered near Chesapeake Bay and in theWest. The five lowest heart disease death rates for men were in theDistrict of Columbia, Hawaii, New Mexico, Maryland and Utah.   Similar geographic patterns were shown for women, although maleshistorically suffer most from heart disease.   New York had the nation's worst rate, with 320 out of every100,000 men dying of ischemic heart disease in 1985. The nationalaverage was 249 per 100,000; in New Mexico, the rate was 151.   Remington said other possible causes for the geographicdisparities include cholesterol levels and differences in medicalcare, for which no firm state-by-state data are available.   Sociodemographic differences and population shifts also mightplay a part, the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.   However, heart disease death rates for all ages and geographicareas have decreased in the last two decades, the CDC said, citingpreviously reported research.   Remington noted that much of the nation had similarly high heartdisease death rates in the 1950s, ``then California and the Westernstates began declining. There's something about it. ... In certainstates, it started earlier.''</TEXT></DOC>
