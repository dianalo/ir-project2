At Saturday's conference in Bonn, the four victorious World WarII allies agreed that unification should go forward without delay.   It was the first top-level unification session among theGermanys and the Allies _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britainand France _ which split Germany into two countries after World WarII.   The conference, Kohl said in a statement, produced a ``historicresult for Germany and Europe.''   ``There are no more obstacles to the realization of the right ofself-determination of all Germans,'' he said. `After more than 40years of painful separation, the Germans' longing to be united inone state is being fulfilled.''   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, meanwhile, hailed anew era.   ``The Cold War is over. Our planet, the world, Europe, are nowembarking on a new road,'' he said.   Shevardnadze, Secretary of State James A. Baker III andcounterparts from Britain, France and the two German states tookpart in the nearly seven-hour talks.   The sides agreed on several issues, including a timetable forfuture meetings and the inclusion of Poland in some of the talks.Soviet objections to NATO membership by a united Germany remainedthe main stumbling block.   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, saidthe meeting cleared the way for quick German unification and leftit up to the Germans to determine the pace of the process.   In an interview with the ZDF television network, Genscherreferred to a statement in which Shevardnadze was quoted as saying,``The settlements of interior and foreign aspects of German unitydo not necessarily have to come at the same time.''   The statement, translated by the West German Foreign Ministry,reflected a significant shift in the Soviet position because itseparated the problem of NATO membership from other aspects of theunification process, ministry officials said.   ``It was a surprising formulation that's making our lifeeasier,'' said one Bonn diplomat, who asked not to be named.   Genscher said Shevardnadze's ``clear distinction of interior andforeign aspects of German unity'' reaffirmed the right of theGermans to alone decide the time of unification.   ``This requires from the two German states, which now holdunification in their hands, a high degree of responsibility,''Genscher said.   The six foreign ministers at the conference, dubbed thetwo-plus-four talks, announced a timetable for further meetings,with a session in June in East Berlin, in July in Paris and inSeptember in Moscow.   The Soviets have called for a neutral Germany.   The Soviet news agency Tass said the Kremlin opposed Germanmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because itwould touch on ``Soviet security interests'' and ``disrupt thebalance of forces in Europe.''   East Germany has long served as a buffer between the East andWest blocs. The Soviet Union has and estimated 380,000 troops inEast Germany, while the United States has about 250,000 soldiers inWest Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
