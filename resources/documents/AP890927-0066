On the eve of a new round of negotiations, Yuri Nazarkin saidthat after last week's concessions by the Soviet Union, the mostdifficult remaining issue involves air-launched cruise missiles.   He said he will await U.S. reaction to the Soviet moves, whichinclude a proposal on the missiles, before assessing chances forcompleting a draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.   ``I wouldn't dare to forecast the prospect of the negotiationsfrom the point of view of the forthcoming summit,'' Nazarkin saidat a news conference. ``We still expect the American reaction herein Geneva.''   But an accord between President Bush and Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev for a summit in the first half of 1990``reflects the confidence of the sides that major agreement andsubstantial progress are possible,'' Nazarkin said in a preparedstatement.   He said the outstanding points on the air-launched cruisemissiles include their allowed range and how to deal with bomberscarrying cruise missiles tipped with conventional rather thannuclear warheads.   His remarks were similar to others by senior officials on bothsides who have said an agreement is within reach but that remainingobstacles should not be underestimated.   Talks began in March 1985 on a treaty aimed at reducing U.S. andSoviet long-range nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent. Bothsides have already agreed to ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers with which eachsuperpower can strike the other directly.   The talks are to resume Thursday when delegation officialsdiscuss how the session will be organized. Nazarkin and U.S. chiefenvoy Richard Burt are to meet Friday, and the first full meetingof both delegations is set for Monday.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze met in Wyoming over the weekend andMoscow removed a long-standing obstacle in the talks by announcingit would not let its objections to U.S. plans for space-basedmissile defenses block the signing of a treaty.   Under the new Soviet position, U.S. tests involving theStrategic Defense Initiative ``connected with research'' would bepermitted, but not trials of ``systems or prototypes,'' Nazarkinsaid.   The Soviets also agreed to a U.S. demand for not includingsea-based cruise missiles under the weapons ceilings of a treaty.Washington says the rockets cannot be monitored reliably.   The two sides also agreed on certain anti-cheating measures forthe proposed treaty.   Earlier, the Bush administration said it would drop its demandfor a ban on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, providedCongress approves funding for such missiles.
