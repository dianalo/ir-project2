On Monday, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste and New York Gov. MarioCuomo made public their proposal to reduce polluting sulfur dioxideemissions from utility sources by 10 million tons by the year 2003.   The plan calls for authorizing $900 million a year from thefederal government to finance up to 50 percent of the capital costs.Most of that money would come from having the oil industry take overthe cost of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   The polluters themselves would have to raise about $900 million ayear under the deal.   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said it represents ``significantprogress'' anytime Ohio and New York can agree on acid rain.   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have beenblamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say isdestroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast.   Much of the sulfur dioxide comes from coal-burning power plantsalong the Ohio River.   Sikorski, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, isthe main sponsor of an acid rain control bill pending in committee.His bill would mandate a 10-million-ton reduction in emissions by1998.   ``This agreement shows that there is renewed seriousness aboutdealing with the issue,'' Sikorski said. ``It indicates that Ohio isfinally reading the writing on the wall. This could be their lastgood chance at legislation that assists them with their cleanupcosts.''   But the proposal drew fire from other lawmakers.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said that while heis encouraged by the dialogue between Ohio and New York on acidrain, he sees nothing new in the proposal.   ``The key element of any effort to deal with acid rain has to betime,'' said Byrd. ``And this proposal does not allow enough timefor the development of clean-coal technologies. Coal is essential toAmerica's national security, and we cannot afford to adopt an acidrain policy that would devastate the coal industry.''   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the proposal would hurt Ohio andaccused Celeste of not speaking for Ohioans on the issue.   Regardless of the financing ``gimmicks,'' said Luken, Ohioconsumers ``will pay millions of dollars and Ohio will losethousands of jobs for no known benefit.''   Ohio, next to coal-rich West Virginia, has a significantcoal-mining industry.   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., said he believes the proposalrepresents a breakthrough because it is the first time a majoremitter of sulfur dioxide, Ohio, has attempted to come to grips withthe acid rain problem.   Stafford, who is ranking Republican on the Senate Environment andPublic Works Committee, has been a major proponent of acid raincontrol and is a co-sponsor of legislation authored by Sen. GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, that would reduce emissions by 12 million tons.   ``I think it's a very encouraging development,'' said Stafford,adding that he expects that the Senate committee will want to reviewthe Ohio-New York proposal and possibly amend the pendinglegislation to take advantage of the initiative.   The proposal, an amendment to the Clean Air Act, calls forreductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in three phases: 3.5 milliontons by 1993, another 4.5 million tons by 1998 and another 2 milliontons by 2003.   The agreement would also establish a 10-year, $2.5 billionexpanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions insulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.   Daniel Weiss, Washington representative of the Sierra Club,called the new proposal encouraging because it comes in part fromOhio, the largest single emitter of sulfur dioxide in the nation.   ``This is a statesmanlike proposal, but it doesn't include enoughreductions soon enough to adequately protect public health or theenvironment,'' said Weiss.   However, he said the environmental group believes that theproposal will help move acid rain control legislation in Congress.   Susan K. Roth, spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute,said the deadlines in the Celeste-Cuomo proposal are not flexibleenough to allow for the use of new clean-coal technologies. And shesaid the additional costs to the oil industry would be passed alongto consumers.   ``We don't see that this is going to give us any better long-termreductions than the program that is already in place,'' said Ms.Roth.</TEXT></DOC>
