<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-0719 </DOCNO><TEXT>A complete canonical formulation of the BRST theory of systems with redundantgauge symmetries is presented. These systems include p-form gauge fields,the superparticle, and the superstring. We first define the Koszul-Tatedifferential and explicitly show how the introduction of the momentaconjugate to the ghosts of ghosts makes it acyclic. The global existenceof the BRST generator is then demonstrated, and the BRST charge is provedto be unique up to canonical transformations in the extended phase space,which includes the ghosts. Finally, the BRST cohomology in classicalmechanics is investigated and shown to be equal to the cohomology ofthe exterior derivative along the gauge orbits, as in the irreduciblecase. This is done by re-expressing the exterior algebra along the gaugeorbits as a free differential algebra containing generators of higherdegree, which are identified with the ghosts of ghosts. The quantum cohomologyis not dealt with.</TEXT></DOC>
