Seib and Joe Davidson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>      {Part of a Series}   WASHINGTON -- A strange new vocabulary can be heard these days on the campaign trail: ET and toddler tax credits, partnerships and catalysts, college savings bonds and STARS.    They are shorthand terms for social programs being proposed in the 1988 presidential campaign. As the modern-sounding terminology suggests, in a campaign often lacking in trail-blazing ideas, domestic social policy is one area where Michael Dukakis and George Bush are breaking out of their parties' molds.    Mr. Dukakis's campaign hinges in large part on his ability to redefine liberal Democratic social policies so they become more affordable. Instead of giant federal social programs, the Massachusetts governor proposes government-led &quot;partnerships&quot; with the private sector and the states to provide such things as health care, housing and student loans -- in short, leveraged liberalism.    Vice President Bush, meanwhile, accepts traditional Republican prescriptions about letting market forces cure social ills -- but recognizes that even many young Republicans now think there are important areas where the government should act as a catalyst to push market forces along. So he offers tax credits to expand child care for the poor and tax-free bonds so parents can better save for college costs -- in short, compassionate conservatism.    &quot;Each candidate has adhered to the quintessential philosophy his party has held for the last 50 years, while each has also recognized he has a problem if he doesn't adjust that philosophy,&quot; says Stuart Eizenstat, who was director of domestic policy in the Carter White House.    There are a few significant similarities between the two candidates, suggesting something of a national consensus on certain issues as the U.S. enters the 1990s. Both identify some of the same problems to tackle: education, child care and long-term health care. Both are willing to spend more than President Reagan has on selected problems.    Yet in an age of federal budget deficits, &quot;both men are fiscal conservatives or at least fiscal moderates,&quot; says Jack Meyer, president of New Directions in Policy, an issues-research group here. &quot;I don't look for big spending proposals from either.&quot;    One fundamental difference still remains: Mr. Dukakis believes that government must remain directly involved in social programs, while Mr. Bush believes the government should get out of the process once it gets things moving.    There's an important political difference as well. While foreign policy is Mr. Bush's campaign strength, domestic programs are Mr. Dukakis's strong suit -- the basis for his claim that he can translate innovative and competently managed Massachusetts programs into effective new national programs.    Mr. Dukakis's quest for what Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute calls &quot;social policy on the cheap,&quot; and Mr. Bush's parallel search for innovative conservative solutions are clear in their differing approaches to health care and housing.    Unlike liberals of the 1970s, Mr. Dukakis doesn't advocate a grandiose national health insurance program. Instead, he supports a plan similar to a newly enacted Massachusetts program requiring employers, with some exceptions for small businesses, to provide minimum health-care coverage to employees. With such basic coverage assured for workers, the Dukakis camp argues, the government will be freer to deal with the estimated 10 million unemployed and uninsured.    Businesses in Massachusetts helped work out the state's plan but remain leery of its cost. Gov. Dukakis, though, argues the plan actually will benefit the majority of businesses that now offer health plans, because hospitals won't have to charge insured patients extra to make up for uninsured patients who leave bills unpaid.    For his part, Mr. Bush has endorsed a catastrophic illness bill passed by Congress this year to beef up Medicare coverage and pay for the additional benefits through expanded payroll deductions. Mostly, though, the vice president advocates incentives to spur the private sector to provide cheaper health care, such as health maintenance organizations, and wants tax changes to encourage the purchase of long-term-care insurance by individuals.    On housing, Mr. Dukakis endorses spending some money for the traditional liberal approach of direct federal investment. But the Dukakis housing proposal explicitly rejects a &quot;return to the old days of deep subsidies for programs crafted in Washington.&quot; Rather, it stresses federal grants that could be dispersed by &quot;state and local partnerships with private and nonprofit developers.&quot; Such policies, combined with maintenance and improvement of existing public housing, will tackle the problem of the homeless, Mr. Dukakis maintains.    Mr. Bush, by contrast, endorses such new-wave conservative ideas as federal vouchers that the poor can use to pay for housing wherever they like, and turning ownership of public-housing units over to tenants. Full funding of existing housing programs, combined with strengthened programs for the mentally ill, will deal with the homeless problem, he argues.    It is in the area of welfare that Mr. Dukakis makes perhaps his most forceful claim to have fashioned new, hardheaded solutions. One of his central accomplishments in Massachusetts, he says, is his Education and Training, or ET, program that provides welfare recipients with job training and child day care to help move them off the public dole.    It is a relatively expensive initial effort; the Massachusetts welfare bill jumped to $50 million in 1986 from $12 million in 1982, the year before ET began. But proponents say the investment of state and matching federal funds is worthwhile because, they claim, the program generates two dollars in increased tax revenue and saved welfare benefits for every dollar spent.    Mr. Bush favors welfare revisions that would institute a work requirement for welfare recipients, and endorses the idea of turning welfare programs into a &quot;jobs system.&quot; But the most innovative Bush social-policy ideas have emerged in two other areas: education and child care.    Mr. Bush's education ideas basically mirror those pushed by former Education Secretary William Bennett, and they also reflect a willingness to dig deeper into the treasury for education than the Reagan administration has. He proposes $500 million in federal awards to schools with many disadvantaged students. And he advocates more than quadrupling, to $50 million, an experimental fund that finances educational research and experiments in innovative schools.    But Mr. Bush's principal new approach to expanding educational opportunities is his plan to introduce &quot;college savings bonds,&quot; which would allow parents to earn tax-free interest on savings for their children's college expenses. Initially, the proposal was roundly criticized for providing tax breaks to upper-class families that don't need them, but the vice president now proposes an income cap.    Mr. Dukakis's education ideas combine his willingness to invest more federal dollars and his inclination to use governmental leverage to promote private action. He wants a $250 million national teaching-excellence fund to help pay teaching students' college expenses, and proposes a Student Tuition and Repayment System, or STARS, under which government-backed loans from private financial institutions would be available to all students. The loans would be paid back through a small, fixed payroll deduction; some recipients who do well financially after college might pay back more than they borrowed, while those who do less well might pay back less.    Mr. Bush's inclination to prod the private sector into addressing social needs is clearest in his play for expanding day care. He has proposed a &quot;toddler tax credit,&quot; a refundable tax credit for children under the age of four designed to help low-income parents meet the cost of child care. The idea appeals to conservatives because a tax credit could be used either to pay for private-sector, child-care programs, or as a way of indirectly rewarding mothers who choose to stay home to care for their children rather than go to work.    Gov. Dukakis advocates a more traditional liberal approach, endorsing a $2.5 billion child-care bill in Congress that would use government funds to expand day-care centers and set government health and safety standards.    Neither candidate's philosophical approach provides ready answers to every social problem, of course. AIDS, for instance, is a pressing new problem defying normal policy formulas. Mr. Dukakis advocates a &quot;massive&quot; public education program, increased voluntary testing for the AIDS virus and legislation banning discrimination against those carrying the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, endorses more mandatory testing and an education program stressing traditional moral values. He has expressed general support for anti-discrimination legislation but, giving in to the protests of his party's right wing, didn't include endorsement of specific legislation in the Republican platform.    ---                       Campaign Dictionary:             Candidates' Domestic Policy Terminology    Dukakis    Partnerships -- A combination of government and private resources to address social needs; his preferred way to tackle problems.
