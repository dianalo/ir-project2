Group Cites Violations Of Oil Embargo On South Africa</HEAD><BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. anti-apartheid group said Tuesday itis investigating 48 alleged violations of a voluntary embargo on oilshipments to South Africa aimed at undermining that country's systemof racial segregation.   It also said some world corporations have helped the Pretoriagovernment obtain oil, although they are not covered by the embargoand are not violating national laws.   The second annual report by the U.N. Intergovernment Group ToMonitor Supply and Shipping of Oil to South Africa said the vastmajority of the world's oil producing states prohibit exporting oilto South Africa.   It called the embargo, adopted by the General Assembly in 1984,an important means of pressuring South Africa to dismantleapartheid, because that nation is dependent on imported oil. Theembargo is voluntary and the world body has no enforcement powers.   ``However,'' it said in a statement, ``some transnationals likeBritish Petroleum, Caltex, Mobil, Shell and Total have helped SouthAfrica obtain oil, and British Petroleum and Shell are allegedlystill involved in oil imports to that country.''   In 1988, the report said, the group received reports of 64alleged violations involving 32 ships. Sixteen cases were withdrawnand ``the remaining 48 cases are still under suspicion and ourinvestigation,'' it said, without giving specifics.   ``The imposition of a mandatory oil embargo by the SecurityCouncil against South Africa is urgently needed to complement thearms embargo imposed by the Security Council,'' the report said.   It also noted, ``There are a number of transnational corporationsthat have assisted South Africa in its coal conversion to oil andhydrocarbon exploration projects ...   ``When the threat of an oil embargo began to loom and theapartheid regime decided to expand its coal exports, a new occasionof collaboration between the regime and international oil companiesarose.   ``The oil companies are granted access to cheap coal in returnfor their cooperation in evading the oil embargo.''   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
