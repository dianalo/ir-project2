The leftist Angolan government has rejected proposals for across-border assistance program because of concern that thesupplies could contain U.S. weapons for anti-communist rebels.   Andrew Natsios, director of the Office of Foreign DisasterAssistance, is expected to arrive in the Angolan capital of Luandalater this week to discuss the issue with government officials. Theoffice is an arm of the U.S. Agency for International Development.   Natsios also plans to visit the affected areas, which cover abroad stretch of territory along in the southern part of thecountry and encompasses both government- and rebel-held zones.   Officials believe the potential for a catastrophic famineprobably is greater in southern Angola than in any other region ofAfrica.   But the Angolan government's hard-line stance reflects awariness that the United States, which has been arming the UNITArebels since 1986, may use a cross-border relief operation to runguns to the rebels. The most likely headquarters for a reliefprogram are neighboring Botswana and Namibia.   The Bush administration derided Angola's concerns as``absolutely ridiculous'' and said any such program would becarried out by a trusted charitable agency, such as theInternational Committee of the Red Cross.   Over the past several weeks, U.S. and United Nations emissarieshave failed to convince Angolan authorities to show moreflexibility.   The famine area has been afflicted both by drought and byprolonged fighting that resulted from a government offensiveearlier this year.   The administration is prepared to be the major contributor ifthe Angolan government agrees to an international relief effort,officials said.   Angola has been a sore point in East-West relations for years.While the United States has been supplying the rebels, the SovietUnion and Cuba have provided generous backing for the government.Cuba once had 50,000 troops in Angola but has begun a phasedwithdrawal that is expected to be completed next year.   One measure of the mistrust between the Angolan government andUNITA was the breakdown of peace talks last week in Lisbon,Portugal.   The negotiations collapsed after government negotiators refuseda rebel demand for formal political recognition in advance of anycease-fire agreement.   ``This inflexible demand was designed intentionally to scuttlecease-fire negotiations,'' said Manuel Pedro Pacavira, Angola'sU.N. ambassador.   Angolan authorities contend that the rebels sabotaged the talksin order to win congressional approval for additional U.S. militaryaid.   UNITA President Jonas Savimbi said he was surprised anddisappointed that Angolan officials were not prepared to sign anagreement that would bring ``peace and democracy'' to Angola.   ``As this was the purpose of this round of talks, their behaviorraises doubts about the sincerity of their intentions,'' Savimbisaid.</TEXT></DOC>
