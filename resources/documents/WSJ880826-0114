In its annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, the central bank yesterday suggested it is concerned that domestic demand is strong at a time when Australia must remain focused on reducing its current-account deficit and foreign debt. (Strong domestic demand increases imports and inflation.)    &quot;Australia's external imbalance and the high level of external debt were major issues for general economic policy throughout 1987-88,&quot; the annual report said.    &quot;It was of some concern, therefore, that strong domestic demand boosted imports over the year. Also, in the second half of the year, earnings and prices appeared to be growing uncomfortably quickly, threatening the downward course of inflation and the improving trend in the balance of payments,&quot; the report said, adding, &quot;The tightening of monetary policy in the second half of the year was in response to those developments.&quot;    The reserve bank said it is &quot;disappointing&quot; that &quot;Australia's high economic growth in the year just closed (gross domestic product expanded 3.6%) largely reflected strong domestic demand with no further gains in volume terms in net exports.&quot;    Moreover, the central bank said, &quot;Despite the evidence of a further reduction in the current-account deficit in 1987-88, there were some signs that the pace of underlying adjustment wasn't proceeding as in the previous two years.&quot;    The report said the reduction in the current-account deficit in 1987-88 was a result of a sharp rise in commodity prices and a consequent improvement in the terms of trade, or the ratio of export prices to import prices, adding, &quot;The fall in import volumes was reversed.&quot;The central bank stressed that the major medium-term issue for Australia continues to be the need to correct the balance of payments deficit and the high level of international indebtedness.    Commenting on monetary policy, the annual report said, &quot;It became increasingly plain (in the quarter ended March 31) that there was a need to dampen demand before it flowed too heavily into import volumes, prices and wages. Capacity constraints were appearing in the building industry and in some other parts of the economy.&quot;    Earlier yesterday, the reserve bank said it will review its rediscount rate after financial markets have settled. Many in the markets had expected the central bank to raise its rediscount rate yesterday after Wednesday's treasury note tender where the average weighted yield on 13-week notes rose to 12.679% from 12.310%. </TEXT></DOC>
