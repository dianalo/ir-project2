He believes thatas hardware becomes cheaper, the link between engineering, design andmanufacturing is technical information management, and that is based on arelational database.andP;  However, building such an integrated environment islikely to be difficult.andP;  Different kit, software and standards have createdislands of incompatible technology, and few companies are prepared to discardtheir existing systems.andP;  Consequently, it is up to the vendors to create afully integrated environment, and DEC has acknowledged this necessity byannouncing its intention to convert most applications software for othervendors' hardware.andP;  Nonetheless, one major obstacle to an industry-wideresponse is the cost of developing database links, and perhaps moresignificant, who should pay for such work.andP;  Manufacturers are reluctant to doso, and despite widespread agreement on the need for a common databasestructure, there is still an overriding lack of compatibility at anythingother than the most basic levels.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
