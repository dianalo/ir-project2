<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0773 </DOCNO><TEXT>A strain gage capable of direct measurements of the two-dimensional spreadingpressure of physisorbed films was employed in a study of monolayer {sup4}He physisorbed on graphite. In this presentation, the response of thegage to an adsorbed {sup 4}He film is characterized through the analysisof isothermal vapor pressure and strain data collected at 7.8 and 8.5{sup0}K. Results of an investigation of the order-disorder transition of{sup 4}He/graphite are reported. In addition to equilibrium measurementsof the spreading pressure, the dynamic response of the strain cell tosmall induced temperature changes is discussed. The dynamic response,which varies markedly with density and temperature in the neighborhoodof the order-disorder transition, is characterized by an exponentialrelaxation with a temperature-dependent time constant that reflects thedivergence of the film heat capacity. This result is in accord with asimple model which attributes the dynamic response to the thermal inertiaof the strain cell.</TEXT></DOC>
