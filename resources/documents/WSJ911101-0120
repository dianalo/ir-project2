And therein lies the problem facing Rolls-Royce. It isn'tenough to make top-quality engines; size and financial cloutmatter more. As a distant No. 3 among makers of engines forbig jets, Rolls-Royce can't match the financial and practicalincentives offered to customers by No. 1 GE and No. 2 Pratt andamp;Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. So the Britishconcern has a harder time getting its engines accepted by bigairlines as equipment on new planes, and that makes it evenmore difficult to land deals with smaller airlines.   This lesson has been painfully illustrated in the pastseveral months by the beating that Rolls-Royce has taken inthe marketplace. The biggest blow came when British AirwaysPLC, a long-time Rolls-Royce customer, chose GE engines foran initial order of Boeing Co.'s new 777 jetliner. Then,citing the British Airways decision, All Nippon Airwaysscrapped plans to order Rolls-Royce engines for its 777s andswitched to Pratt andamp; Whitney. Air India switched to Pratt andamp;Whitney from Rolls-Royce for an order of Boeing 747s.   Those developments couldn't have come at a worse time. Thedownturn in airline passenger traffic has forced manycarriers to mothball planes and stock fewer spare parts. Thathits engine makers hard because the sale of spare parts oftendoubles the profits from selling an engine. At the same time,the outlook for military-aircraft engines has turned dismal.So Rolls-Royce is restructuring, and cutting the aerospacedivision's work force by 6,000 jobs, or 17%. (Rolls-Royce PLChas nothing to do with Rolls Royce luxury autos, which aremade by Vickers PLC.)   &quot;We've had to react to a downturn in the civil sidesuperimposed on a more severe downturn in the military side,&quot;says Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce's chief executive officer.He notes that Rolls-Royce has scored successes with other newplanes, including the smaller Boeing 757, and says thecompany is well positioned to claim a bigger share of futureorders.   Still, the downturn in military sales is expected tostabilize at a level 20% lower than before, Rolls-Royceestimates. That gives added importance to the civil aerospacemarket. And the most important piece of that is the &quot;big-fan&quot;engines for the new generation of wide-body jets.   The industry expects the big-fan market to amount to $50billion over the next decade and to account for about halfthe total civil engine market. Boeing estimates that airlinepassenger traffic, despite the current slump, will grow by anaverage annual rate of 5.2% through 2005. But with airportcapacity remaining relatively unchanged, airlines will haveto rely on the new wide-body planes to accommodate the risingnumber of passengers.   But Rolls-Royce lags far behind in supplying engines forthat category of planes. Definitions vary as to whatconstitutes a big-fan engine, but one tally shows GE with 63big-fan customers, Pratt andamp; Whitney with 44 -- and Rolls-Roycewith just 10.   Nowhere are Rolls-Royce's troubles more evident than inthe battle to get its engines accepted for the new widebodies. McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11 entered service thisyear; Airbus Industrie's A-330 and A-340 series are scheduledto start service in January; and Boeing's 777 is to enterservice in 1995. But Rolls-Royce has had success only withthe A-330, for which it has a third of the engine market.   In seeking a place on the MD-11, Rolls-Royce promoted itsnew Trent engine, even though it won't be ready until 1994 --three years after MD-11 deliveries began. Rolls-Royce waseager to start recovering the #500 million ($850 million) itspent to develop the engine.   Rolls-Royce officials now acknowledge that was a blunder.Because of the engine's late availability, Rolls-Royce landedonly one customer, Air Europe, which later went out ofbusiness. Rolls-Royce has since abandoned hope of getting itsengines on the MD-11.   Then came the failure with British Airways and the Boeing777. British Airways won't disclose why it chose GE, sayingonly that it accepted the best offer. Industry officials andanalysts suggest that GE's #272 million purchase of a BritishAirways engine-overhaul unit in South Wales, announced at thetime of the engine order, may have had something to do withit. Both British Airways and GE say the two transactionsweren't related. GE of the U.S. is unrelated to GeneralElectric Co. of Britain.   Rolls-Royce did manage to place the Trent engine on the777 with an order from Thai Airways International to outfitits six 777s. But at least one analyst says it's too late forRolls-Royce to take a serious share of the 777 market.Indeed, several industry analysts suggest that Rolls-Roycewon the sale only by giving Thai Airways deep discounts.   Sir Ralph disputes that. &quot;We don't sell equipment to losemoney,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm not concerned about the 777. I thinkwe'll get our share of the market.&quot; He says Rolls-Royce is intalks with several other carriers about 777 orders.   Nonetheless, Sir Ralph is acutely aware of the dilemmafacing Rolls-Royce in the big-fan market. &quot;If you can't sellengines, you're not going to be on airplanes,&quot; he says. &quot;Ifyou're not on airplanes, you can't sell engines.&quot;   That's because to airlines, price is only one factor in anengine-buying decision. Of almost equal importance is theneed for a common fleet, which helps airlines cutmaintenance, training and other costs. That makes it crucialfor an engine maker to have its equipment installed early ona new line of planes. Roll-Royce has often stumbled on thatfront.   Nonetheless, Sir Ralph says he is optimistic Rolls-Roycecan continue competing in the big-fan market. Certainly,Rolls-Royce did overcome its handicaps to succeed in themarket for 747 engines, winning about 30% of orders.   For now, Rolls-Royce does have a healthy balance sheet.Though pretax profit plummeted in the first half to #11million from #115 million a year earlier, much of thatreflected a #26 million charge for the restructuring andlayoff program, and a #32 million rise in research anddevelopment costs to #118 million.   &quot;That's going to make us very lean and very hungry,&quot; saysSir Ralph. &quot;We don't intend to hire {the idled workers}back.&quot;   Scrappy as it may be, Rolls-Royce will still be leftfacing tough competitors that benefit from havingdeep-pocketed parent companies. &quot;When push comes to shove,&quot;one analyst observes, &quot;the resources behind GE and Pratt andamp;Whitney are larger than {those behind} Rolls-Royce.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
