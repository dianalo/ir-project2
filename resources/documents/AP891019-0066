The first post-walkout talks between Boeing Co. andrepresentatives of 58,700 workers in the International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace Workers union fizzled Wednesday justfour hours after they began.   Through a federal mediator, Boeing negotiators told the unionthey would not expand the economic package union members rejectedOct. 3, but were willing ``to make adjustments within the frameworkof the original wage offer,'' the company said in a statement.   ``They might be willing to move the numbers around a little bit,but that's not what it's all about,'' said Tom Baker, president ofIAM District Lodge 751. ``It's about improvement.''   Any further talks will be scheduled by federal mediator DouglasHammond. He said he will maintain contact with both sides daily,but he held out little hope for an immediate resolution.   ``If the parties continue to agree to disagree there's nothing Ican do about it,'' Hammond said.   The talks were the first since Oct. 2, two days before IAMmembers struck to press for a bigger share of Boeing's recordprofits.   Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean on Wednesday defended thecompany's wage offer as fair, equitable and the best three-yearoffer in recent American industry history.   The Machinists voted 85 percent to strike rather than take acontract with annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3percent the second; cost-of-living boosts virtually matchinginflation; a cut in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from200 hours; and higher benefits.   Baker said Boeing's unwillingness to budge didn't surprise thestrikers and he viewed the brief meeting as just a start.   ``We'll take it a day at a time,'' he said, adding he planned tojoin the picket line today. ``That's where the fight will be won,on the picket line.''   Rather than rush to a settlement, Baker added, union negotiatorsplanned to move cautiously to avoid a second rejection vote thatcould leave both sides more entrenched.   The Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers in the PugetSound area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and afew hundred others at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,Montana, Utah and other states.   For Boeing, there have been growing reports of concern aboutdelayed aircraft deliveries to Malaysia Airlines, America WestAirlines and British Airways. Boeing has delivered seven planesduring the strike.   An agreement would set a pattern for other labor negotiations atBoeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, andtraditionally sets the standard for the nation's aerospace industry.</TEXT></DOC>
