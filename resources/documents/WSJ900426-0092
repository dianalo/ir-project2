The bill, which also applies to savings and loanassociations and credit unions, passed by a vote of 406-0.The legislation is aimed at battling what law enforcementofficials say is vastly increased money laundering from theillegal drug trade.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In plain language, the provisions hold out the deathpenalty for the management and for any financial institutionitself convicted of money laundering,&quot; said Rep. FrankAnnunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of the House BankingSubcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision,Regulation and Insurance.   Under the legislation, regulators also could take controlof an institution if it alone -- not its management -- isconvicted of money laundering. Regulators would be requiredto hold a hearing and consider how involved the bank's seniormanagement was in money laundering before taking the action.This procedure would enable regulators to replace managementand make other changes without eliminating stockholders'ownership of the institution.   The bill is likely to become law by the end of the year. Asimilar measure has bipartisan support in the Senate BankingCommittee. The banking industry favors the legislation and aspokesman for the Treasury Department said the department&quot;strongly supports&quot; the bill.   Treasury and the banking industry joined in opposition toa proposed amendment from Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.)that would have required banks to maintain records oninternational wire transfers if the Treasury certifies therecords are useful. Law enforcement authorities have pointedto wire transfers as a key tool that illegal drug businessesuse to move money out of the country. Opponents argued theprovision would be burdensome to banks and noted the Treasuryis currently working on new regulations for wire transfers.The amendment was rejected 283-127.   However, the House approved on a voice vote an amendmentoffered by Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.) directing theTreasury to consider whether removing $50 and $100 bills fromcirculation would hurt the illegal drug trade.   One member of the House, Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.) voted&quot;present&quot; on the legislation. Mr. Cooper said he &quot;owns a lotof bank stock&quot; from a family inheritance and chooses not tovote on banking legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
