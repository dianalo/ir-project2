<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-1291 </DOCNO><TEXT>Under the authority of NOVEM BV, Netherlands Agency for Energy and Environment,the Apeldoorn based branch of the Division of Technology for SocietyTNO of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research hasdemonstrated savings in electric power consumption of industrial refrigerationcompressors. This is realized by application of pole-reversible electromotorswhich enable speed reduction of the motor. The possibility of speed reductionof the electromotor results in capacity/output control of the compressor.The test facility uses a 4-cylinder refrigeration compressor having acapacity of 30 kW at -10 to 30 C. Test facility and measuring proceduresare described; test results are given in comparison with valve lift methods.Different coolants are tested. 4 figs., 3 tabs., 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
