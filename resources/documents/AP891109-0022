Law professor William E. Kovacic said his findings may beespecially significant if President Bush chooses judges of the samecast of mind as those appointed by Reagan. In eight years, Reagannamed 347, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federal judges,who serve life terms.   By the end of Bush's term in 1992, Kovacic noted, ``Reagan-Bushnominees could account for as many as 75 percent of all federalCourt of Appeals judges.''   When Reagan-Bush judges constitute that big a majority, Kovacicnoted, they ``might be inclined over time to endorse more extremepositions in writing majority opinions'' because they won't feelcompelled to achieve consensus with more moderate judges.   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Kovacic said everyone knowsabout the impact of a president's choices for Supreme Courtvacancies, ``but the same kind of effects, though not quite sodramatic, can result from whom he picks for the district andcircuit courts.''   ``Of all the tools at a president's disposal, this is animportant one,'' he said. ``If you want to make your policiesoutlive your administration, this is one of the most importantmeans for doing that.''   Kovacic's analysis was published by the Washington LegalFoundation, a conservative research organization. Kovacic teachesat George Mason University in Virginia.   He studied how appeals court judges voted on environmental casesarising from enactment of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.   In 162 cases in which Reagan and Carter appointees cast 254votes, he found that Carter's judges voted 54 percent of the timeto increase the regulatory burden on those whose pollution emissionor discharge activities were under consideration. Judges appointedby Reagan voted that way 43 percent of the time.   On the key District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, oftencalled the country's second most important court, the differenceswere sharper. Carter appointees voted 48 percent of the time toincrease the pollution-fighting burden of parties before the courtwhile Reagan judges voted that way only half as often.   ``The results are not entirely clear-cut,'' Kovacic concluded,noting that when Carter and Reagan judges sat on the same panelthey rarely disagreed. ``It nonetheless appears that the Reaganappointments on the whole succeeded in bringing lessintervention-minded judges to the courts of appeals.''   The tendencies of judges are particularly important, Kovacicsaid, in regulatory issues where Congress often gives anadministrative body, like the Environmental Protection Agency,broad authority to implement comparatively general statutes and thecourts find themselves overseeing their work.   Other studies have reached the same conclusion about thelong-term impact of judicial selections. Sheldon Goldman, politicalscientist at the University of Massachusetts, wrote last summerthat the real impact of Reagan's appointments will reach into the21st century and likely will be reinforced by Bush's judges.   ``For civil libertarians this means that when the countrycelebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill ofRights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to aliberal reading of those rights,'' Goldman wrote. ``For judicialconservatives, this means a healthy return to government by theelected representatives of the people.''   Kovacic noted speculation that substantial numbers ofReagan-appointed judges, younger than average and often withcollege-age children, may quit the bench for the higher earningpotential of law practice, especially if Congress doesn't raisejudges' salaries.   ``The real test of whether the Reagan-Bush appointments willhave long-lasting effects depends on whether the people they haveselected will remain in those jobs,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
