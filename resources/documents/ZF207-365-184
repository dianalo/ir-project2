and, &quot;If so, which of today's systems are capable ofproducing it?&quot;andP;  But in pursuing those questions, the sessions probedinteresting areas relating to the adequacy of PostScript, the sophisticationof desktop systems, the need for standards in interfacing low-end andhigh-end systems, and myriad other topics.andM;The day's sessions covered many points of view, from the high end of themarket to the low, from commercial perspectives to newspapers to corporatepublishing.andP;  But throughout the sessions, as with most other parts of theprogram, the subject of PostScript was intertwined in nearly everydiscussion.andP;  The PostScript debate generally centered on the issue of whetheror not PostScript was suitable for producing full, process color at anacceptable level of quality and performance.andM;Another issue focused on whether color could be produced from a desktopplatform, and, if so, what sort of color was possible?andM;Those two issues--desktop platforms and PostScript capabilities--havecombined to generate an increasing amount of interest and concern recently asthe more advanced desktop publishing systems have added some degree of colorfunctionality, which, in turn, requires an ability to output color pages.andO;Besides the tendency for desktop publishing systems to add colorcapabilities, there have been a few new systems built on relatively low-costpersonal computer platforms that are being marketed to handle full processcolor, using PostScript as their predominant means of output.andM;At our conferences last fall in Santa Clara and Amsterdam, there was a greatdegree of discussion about the inadequacies of PostScript for color in aproduction environment, and an increasing awareness of the need for asolution.andP;  So it wasn't surprising that the event this March was accompaniedby great anticipation that something would be done to clarify the situationand to clear a path for the future.andM;The technology and the marketandM;One focus concerned market positioning and the increasing awareness of colorand the corresponding demand to have it.andP;  Presentations centered on thevarious applications for color publishing and the levels of technology thatare currently being used for them.andM;The role of the office.andP;  Brad Kruchten of Kodak noted the growth of officecolor requirements and said he anticipated an increase in the growth rate,similar to what has happened in the field of amateur photography, where 98%of the market is now in color rather than monochrome.andP;  The move toward coloris exemplified by the fact that more color monitors are currently beingshipped than monochrome ones, he said, in spite of the fact that the finalproduct remains generally black-and-white.andM;He quoted a number of studies showing improved identification and retentionof information when it is presented in color, not unlike studiesdemonstrating that typeset output improves readability and retention ofinformation in comparison to typewritten copy.andM;Of course, Kodak is hardly a disinterested party.andP;  Besides its contributionin the photographic area, it is anxious to bring color into the officethrough color copiers and printers.andP;  Brad identified some current barriers toacceptance of these color devices, including productivity, reliability, cost,image quality and compatibility.andP;  He said he expected the markets for colorin the office to be determined in part by how these barriers are removed.andM;These markets include on-demand color publishing, presentation graphics,applications where color is used for impact, and complex applications with arequirement for full color.andP;  Kodak believes it is unlikely that one productcan address the needs of all these areas.andM;The Kodak presentation brought up the issues of color compatibility, deviceindependence and accurate color calibration.andP;  It also brought out adivergence of opinion from the quality-oriented prepress color vendors inthat it looked toward international standards to assist in solving theseproblems, partly through the CIE LUV color separation and space definitionswithin the ODA standard.andP;  The general response from the traditional colorvendors was that this standard was unlikely to satisfy the needs of theirpart of the market.andM;&quot;Adequate&quot; vs.andP;  &quot;commercial.&quot;andP;  Following the presentation from Kodak, EliIsraeli of Scitex defined what Scitex saw as the difference between the lowend and high end of the color market, or, as he termed it, &quot;adequate color&quot;and  &quot;commercial-quality color.&quot;andM;He said that the level of quality defines the final production process andthat the requirements for commercial-quality color output, with all itsvariables, can only be met currently by a high-end solution.andP;  Israeli listedsom of the variables that must be controlled to produce such levels ofquality: screen presentation, assembly and editing of data, input of colorimages with the required resolution and color depth, processing power and theneed to handle images at high resolution, and the requirements for power andnetwork speed to move high-resolution images.andM;Israeli stated that many of these functions can be handled on lower-levelsystems, but that they are uneconomical currently because they require theoperator to wait too long for the system to process a task.andP;  In commercialwork, he said, productivity is the key requirement of a system.andM;Vendors and the market.andP;  Mills Davis attempted to clarify the availablesystems and their corresponding markets in a whistle-stop tour (with a lot ofwhistle and not much stop) that endeavoured to position every vendor in themarket and to identify market differences.andP;  He tried to identify the currentlevels of acceptance of systems in each market, from which he attempted topredict which market areas were most likely to develop in the future.andM;* Color prepress services.andP;  In the U.S., Davis said, there are 2,000 colortrade shops, with a possibility of as many as 5,000 new companies entering.andO;He said 90% of the current trade shops have scanners and more than 40% havecolor systems, but fewer than 10% have any art or design operations.andP;  In hisview, this is a motivated market and one of the key areas for high growth incolor.andM;* Slide producers, typesetters, quick printers and photo labs.andP;  Davis saidthis group comprises more than 30,000 businesses in the U.S.andP;  He stated thatmore than 65% of the slide producers have composition systems, as do 95% ofthe typesetters and 40% of the quick printers, but only 5% of the photo labs.andO;He didn't indicate how many of these systems are capable of handling color.andO;This market, too, is poised for rapid growth, Mills said.andM;* Ad agencies and public relations.andP;  In the ad agency/public relations marketthere are about 15,000 firms, less than 20% of which have any form of coloror design system, according to Davis.andP;  However, since this market has arecord of very low spending on capital purchases, it is unlikely to be amajor area for future system growth.andM;* Newspapers, magazines and catalogs.andP;  This area, comprising more than 15,000businesses, has seen low penetration of color systems to date: more than 30%of the newspapers have some form of color equipment, but the other areas haveless than 20% penetration, earmarking this as an area poised for growth.andM;* Corporate communications.andP;  Also poised for growth is this area, where thereare more than 80,000 businesses, only 45% of the which have installedsystems.andM;* Graphic artists and designers.andP;  Davis estimated there are 100,000 U.S.andO;businesses in this category, with a low rate of penetration of computersystems, which suggests that this area is poised for growth.andM;With respect to functions required in the prepress market, Davis agreed withIsraeli of Scitex in stating that the key differences between design,production and prepress systems concern resolution, accuracy and powerrequirements.andP;  He characterized the market segments as:andM;* Design--layout, display and body type, line art, information graphics andphoto design.andM;* Production--contone art, photo illustration and synthetic imagery(montaging, air brushing, etc.).andM;* Prepress--color correction and separation, screening and stripping.andM;The idea of splitting the production and prepress phases is relatively recentand reflects the structure of the newer suppliers, rather than theestablished color prepress equipment vendors, as many of the newer suppliersrely on a separate system to handle the final output of the fourprocess-color films.andM;Davis projected the market size for the color prepress area based upon price.andO;He estimates that the potential number of unit sales for systems costing lessthan $20,000 is 300,000 units; for systems priced at $20,000 to $40,000, heforesees sales of 100,000 units; and for systems ranging from $40,000 to$80,000, the market potential is 50,000 units.andM;'Good-enough' vs.andP;  high-end colorandM;As we noted earlier, the key questions that prevaded the entire colordiscussion were whether or not there was a market for &quot;good-enough&quot; color andwhether or not PostScript could handle the requirements of quality color.andM;Differentiating factors.andP;  The crucial distinguishing factors that separatethese market tiers may be the quality (sharpness, resolution, evenness) ofthe color image and, especially, the accuracy and consistency of colorreproduction.andM;There was general agreement that low-end applications can be served byapproximate color.andP;  Red is red, blue is blue.andP;   There was also generalagreement that the high-end requires extraordinary precise control overcolor.andP;  Images must be balanced for the specific printingplate/press/ink/paper combination to be used for the final run.andP;  Even themost carefully calibrated display screens cannot be trusted to present acompletely faithful representation of the colors in the printed job.andM;The controversy lies in the middle.andP;  What is &quot;good enough&quot; color? How do youget it?andP;  Can desktop tools (and PostScript) be cost-effective in producingit?andM;Matthew Kubitsky of CyberPublishing attempted to answer these questions byusing his company's own experience.andP;  CyberPublishing introduced itsCyberChrome system in the middle of 1987 and installed the first one early in1988, producing what the trade had started to call &quot;good-enough color.&quot;andP;  Thesystem was targeted at magazines and catalog publishers serving the lower endof the color quality spectrum, with output to Linotronic 300 service bureaus.andM;However, CyberPublishing found that the market wouldn't accept the quality ofcolor produced through this operation because of its lack of consistency,poor throughput and general inability to achieve an acceptable standard.andM;CyberPublishing went back to the drawing board to come up with an enhancedsystem based on its new-found knowledge.andP;  It now claims to have reached alevel that will produce results suitable for 75% of the market, although itstill won't be adequate for the complex color advertising area.andM;The system outputs to film in one step, using PostScript, or it produces aPICT2 or EPSF image for input to software such as Quark Xpress.andP;  The systemincludes scanning software for handling Cyber's own scanner; color imageediting software based on TIPS, Rio and Time Arts Lumena; and colorseparation using Cyber's own software.andP;  The company claims that it nowproduces higher-quality output in less time than can be achieved using thenormal separation capabilities of the PostScript language.andM;Kubitsky's conclusions were (1) that there is no current market for colorthat is almost commercial; (2) that publishers are the best customers becausethey are motivated by profit considerations and can make &quot;good-enough&quot;quality decisions; and (3) that the problem with PostScript color is havingconfidence in PostScript.andM;He also commented on the problems of building color systems withoff-the-shelf components.andP;  Difficulties include calibration of color devicesand supporting alternative interfaces, as well as the fact that componentstend to conflict with each other.andP;  He concluded that achieving performancegoals for complete production systems based strictly on PostScript isn'tpossible with off-the-shelf components.andM;The Quad approach.andP;  One of the speakers at the Desktop Publishing Conferencelast September was Alan Darling of the Quad/Text division of Quad Graphics, avery large color magazine and catalog printer.andP;  In September, Darlingoutlined the system he proposed to develop, which was based on desktopcomponents and would enable his customers to handle the designing andstripping of color pages at their own sites for input into the Quad system.andO;At the March Seminars he gave a promising progress report on where Quad/Textwas in the development and introduction of the ADEPT system (Automated Designand Electronic Production Tools).andM;The intention is to move the design and page assembly tasks of producingcolor pages back into the clients' offices, leaving Quad to handle thehigh-resolution scanned color image data and the total production managementof the process.andP;   ADEPT has been built primary using off-the-shelf componentsfrom the desktop area, which Quad/Text has integrated to make a total system.andM;The system is built around DEC Vax or MicroVax file servers in both theproduction and client sites.andP;  They communicate with each other to transfertext, layout and low-resolution graphic files.andP;  The software on the Vaxcomputers is Odesta's ODMS, which is said to be maturing into a very powerfultool for production control.andP;  Quad/Text is one of the beta sites for thissoftware.andM;Pictures are scanned in the Scitex system.andP;  Low-resolution copies of theseimages are transmitted back to the MicroVax at the client's site.andP;  TheMacintoshes at the client site are connected to the local Vax file server.andM;The client uses Macintosh software (Scitex/Quark Visionary or Crosfield'sLightspeed design system) to design pages; to compose text; to place rulesand tints; and to size, place and crop color photos.andP;  When the finished jobis sent back to Quad, the color-retouched high-resolution versions of thecolor images are automatically substituted for the low-resolution copies usedfor page assembly.andM;The Odesta ODMS software automatically tracks the status of every element onevery page.andP;  Clients and Quad account representatives communicate viaelectronic mail (which Quad finds is far more effective for this purpose thanplaying telephone tag).andM;Quad has completed the implementation and testing phases of the project andhas signed its first customer.andP;  While it is too early to quote benefits basedon actual usage, this project is viewed as an indication of the way a largerepro and printing operation is likely to work in the future: customers takecontrol of their own work, but the printer manages the total operation.andP;  Theperceived benefits that will accrue are in the areas of cost reduction,reduced turnaround times, and more user control over the production process.andM;Based on developments to date, Quad has found a number of items that loom aspotential limitations if the policy of using off-the-shelf products isstrictly adhered to.andP;  The first is that the typography available throughApple and Adobe is inadequate in number of fonts and in their character sets,which lack fractions and ligatures.andM;Quad Graphics has signed an agreement with Bitstream for its entire fontlibrary to get over this font problem (and also to maintain compatibilitywith the Scitex and Lightspeed products in use).andP;  It also has needed tohandle import of PostScript files into the Scitex system, and for this haspurchased Hyphen software to run on the Vax computer to convert PostScriptfiles into Scitex line-art files.andM;Micros for inhouse color design.andP;  Martin Dowzal of Letraset spoke of thepotential of microcomputers in prepress color, making specific reference tothe Letraset products.andP;  The New Products Showcase at the Seminars was thevehicle for the launch of Letraset's new ColorStudio product.andM;Letraset contends that its market research has shown a high demand by thecreative graphics community to have the abilities of a high-end prepressworkstation, with its manipulation, retouching, modification and enhancementof color images, in their shops, rather than using outside services.andP;  Theobjective is to have an affordable solution that will allow  designers toconcentrate on the aesthetics they desire, without the pressures of time andcost.andP;  Letraset also foresees the demand for a rich set of tools to allow forthe creation of painting and illustration, with filters to convert scannedimages into varying art techniques such as oil, watercolor or crayon, as wellas generating random texture effects.andP;  It is also expected that such systemswill link to existing desktop publishing page layout and illustration systemsto become part of a total system for a designer.andM;Dowzal contended that the user of such a system will not want to handle colorseparation, which will remain the task of the skilled professional, handledas a separate pass.andP;  Separation probably will be performed on amicrocomputer, taking into account dot gain, under-color removal (UCR),gray-component replacement (GCR) and screen angles.andM;Output could be to a PostScript imagesetter or via conversion from atraditional color prepress system.andM;Dowzal didn't see micro-based systems replacing the work of the traditionalhigh-end systems, but rather supplementing them by providing lower-costediting workstations for use by new color operators.andP;  He foresaw the adventof more powerful processors, such as the 68040 and VLSI processors, andbetter operating systems, which will make it possible to handle larger imagesmore easily.andM;In the meantime, he saw the role of micro systems as reducing thetime-consuming aspects of the artistic task and merging the functions of theillustration and photographic operations.andP;  He also foresaw a new market formicro-based systems in which customers demand quick turnaround and low-volumeruns, a market where &quot;good-enough&quot; color may actually be good enough.andM;In response to our question, he did admit that the approach leaves open asubstantial question of color calibration.andP;  What is the color prepress houseto do when the client says, &quot;That's not the green I saw on may screen&quot;?andM;Advantages of the high end.andP;  This is precisely what bothered Jim Klauber ofHell Graphic Systems.andP;  Looking at the emerging situation from the perspectiveof a high-end vendor, Klauber contended that the desktop systems simply donot provide the color accuracy, fidelity and calibration required for qualitycolor reproduction.andP;  He accepted the proposition that desktop systems cangive design professionals direct access to tools to create electronicmechanicals for input into high-end systems.andP;  But he doesn't think that thenew generation of low-cost systems--or the inexperienced people who arelikely to run them--are capable of producing quality color work on a volumeproduction basis.andM;To some observers, this argument appeared to be a replay of the statements bymonochrome system vendors several years ago that desktop systems would not beappropriate for production of professional-quality output.andP;  However, colordoes pose some unique problems.andP;  Color images require huge amounts of data;digital screening of color separations is an exacting, compute-intensive art(more on this in a moment); calibration (trying to insure that the color yousee on the screen bears a predictable relationship to the color you will seeon the final printed piece) is a nightmare; the controls required forconsistent color reproduction are terribly exacting; and relatively fewpeople have any experience with or expertise in color reproduction.andM;All the same, history suggests that the color system vendors (and the colorprepress houses that use their equipment) cannot afford to get toocomplacent!andM;Color PostScriptandM;As noted above, any discussion of &quot;mid-range&quot; or &quot;good-enough&quot; colorultimately returns to a discussion of PostScript output of color images.andM;Four key issues tend to get intermixed in any discussion of output of colorseparations on high-resolution PostScript recorders.andP;  We tried to disentanglethem in the seminar discussions.andP;  They are:andM;1.andP;  The capabilities of typesetters as imagesetters.andP;  An output recorder thatdoes fine for text and line graphics may do much less well for screen tintsand halftones.andP;  David Spencer has discussed in these pages many of theseissues as they relate to plain-paper laser printers.andP;  The same problems mustbe dealt with in high-resolution output recorders as well.andM;Color output only compounds the problem.andP;  Registration and repeatabilityissues that are not significant in monochrome output become crucial when youare outputting color separations of screen tints or pictures.andP;  Linotypecontended that it has made continual improvements to the design of theLinotronic 300 recorders to make them more suitable for color output.andP;  As ithad in September, it claimed that the most recent changes (made within thepast months) make the machine entirely suitable for color output recording.andM;Other people argued that a start/stop machine like the Linotronic hasinherent problems and that a better approach is to buffer the entire image,then expose the output film in a continuous pass without starting andstopping.andM;Everyone agreed that the large drum machines used in high-end color systemsproduce the best results.andP;  Large, expensive flatbed machines with lots ofmechanical precision should be next best.andM;2.andP;  PostScript color screening algorithms.andP;  Everyone has complained thatPostScript does not generate &quot;proper&quot; color separation screens.andP;  Adobeexplained why, and introduced what it believes are some workarounds in theform of nonstandard color separation screen angles.andM;3.andP;  The speed of PostScript color separations.andP;  Everyone complains thatPostScript color separations are slow.andP;  This is largely a matter ofprocessing speed.andP;  As mentioned in our previous issue, Linotype introduced atthe Seminars a faster RIP III version of its current 68020 controller.andP;  Thiswill help, but it will not solve the problem.andP;  For cost-effective coloroutput, users are really going to need the much faster PostScript processorsthat are now in the pipeline.andM;4.andP;  Skills and experience.andP;  There is a growing consensus that consistent,quality output of color requires knowledge and discipline that the typicaltypesetting service bureau simply does not have.andP;  Some may learn how to dealwith color.andP;  But it is equally likely that companies who already understandcolor reproduction may begin to move into the PostScript color outputrecording service business.andM;The GPI alternative.andP;  As we discussed in our last issue (pp.andP;  31-33), it isbecoming increasingly clear that desktop screen imaging models--in particularthe Graphic Programming Interface (GPI) used in Microsoft's OS/2 PresentationManager and the QuickDraw imaging language used in the Apple Macintosh--areemerging as potential challengers to PostScript.andM;In spite of the relative immaturity of GPI, QMS (which, by the way, was thefirst supplier of PostScript color printers) believes that because OS/2Presentation Manager will be the dominant operating environment for desktopworkstations in the coming decade, direct GPI color output will beincreasingly important in the color market.andM;QMS is implementing GPI color printers.andM;As noted in our last issue, there are a number of hurdles to be overcome.andO;The first is that the current implementation of GPI doesn't support scalablefonts.andP;  QMS espects Microsoft to remedy this in future releases.andP;  In themeantime, it is using the outline font technology it acquired when itacquired Imagen.andP;  Since Imagen had rights to use the Linotype library, QMSwill offer Linotype fonts that closely parallel their PostScript equivalents.andM;The second impediment is that GPI provides no support for process color.andO;Only red-green-blue color is handled.andP;  However, QMS believes that this willnot be a significant limitation for most of the Presentation Managerapplications and that the lower cost and higher speed of a GPI printer(compared to a PostScript printer) will make it attractive.andP;  If this turnsout to be true, we expect that the rest of the color market will have tolearn to accommodate color GPI output as well.andM;Color PostScript.andP;  In the meantime, for most of the market, &quot;good-enough&quot;color output probably means PostScript color output.andP;  Adobe is well aware ofthe criticisms that have been leveled against high-resolution PostScriptcolor output.andP;  John Warnock of Adobe used the Seminars to explain how Adobeis responding to these criticisms.andP;  He stated that in the initial plans forPostScript a &quot;placeholder&quot; was put in for handling color, leaving much of itsdefinition to a later time.andP;  When the first attempts were madeto handlecolor, certain deficiencies in this early specification were found, and extrafunctionality was added to the PostScript operations to take this intoaccount.andM;The demand for color PostScript didn't really take off until applicationprograms such as Adobe Illustrator started to address the issue of colorscreening.andP;  From experience following this, Adobe formed a belief that thereare no inherent limitations in PostScript to prevent it from handling largecolor image files.andP;  The major limitations are with communications networks.andO;When faster networks become available, PostScript will become moreappropriate.andP;  This view was echoed in the newspaper session later in the weekwhen Alan Marshall of The Evening Standard outlined his newspaper'sexperience with the Hyphen PostScript RIP in endeavouring to achieve fastoutput of newspaper pages.andP;  He concluded that fast networks and datacompression were the key, rather than still faster RIPs.andM;But Warnock admits that appreciably faster PostScript RIPs certainly will berequired for color output.andP;  Screening color separations is a verycompute-intensive application.andP;  Adobe is implementing PostScript on severalRISC-architecture chips (including the Weitek set).andP;  These implementationsshould yield substantially faster PostScript controllers, which are bettersuited to the demands of high-resolution color output.andM;Warnock began to address the main questions that are being asked aboutPostScript: achieving acceptable quality control and screening, plus avoidingthe moire effect that is frequently seen.andM;On the issue of color quality and accuracy, Warnock stated that there is noindependent color standard and no means of accurately defining RGB and itsconversion into CYMK.andP;  Standards are being developed, but at present the onlystandard is output.andP;  A standard color definition would be ideal, he said, butthis is a very tall order in consideration of all the variables that have tobe taken into account.andP;  These variables concern the scanner response to theCCDs, the monitor phosphor, the characteristics of the thermal transfer orink-jet printers, the paper to be used, the ink or toner characteristics andtheir reaction with the paper, spectral response of the systems, the controlsof the positioning of the typesetter laser beam, the variables in filmprocessing, dot gain and inks on the press, etc.andM;This view was much more in line with the positions being taken by thehigh-end prepress vendors in looking at definitions of color space than itwas with those companies coming to color from the mainstream computer marktwho saw CIE LUV and ODA as the answer.andM;Adobe's strategy is to put the tools into place to enable the sophisticateduser to solve the problem.andP;  For example, a Macintosh user is faced with acolor monitor sporting a blue caste, much like the early Macintosh monochromemonitor.andP;  Within Illustrator, it is possible to produce color test swatchesto use in adjusting the monitor's setup.andP;  For density testing of output, itis possible to print film with normal settings and then adjust the AdobeSeparator output program using a densitometer to calculate the correctsettings.andP;  (We find it interesting to hear this proposed in this context whenit has been an absolute requirement in high-end repro operation, whichsuggests that some of the problems with Postcript color may be self-inducedby the users not understanding what is industry practice in the high-endcolor area).andM;The issue of screening angles is more complex.andP;  The fundamental problem isthat it is mathematically impossible to calculate digital screens that matchexactly the traditional angles for color separations.andP;  There are solutions tothe problem, but these are covered by patents--in particular those held byHell.andM;If you don't use traditional screen angles, you face the likelihood of moireinterference patterns caused by repetition in the intersections between thescreen angles used for two or more colors.andM;At the Seminars, Adobe announced a &quot;workaround&quot; for this problem: after agreat deal of experimentation, it has worked out the different combinationsof &quot;nontraditional&quot; screen angles for different output resolutions:andM;Adobe admits that these angles are not as good as the traditional angles, butpending resolution of the patent restrictions, it feels that these anglesshould produce substantially better results than those previously used forPostScript color output.andM;Setting different screen angles for different output resolutions implies, ofcourse, that the user has to know the output device and the output resolutionto be used.andP;  This does make a particular color PostScript output file prettydevice-specific.andP;  But we think it is a reasonable tradeoff under thecircumstances.andM;The Hell patents.andP;  Since the Hell patents hae emerged as a crucial issue forhigh-resolution color output, we asked Dr. Klaus Wellendorf, executive vicepresident of Dr.-Ing.andP;  Rudolf Hell GmbH, to explain the situation.andP;  Heindicated that in Hell's 20 years of pioneering efforts in electronic colorscreening it has generated many patents.andP;  The principal patents of interest,concerning rational tangent screens, have been licensed to its major high-endcompetitors: Crosfield, Dainipon Screen and Scitex.andP;  (The latter one wasarranged only after litigation and compensation paid by Scitex.)andM;There are also patents covering regular screen frequencies made up ofmultiple sub-dots.andP;  These patents cover the 30- and 60-degree calculationsthat Warnock referred to.andP;  The approach of this technology is to make themoire effect as small as possible so as to be virtually indistinguishable.andO;It also is used to avoid color shifting.andM;A second group of Hell patents is needed to handle image sharpness, whichinvolves the shifting of dots at borders of an image area or at the edges ofa typeface character.andP;  This also covers multiple sampling of a scanned imageto be able to generate an irregular dot shape to increase image sharpness.andM;A third group of patents covers intelligent random screening so as not togenerate a pattern with very fine laser dots.andP;  This is used particularly withmultiple laser-beam recorders operating at very high resolution.andP;  It is idealfor flat colors and for generating extreme sharpness.andM;We are not experts in this area, but it appears to us that the Hell patentsare quite comprehensive and that it would be quite difficult to generatehigh-quality color output without infringing on one or more of these patents.andO;It looks to our eyes as if one or more of the newer high-resolution coloroutput vendors has a problem on this score.andP;  We even wonder if Adobe's new&quot;nontraditional&quot; screen angles might inadvertently conflict with one of thelesser-known Hell patents.andM;On this score, among the most interesting exchanges of the week were themutual compliments exchanged by Adobe's Warnock and Hell's Wellendorf.andP;  Theyleft the impression that the two companies are well-acquainted with eachother's work, and that they have had serious discussions.andP;  Neither Warnocknor Wellendorf was prepared to comment further.andM;Further directionsandM;The daytime color session concluded with three views of the future of colorimaging: one from Efi Arazi, the founder of Scitex; one from Alvy Ray Smith,one of the founders of Pixar; and one from Paul Brainerd of Aldus.andM;Automated color.andP;  As part of the deal that brought Robert Maxwell intoScitex, Arazi has now sold all of his shares of Scitex stock.andP;  He has set upa company called EFI (Electronics for Imaging) to implement his concepts onhow to bring color to a wider market.andM;Briefly stated, Efi believes that much of the judgment and craft skillrequired for good color reproduction can now be bottled and built intointelligent computer software.andP;  Put another way, he believes that the use ofcolor will grow tremendously if the industry can find ways to make themysteries of color reproduction accessible to a much wider market.andM;His new company plans to develop core hardware and software technologymodules that system companies and output device manufacturers can incorporateinto their color products.andP;  In simplest terms, he expects that thistechnology will allow users to produce &quot;good-enough&quot; color output that isboth truly good enough for most publishing applications and far moreproductive and cost effective than either traditional high-end systems or thecurrent generation of desktop color systems.andM;Synthetic images.andP;  Alvy Ray Smith of Pixar introduced a new dimension to thediscussion with the argument that publishing systems of the future will haveto cope not only with &quot;natural&quot; color images scanned from photographs, butphoto-realistic synthetic images generated by computer systems.andP;  To this wewould add hybrid images that combine natural, scanned information withsynthetic computer-generated information.andM;To support his argument, he showed samples of synthesized photo-realisticimages that are appreciably more realistic than the kinds of things mostpeople associate with computer-generated images.andM;Pixar's RenderMan 3D rendering language has become an increasingly popularstandard in the image modeling world.andP;  We don't think it will be too longbefore you will see demand for support for Renderman color images inpublishing systems.andP;  We also expect to see efforts made to marry PostScript2D imaging conventions and RenderMan 3D conventions.andM;The broadening color base.andP;  The final speaker, Paul Brainerd of Aldus,provided an intellectual construct that tied together much of what had beendiscussed during the day.andM;Brainerd applied the classic pyramid analogy to the color market.andP;  The usualconvention is that the base of the pyramid represents the broad market: wideapplication, low cost, modest quality requirements.andP;  The top of the pyramidrepresents the specialist market: much higher quality and productivity requirements, but much higher costs, and a much smaller (numerically) market.andM;Brainerd positions the established color prepress market at the top of thispyramid.andP;  At the bottom he places the corporate and office color market:presentations, CAD, documents with highlight color, etc.andP;  This is a rapidlygrowing market served by the new generation of color printers, color copiers,slide-makers, etc.andM;In between is the controversial &quot;good-enough&quot; market served by colorPostScript output.andP;  Like Arazi, Warnock and several other speakers, Brainerdclearly believes that this market exists, and that--in classic pyramidstyle--it will be larger than the high-end market.andM;The markets are distinguished in part by the types of proofs available,ranging from casual or approximate color at the low end to what he calls&quot;contracts&quot; proofs at the high end.andP;   One of the major challenges that mustbe overcome to realize the growth potential in the low and medium ends of themarket is that of color calibration: closer matching of color on the screen,on proof print and on final output.andM;But Brainerd doesn't believe that these tiers are fixed divisions.andP;  In fact,he believes that eventually a large portion of the work produced via the toptier will have worked its way up through the two lower tiers.andP;  The high-endsystems have been designed to cope with huge files of raster data typical ofscanned color photographs.andP;  They have always had problems dealing with type,rules and geometric elements.andP;  Desktop publishing systems, on the other hand,have been designed from the beginning to deal with layout, text, rules,tints, reverses, etc.andP;  They are much less well suited for handling the hugeraster files generated by high-resolution scans of color images.andM;OPI.andP;  Ideally, the two types of systems should work together (as they do, forexample, in the Quad system).andP;  This observation led Aldus to develop andpropose the Open Prepress Interface (OPI) specification.andM;In essence, Aldus embeds image placement and manipulation information as aheader to an Encapsulated PostScript file.andP;  The color prepress system thatreceives the file is expected to interpret these instructions and manipulatethe image as requested, and merge it into the specified location on the page.andM;Quark (Visionary link to Scitex) and Letraset (Desklink for ReadySetGo tosupport Crosfield) have already built similar capabilities into theirproducts.andP;  The most important difference is that Aldus is offering itssolution as an open industry standard (Open Prepress Interface) which ithopes will be adopted by everyone (including its competitors).andM;Thus far, Crosfield, Dainippon Screen and Diadem have said that they willsupport OPI.andP;  Since the proposal is new, none has had time to work outspecifics as to how it will support it and when it will offer that support.andO;Other vendors, including Hell, have said that they will respond to marketpressure.andP;  If they have demand from customers, they too will undoubtedlysupport OPI.andM;Color vendors' meetingandM;On Wednesday night, Aldus and Tektronix sponsored a gathering for vendorsinvolved in color systems.andP;  The purpose was to identify issues that need tobe resolved to encourage development of multivendor, heterogeneous colorsystems.andM;The meeting quickly focused on the question of a standard system-independentmeans of specifying color (a standard &quot;color space&quot;).andP;  Just as quickly, itbroke down into what proved to be irreconcilable differences between vendorsserving the high end of Brainerd's market pyramid and the vendors who haveset their sights on the lower two-thirds of the pyramid.andM;The high-end vendors contend that what really matters to their customers isthe final CMYK result printed on a particular printing press, using aparticular combination of printing plates, inks and paper stock.andP;  They mustcalibrate all of the preparation steps to this result.andP;  Because of all of thevariables involved (including the influence of ambient lighting), screens, nomatter how carefully calibrated, can't be trusted completely.andP;  If you reallywant to be precise about a color, you will specify it in terms of outputCMYK.andM;The rest of the vendors were mostly in favor of a device-independent colorspace for specifying colors in a completely neutral fashion.andP;  It would be upto &quot;translate&quot; functions associated with each device (workstation or outputrecorder) to render these colors as accurately as possible.andM;Adobe was the principal vendor that sat on the fence.andP;  It sees merit in bothsets of arguments.andP;  It is also very concerned about the processing burden(and concomitant performance penalty) that a translation from an abstractcolor space might place on an already stressed color output recorder RIP.andM;As much as anything else, the division crystalized the split between thosewho believe in &quot;good-enough&quot; color and those who think that &quot;good-enough&quot; isan illusion.andP;  In the end, the &quot;good-enough&quot; crowd (led by Aldus, Tektronixand Kodak) decided to work together to decide which color space and dataformat standard to support.andP;  Companies interested in participating in theeffort should contact Peggy Thompson at Aldus.andM;User session on low-cost colorandM;Held for the first time, the low-end color users' session offered attendees aglimpse into how a few pioneering publishers are producing affordable colorseparations using microcomputer-based software.andP;  The fact that there are anyusers at all is significant because the market is only a year old.andO;(Pre-Press Technologies introduced its software at last year's Seminars;Best-info introduced Wave4 last June.)andP;  Based on the experiences of thespeakers, the desire to have color integrated with the editorial process willbe a driving factor in the acceptance of color separations by imagesetter.andM;Michael Tchong and Laslo Vespremi discussed how MacWeek is using the Macsoftware of Pre-Press Technologies to produce their own color separations,with Tchong addressing the publisher's perspective (&quot;If you can save $100,000a year in costs, and the quality is good enough, you will use desktoptechnology&quot;) and Vespremi filling in the technical details.andP;  They have beenpleased with the greater control, later deadlines and lower costs associatedwith the move to making their own separations.andM;Their Mac-oriented shop contrasted with the PC-based approach of Bob Towery,a catalog publisher who is using Bestinfo's Wave4 to produce four-colorseparations for his catalog.andP;  Towery noted that he, too, was unwilling tocompromise on quality, and with Bestinfo he has not had to.andP;  Like MacWeek,Towery now enjoys more control over the publication after it is in pages,with accompanying savings.andM;Roger Black addressed desktop color separations from a designer'sperspective.andP;  The ideal user interface for creating separations, Blackconjectured, would be an/off switch and two control knobs for adjustingcontrast and brightness, much like the user interface of a car radio.andP;  Underquestioning, Black admitted that such an interface would presume that theuser does not want precise control (and he himself likes the precision ofseveral advanced software products, like Nimbus-Q), but the idea still holds.andO;Editors and designers do not really want to become color experts when theytake on the responsibility of making their own separations.andP;  Since editorialphotos are not retouched, they want software that is smart enough to produceclean separations for them.andM;In the end, the consensus was that the technology is no longer holding usersback.andP;  With the corrections Adobe is making to Color PostScript, and softwarealready in the market or new products like PageMaker's Color Extension,customers can--and will--be making in-house color separations in the nearfuture.andP;  How quickly the new methods become common-place will depend on howquickly publishers can adapt their thinking to new tools.andP;  Today, there isstill a need for in-house technical staff before undertaking what Towery andMacWeek have done.andP;  But the overall return on the investment is becomingquite appealing.andM;Color ExhibitsandM;AgfaandM;Agfa compugraphic introduced the Agfa Color Scanner (ACS) 100, a flatbed, CCDcolor scanner that offers variable-resolution scanning from 300 dpi to 2,4000dpi.andP;  The product will be the input scanner for the Mosaic Color System andwill also be offered as a standalone unit to end users or OEM customers.andM;Developed by Agfa-Gevaert in Belgium, the ACS 100 records 10 bits of data perpixel per color to output true 24-bit RGB color.andP;  A 1:8 zoom lens, controlledby software, focuses the 3,648-element linear CCD array on the image areaspecified in the scanning software, with resolution varying accordingly.andO;Halogen spots are the light source.andM;The ACS 100 scans both line art and continuous-tone images on transparenciesand reflective originals.andP;  Transparencies may range in size from 35mm slidesto A4 (8&quot; X 11&quot;), with resolution varying from 2,400 dpi to 400 dpi,respectively.andP;  Reflective line art may be as large as an A3 (12&quot; X 16&quot; page),scanned at up to 2,400 dpi.andP;  Reflective images may range from 3&quot; wide (1,200dpi) to 12.3&quot; wide (300 dpi).andM;During the scan, the optical system is stationary, while the platen movesunderneath.andP;  A spinning filter wheel produces for every scan line asequential RGB illumination.andP;  In monochrome mode, the filter is keptstationary at the green position.andM;The rated speed of the scanner is 25 lines per second for color art and 77lines per second in monochrome mode.andP;  This translates into about one minutefor A3-sized reflective images at 300 dpi; 90 seconds for 35mm transparenciesat 2,400 dpi; and 5 minutes for 8&quot; X 8&quot; reflective line art at 1,200 dpi.andM;The scanner is driven through software that is developed by the systemintegrator.andP;  CG showed demonstration software running on a Sun workstation,although the exact software and configuration that will be offered withMosaic are still under development.andM;One of the nice features of the ACS 100 is the ability to gang images on theplaten to scan multiple images in a single pass.andP;  The images may be ofdifferent media.andP;  Previewing software enables the operator to crop each imageseparately and establish different settings for each, and then go back andscan in one pass all of the originals using the set-ups.andP;  The scanner alsofeatures removable copyplates, which allow for off-scanner set-up.andM;Internally, the unit uses a VME bus to transfer data to the port.andP;  There isno internal storage.andP;  Interfaces include a SCSI port and optional Ethernetinterface.andP;  An RS232-C port is standard for connection to a diagnosticterminal.andM;One controversial aspect of the device is its automatic calibration for graybalance.andP;  On conventional drum scanners, operators take their owndensitometer readings.andP;  The automatic calibration of the ACS, whilewell-suited to a new generation of color system operators who have neveroperated a drum scanner, does not allow the hands-on calibration to which traditional prepress operators are accustomed.andP;  CG did not have any printedsamples produced with the scanner at the show; we will have to waid until theunit is in the field to report on its quality and consistency of operation.andM;Priced under $50,000, the ACS 100 fits nicely in the gap between 300-dpidesktop scanners and the high-resolution scanners of Itek, Crosfield, Helland Dainippon Screen.andP;  Its flatbed design makes it a natural counterpart tothe Eikonix camera, which is usually priced slightly higher and is not wellsuited to small transparencies.andP;  The ACS 100 will be marketed worldwide byAgfa Compugraphic.andP;  Deliveries are scheduled to begin this June.andM;BestinfoandM;Bestinfo unveiled a color imaging module for its PC-based Wave4editorial/production system.andP;  Called ImageWright, the new module is ahardware/software combination for producing magazine-quality monochrome andcolor images that may be merged with text and line art and output asfull-color separations of pages on a PostScript imagesetter.andM;ImageWright.andP;  ImageWright was designed as an integral part of Wave4, andevidence of this integration is immediately apparent.andP;  The first step tocreating an image is creating a picture job ticket, which is much like thejob ticket used for stories and galleys in the text modules of Wave4.andP;  Theticket contains information about the image and its status as it movesthrough production.andM;The scanner is an Eikonix desktop slide scanner (1435) or Eikonix camera(1412), which scans transparencies, reflective art and 3D objects.andP;  Both arecontrolled through the ImageWright software.andP;  Scanning generates an 8-bit(Eikonix) color file tha may be as large as a 4,000 X 4,000-line image.andO;Tools for calibrating the scanner are available in ImageWright.andM;During the scanning process, ImageWright produces a low-resolution file forvideo display.andP;  There are tools for croping and scaling and globallycorrecting color by adjusting brightness and contrast.andP;  The individual colorcurves ar modified by adjusting points on a histogram.andP;  The system allows twoimages to be displayed at once, so you can view the original and thecorrected version side-by-side.andP;  Setups may be named and saved for later use.andM;Once an image is scanned, Bestinfo uses the TIPS software from TrueVision forlocal retouching.andP;  This includes a tool for drawing masks (point by point)and applying color correction within the mask.andP;  Truevision has its own toolsfor creating and coloring geometric shapes, and which are used for generatingvignettes.andP;  There are also tools within PageWright for handling vector art,and, in the future, Bestinfo plans to integrate vignettes with the pagecomposition software.andM;Color PageWright.andP;  The real benefit of ImageWright is that it is integratedwith a professional composition system.andP;  At this time, Bestinfo is the onlyvendor that can make that claim.andP;  In order to support color, Bestinfoannounced Color PageWright, an upgrade that is sold as part of the bundledsystem.andM;Color PageWright offers all of the PageWright tools with the followingenhancements:andM;* Importing contones as graphic objects: images may be scaled, moved,clipped, flipped, grouped or rotated directly on the page.andM;* Color palette: Bestinfo offers RGB and Pantone's color models for colorselection.andM;* Coloring graphic objects: vector art may be colored using either colorpalette.andP;  Chokes and spreads are supported (thank goodness someone understoodthese are necessary!), with precise controls over each.andP;  Spot colorseparations may be included with four-color pages (up to nine separations perpage).andM;* Traps: tints may be trapped within a text or graphic border with the samespread controls.andM;* Support for code-driven and interactive modes: in TableMaster, for example,you can color whole rows or columns interactively on the screen or throughembedded commands.andM;* Encapsulated PostScript: both monochrome and color Encapsulated PostScriptfiles may be imported, with a caveat--the color Encapsulated PostScript filessupported are those created by ImageWright; Bestinfo is still ironing out thedetails of importing color files from a Mac.andM;Proofing options include color PostScript printers, monochrome laser printersand the black-and-white Moniterm Viking screen.andM;A different approach to separations.andP;  Bestinfo talked about integrating colorinto Wave4 when it was introduced last June at Type-X, but at that time thecompany was unsure whether it would OEM the color separation software or doit itself.andP;  Over the summer, the company decided that to get the quality,control and speed it wanted, the best route was developing the softwarein-house.andP;  As a result, ImageWright's color separation software is unique atthis time.andM;Like other separation software that uses imagesetters, ImageWright produces aPostScript file.andP;  But unlike Pre-Press Technologies or CyberChrome,ImageWright has its own dot-generation techniques that produce the halftonebefore it is sent to the imagesetter.andM;Separations are created as a background task on a file server or PC set upfor background processing.andP;  The RGB data for color images are converted toCMYK through lookup tables that include the undercolor removal andgray-component replacement aspects of creating the black separation.andP;  Thesystem then screens the image using Bestinfo's software, which offerscontrols for the angles, mesh, ink density values, dot shape and contours.andO;Usually, the black separation of images is merged with the text as part ofthe output process.andP;  The process is fairly transparent to the user: if theimage is imported onto the page before separations, the image separations andmerging of black separations take place as part of the batch output process.andM;Bestinfo sees two primary advantages to creating the halftone for theimagesetter.andP;  First, because the image is being prescreened, the processingtime on the RIP is greatly reduced.andP;  Bestinfo estimates that its separationsare output four to five times faster on a Linotronic 300 with a RIP II thanwhen using separation software that relies on the RIP to do the screening.andM;The savings may actually be greater than that because it is possible toprescreen and separate multiple images ahead of time before the pages areready.andP;  (The prescreened images may be merged with the test file at outputwithout rescreening.)andP;  This time saving may be significant in the editorialenvironment that is Bestinfo's target market.andP;  News pages are typically helduntil the last possible minute, and bottlenecks at the imagesetter canquickly chew up hours of production time when users are outputting full pageswith halftones.andP;  Any reduction of those bottlenecks means a later pressdeadline, which is usually appreciated by editors trying to get the latestpossible news into an issue.andM;The second advantage Bestinfo claims is quality.andP;  This one is morecontroversial in light of the events at the Seminars (see Color Sessionnotes, above).andP;  When Bestinfo began developing its color software nine monthsago, the quality of Adobe's screening was suspect.andP;  It made sense for acomposition vendor to develop its own separation software if it could offersomething better.andP;  What Bestinfo has now appears better than what othervendors are currently getting through Adobe screening.andM;John Warnock announced at the Seminar that Adobe has corrected itsshortcomings in a forthcoming release, which should be available in the nextmonth or so.andP;  It will probably be another month or two after that until wehear from the field how well the new release works.andM;But the real issue is whether it is possible to do quality color screenswithout infringing on Hell's patents.andP;  The quality of ImageWright appearsacceptable at 133-line screens for most magazine editorial graphics.andP;  What wedon't know is whether or not Bestinfo is infringing on Hell's patents.andP;  JimBessen, Bestinfo's CEO, said he didn't think there was any infringement, butas yet the question is unresolved.andM;Bestinfo has at least one customer that is currently using ImageWright.andO;Robert Towery of The Towery Group in Kentucky talked at the Tuesday nightsession about his company's use of ImageWright in preparing its catalog.andO;With this software, Towery is now merging all of its catalog photos with thepages and creating the separations itself, bypassing the need for trade-shopseparations.andP;  The photos in Towery's catalog are small, but it has found thequality from ImageWright acceptable and is pleased with its new-found abilityto create the entire pages itself.andM;Several other Bestinfo customers are currently evaluating ImageWright.andM;The full Color PageWright and ImageWright combination is available now fromBestinfo or its dealers.andP;  The price is about $95,000, including scanner,80386 PC with both Viking and color monitors, and all necessary software.andM;DiademandM;Diadem introduced a new production-oriented color system, called the Carat500.andP;  The intent of the 500 is to provide all of the production functionalitywithout the retouching and real-time validation of changes that mark Diadem'shigh-end system.andP;  Although its price is in the league with the other prepresssystems (&quot;under $300,000&quot;), the Carat 500 may be an appealing package fornewspapers, news magazines, catalog printers or the production-minded tradeshop.andM;Carat 500.andP;  The Carat 500 is based on a MicroVax II.andP;  (The 560 has beenupgraded to a MicroVax III.andP;  Because both use the same processor andoperating system, the 500 may be upgraded to a 560.) Storage options areconsiderable, including a 2.2 GB WORM drive, two to sixteen 736-MBWinchesters, 8mm video cartridges that each hold 512 KB to 2 MB of images,and a 9-track 6250 BPI tape drive.andP;  Online interfaces to Crosfield, Hell andDS scanners have been added to the original support for the Itek scanners andrecorders.andM;Two 500 workstations may be connected to the same CPU, storage andperipherals.andP;  The 500 also may be connected to the 560.andM;The 500 offers streamlined tools for building the page.andP;  All of the geometry,flat tint and vignette capabilities that are part of the PC-based Carat 280are included.andP;  These tools are quite flexible for a color system, includingautomatic starbursts, coupon boxes and other special geometric forms, as wellas tools for building your own shapes and then rotating, grouping anddistorting them.andP;  Up to 256 simultaneous layers are supported.andP;  The fullcolor palette of the high-end system is included for filling objects.andM;Nonprinting grids and a snap-to-grid feature aid in placing objects andimages.andP;  Page files may be named and stored for later recall.andP;  The systemalso will accept page geometrics built on the Carat 280 system.andM;Once a page geometry is built, the user fills shapes with a color fill, ascanned image or line art or with a vignette.andP;   Benday tints are specified asCMYK values.andP;  Vignettes are also specified in CMYK and may be appliedhorizontally or vertically.andP;   (In the 560, vignettes may follow angles and beapplied within text.)andM;In image assembly, the 500 takes an approach that is akin to page building onthe other prepress systems.andP;  The 500 operator takes prescanned and correctedimages and places them on the page via a streamlined interface that is fastand effective, combining the dual image and page displays of the 560 into onehigh-res monitor.andP;  Scanned color images saved on the system are subsampledinto memory for the screen, so that they can be freely moved about the pagein real time.andP;  You can pan an image within a window (i.e., move it behind thewindow mask as a means of cropping), and you can activate fine detail mode,which zooms the image to allow for masking.andP;  (However, the automatic maskingfeatures of the 560 are not included at this time.)andM;The 500 enables you to take prescanned images and quickly build a page with aminimum of fuss, with most of the time-consuming processing done as a batchbackground process.andP;  Presently, all scaling and rotating are done at thescanner or on the 560.andP;  Once the page is built, all cropping of the high-resfiles is done as part of the batch process of preparing separations for thescanner or recorder.andM;PostScript interpreter.andP;  Diadem announced that it will offer a PostScriptinterpreter for converting black-and-white PostScrip files into Diadem'snative format at resolutions from 300 to 2,450 dpi.andP;  Diadem has licensed theinterpreter from an as-yet undisclosed source.andP;  Although this feature was notshown, Diadem says it is now operational at its demonstration facilities inthe U.S.andP;  and Europe.andP;  Reportedly, it converts PostScript output files frompage composition programs as well as line work from both PC and Mac drawingprograms like Adobe Illustrator or Aldus Freehand.andP;  Once imported to theDiadem system, line work can be colored within the system.andM;The PostScript RIP is a $75,000 option to the 500 or 560 systems.andP;  A set of35 fonts (those of the LaserWriter Plus) from either Bitstream orCompugraphic will be included.andP;  In the future, Diadem will be exploring theuse of Aldus's new Open Prepress Interface as another means of working withdesktop page composition programs.andM;Sales.andP;  Diadem reports that it has now shipped about 20 systems, five in theU.S., including three to customers in production.andP;  Here its products are soldby RZ Color Systems, its exclusive U.S.andP;  distributor.andP;  Diadem and RZ ColorSystems are accepting orders for the new Cara 500, which can be seen at theirdemonstration facilities.andM;Eastman KodakandM;Kodak had two booths in the exhibit, one showing networked, on-demandprinting on the 1392, the other showing application software.andP;  We have beencovering the 1392 since its introduction, most recently by discussing thePostScript interpreter that is now standard with the product (see Vol.andP;  18,No.andP;  3, p.44).andP;   At the Seminars, Kodak highlighted the use of the 1392 on anEthernet network, outputting a variety of jobs from different workstationsand software.andM;On the application side, Kodak unveiled the next generation of KEEPS,including a unique, application-independent user interface, and it showed aprototype of an officer color publishing system based on Sun hardware.andM;Network printing.andP;  When it was introduced, the 1392 was much like ahigh-speed Xerox printer in that it interfaced to few systems.andP;  Initially, itwas driven online by KEEPS and offline from IBM mainframes.andP;  Not long after,Kodak introduced an online interface for IBM mainframes.andP;  But with theintroduction of the PostScript interpreter the 1392 becomes much moreversatile in the general office market.andP;  With interfaces to Ethernet networksand direct input through parallel and serial ports, the 1392 is now able tohandle a variety of publishing, office and MIS printing needs at the sametime.andM;Kodak demonstrated the 1392 printing jobs from a PC, a Mac, and Digital andSun workstations, all running different application software.andP;  The PC and Macproducts produced PostScript files that were sent over the Ethernet networkto the interpreter, which converted the files to the 1392's native languagefor output at the printer's rated  speed: 92 pages a minute.andM;The first pages of a Ventura Publisher document, for example, still takeseveral minutes to compile and output, but once that first job is completed,the machine creates duplicates at more than double the speed of any otherPostScript printer on the market.andM;The native controller has IBM 1403, Diablo 630 ECS and Epson FX emulations,which are typical for office and MIS applications.andP;  It also supports imPressfor direct output from KEEPS.andP;  Kodak rightfully claims that it is the onlyvendor currently supporting such a wide variety of workstations andapplications from a single printer.andP;  Although it declines to say how manyunits are in the field, the company did say that sales of the product haverisen sharply since the introduction of the PostScript interpreter.andM;AP/PS 1.0  Kodak has been quietly developing its own answer to the userinterface quandary of Unix workstations.andP;  Shown last year as a developmentprototype, its application interface, called Advanced Printing/PublishingSoftware, or AP/PS (pronounced APPS), was formally unveiled at this year'sSeminar.andM;The AP/PS is designed to enable KEEPS users to run nonKodak applications ontheir Sun-based systems while still making use of Kodak's desktop userinterface.andP;  It is also Kodak's answer to the confusion over user interfacesin the Unix market.andP;  Rather than commit to one model, AP/PS supports four,albeit in Kodak's unique form, running with or without Sun windows.andM;As readers may recall, Kodak has developed a number of nice desktop modulesfor KEEPS.andP;  In the AP/PS, these have been broken out from KEEPS to operate asa true shell just above the operating system but below each application.andP;  Theuser interface of third-party applications is not affected by AP/PS, so youwill still have differences in these interfaces, but with AP/PS you have aunifying desktop interface that takes the place of Sun's own Open Look.andM;Even though the user interface tools have been broken away from KEEPS, Kodakis not selling the software as a standalone product.andP;  It does not intend tobe in the system software business.andP;  Rather, AP/PS provides the KEEPScustomer with additional desktop functionality without making a commitment toOpen Look or a competing interface.andM;There are seven modules to AP/PS 1.0:andM;* User interface management;andM;* System administration;andM;* Communications management;andM;* Printing management;andM;* Scanning; andandM;* Basic or advanced KEEPS composition.andM;Most of these are similar to what is currently offered with KEEPS 5.2.andP;  Onethat is brand new is the user interface management module.andP;  Kodak hascombined the desktop models of the Macintosh, Open Look, Microsoft Windowsand KEEPS into one desktop, which the user may customize.andP;  You decide whichmode of operation you prefer.andP;  To move a file from one folder to another, forexample, you may simply drag it, as on the Mac, or use the buttons of OpenLook, pull-down menus of Windows or pop-up menus of KEEPS.andP;  Talk about aproduct that tests the market!andP;  With AP/PS, Kodak wins the award for bestUnix fence-straddler, but the feedback it gets from its users should proveinvaluable for deciding which user interface users really prefer.andM;Some of the other new features are:andM;* File management--the desktop now encompases all directories on the net, notjust those that are part of KEEPS.andP;  File management tasks like moving andcopying files and folders, directories and display of file attributes (accessrights, path, size and date stamps) may be executed on any file to which theuser has access.andM;* Networked printing--the interface developed for driving the 1392 has beenexpanded to support additional printers.andP;  Different printers (Kodak's 1308,1320 and 1392 and any PostScript printers) may be supervised from one monitorusing Kodak's print manager.andP;  This facility should be quite useful forcentralized printing operations.andM;* Communications--like network printing, the communications module nowsupports monitoring of multiple concurrent processes running on differentplatforms within the network.andP;  All tasks are monitored on the Sun, butthrough Kodak's gateways, sessions may involve DEC and IBM mainframes, PCs,Macs and other Unix workstations.andP;  Protocols supported at this time includeLU6.2 (DISOSS) FTP (Ethernet), UUCP, DECnet, SNA and NFS.andP;  Tops is plannedfor the future.andP;  The AP/PS requires a Sun-3 or better with Sun's 4.0operating system and at least 4 MB of memory and 142 MB of disk storage.andO;Kodak will continue to offer KEEPS 5.2 without AP/PS to customers who want adedicated composition system.andM;Hedging bets.andP;  Despite its present ties to KEEPS, it is interesting to notethat the design of the AP/PS user interface enables it to run othercomposition engines.andP;  Kodak showed FrameMaker and its own Color Probe (seebelow) running under AP/PS.andP;  Kodak's agreement with Interleaf expires inMarch 1990, and so far no renewal has been made.andP;  It is clear that the designof AP/PS will enable Kodak to maintain consistency with its current softwareefforts, regardless of what composition engine it sells in the 1990s.andM;The AP/PS will be available in June.andP;  Pricing will depend on the hardware andsoftware configuration.andM;Color publishing &quot;probe.&quot;andP;  Kodak surprised many attendees by showing anengineering model of a Sun-based office color publishing system with outputon the ColorEdge color printer.andP;  Although it resembles the KEEPS system inmany respects, none of the composition capabilities of the probe areInterleaf's: the entire product was developed from the ground up by Kodak.andM;The product is still in the early stages of development, and Kodak plans toput only five or six into select accounts in the next few weeks as a probe ofthe market for such a product.andP;  No pricing or release dates were revealed,but, based on the demonstration, the product is still a year away fromdelivery--if Kodak decides to develop it commercially.andP;  Brad Krutchen, themarketing planner for the product, conjectured that color publishing will notbecome widespread until color printers, color composition software, and colorstandards for page description languages and monitors are available.andM;Kodak is testing several things with the probe.andP;  First, the company isinterested in determining what color models will be appropriate in thegeneral office and publishing environments.andP;   It currently offers four: RGB,hue/saturation/value, hue/saturation/lightness and a tri-simulus color methodcalled XYZ.andP;  The first three provide the most specificity, which is usefulfor precise matching of color.andP;  But the latter, although not in widespreaduse, looked the most appealing for office publishing applications.andM;Rather than picking colors from a wheel or by number, the user simply looksat a color spectrum (a horizontal rainbow), and picks the approximate color,which brings up a more detailed spectrum in the range chosen (a horizontalband of greens, for instance).andP;  The user selects the desired color from thisband, without having to know anything about numerical values.andP;  Thecomposition software supports 256 colors within a single document, chosenfrom a palette of 64,000 colors, of which 32,000 may be output on theColorEdge printer in solid fills.andP;  Text and line color output is limited to124 colors.andM;In page composition functionality, the color system was positioned betweenKEEPS basic composition (Interleaf TPS 3.0) and KEEPS advanced composition(Interleaf TPS 4.0), although too many of the features were not implementedto really get a feel for the accuracy of this claim.andM;The user interface offers both pull-down and Interleaf-style pop-up menusfrom a color desktop that uses Kodak's own icons.andP;  Icons change state to showaction--the file cabinet's drawers actually open when you open a drawer, forinstance.andM;Both structured and unstructured documents are supported.andP;  Both makeup styleshave property sheets, much like KEEPS, but without the component bar that isInterleaf's hallmark.andP;  The software has its own set of attributes in theproperty sheets, including set size, a nice addition to what KEEPS provides.andO;The font menu was limited to Courier, Helvetica, Times and Symbol, alimitation we would hope to see raised in any commercial release of theproduct.andM;The hyphenation routine is still in rough form.andP;  Currently it uses the TEXalgorithm, with a small exception dictionary.andP;  The frequency of hyphenationis set on a sliding scale the same as in KEEPS.andM;Most of the paging parameters were not implemented, but the options forplacing illustrations looked to be on a par with Interleaf.andP;  With any systemdesigned for long documents, pagination is a key issue; we expect that thisis one area that may take Kodak some time to perfect.andM;In graphics, the software has its own set of vector drawing tools that areextensive, but still shy of TPS 4.0 with one exception--color.andP;  Like everyother component, graphic objects may be colored, not for separations, but foroutput on the color printer.andM;The software also imports Encapsulated PostScript files and renders them onthe screen for modifications, including coloring.andP;  Kodak demonstrated how anAdobe Illustrator file, for example, could be imported, colored and output onthe ColorEdge.andM;Filters for Interleaf line art and KEEPS graphics are under development.andM;In raster images, the software is working with Sun's raster file format.andM;ColorEdge printer.andP;  One of the key points of the probe is to test the KodakColorEdge printer, a 17.5-ppm four-color printer that combines the ColorEdgecolor copier engine with the 1392's controller, including the PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  To our knowledge, the ColorEdge will be the first color printerto offer PostScript compatibility without an Adobe RIP.andP;  (Kodak's PostScriptinterpreter is licensed from Imagen using Linotype fonts.)andM;The ColorEdge is a 300-dpi electrophotographic printer for high-volumeapplications.andP;  The recommended duty cycle is 5,000 to 30,000 pages a month.andO;It accepts 20-28 bond paper and transparencies up to 8-1/2 X 11&quot; in size,with a maximum imaging area of 7-1/2&quot; X 11&quot;.andP;  It uses four toners--cyan,yellow, magenta and black--which means that it prints solid blacks muchbetter than a three-toner electrophotographic copier.andM;Kodak has announced that the ColorEdge will be made available on a limitedbasis in the first half of 1989 within major metropolitan cities in the U.S.andO;only.andP;  It will be targeted at two configurations: mainframe graphics andcolor publishing.andP;  The price is $125,000.andM;For mainframe graphics (including DEC minicomputers), the printer will comeequipped with an IBM channel attachment, IBM 3170/3270 series controller,Centronics interface, support for SAS Institute and Computer Associatessoftware and HPGL and Kodak's own graphics language.andP;  An offset stacker willbe an optional accessory.andM;The color publishing configuration, to be offered with the color compositionsoftware, will offer Ethernet (TCP/IP) and parallel interfaces, support forSun Microsystems workstations, and imPress and PostScript interpreters.andP;  Aninline stapler will be an optional accessory.andM;Output from the ColorEdge is impressively fast and clean, offering a dramaticimprovement over plotters, which are most often used for mainframe graphics.andO;The success of the color publishing configuration may depend on how well thecolor publishing probe proceeds, unless Kodak decides to offer the ColorEdgeas a general printer (without the composition software) for use with softwarewith imPress or PostScript drivers.andM;Networked Picture SystemsandM;NPS unveiled several enhancements to its Page Express color prepress system,with the ability to import and convert PostScript files and a user-definabletrapping facility being chief among them.andP;  The new features were to beincluded in Page Express release 2, which will be shipped in late April.andM;At that time, NPS will stop offering components of its color system asseparate software packages.andP;  Last fall it began selling RGB Master, a globalcolor correction package, and CT Write, which wrote files to Scitex format,through VARs.andP;  That approach was largely unsuccessful, and NPS has decidedthat a small company such as itself is better off concentrating on sellingturnkey systems via a direct sales force.andM;Release 2 of Page Express will contain a new local color correction featureknown as Range Master, which will complement RGB Master's capabilities.andP;  Thefull Page Express Design/Layout Station, which will sell for $52,000, willconsist of a 20-MHz 386 AT with 4 MB of memory, a 300-MB SCSI drive, a 60-MBstreaming tape drive, a 5-1/4&quot; floppy drive and a 3-1/2&quot; IBM/Mac-compatibledisk drive, a 32-bit color frame buffer (Targa board), a 19&quot; color monitor, a12&quot; digitizer tablet, and the following software: Image Express, PageExpress, Image Master, hi-res masking, RGB Master, Range Master, software forsimulating Pantone's colors on the display, and 27 Bit-stream fonts.andM;Imported via disk, PostScript files are converted to raster images atuser-definable resolutions ranging from 300 dpi to 2,540 dpi.andP;  Once it hasbeen converted to an overlay or a  background, the PostScript image can bemanipulated with the Page Express tools: positioned, cropped, divided,colored, etc.andM;Because Page Express can output files to a Crosfield, Hell or Scitex system,it can now serve as a way station on the road from low-end to high-end color.andO;Such signs as Visionary (connecting Quark to Scitex systems), Desklink RSG(connecting Letraset's ReadySetGo to Crosfield systems) and Aldus'sannouncement at the Seminars of the Open Prepress Interface (see page 8) showa great push toward low-end-to-high-end connectivity.andM;At an event where the question of &quot;good enough&quot; color was fiercely debated,NPS extended its reach along the quality continuum.andP;  Desktop compositionalone not good enough?andP;  Bring PostScript files from PageMaker, VenturaPublisher, Quark Xpress, etc.andP;  into Page Express.andP;  Looking for as much colorfunctionality as possible without a six-figure price tag?andP;  Try a turnkey NPSsystem.andP;  Need the power of Crosfield, Hell or Scitex?andP;  Design in PageExpress, then bring those files into a top-of-the-line system.andM;We will be interested to see how the PostScript import capabilities expandNPS's markets.andM;ScitexandM;Scitex announced an important enhancement to its Visionary product.andO;Visionary is a customized version of Quark Xpress, running on a Macintosh,that allows the customers of Scitex sites to do their own page makeup,including placement and composition of text; placement of tints, borders, andrules; and placement of low-resolution color images.andP;  The resulting file canbe fed into a Scitex system, where the low-resolution images can be replacedwith high-resolution scans.andM;A significant limitation of Visionary has been its method of dealing withEncapsulated PostScript (EPS) images.andP;  EPS images are generated byillustration packages, like Aldus Freehand and Adobe Illustrator, and bynon-Quark DTP packages.andP;  Although it has always been possible to bring EPSimages into Quark Xpress, the Visionary software package has not had theability to get them out into a Scitex system.andP;  That has resulted in arestriction on graphics in Visionary: line art has, for the most part, beenrestricted to art created with Quark's own set of graphics tools.andP;  EPS lineart had to be typeset, then scanned at high resolution to get it into theScitex system.andM;At the Seminars, Scitex and Adobe jointly announced the Visionary Interpreterfor PostScript (VIP).andP;  This facility lets a Macintosh at the Scitex siteconvert EPS images into Scitex line-art format.andP;  It is an Adobe interpreter(a software RIP) that runs in the Macintosh.andP;  That means Illustrator orFreehand output files can now be handled electronically via Visionary.andP;  (EPSpages composed by non-Quark DTP packages could also be input via thissoftware, at least in principle.)andM;V.I.P.andP;  provides a one-directional link: it will not be possible to get EPSdata back out of the Scitex system.andP;  V.I.P.andP;  handles the full range ofPostScript functions, including halftoning.andP;  No performance estimates wereavailable.andM;It is our understanding that Visionary sites using a thermal printer for pageproofs will not be able to proof EPS images on that device.andM;V.I.P.andP;  will be sold as an $8,000 option to the Visionary Gateway software,which runs at Scitex host sites.andP;  Visionary end users will not changesoftware.andP;  Beta testing is just getting started, and the final version isexpected to be released in June.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
