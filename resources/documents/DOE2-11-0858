The message,devoid of any meaningful physical embodiment, is presented for authenticationby a means that the they call the authentication channel. This channelis by definition insecure, i.e., all communications that pass throughit are public and may even be intercepted and replaced or altered beforebeing relayed on to the intended receiver. In the simplest possible authenticationscheme the party receiving the message (the receiver) is also the onewishing to verify its authenticity; although, there are circumstancesin which this is not the case. Authentication, however, is much broaderthan this communications based terminology would suggest. The informationto be authenticated may indeed be a message in a communications channel,but it can equally well be data in a computer file or resident softwarein a computer; it can be quite literally a fingerprint in the applicationof the authentication channel to the verification of the identity ofan individual or figuratively a &quot;fingerprint&quot; in the verification ofthe identity of a physical object such as a document or a tamper sensingcontainer. In the broadest sense, authentication is concerned with establishingthe integrity of information purely on the basis of the internal structureof the information itself, irrespective of the source of that information.</TEXT></DOC>
