Sooner or later it gets you.&quot;;   That isthe consensus of players -- artificial turf causes injuries. But the NFL hasoffered scientific studies that show little or no correlation between surfaceand injury.;   Dr. John Powell of the University of Iowa compiles data for theNFL and has found that the difference in knee injuries per 20 games onartificial surface and 20 games on natural grass is one injury: four on turfas opposed to three on grass. And, Powell said, that one injury could be theresult of any number of independent factors.;   Other research concurs; Thatresearch confirms the results of another NFL-sponsored study done by theStanford Research Institute in the early 1970s. It also concurs with anindependent study done by the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine andAthletic Trauma in New York.;   &quot;To say that artificial turf is a terriblething has no bearing in actual reality,&quot; Powell said.;   Tell that to 49erscornerback Darryl Pollard, who felt his left foot stick in the carpet at theSeattle Kingdome in the final exhibition game.;   &quot;It felt like it was stuckin Super Glue,&quot; Pollard said. &quot;I tried to twist out of it, and that's when thebone snapped.&quot;;   Pollard is out for the season.;   NFLPA data is incomplete;The NFL Players Association has found a 20 percent higher rate of injury forevery game on artificial surface. But Michael Duberstein, the NFLPA directorof research, concedes his research is far from complete. Denied access to NFLinjury data, the NFLPA studies are based on injury reports that the leaguereleases every week during the season. Though they found a higher proportionof players listed as out or doubtful after games on artificial surface,Duberstein said actual severity of injury was hard to accurately measure.;  Severe injuries such as those suffered by Pollard, Allen and former Seattlerunning back Curt Warner, who blew out his knee at the Kingdome, obviouslyalso occur on grass.;   Over time, turf takes toll; But artificial turf isalso despised by players for what it does over the long haul, for the constantpounding on the joints.;   &quot;There's no question that you can feel it moreafter a game,&quot; said 49ers running back Spencer Tillman, who played in theAstrodome for two seasons.;   &quot;It's taken a toll on my body and my knees,&quot;said O.J. Simpson, who ran on turf in Buffalo. &quot;My knee problems areattributable to the wear and tear of running on AstroTurf.&quot;;   The severe,season-ending injuries occur when a player's foot gets stuck on the turf,which doesn't give like natural surface.;   &quot;You stop suddenly and all yourweight is going forward,&quot; Tillman said. &quot;A little twist is all it takes.&quot;;  Already decimated by injuries, the 49ers will be keeping their fingers crossedtoday, when they play at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, the second of fiveregular-season games scheduled on artificial surface.;   &quot;I don't like playingon it,&quot; Coach George Seifert said. &quot; . . . If I were in control, I wouldeliminate artificial surface.&quot;;   But Seifert isn't in control. The playersaren't in control. And the body that could be in control -- the NFL -- says itcan't outlaw artificial surface.;   &quot;It's a club policy,&quot; said NFL spokesmanGreg Aiello. &quot;The NFL has not taken a position on it.&quot;;   Indeed, duringCommissioner Paul Tagliabue's state-of-the-NFL teleconference in August, thesubject of artificial turf did not come up. Last year, Tagliabue recited thecompany line about limited control when asked about turf.;   &quot;The leaguedoesn't give a damn about us,&quot; Allen told reporters after his injury. &quot;Itwants to worry about all that other insignificant stuff like uniformviolations and celebrations.&quot;;   The owner of the 49ers, Eddie DeBartolo Jr.,said he thinks the issue may be raised at future NFL owners' meetings.;   &quot;Idon't think there's any way on God's green Earth athletes should be playing onit,&quot; he said.;   In 1979, two years after DeBartolo bought the team,Candlestick Park switched back to natural grass. The balance -- now 14 teamson turf and 14 on grass -- will be tipped next season when Atlanta moves intothe Georgia Dome.;   Hope still exists. Studies conducted last summer onbehalf of soccer's World Cup -- which won't allow games to be played onartificial surface -- found that grass could be grown in domed stadiums.;  &quot;We can put people on the moon, you should be able to grow grass indoors,&quot;Simpson said. &quot;I don't think anyone can make the argument that it doesn'tshorten careers.&quot;;   But the players better come up with some statistical datafast. Sore knees and snapped bones aren't enough.; GOING NATURAL; Teams whohave switched from artificial turf back to grass:; (box) 49ers: CandlestickPark had artificial turf from 1970 to 1979 and replaced it with naturalgrass.;   (box) Chicago Bears: Soldier Field had artificial turf from 1970 to1988, when natural grass was planted.;   (box) Miami Dolphins: The Orange Bowlhad an artificial surface from 1970 to 1975.; TURNING TO TURF; (box) AtlantaFalcons: Following in the tradition of teams such as Minneapolis, Detroit andIndianapolis, the Falcons will move from grass to artificial surface when theymove into the Georgia Dome next season.; -- Ann Killion  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910915  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  984  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 15, 199100259212,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
