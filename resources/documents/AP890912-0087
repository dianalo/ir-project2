ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists today protested thelaunch next month of a nuclear-powered space probe, butadministration officials say President Bush will not block theflight.   The president is expected by next week to authorize the use of a48-pound nuclear generator to provide electrical power for theGalileo spacecraft, scheduled for launch to Jupiter from the shuttleAtlantis on Oct. 12.   The nuclear powerplant is similar to the one the Voyager 2spacecraft used so successfully on its 12-year journey to Neptuneand beyond, and on 21 other space devices. But protesters worryabout a release of radioactivity should the Atlantis have anaccident similar to the one that destroyed Challenger.   A recent safety analysis by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration concluded, ``the probability of an accident resultingin a release of plutonium ranges from 1-in-2,500 to 1-in-2 millionand any release from these low probability events would be verysmall.''   About a half dozen sign-carrying protesters stood outside NASA'snational headquarters today, passing out a flyer that said, ``KeepProject Galileo's plutonium on the ground.''   One sign said, ``If Galileo explodes, kiss Florida goodbye,'' andanother said, ``One pound of plutonium could kill every person onEarth.'' The demonstrators represented the Maryland Safe EnergyCoalition, which is headquartered in Columbia, Md.   This weekend, a group called the Florida Coalition for Peace andJustice, says it will begin a 200-mile ``peace walk'' from CapeCanaveral to Kings Bay, Ga., to protest both the Galileo probe andthe Trident missile program.   A spokesman said the walk will be completed Oct. 8 and theprotesters will return in time for the Atlantis launch.   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on thelaunch pad'' to halt the October launch, said Bruce Gagnon ofOrlando, leader of the Florida group which has staged pastdemonstrations against Trident launches.   King's Bay is where the Trident is flight tested.   A lawyer for the Christic Institute, Larry Sinkin, said the groupwill file suit in federal court later this month to stop theAtlantis launch, citing among its reasons ``the very poor recordNASA has of estimating risks'' and ``the reliability of the shuttleitself.''   The president's science advisers are studying risk assessments ofthe launch and a separate safety evaluation, Thomas P. Rona, deputydirector of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy,said Monday.   An administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity,asked if the Galileo launch will be approved, replied ``certainly.''   Rona declined to say what the recommendation to Bush will be butsaid ``every possible design precaution has been taken. ... Mypersonal opinion is that the shuttle is far more reliable now thanbefore.''   Elizabeth Prestridge, spokeswoman for the National Space Councilwhich is chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, said the staffconsiders the Galileo probe safe. And a congressional source saidthere is no doubt the president will allow the launch.   The review process, which makes White House approval mandatorybefore nuclear isotopes can be launched into space, has been ineffect since 1977.   The nuclear devices are called RTGs, for radioisotopethermoelectric generators. They have never caused a spacecraftfailure, although three of the 22 have been involved in spacemission accidents with no release of plutonium.   Galileo will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and it willinsert a probe into the atmosphere to investigate thick cloud layerscovering the huge planet. The trip is a complicated one in which thespacecraft will twice return near Earth for gravity boosts to gainnecessary velocity to reach Jupiter in 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
