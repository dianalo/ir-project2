A British Caledonian spokesman said that the talks were &quot;progressing&quot; and that a statement might be made today. He declined to say if SAS had made an offer.    British Caledonian has yet to respond to a takeover offer made by British Airways PLC last Friday. The bid values the airline at #153 million ($271.8 million) based on yesterday's closing price of British Airways shares.    SAS has been considering making a partial bid for British Caledonian but is believed to be waiting until it can ascertain the British government's reaction. An earlier #237 million offer for British Caledonian from British Airways lapsed when it was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Reportedly, SAS is talking about buying 40% to 50% of British Caledonian with other U.K. investors if British Airways' revised offer is rejected by British Caledonian.    Lord Young, U.K. secretary of state for trade and industry, who decides whether to refer mergers to the commission, said in an interview in the Independent newspaper that &quot;I can't see that there would be any great competition changes (arising from a partial SAS offer) . . .&quot;    A British Airways spokesman declined to comment on SAS. </TEXT></DOC>
