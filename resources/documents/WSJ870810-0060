While the SEC had taken the position that a definition isn't necessary, Commissioner Charles Cox conceded that the proposed definition in a bill sponsored by Sens. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) would clarify insider-trading law without restricting the range of enforcement cases the agency can bring.    Under close questioning at a Senate hearing Friday, Mr. Cox and Gary Lynch, the agency's enforcement chief, conceded that the bipartisan proposal would be preferable to relying on so-called case law that has evolved from a series of court decisions.    But there still are differences between SEC officials and lawmakers on how best to codify the case law.    The hearing was called by Mr. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's securities panel, to discuss an alternative insider-trading definition submitted by the SEC staff, as well as a version proposed by the New York Stock Exchange's legal advisory committee. He and other lawmakers were clearly heartened by the willingness of SEC officials to embrace a statutory definition.    But Mr. Lynch told them that he preferred the SEC's proposal to the Riegle-D'Amato bill, which was drafted by a group of prominent Washington securities lawyers led by Harvey Pitt, one of the attorneys for the convicted insider trader Ivan Boesky. At the same time, Mr. Pitt and others faulted parts of the SEC's definition.    That definition would forbid trading &quot;while in possession of material nonpublic information&quot; that has been wrongfully obtained by theft, bribery, misrepresentation or espionage, or obtained or used in breach of a duty to keep the information confidential.    The SEC also would prohibit passing such information to others when the tipster knows it is inside information and &quot;foresees&quot; that those who receive it will engage in trading. The tipster, moreover, would be liable if someone who receives a tip then tipped others who foreseeably would trade.    At the hearing, the SEC officials said they preferred that language over the Riegle-D'Amato bill, which would outlaw trading on the basis of inside information. Under the SEC's version, the burden of proof would be lighter for prosecutors. Currently, defendants often claim they traded on the basis of a research report or newspaper article they read recently.    It is likely the lawmakers will heed the SEC on this point.    Surprisingly, the SEC's definition doesn't mention the &quot;misappropriation&quot; of inside information. Mr. Pitt and other lawyers called the omission &quot;unfortunate&quot; because the SEC's so-called misappropriation theory has been the legal basis of its insider-trading enforcement program in recent years, and its omission could preclude the SEC from bringing certain cases.    But in his testimony, Commissioner Cox said the agency's definition &quot;builds on the breach-of-duty and misappropriation principles embodied in existing law.&quot;    One reason lawmakers are seeking a statutory definition is the potential fallout from the government's insider-trading case against former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments this fall on the convictions of Mr. Winans and two others on charges that they conspired to profit from advance knowledge of Journal articles. Some lawyers believe the court will reject the misappropriation theory.    Daniel Goelzer, the SEC's general counsel, said Friday he doesn't believe such a ruling is likely, but he conceded it would create a &quot;desperate need for legislation.&quot;    The SEC's definition, among other things, would:    --Require securities firms to have &quot;reasonable procedures&quot; against insider trading if they are to avoid liability for such trading by employees.    --Provide a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for securities analysts, newsletter publishers and others to disseminate marketplace information.    --Give investors injured by insider trading the right to recover their losses from insider traders or tipsters.    But Richard Phillips, a Washington attorney and spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, criticized the SEC's definition as extraordinarily complex, creating loopholes for the dishonest and causing problems for &quot;honest market participants.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Phillips spoke well of the Riegle-D'Amato bill, which is similar in many respects to the Big Board proposal. And he said he believes they can be reconciled. </TEXT></DOC>
