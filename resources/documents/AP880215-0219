But how many candidates or other movers and shakerswrite their own speeches and quip their own quips? Their eloquenceis manufactured by self-effacing, anonymous ghosts, who workovertime in an election year.</TEXT><BYLINE>By SAUL PETT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``No one,'' Walter Lippman said, ``can writean authentic speech for another man. It is as impossible as writinghis love letters for him or saying his prayers for him.   ``When he speaks to the people, he and not someone else mustspeak. For it is much more important that he is genuine...than thathe be bright, clever, ingenious, entertaining, eloquent or evengrammatical.''   No specialized talent is required, Lippman said. ``Anyone whoknows what he is doing can say what he is doing, and anyone whoknows what he thinks can say what he thinks.''   Lippman was an important columnist whose judgments were closelyattended by presidents, tycoons and other pillars of power. But onthe matter of speech writing, no oracle was ever more widelyignored, then or now.   Especially now, an election year, when the full monsoon is uponus. Never were more people cleaving the air with more speecheswritten by other people.   In the stupefying war of words, 12 of the 13 original candidatesfor president used at least one mercenary each, as do mostsenators, representatives, governors, mayors, bank presidents,tycoons and assistant tycoons. Humble Gary Hart has no speechwriter.   The Super Bowl, of course, is the White House, where PresidentReagan has five full-time writers, four researchers and assortedfree-lance specialists to help him with a portentous speech on thecrisis in Iran or Wall Street, with a one-liner for reporters, atidbit for a tete-a-tete with visting royalty in the Rose Garden,an inspiring sermon on the State of the Union, taped birthdaygreetings for Jimmy Stewart, a proclamation summoning the attentionof his countrymen to Dairy Goat Awareness Week.   For three days of summitry with Mikhail Gorbachev, the boys inthe back room provided the Great Communicator with warm words ofwelcome and farewell, one treaty signing statement, one eveningbroadcast, two dinner toasts and nine Russian proverbs for targetsof opportunity. (He used seven.)   Cooling or thawing, the Cold War is fought with the menace ofvast armadas of planes, aircraft carriers, submarines, guidedmissiles, nuclear bombs and speech writers.   Ted Sorensen wrote for John Kennedy. Fyodor Burlatsky wrote forNikita Khrushchev. They met for the first time in New York twoyears ago.   ``In effect, we have met before,'' said Burlatsky. ``We havecorresponded.''   ``Really?''   ``You helped write President Kennedy's messages during themissile crisis. I helped write Chairman Khrushchev's answers.''   Eyeball to eyeball, typewriter to typewriter, the twain met.   William Safire wrote for Richard Nixon. Georgy Kornienko wrotefor Leonid Brezhnev. In 1972, in the Great Hall of the Kremlin,after the signing of the first treaty limiting strategic weapons,the writers sat side by side basking in the warm glow of the toaststhey had written for the two world leaders.   Kornienko, particularly, basked during Brezhnev's delivery ofhis toast.   ``Can you not hear the steps of history going by us?'' hewhispered to Safire, ghost to ghost.   The example may be Russian rococo but it is history, they say,that lures perspiring writers to aspiring presidents. The chancethat one day their words may soar out of the Oval Office or a jointsession of Congress is the fuel propelling most of thepractitioners now pounding typewriters in planes, trains, buses,cars, motel rooms, bathrooms and the dank wings of theaters. Thehope of marble sustains them in their frantic anonymity.   Ever after their words become history, a curious honor codeprevails among presidential speech writers. Even at this late date,neither Clark Clifford nor Ted Sorensen will tell you which goldenphrases he crafted for Harry Truman or John Kennedy. It was yearsbefore we learned that honest George Washington got help on hisfarewell address from three ghosts named Madison, Jefferson andHamilton.   Safire and Pat Buchanan reveal nothing about the language theysupplied Nixon or Reagan, but on a vice presidential level theyhave confessed their connection with the ``pusillanimouspussyfooters'' and ``nattering nabobs of negativism'' immortalizedby Spiro Agnew.   Among Jimmy Carter's writers, the vow of silence wasparticularly easy to observe after his speech before adistinguished audience in Mexico City. None was tempted to rushforward to claim authorship of his jocular remarks about jogging inMexico because of ``Montezuma's revenge.''   Besides his humor, Carter's writers worried about twists of histongue. To their horror, in a major speech, they heard him identifya huge block of voters as ``eyetalians'' and one of the party'ssaints as ``Hubert Horatio Hornblower'' (nee Humphrey). GeraldFord's writers tried to keep him away from ``judgment,'' which heinsisted on making ``judg-a-ment.''   Reagan's writers luxuriate in his masterful delivery of theirlines but their ulcers stir when he strays from the text. At suchtimes, he has been known to come up with a statistic or itemunchecked by White House researchers which later requirescorrection. This president literally saves his own supply of speechgoodies in a shoe box.   Sen. Robert Dole's staff worries most about his wit, which seemsclearly the best among the candidates _ but unreined lunges for thejugular. George Bush's two writers tense up when he ad-libssomething folksy. Trying to explain why he did poorly in an Iowastraw poll, the vice president said his supporters were probablybusy that day with other things, like a daughter's coming outparty. This in a state gloomy with farm foreclosures.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
