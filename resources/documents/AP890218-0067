The U.S. Department of Energy said that 88,000 more pounds ofuranium and 16,100 more pounds of thorium, an uranium substitute,had been released than previously estimated since the 1951 openingof the Feed Materials Production Center in nearby Fernald.   A firm estimate of emissions from the plant is needed from itsowner, the Energy Department, before the start of a health study bythe U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The government now estimates297,000 pounds of uranium and 17,590 pounds of thorium were released.   The Fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny byCongress and the press because of contamination problems andallegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may haveharmed people who live and work nearby. The plant processes uraniumfor the U.S. nuclear weapons program.   Environmentalists said they doubt the department ever will knowhow much pollution escaped from Fernald, 18 miles northeast ofCincinnati.   ``This makes 175 metric tons, but that's just one more step alonga long, long road,'' said Arjun Makhijani, an environmentalconsultant for Fernald-area residents in a lawsuit against the plant.   The Energy Department quietly made the new estimates public in anews release last week, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Saturday. Apreliminary plant emission estimate was presented in a congressionalhearing last October.   ``It raises a real concern,'' said Len Weiss, staff director ofthe U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is led byU.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. ``Every time they look at things, thenumbers go up again.''   Steven Wyatt of the Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., office,called the new data a significant increase. ``I can only say thatwe're doing our best to fine tune this data,'' he said. ``We stilldon't have final numbers.''   Robert Walker, spokesman for Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio,which operates the Fernald plant for the department, acknowledgedthe significance of the revised estimate.   ``There's no question it's a chunk,'' Walker said. ``But, `Oh, myGod,' isn't an appropriate reaction from our point of view. We'retrying to uncover every possible emission from this plant over the37 years it's been here, and this is one more that's been trackeddown.''   In a related Fernald development, a workers compensation findingthat blamed work-related radiation for the fatal liver cancer of anengineer at the plant has been appealed by Westinghouse.   Westinghouse, which took over the management of the plant fromNLO Inc. in 1986, asked Hamilton County Common Pleas Court last weekto overturn the state agency's decision. The ruling is the only oneto officially link a death with radioactive contamination at theplant.</TEXT></DOC>
