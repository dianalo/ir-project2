(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>This is the third of five reports on networking, part of DATAMATION's ongoingSystems andamp; Strategies for the  '90s program.andP;  The remaining parts will coverdistributed databases and an interview with an expert.andM;Network specialists say that the variety of transmission media available hasenabled users, whatever their needs, to choose the best option for each jobwith a minimum of trade-offs.andM;As networks continue to link more offices nationally and internationally,much like a giant road system, the criteria for choosing the right highwayfor data transport are becoming at once more flexible and more crucial.andO;Ethernet and Token Ring cabling systems, formerly routes exclusive of eachother, can now be combined as alternate choices for average and heavy datatraffic, respectively.andP;  Meanwhile, bridges, routers and other network mediaproducts are helping users avoid network dead ends.andM;The current options for local area network (LAN) transmission media allowusers to choose the cable highway best suited to their needs without cuttingthemselves off from other networks, say network managers and analysts.andO;However, increasing traffic and larger networks are making the right choicemore important for specific applications to avoid traffic jams that couldbring data to a halt throughout a company.andM;The right cabling in the right configuration is crucial, say networkingspecialists like David jackson, director of technical services at Micro OneInc., a Dallasbased systems integration firm specializing in networkinstallations.andP;  &quot;You can easily put 40 to 200 Pcs on an Ethernet network,&quot;says jackson.andP;  &quot;But two Sun engineering workstations can saturate an Ethernetbus.andM;&quot;The great thing about networking today, though, is that you don't have tochoose 'either/or.' You can use Ethernet, Token Ring, ARCnet or an FDDIbackbone in combination [with these other networks] to accommodate whateverthe customer's needs are,&quot; says Jackson.andM;Who Cares About Cost?andM;Cost, while still a factor, is often less important than continuousavailability and, in some cases, speed.andP;  Ethernet is supported by over I 00vendors and holds over half the market, according to market research firmDataquest Inc. in San jose.andP;  Ethernet became even more popular in recentyears by adopting the use of unshielded twisted pair wiring, which is cheaperto install than the original broadband coaxial cable.andM;Developed by Digital Equipment Corp., Intel Corp. and Xerox Corp. in 1980,Ethernet is still seen as the best choice for general office applications.andO;Its 10 megabits-per-second transmission speed and linear bus topology-inwhich workstation nodes are arranged along the length of a line of cable,extendable at one end-work best under light, intermittent traffic conditions.andO;Performance decreases underheavy, steady traffic.andM;But the future trend toward database-intensive network applications on moreheavily traveled networks is already producing a growth spurt for the TokenRing market.andP;  Developed by IBM, released in 1985 and previously only offeredat 4Mbps, the recently available 16Mbps ring-shaped networks handle heavierloads faster than Ethernet.andM;Two years ago, only two vendors were manufacturing Token Ring-IBM andProteon.andP;  Now there are over 30, and prices have come down,&quot; says Micro One'sjackson.andP;  &quot;There has also been increasing acceptance as other vendors havemoved in.andP;  When the network interface cards were only available from IBM,there were a lot of restrictions on the type of cabling media.andP;  But now,people are making Token Ring equipment that imposes little penalty in termsof the number of nodes, wire closets and extra hardware you need.&quot;andM;In fact, the 4Mbps Token Ring network supports twisted pair wiring, as doesProteon Inc.'s version of the 16Mbps Token Ring network.andP;  IBM will supporttwisted pair wiring at 16Mbps within one year, according to David Perro, anindustry analyst at Dataquest.andP;  Baseband coaxial or fiber-optic cable canalso be used.andM;Meanwhile, Datapoint Corp.'s ARcnet, the grandfather of cabling systems,which has been available since 1978, may gain new market life when a 20Mbpsversion becomes available this year.andM;&quot;We don't see ARCnet as a big player because it is competing against two IEEEstandards,&quot; says Perro, referring to the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers Inc.'s 802.3 standard, to which Ethernet complies, andthe 802.5 standard, to which Token Ring is compliant.andP;  &quot;And IBM and DECbetween them dominate almost the entire market.&quot;andM;Still, the current 2.5Mbps ARCnet, which uses the star-shaped topology, canbe the best choice for smaller networks and tight budgets, says Jackson.andP;  Thenew 20Mbps version is bound to attract some users because it will be fasterthan either Token Ring or Ethernet, he adds.andM;Nobody Does it BetterandM;&quot;A random environment with a lot of different things going on is still servedbest by Ethernet,&quot; says jackson.andP;  &quot;But people doing heavy on-line databasesearches or on-line order entry-if their primary application is a databaseand the load on the network is steady-are better off with Token Ring.andP;  Theresponse will be steadier.andP;  And, of course, a Big Blue shop will always bebetter with Token Ring, because nobody supports it better than IBM.&quot;andM;Luis Cuza, telecommunications planner for the City of Los Angeles' Departmentof Airports, has two Etherneting one Novell Inc. and six IBM Token Ringnetworks at Los Angeles International Airport.andP;  He plans to add a FiberDistributed Data Interface  FDDI) backbone to the airport's networks in 1991.andM;Used as a backbone, the 100Mbps FDDI offers users increased speed and theperformance reliability of fiber-optic cable without the expense of takingthe fiber all the way to each workstation.andP;  Codenoll Technology Inc.,andO;Northern Telecom Ltd. and Ungermann-Bass Inc. are among the vendors with FDDIproducts on the market.andM;Cuza will use Token Ring cabling between the FDDI backbone and theworkstations for the new LANS, but the existing Ethernet LANs will alsointerconnect.andP;  He is looking at FDDI vendors and hopes to install thebackbone in the second half of next year.andM;&quot;There is a role for Ethernet and Token Ring, and for FDDI, too, because ofthe available gateways,&quot; says Cuza.andP;  For his applications, however, heintends to grow with Token Ring, rather than adding more Ethernet, because ofthe anticipated data demands for his network.andM;Avoiding CollisionsandM;&quot;We considered adding more Ethernet, but [since it is a bus rather than aring topology] if you cut the cable anywhere, the network is gone.andP;  Also,under heavy loads, throughput decreases because of the collision detection,&quot;Cuza notes, referring to Ethernet's Carrier Sense Multiple Access/CollisionDetection (CSMA/CD) access method.andP;  CSMA/CD controls the simultaneous releaseof data from two workstations by halting transmission for a random time ateach workstation, thus reducing the chances that data packages will collideon the network.andP;  Transmission can be slowed, but collisions are not alwaysavoided.andM;On a Token Ring network, each workstation can transmit only when it receivesa circulating bit-pattern token from the previous station.andP;  Collisions aretherefore not possible, and performance is affected primarily by the numberof workstations on the ring.andP;  The number of workstations on the network canalso affect Ethernet performance, but not as greatly as in the CSMA/CD accessmethod.andM;&quot;The 16Mbps Token Ring shows more potential for the future than Ethernet,&quot;says Dataquest's Perro, &quot;but not everyone is using all its features.andP;  Thethroughput varies, and the way the driver is written makes a big difference.andO;Whether it catches up to Ethernet's market share depends a lot on the playersin the market.&quot;andM;&quot;Survivability and throughput under heavy load were the main criteria for theselection of Token Rings,&quot; says LA Airport's Cuza.andP;  Price was not a bigfactor-not as important as survivability and making sure it worked right.&quot;andM;Constant availability and speed are important throughout the airport'snetworks, but especially so on the security access network, which controlscommercial vehicular traffic at the airport's many entrances.andP;  The securitynetwork being installed will run 12 miles around the airport and have 19nodes controlling over 1,000 doors.andM;PCs as Security GuardsandM;The first five nodes, now operational, are manned Pcs at gates equipped withcard readers.andP;  A person seeking entrance to a certain area of the airportinserts an authorization card in a slot.andP;  The query is referred via thenetwork to a database residing on an IBM minicomputer.andP;  The guard receives aphoto and authorization information on the Pc screen and decides whetheraccess is appropriate.andM;The network will also include unmanned nodes that control access tobuildings.andP;  A Pc within the building will control automated access to eachdoor by polling the database and unlocking doors equipped with card readers.andO;The security LAN is a Novell Token Ring that uses a slightly differentprotocol than the six IBM Token Ring networks being installed asadministrative networks in the airport.andM;The security network also illustrates how third-party products have added tothe flexibility of both Token Ring and Ethernet cabling systems.andP;  Cuza isusing a repeater product om Raycom Systems inc. of Boulder, Colo.-the 3410Fiber Optic Token Ring Extender-to eliminate the distance limitations arisingfrom using twisted pair wiring for Token Ring.andP;  The repeater extends thepossible distance from a wiring center to a workstation from 100 meters tomore than 4 kilometers.andM;For the six or so administrative networks, we want to connect multiple rings,using the IEEE 802.5 standard for interoperability, [which is based on theIBM Token Ring technology].andP;  Novell is not fully 802.5 compliant, but thesecurity network will not be attached to the Ethernet or other Token Ringnetworks,&quot; says Cuza.andM;He chose IBM Token Rings for the administrative networks because he expectsthem to be used heavily for distributed processing.andP;  &quot;To the extent [that itis] practical, we are trying to give our users as much access as possible toall the network resources.andP;  We have an IBM 4381 mainframe that we willcontinue to use for database storage, but we are moving from a mainframe and3270 terminal environment to a PC network environment,&quot; explains Cuza.andP;  &quot;Wehave had a tremendous demand for LANs in the past couple of years tofacilitate applications at different offices and to share data acrossnetworks.&quot;andM;This ability to handle data-intensive loads at higher speeds will positionToken Ring strategically for the future, says IBM's Curt Dunbar, LAN productplanning manager for the company's Research Triangle facility outside Durham,N.C.andP;  &quot;Token Ring is positioned well to go enterprisewide.andP;  Aggregatebandwidth is the reason why Token Ring will overtake Ethernet,&quot; says Dunbar.andM;Eventually, Cuza expects to make use of the variety of bridge and routerproducts coming on the market from IBM, Digital and many smaller vendors tofacilitate connecting the networks and even to configure the individualnetworks.andM;Bridges to the FutureandM;As trends in networking move toward heavier traffic and more nodes, bridgeswill become an increasingly important market segment, says jackson at MicroOne.andP;  Distance limitations can be overcome, and the performance degradationcaused by a few powerful workstations can be alleviated by the addition ofbridges to segment traffic and reconfigure the networks.andP;  The same solutioncan be applied to keep up with the demands created by a new generation ofsoftware that generates heavier traffic when it distributes applicationsacross a network, according to Perro at Dataquest.andM;Rob Becker, Ethernet marketing manager at Digital, the largest Ethernetvendor, sees bridges as critical to the future networking  market.andO;&quot;Transparent bridges are the most important thing in high-performancenetworking,&quot; says Becker.andP;  &quot;Bridges can be strategically placed to segmentsections of users and can help maximize up-time.andP;  They are very important toconnecting and configuring networks.&quot;andM;Digital recognizes the need to combine network transmission media, accordingto Becker, especially with the rise in multivendor environments.andP;  &quot;Users needto communicate across Ethernet and Token Ring networks.andP;  We are seeing moresolutions that allow that, but the efficiency is low for today's needs.andP;  Wewill see more over time that are better,&quot; he says.andM;Becker feels bridges are particularly necessary for combining FDDI into anetwork.andP;  &quot;We view Ethernet and FDDI as a single solution,&quot; says Becker.andO;&quot;This takes Ethernet to the next level, to the primary enabling technology.andO;Bridges are critical in the Ethernet/FDDI solution.&quot;andM;IBM's Dunbar says Big Blue will support FDDI in the future, as well.andP;  &quot;Wewill have two FDDI products out soon-an FDDI work group LAN for CAD/CAM andFDDI backbones.andP;  FDDI will become the common interconnect for heterogeneousLANs, interconnecting to Token Ring through a bridge.andP;  In the meantime, wehave an Ethernet to Token Ring bridge that allows the user to run a 16MbpsToken Ring as the backbone to connect Ethernet and Token Rings.andP;  &quot; is theFuture Here for FDDI?andM;FDDI, which Dataquest's Perro calls &quot;the next LAN breakthrough for the1990s,&quot; will eventually be needed all the way to the workstation toaccommodate the levels of traffic and response time required for workstationsusing extensive graphics packages.andP;  Video applications will also push FDDI tothe workstation, says Perro.andP;  But, for average Pc applications, FDDI willremain a backbone for the future because of its relatively high cost.andM;Although the IEEE FDDI standard is still being drafted, the technology isstable, according to Dataquest's Perro.andP;  But jackson still sees reluctanceamong his clients to take FDDI to the workstation, not just because of theexpense but because fiber-optic cable is more fragile in the officeenvironment than twisted pair or coaxial cable.andM;It is still too expensive and too fragile to go right into an officeenvironment,&quot; he says.andP;  As the price of FDDI drops, however, he sees usersmoving from Ethernet and Token Ring to FDDI, with an interim period in whichboth would be used.andM;Ethernet is still by far the most popular choice with Micro One's clients,however.andP;  Jackson says the company installs a variety of networks,specializing in larger law firms and Fortune 500 companies.andP;  &quot;Eighty percentof the networks we install are Ethernet, but most of our customers are notdedicated IBM shops.andP;  We still install some ARCnet, although it is primarilyused now because of cost, at least until the 20Mbps becomes available.&quot;andM;One of Micro One's clients, the Dallasbased law firm of jackson andamp; Walker,recently replaced its combined ARCnet and Ethernet installations with anall-Ethernet approach.andP;  Two years ago, when the firm only had offices inDallas and Fort Worth, director of operations David Hedges replaced a WangLaboratories Inc. minicomputer system with LANS.andP;  &quot;Since we had Wang coaxialcable all over the place, and we could use ARcnet over that cable, we thoughtit would be economical to use ARcnet where we had the cable.andP;  We installedEthernet where we didn't already have cable,&quot; says Hedges.andM;The firm ran into two problems.andP;  &quot;ARCnet was too slow and too fragile for theenvironment.andP;  If the network hub went bad, it made the network reconfigure,which brought the whole thing to its knees.andP;  In a legal environment, moneyisn't the issue-up-time is the issue.andP;  They'll spend the money to get theuptime,&quot; Hedges explains.andM;The Ethernet networks did not have the same problem, however, and within ayear, Hedges began replacing the ARcnet with Ethernet on unshielded twistedpair wiring.andP;  Now, with additional offices in Houston and New Orleans and atotal of 315 users, jackson andamp; Walker has a four-city network with localEthernet cabling connected by T1 links.andP;  The workstations are 386sx PCs fromAST Research Inc.; the LAN is a Novell 386.andP;  Hedges and Micro One choseEthernet products from SynOptics Communications Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.andO;&quot;Their network management is very strong,&quot; says Hedges.andM;Hedges did not consider Token Ring cabling because, &quot;we have no main frame,no IBM, no reason.andP;  Our applications are mainly word processing sheet-noheavy database applications although we have a few little databases.andP;  We haveaccess to all documents in all four cities.andP;  The Wang vs minicomputer stillhas our accounting applications and contains our client matter database,[written in house].andM;&quot;Our real focus is connectivity and communications, not sheer processingpower.andP;  We are moving in the direction of networking wherever we can to shareand standardize our applications,&quot; says Hedges.andP;  In the future, he sees noneed to upgrade to a faster cabling system but expects to continue to expandthe network as the law firm grows.andM;Whether users need widespread access, like Jackson andamp; Walker, or heavy networkprocessing power, like the Los Angeles International Airport, networkspecialists say that the variety of options available in transmission mediamakes it possible for users to choose the best one for each job without manytrade-offs.andP;  And by the mid-1990s, there will be even more options.andM;As FDDI becomes more widespread, prices will drop, say analysts, making itsufficiently economical to move beyond the backbone to the workstation, evenon PC LANS.andP;  FDDI's 100Mbps speed is enough of a jump over current technologyto satisfy large, data-intensive application needs into the next century.andO;Meanwhile, smaller, less intensive networks should be able to maintain theircabling systems with the help of a proliferating number of bridge and routingproducts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
