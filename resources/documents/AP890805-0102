For the first six months of his presidency, Bush had beenlargely spared from any pressures over the hostages' plight, eventhough nine Americans remained in captivity in Lebanon.   That suddenly changed after Israeli commandos seized a ShiiteMoslem cleric in Lebanon. Three days later, a shadowy organizationcalled the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth declared it hadhanged Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and released a videotapepurportedly showing the execution.   Suddenly, Bush began to feel the sting of experiences that hadbludgeoned Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Bush spoke of ``theoverwhelming events'' of the hostage crisis and commented, ``Theseare not easy days.''   Bush was spending the weekend with family at the presidentialretreat at Camp David, Md., while national security aides monitoredthe hostage developments at the White House.   The president did not have any policy staff with him and thehostage situation was considered ``stabilized,'' White Housespokesman Jay Allison said Saturday.   He said Bush did routine paperwork, received intelligencebriefing materials and made phone calls during the morning, thenplayed tennis and went swimming.   Back in Washington, U.S. officials sought to downplay anynegative interpretation of the Iranian news agency report on Iranrefusing a U.S. message last week.   ``Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weighin,'' said one closely involved source who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``We have been able to get our messages, one way oranother, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians.''   It was last week _ with telephone calls to world leaders onbehalf of the hostages _ when Bush initiated what his presssecretary, Marlin Fitzwater, called ``the most defined andhigh-level diplomatic effort I have ever seen'' in the Bush andReagan administrations.   Complaining of inadequate intelligence from Lebanon, Bushanguished with ``a heavy heart'' for four days over Higgins andawaited word on hostage Joseph Cicippio, under a death threat fromthe radical Revolutionary Justice Organization.   After a long suspense, as the White House waged its intensediplomatic effort and the Pentagon put on a display of militarymuscle in the Middle East, Cicippio got a temporary reprieve fromhis captors.   No one knew for sure why Cicippio's sentenced was suspended. ``Ilike to think that a broad-spread appeal to nations in every cornerof the globe had something to do with it,'' Bush said.   The outcome spared Bush _ at least temporarily _ from pressureto find an appropriate way to punish the terrorists withoutendangering the remaining hostages or innocent civilians.   Even so, Bush said Friday, ``I feel the burden of going to everyend possible to try to find _ get the return of these Americans totheir loved ones and find out the truth about Col. Higgins.''   Such a burden can be perilous to presidents.   Carter's White House became branded as a presidency held hostageby the 441-day captivity of Americans in Iran, and the ordeal,including a disastrous rescue attempt, helped drive him from office.   For Reagan, the kidnapping of Americans in Lebanon led the WhiteHouse into the improbable Iran-Contra affair with embarrassingrevelations about criminal wrongdoing and clumsy attempts to tradearms for hostages.   William Schneider, a political analyst at the AmericanEnterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said Bush ``lookedthe same way all presidents look when they get to a hostage crisis.He looked ineffectual and the United States look helpless.   ``He's under pressure to do something and there's nothing he cando,'' Schneider said. ``He rediscovered a lesson he should havelearned ... to resist the temptation to allow these things tobecome a serious national crisis because you cannot controlevents.''   On the other hand, Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at theBrookings Institution, said Bush had performed well.   ``He's a naturally cautious man and this is one of those timeswhen it was probably useful,'' said Hess. He said Bush had learnedfrom the experiences of Carter and Reagan.   With the announcement of Higgins' death, Bush cut short aspeech-making trip in the West and rushed back to Washington,hurriedly ordered a meeting Monday with military, diplomatic andnational security advisers, and then delivered a briefing tocongressional leaders.   High-ranking Pentagon officials were seen entering the WhiteHouse carrying large charts and maps, giving rise to speculationthat a military strike was being planned.   Nothing happened after the apparent shift to a crisis mode.   At the Tuesday morning meeting of top White House aides, chiefof staff John Sununu emphasized the limitations Bush faced intrying to employ military options.   Stephen Studdert, a high-ranking aide, described Bush as``outraged, incensed, but cognizant of the limitations on hisoptions and the need to be responsible.''   Bush himself acknowledged in a 1986 report on terrorism thatretaliation was not an easy course. ``Our principles of justicewill not permit random retaliation against groups of countries,''the report said.   The White House began to reverse course. There was no crisis andthe government was not being immobilized by terrorists, presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.   Bush went ahead with a festive barbecue on the South LawnTuesday night.   With the immediate crisis behind him, Bush said he wanted tofollow up an offer from Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,to help find a solution to the hostage crisis. There also wereintriguing clues that the Soviet Union and Syria had been helpful.   Fitzwater said the United States hoped last week's developments``may open up some opportunity for improvement over the long haul.... I don't think we're back at square one.''</TEXT></DOC>
