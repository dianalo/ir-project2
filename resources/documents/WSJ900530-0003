Although the changes in the Revlon refinancing arerelatively minor, bankers say they occurred partly inresponse to regulatory pressure on banks to limit loans forhighly leveraged transactions.</LP><TEXT>   Revlon, controlled by New York investor Ronald O.Perelman, has operated under a heavy debt load ever since acompany controlled by Mr. Perelman acquired Revlon in 1986 ina hostile takeover financed by high-risk, high-yielding junkbonds.   The Revlon debt restructuring, first disclosed yesterdayin the American Banker, a trade publication, was forced onthe company and the four banks after other U.S. banks balkedat terms of the new loan. The four banks, units of ChaseManhattan Corp., Chemical Bank Corp., Citicorp, andManufacturers Hanover Corp., were seeking to resell parts ofthe loan to other banks.   The changes in the borrowing will boost the fees paid tosome banks that participate in the loan, and accelerate therepayment of part of the loan by Revlon, a maker oftoiletries, cosmetics and other beauty products. The Revlonborrowing refinances existing Revlon bank debt.   The bulk of the new loans carry an interest rate of 1 1/2percentage points above the prime rate, a common benchmarkfor bank loans; the prime is now 10%. The interest ratewasn't affected by the restructuring. Revlon has another $800million in junk bonds outstanding, which yield more than 18%based on their market prices, indicating some uncertaintyamong investors about the company's finances.   The new Revlon debt package consists of $1.25 billion interm loans plus a $550 million revolving credit without anyset maturity. Originally the term loans had a four-yearmaturity, meaning they had to be repaid or refinanced in1994. To help the banks resell the loans, Mr. Perelman agreedto repay half the term loan in 1992.   A statement by the four banks said of the Revlon loan: &quot;Inorder to respond to current market conditions, Revlon and theco-agents are making certain structural and pricingadjustments to the $1.8 billion transaction currently in themarketplace.&quot; The loan is expected to close in June.   Although Revlon confirmed that the terms of the loan havebeen changed, a spokesman stressed that the refinancing isvoluntary and that the four lead banks have committed to lendall the money.   An individual close to the company said the new bank debtwill reduce Revlon's bank interest costs by about one-half apercentage point. The same person said Revlon's projected1990 revenue is $2.8 billion, with expected operating cashflow -- before interest, depreciation, and amortization -- ofmore than $400 million.   The amicable revamping of the loan's terms stands in sharpcontrast to a $7 billion bank borrowing for a proposedtakeover of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., which collapsedlast October amid wrangling between two lead banks and UALmanagement.   The market for bank loans for leveraged transactions hasgrown increasingly wobbly in the past year, during which manyheavily indebted companies have suffered financial reversalsand some have been forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection.Bank regulators have since launched a crackdown on loans forhighly leveraged transactions.   One banker familiar with the loan said, &quot;There was toughergoing than expected in placing the loan. It's a leveragedtransaction with all the complications therein in amarketplace with a difficult tone.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
