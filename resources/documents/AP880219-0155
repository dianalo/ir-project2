Mack Landers' quest for a copy of ``Don, The Story Of A LionDog,'' of which only an estimated 100 copies exist in this country,got national publicity when syndicated columnist Bob Greene wroteabout him.   After hearing about Landers, Dr. James H. Vickers, president ofthe National Zane Grey's West Society in Ijamsville, Md., sent acopy to Greene, who will deliver it to Landers on Sunday at hishome in this Fort Worth suburb.   ``Anybody that thought that much of Zane Grey, I'm happy to sendit to him,'' Vickers, 57, said Thursday. ``I hope he gets a lot ofenjoyment out of it.''   Doctors gave Landers, 73, less than three months to live inJanuary, after they found that cancer had spread in his body.   Landers was near tears when he learned that a copy of ``Don''soon would be added to his 92-book collection of Grey's books.   ``I don't have the vocabulary to express how I really feel,''said Landers. ``I know it's true, but I can't believe I'm going toget it. It's wonderful that someone would do that for an old man.''   Out of appreciation for Greene's efforts, Landers said he willaccept the copy the Chicago Tribune columnist is delivering ratherthan one offered by a Fort Worth woman or those offered by peoplefrom California, Colorado, Connecticut and several other states.   ``We're going to go with Mr. Greene because he was the one whoinstigated the story in the first place,'' said Landers' wife,Alliene. ``Everyone is being so kind. We're real grateful.''   Greene said he even was contacted by Zane Grey's granddaughter,who offered to give Landers a copy.   Greene said he was surprised by the response to his column thatappeared last week in about 200 newspapers.   ``The books are starting to pop up,'' he said. ``It's beenestimated to me that there are only about 100 in the country. Wehad no idea we'd have this kind of response.''   ``Don'' is a limited-edition tale about a hunting expeditionGrey and friends took to the Grand Canyon area in the early 1920s.The men were hunting mountain lions, not to kill but to sell tozoos and circuses.</TEXT></DOC>
