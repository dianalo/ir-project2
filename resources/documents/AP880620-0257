By a unanimous vote, the justices ruled that the New York Citylaw is constitutional, at least as it is written.   The law banning discrimination by public accommodations exempts``distinctly private organizations.'' But it deprives non-religiousgroups of that exempt designation if they have more than 400members, provide regular meal service and regularly get theirmembers' dues paid by non-members such as the members' employers.   At least six other major cities _ Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, LosAngeles, San Francisco and Washington _ have enacted similarordinances recently.   The New York State Clubs Association, comprised of 125 privateclubs and associations, challenged the New York City law soon afterit was enacted in 1984.   The city had initiated proceedings against four men-only clubs _the 10,003-member New York Athletic Club, the 4,329-memberUniversity Club, the 1,900-member Century Association and the1,600-member Union League Club.   Lawyers for the clubs association argued that the law wronglycreates an irrebutable presumption that such organizations are nottruly private if they have more than 400 members and meet the othercriteria.   The law's attackers said it does not give individual clubs anopportunity to prove they should not be treated as a publicaccommodation.   Writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White noted thatany individual club wanting to challenge the New York City law asapplied to it is free to do so.   But White said the law can be applied in a way that does notviolate the constitutionally protected freedom of association.   In previous decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled that statesmay force the U.S. Jaycees and Rotary International to admit womenas members.   In ruling unanimously in the Rotary case two years ago, thejustices suggested that numerous other male-only or female-onlyprivate organizations may have to comply with state laws requiringequal access to public accommodations.   The challenge of New York City's law was supported in a``friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted in behalf of, among others,the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Loyal Order ofMoose, the Improved Order of Red Men and Kiwanis International.   Kiwanis International last July voted to end its men-onytradition and allow its 8,200 clubs worldwide to admit women.   The law was defended by, among others, the U.S. Conference ofMayors, the Council of State Governments, the National Associationof Counties, the National League of Cities, the American CivilLiberties Union and the American Bar Association.   In today's decision, White acknowledged that ``a considerableamount of private or intimate association'' might occur in New YorkCity's private clubs.   However, he said the same is true ``in many restauarants andother places of public accommodation, but that fact alone does notafford the entity as a whole any constitutional immunity topractice discrimination when the government has barred it fromdoing so.''   White said some clubs may be able to prove they were organizedfor ``specific expressive purposes'' they will not be able topursue ``if they cannot confine ... membership to those who sharethe same sex, for example, or the same religion.''   But he added, ``It seems sensible enough to believe that many ofthe large clubs covered by the (New York City) law are not of thiskind.''   Two justices who joined in the opinion, Anthony M. Kennedy andHarry A. Blackmun, once belonged to male-only clubs.   Kennedy, the court's newest justice, was criticized during hisSenate confirmation hearings last year for his past membership inexclusive private clubs.   Kennedy quit San Francisco's men-only, all-white Olympic Clubafter he was mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee. He hadbeen a member since 1962. He quite the men-only Sutter Club in hishometown of Sacramento, Calif., eight years ago.   Blackmun recently quit the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C.,where he had held a longtime membership. The club for 110 years hasbarred women from becoming members, a policy it voted Saturday toabandon.   The clubs case is New York State Club Association vs. New YorkCity, 86-1836.</TEXT></DOC>
