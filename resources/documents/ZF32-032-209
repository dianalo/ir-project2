Toshiba plans to bring its owndevices to the world market in early spring 1992.andP;  Toshiba will also developand diversify product lines to include its own designs of devices based onthe R3000 and R4000 architectures, and offer chip sets integrating peripheralcomponents around the cores of the two parts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
