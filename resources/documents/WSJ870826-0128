Arnox, which makes fire-retardant chemicals, said its board would consider the proposal at a meeting this morning. A spokeswoman said Arnox would have no comment on the proposal until after the board meeting.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Arnox shares were quoted at $8.75 bid, up $1.375.    Arnox said in a statement that the buyout proposal has been endorsed by its chairman and president, George W. Schiele, who is 56 years old. It said the offer was subject to, among other things, proper financing and an agreement with certain of the company's debtholders.    For the six months, Arnox had a net loss of $413,919, compared with a loss of $743,061 a year earlier. Revenue soared to $12 million from $799,520.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
