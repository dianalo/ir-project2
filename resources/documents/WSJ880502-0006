In both the U.S. and Canada, natural gas well completions rose in 1987, after generally plunging between 1981 and 1986. The latest statistics for the first quarter of 1988 show a continuation of growth, particularly in Canada. Some observers are encouraged by the increases, and by a renewed trend toward long-term supply contracts between gas buyers and sellers.    In recent years the supply glut has discouraged buyers from contracting for long-term gas supplies, while depressing drilling for new gas. Since last year, however, some gas buyers, anticipating that the glut may diminish soon, are once again locking in future supplies. Such contracts are helping to re-stabilize the gas production industry by making producers' cash flows and drilling plans more predictable.    With an increased number of drilling rigs at work, prospects are good that the number of U.S. gas wells completed in 1988 will rise by 20%, after a 1.4% increase in 1987, says Michael German, spokesman for the Washington-based American Gas Association, a trade group. Hans Maciej, technical director of the Canadian Petroleum Association in Calgary, Alberta, says he expects higher gas well completions in Canada this year, even though &quot;we still have gas coming out of our ears.&quot;    But both men remain cautious about the outlook. &quot;It's a long way from a stampede,&quot; says Mr. German of the gain in U.S. gas drilling. And Mr. Maciej warns that a Canadian downturn could develop in 1989 after attractive government incentives expire this year.    For the 1988 first quarter, the number of gas wells completed in the U.S. rose 9%, to 2,112, from 1,938 a year earlier, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In Canada, the Daily Oil Bulletin, a Calgary trade publication, says first quarter gas well completions rose 74%, to 640, from 368 in the year-earlier period.    The increases have occurred even though spot prices for natural gas have resumed a downward trend, after excessive buying for storage caused a brief surge last winter. According to Benjamin Schlesinger, a natural gas analyst in Bethesda, Md., benchmark prices at the wellhead in the U.S. Gulf Coast area are currently about $1.25 to $1.30 per thousand cubic feet, down about 38% from a recent peak of $2.10 in January and about 13% lower than $1.45 to $1.50 a year ago. He says the latest decline occurred because the industry found itself overstocked this spring.    Even with the lower spot prices, Mr. Schlesinger thinks some gas producers are gaining confidence because of the revival in long-term supply contracts, which can range up to 20 years. The practice was abandoned in favor of short-term contracts of less than one year after the gas surplus developed in the early part of the decade.    According to Mr. Schlesinger, long-term contracts once again assure gas producers of a market and assure gas users of a reliable supply. But he adds that the current crop of contracts differs from those in previous years by allowing for flexible prices, based on changing market conditions. Since the negotiations for such contracts are complex, he says that only a few have been signed, but he adds that the trend is &quot;very healthy for the gas industry.&quot;    Shell Oil Co., a major Houston-based producer, says it recently signed two long-term contracts with gas distributors, including a ten-year commitment to supply Brooklyn Union Gas Co. of New York. James Current, Shell's natural gas manager, adds that the company is pursuing a half-dozen more such contracts in hopes of obtaining prices higher than those available for spot sales.    Although Mr. Current says the contracts are encouraging, he remains wary about the future. &quot;We're new at this. We're not ready yet to say the contracts will have a significant impact on drilling plans,&quot; he says.    But Czar Resources Ltd., a small producer in Calgary, Alberta, says it is preparing to boost drilling after having recently signed a 300 million Canadian dollar ($244 million) 20-year contract to supply gas to a unit of San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co.    Robert Lamond, Czar's chairman, says the company has been trying for years to land such a contract, to stabilize its cash flow and drilling plans. He says the agreement helped the company to borrow new funds for gas developments and adds that Czar can now afford to reduce its discount sales into the spot market if short-term prices fall too low. </TEXT></DOC>
