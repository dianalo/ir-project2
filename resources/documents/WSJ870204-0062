About $330 million of securities is affected. Moody's said Shawmut &quot;has reached an improved level of performance . . . has addressed asset quality problems and is experiencing strong growth.&quot; The rating concern also cited Shawmut's mix of loans, its &quot;good pool of core deposits&quot; and rapid loan growth that it attributed in part to the &quot;hardy&quot; New England economy. A Shawmut spokesman said the upgrade reflects &quot;growing improvement in earnings and in the equity structure of the bank.&quot;    ---   TYLER CORP. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered the rating on $119 million of subordinated debt of the Dallas-based manufacturer to double-B-minus from double-B-plus. The rating concern said weakness in Tyler's markets have resulted in &quot;sub-par earning performance over the past two years and earnings aren't expected to rebound to previously strong levels.&quot; Tyler makes explosives, industrial coatings, pipes and pipe fittings. Company officials had no comment on the rating change.    ---   WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL INC. -- Moody's lowered the company's senior notes rating to Baa-1 from single-A-2 and its convertible subordinated debentures to Baa-2 from single-A-3. The rating concern said the downgrade is based on Wendy's &quot;depressed operating performance and the limited prospect for near-term earnings improvement because of increasingly competitive conditions in the fast-food restaurant industry.&quot; It pointed to what it called the restaurant concern's &quot;unsuccessful attempt to introduce a systemwide breakfast menu&quot; as one of several factors prompting its downgrade. A Wendy's spokesman declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
