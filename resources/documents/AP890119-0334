Trade flows respond slowly but surely to changes in currencyrates, economists say. If the dollar's latest rise lasts, it couldhalt or even reverse progress toward shrinking the trade gap.   As the world's largest debtor, the United States eventually willhave to produce a trade surplus in order to generate enough money tokeep up on rent, interest and dividends to foreigners.   On Thursday, the dollar fell against most major currencies inresponse to dollar-selling by major central banks. But since itslows of late November, the dollar is up 6 percent against theJapanese yen and 8 percent against the West German mark.   The dollar actually is not far above its levels of a year ago _the problem is that many economists believe the dollar needs to befalling to promote U.S. exports and keep a lid on imports.   ``If exports do respond nicely to dollar changes, what do we haveahead of us now that the dollar is no longer falling?'' DonaldRatajczak, head of Georgia State University's Economic ForecastingCenter, said Thursday.   The dollar appeared to defy gravity this week when it surgedupward despite reports of an unexpectedly large U.S. trade deficitand a record Japanese trade surplus.   Analysts say currency dealers, who once panicked at the slightestevidence of deterioration in U.S. trade, have decided they cansafely ignore trade figures.   They may be partially right. The central banks of the bigindustrial democracies are suspending the economic law of gravity bycommitting themselves to keeping a floor under the dollar.   Without meaning to, the central banks are making the world safefor speculators. Foreign investors believe they can put money indollars to take advantage of high U.S. interest rates withoutworrying that the dollar will be allowed to crash and wipe out theirgains.   Having tested the dollar's lows shortly after the election ofGeorge Bush in November, speculators are testing the highest levelsthat the central banks will tolerate.   In the way it has swept skeptics aside, the dollar'sjuggernaut-like rise resembles the rise in stocks in the bull marketof summer 1987 _ which preceded the October crash of that year.   ``If you push the dollar up enough then people will startwavering in their longer-term views and at a certain point they'llthrow in their towel'' and join in the buying, said Stephen Leach, acurrency analyst at Chemical Bank.   A cheaper dollar is not a cure-all for America's trade ills, ofcourse. The United States has to take action on other fronts, suchas saving more and making goods the rest of the world wants.   Still, a low-priced currency helps. The brilliant performance ofthe U.S. export sector last year was a late but direct result of thedollar's decline in 1985 through 1987.   While currency traders have chosen to ignore the trade gap latelyand focus instead on the U.S. interest rate advantage, it seemsinevitable that persistent trade gaps will eventually demandattention.   The central banks' ability to intervene is puny compared to thesize of the worldwide foreign-exchange market. They may not be ableto keep the dollar's decline orderly if psychology suddenly switchesagainst it.   ``The dollar will go up until it reaches the point whereeverybody thinks it's going to fall, and then it will fall hard,''Ratajczak predicted.</TEXT><TEXT>   Editor's Note: Peter Coy covers foreign trade and technology forThe Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
