The rebels were reported overnight to have destroyed a powerplant at a farm run by Bougainville Copper Ltd., which owns theeconomically crucial mine on northern Bougainville island.   A state of emergency went into effect today, AustralianAssociated Press said. It gives authorities broad powers to search,seize and arrest, and it allows them to evacuate people fromemergency areas.   Witnesses reported houses ablaze and said at least two dozenpeople were taken away by police, the news agency said. Soldiersblocked the access road to the mine and checked all vehicles, itsaid.   Many residents were likely to be forcibly evacuated fromrebel-held areas to isolate secessionist leader Francis Ona, a35-year-old surveyor, and his Bougainville Republican Army, theagency said.   The unrest, which broke out seven months ago, closed the mine May15. Rebel landowners say it is damaging the environment and theydemand $10 billion in compensation.   The security forces commander, Col. Lima Dotaona, has called onOna to surrender. He said Sunday before launching the operation hewas confident his men would restore order, but he said he expected aprotracted operation.   ``It's a dangerous operation, and you can expect casualties,'' hesaid.   In an address broadcast to the nation Friday, Prime MinisterRabbie Namaliu said the government could not allow a ``criminalminority'' to threaten the unity and economic stability of thenation.   The mine had been contributing 20 percent of Papua New Guinea'stotal revenue through royalties and taxes.   The rebels have spurned all attempts at conciliation, ambushingmine workers and soldiers. Three soldiers have died and about 20other members of the security forces and numerous civilians havebeen wounded.   Tensions boiled over because local landowners objected to profitsbeing made from the island's mine, which ranks among the world's 10biggest open-cut copper mines. The rebels demand a referendum onsecession.   Australia's biggest mining company, CRA Ltd., jointly operatesthe mine, which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland.   Papua New Guinea, with a 3.5 million population, gainedindependence from Australia in 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
