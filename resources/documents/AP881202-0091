West Germany will abandon more than half its maneuvers involvingmore than 2,000 troops, but increase smaller excercises to allayenvironmental and public complaints, said West German DefenseMinister Rupert Scholz. The switch also would be morecost-effective, he said.   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Scholz stressed theimpending reliance on smaller excercises ``was meant to increase theeffectiveness'' of West German forces.   ``It was not described as a reduction in overall militaryexcercises,'' said Woerner.   Scholz said allies had ``reacted positively'' when hee, won't be affected.But observers said large disruptivemaneuvers by other NATO troops might be seen in an increasingly badlight.</TEXT></DOC>
