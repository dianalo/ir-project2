(``PDH''); Becton, Dickinson and Company (``Becton,Dickinson''); and Edmont, Inc. (``Edmont''), and moves for entry of theproposed Final Judgment as amended. <ITAG tagnum="81">I </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction </ITAG>This action began on June 16, 1989, when the United States filed a complaintalleging that the proposed acquisition of Edmont by PDH would violate section7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. The Complaint alleged that the effectof the acquisition would be substantially to lessen competition in thesale in the United States of dipped unsupported nitrile industrial gloves,liquid proof dipped supported latex industrial gloves, liquid proof dippedsupported nitrile industrial gloves, liquid proof dipped supported neopreneindustrial gloves, and liquid proof dipped supported PVC industrial gloves.Both companies sell all five of those types of industrial gloves in theUnited States. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, to enjoin the transactionto prevent its anticompetitive effects in the five relevant markets. On June 16, 1989, the United States and defendants filed a Stipulationin which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designedto eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition. In accordancewith the provisions of the APPA, the United States also filed a CompetitiveImpact Statement explaining the basis for the Complaint and for the UnitedStates' conclusion that entry of the proposed Final Judgment would be inthe public interest. As a result of public comments received by the UnitedStates, the parties have agreed to amend the proposed Final Judgment asdiscussed on page 17, <T3>infra.</T3> The proposed Final Judgment, as amended, would eliminatethe anticompetitive effects alleged in the Complaint with respect to thefive relevant markets by requiring PDH to sell: (1) Its subsidiary AnsellGranet Inc. (``Ansell Granet''), which manufactures liquid proof dippedsupported gloves; and (2) Edmont's manufacturing facility located in Canton,Ohio (``Canton facility''), which manufactures unsupported nitrile gloves.The United States and the defendants stipulated that the proposed FinalJudgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA, unless the Governmentwithdraws its consent. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment, as amended,would terminate this action, except that the Court would retain jurisdictionto construe, modify, and enforce the Final Judgment and to punish violationsof the Judgment. <ITAG tagnum="81">II </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With the APPA </ITAG>Upon publication of this Response in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the procedures required by the APPA will havebeen completed, and the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment, asamended. A.

(CCH) andpara; 66,651at page 63,045 (D.D.C. 1985). In carrying out its responsibilities, theDepartment has broad discretion in prosecuting alleged antitrust violationsand determining appropriate relief for the settlement of cases. <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Mid-America Dairymen, Inc.,</T3> 1977-1 Trade Cas.

Before entering aproposed consent decree, the Court must determine that the decree is inthe public interest, 15 U.S.C. 16(e),\5\<NOTE/> but that test is limited to ensuring that the Governmenthas met its public interest responsibilities, that is, determining thatthe proposed Final Judgment falls within the range of the Government'santitrust enforcement discretion.

In this case, the United States carefully considered the matters that arenow being raised in the comments when it formulated its position with respectto this transaction, and the parties have agreed to amend the proposedFinal Judgment after consideration of the comments received. We concluded,for the reasons discussed below and in the Competitive Impact Statement,that the public would be best served by the remedial action set forth inthe proposed Final Judgment, as amended. If the Court finds that the UnitedStates' action represented a reasonable exercise of its antitrust enforcementresponsibility and prosecutorial discretion, it may enter the proposedFinal Judgment, as amended, as soon as compliance with the APPA is completedby publication of the comments and Response in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The United States respectfully requests that the Courtenter the proposed Final Judgment, as amended, promptly.

TheCompetitive Analysis of the United States  The Department believes that if the proposed Final Judgment, as amended,is entered, the transaction will no longer violate section 7 of the ClaytonAct. The proposed Final Judgment, as amended, will ensure the preservationof competition in each relevant market by means of divestitures of manufacturingassets to new, or currently small, competitors in those markets. Thus,the United States concludes that entry of the proposed Final Judgment,as amended, is in the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Products are Specific Types of Industrial Gloves  </ITAG>Industrial gloves are designed to protect hands from cuts and abrasionsand environmental, chemical, and biological agents and/or to protect productsfrom hand-borne contamination. They are manufactured using a variety ofprocesses and materials. They may be as simple as cotton or leather gloves,or may be dipped unsupported gloves,\7\<NOTE/> dipped supported gloves,\8\<NOTE/> or impregnated gloves,\9\<NOTE/> using either natural or synthetic materials. Dipped unsupportedgloves are liquid proof, dipped supported gloves may or may not be liquidproof, depending on how they are made, and cotton, leather, and impregnatedgloves are not liquid proof.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Dipped unsupported gloves are made by dipping a ``former,''a porcelain or metal form shaped like a hand, into a coating material suchas latex, nitrile, or neoprene. The result is a liquid proof, chemicalresistant glove made only of the coating material.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Dipped supported gloves are made by cutting and sewinga lining material, typically cotton, into the shape of a hand, placingit on a former, then dipping it into a coating material such as PVC, nitrile,latex, or neoprene.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Impregnated gloves are made by impregnating a fabric withPVC, nitrile, etc., then cutting and sewing the resulting material intothe shape of a hand as a cotton or leather glove would be made. Industrial gloves have varying degrees of suitability for different usesdepending on the manufacturing process and materials employed. Only liquidproof dipped supported and dipped unsupported gloves offer substantialprotection for use with chemical agents. As between liquid proof supportedand unsupported gloves dipped in the same material, the former offer superiorprotection from cuts and abrasions, while the latter have superior tactileand dexterity properties. Within the unsupported and liquid proof supportedcategories, each type of coating material offers protection against certainchemicals or other toxic or corrosive substances superior to other types.When different types of gloves are equally acceptable for a specific use,one type typically is sufficiently less costly to make its use obvious,and a small but significant and nontransitory increase in its price isnot likely to cause a significant number of customers to switch to an alternativetype of glove.  Consequently, at least among liquid proof supported and unsupported gloves,each type of glove constitutes a separate product market. The five productmarkets alleged in the Complaint are unsupported gloves dipped in nitrileand liquid proof supported gloves dipped in latex, nitrile, neoprene, orPVC. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Geographic Market for Industrial Gloves is Nationwide  </ITAG>The geographic market for the various types of industrial gloves is theUnited States because firms that produce and sell those products competewith each other for sales throughout the country.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Effect of the Transaction </ITAG>PDH and Edmont sell numerous types of industrial gloves to distributorsthroughout the United States. They are direct competitors in many of thoseproduct markets. In the five product markets identified in the Complaintthere are few alternative sources. In all of those five markets, the HHI,\10\<NOTE/> measured by dollar sales, exceeded 2700 before the acquisitionand increased by more than 380 as a result of the acquisition. The highlevel of concentration in those markets, combined with the difficulty ofentry into those markets, led the Department to conclude that the acquisitionwould eliminate significant competition in those five markets, increasingthe likelihood that prices would rise in those markets.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ ``HHI'' means the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index, a measureof market concentration calculated by squaring the market share of eachfirm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. Forexample, for a market consisting of four firms with shares of 30 30, 20,and 20 percent, the HHI is 2,600 (30\2\+30\2\+20\2\+20\2\=900+900+400+400=2,600).The HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firmsin the market. It approaches zero when a market is occupied by a largenumber of firms of relatively equal size and reaches its maximum of 10,000when a market is controlled by a single firm. The HHI increases both asthe number of firms in the market decreases and as the disparity in sizebetween those firms increases.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. The Proposed Final Judgment, As Amended </ITAG>Under the terms of the proposed Final Judgment, as amended, PDH is requiredto divest certain assets relating to the production of industrial glovesin the five product markets in which the acquisition poses a threat tocompetition. PDH would  be required to divest a manufacturing facilityin Canton, Ohio, one of two Edmont plants used for the production of unsupportednitrile gloves, and to divest Ansell Granet, which produces all of PDH'sdipped supported gloves. PDH currently manufactures unsupported nitrile gloves at a single plantin Redditch, England, while Edmont manufactures such gloves at its Cantonplant and at a plant in Juarez, Mexico. For several reasons the divestitureof the Canton plant is preferable to divestiture of the Redditch plant.Capacity to produce nitrile gloves at Canton is somewhat greater than PDH'scapacity at Redditch, and although the English plant is newer, it doesnot appear to have any competitive advantage relative to the Canton plantin the United States. Edmont has sold in this country substantially moreunsupported nitrile gloves manufactured at Canton than PDH has sold manufacturedat Redditch. Moreover, the ability of PDH to compete in the United Stateswith gloves produced in England is subject to fluctuating foreign exchangerates and greater transportation costs, problems that have affected itssales efforts, and it is likely that PDH will concentrate sales of glovesmanufactured at the Redditch plant in the growing European market. Divestitureof the Canton plant to a suitable new competitor should adequately replacethe competition currently provided by PDH, which currently is a small playerin the market. Divestiture to a suitable existing, small  manufacturercould effectively increase competition by creating an additional strongcompetitor in a market currently dominated by two companies. Divestiture of Ansell Granet will effectively eliminate the anticompetitiveeffects of the acquisition in the various dipped supported industrial glovemarkets. PDH only recently entered the dipped supported glove markets in1988, through the acquisition of the Granet Division of the WGM SafetyCorp, and PDH competes in the dipped supported markets solely through thisfacility. Thus, divestiture of Granet to a suitable new competetitor willcompletely replace PDH in these markets. G. Response to Comments With the exception of the comments received from the URW, all of the commentsreceived were from industrial glove manufacturers in competition with PDHand Edmont. The comments primarily fall into three categories: (1) Thatthe proposed divestitures of the Canton Facility and Ansell Granet willnot provide adequate relief for the antitrust violations charged in theComplaint; (2) that the product markets charged in the Complaint do notreflect the actual product markets, and thus understate the anticompetitiveeffects of the acquisition; and (3) that even if the product markets chargedin the Complaint are appropriate, the acquisition will enable PDH to wield market power unreasonably in several product markets.\11\<NOTE/> Of significance, however, is that not a single purchaserof industrial gloves, including the large, sophisticated industrial glovedistributors who comprise the bulk of the customers for gloves, has expressedany concern to the Court or the Department of Justice that the proposedFinal Judgment would not adequately protect its interests.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Although the public comments all concern the proposedFinal Judgment as originally published, they are applicable equally tothe proposed Final Judgment, as amended. Under the circumstances, the single issue presented here is whether theproposed Final Judgment, as amended, represents a reasonable exercise ofthe Department of Justice's antitrust enforcement discretion. For the reasonsdiscussed below, the United States has concluded that the proposed FinalJudgment, as amended, is an appropriate resolution of this litigation,that it reflects a careful study of the market and is reasonably calculatedto prevent the anticompetitive effects alleged in the Complaint, and thatits entry therefore is in the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Viability of the Proposed Divestitures  </ITAG>The Final Judgment provides that the Canton and Ansell Granet operationswill be sold to a purchaser or purchasers who can operate them as ``viableongoing businesses engaged in the production of industrial gloves.'' TheGovernment reserves the  right to satisfy itself that the purchase or purchasesare for the purpose of competing effectively in the industrial glove marketand that the purchaser or purchasers have the managerial, operational,and financial capability to compete effectively in the industrial glovemarket in the United States. The goal of the proposed Final Judgment, asamended, is to restore the competition in the relevant markets that theacquisition eliminates. The proposed divestitures will accomplish thatgoal completely. Specifically, the purchaser or purchasers of these facilitieswill fully supplant PDH in each of these markets. a. <T3>The Canton Facility.</T3> LRC, Comasec, and JOMAC question whetherthe purchaser of the Canton facility can effectively compete in the marketfor unsupported nitrile gloves. The divestiture of the Canton facilityto a qualified purchaser will, however, restore, if not improve, the competitivesituation that existed before the merger. As noted by LRC, PDH has not been a major player in the unsupported nitrilemarket with its Redditch plant. The new operator of the Canton facilitywill be able to compete in the U.S. market at least as effectively as PDHcould compete from Redditch. Production costs at the Canton facility arecompetitive in the U.S. market. The Canton facility has the capacity tomanufacture 600,000 dozen gloves, slightly more  than the Redditch plant.\12\<NOTE/> Canton's 1988 U.S. sales were around $7,700,000, comparedto Redditch's sales of $1,269,000. Additionally, fluctuations in currencyrates can render exports to the United States from Redditch unprofitable,and growing demand in Europe makes it likely that most of the productionof the Redditch facility will be directed toward the Common Market in thefuture. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Canton's capacity is well over 25 percent of the estimatedUnited States market for unsupported nitrile gloves. LRC, Comasec, and JOMAC argue that the production facility at Canton isobsolete and otherwise unable to compete in the United States market. Experiencerefutes that concern, however. Although most of the Canton equipment isbetween ten and fifteen years old, it is functional, currently operating,and well maintained. Only in the past few years has Edmont produced nitrilegloves in Mexico. Prior to that time it maintained its dominant positionin the market by manufacturing its gloves at Canton. Even while manufacturinggloves in Mexico, Edmont continues to manufacture substantial quantitiesof nitrile gloves at Canton_approximately 50 percent of the gloves it soldin the United States in 1988.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Canton also produces unsupported latex and unsupportedneoprene gloves. The purchaser of the facility will acquire the abilityto produce those products as well as unsupported nitrile gloves. Comasec states that the Canton facility has been plagued by labor problemsin recent years. The Canton workforce is highly skilled and trained, however,and there is no reason to believe that it would be any less motivated towork for the new purchaser than it has been for Edmont. Although one cannotpredict the future course of labor relations at Canton, the parties enteredinto a four-year collective bargaining agreement in July 1989. Both thenew purchaser and the union are bound by the terms of the agreement. TheUnited States is unaware of any current labor problems. Latex Glove states a concern that the proposed Final Judgment would precludethe purchaser of Canton from manufacturing green unsupported nitrile gloves.Upon further investigation, the United States has determined that the abilityto produce green gloves is vital to the ability to successfully competefor the sale of nitrile gloves. Consequently, the parties are filing anamended proposed Final Judgment which deletes from section IV.I the rightof Pacific Dunlop to preclude the purchaser or purchasers from manufacturingor selling a green nitrile glove for seven years. Comasec and JOMAC question the ability of the purchaser to compete withoutacquiring a distribution system. PDH and other companies in the industryhave competed in the market primarily through the use of independent marketingrepresentatives, a marketing system similarly available to the purchaserof Canton if it does not have its own distribution system. Moreover, PDHis required to provide the purchaser with the names of Edmont customers,primarily independent distributors, who purchased gloves made at Canton,and to notify those customers that they bought Canton gloves. We wouldexpect those customers who have been satisfied with Canton gloves to bewilling to continue to purchase gloves of comparable quality manufacturedthere.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The URW expresses concern that PDH is not required bythe proposed Final Judgment to provide to the purchaser of the Canton facilitythe exact nitrile formulation used by PDH at Canton. There are severalprovisions in the Judgment that protect the purchaser in that regard, however.Section IV H requires PDH to provide the purchaser with a nitrile formulasufficient to produce gloves of a quality, and at a level of efficiency,``substantially equivalent'' to the gloves currently made at Canton. SectionIV C requires PDH to provide all proprietary information necessary to manufacturenitrile gloves ``to standards of quality at least equal to currently manufacturedproduct.'' IV C also requires PDH to provide the purchaser with a perpetuallicense to use all patents currently used in the production of gloves atCanton, and to provide technical assistance to the purchaser, if requested.These provisions assure that the gloves produced at Canton will be competitivein quality with gloves produced elsewhere. LRC correctly notes that the proposed Final Judgment requires only thatthe purchaser manufacture industrial gloves, not nitrile gloves, but itwould make no economic sense for the purchaser not to produce nitrile gloves.The unsupported nitrile market is reportedly growing at eight percent ayear, and Edmont has been utilizing about 95 percent of the capacity ofthe Canton plant to serve that market.\15\<NOTE/> In any case, it would make no economic sense to convert Canton'snitrile production to latex, since nitrile gloves are more profitable,and the vast majority of latex gloves are manufactured outside the UnitedStates to take advantage of proximity to raw materials and cheaper labor.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Indeed, PDH requested that the proposed Final Judgmentinclude a provision requiring the new owner of the Canton facility to enterinto a contract to sell unsupported nitrile gloves to PDH for a periodof time. The United States rejected that Proposal; such supply agreementsare difficult to administer by means of a judicial decree, and it is vastlypreferable for the new purchaser to be free to negotiate its own termswith customers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Most of the United States production of latex industrialgloves is comprised of premium latex gloves, a stagnant market. Finally, JOMAC notes that PDH may try to increase its Juarez productionof nitrile gloves, thus increasing the supply of such gloves in the U.S.market. That development would not be harmful to competition, however.Indeed, it would be beneficial. b. <T3>Ansell Granet</T3>. Comasec, LRC, and JOMAC also question the abilityof the Purchaser of Ansell Granet to compete in the markets for dippedsupported gloves. As with unsupported nitrile gloves, however, this divestitureof Ansell Granet completely removes the competitive overlap between PDHand Edmont in the affected markets. It was only through this facility thatPDH competed in dipped unsupported gloves. We believe that a purchaserwill be at least as competitive in those markets as PDH was prior to theacquisition. Ansell Granet manufactures a full line of dipped supported and impregnatedgloves for industry. Within this category, Ansell Granet supplies aboutfive percent of the United States market. Products manufactured includegeneral purpose and chemically resistant gloves. Ansell Granet has thecapability of producing short runs, special colors, and other non-standardproduct variations. The Ansell Granet organization is vertically integratedand is capable of doing most of the steps needed for the finished producton its premises. Ansell Granet is a well-established company and shouldbe able to continue to compete in the markets for dipped supported gloves.\17\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ It is true, as Comasec points out, that PDH will be ableto manufacture similar products in Edmont's facilities, but in that eventthe competitive situation will be no worse than it was when those facilitieswere operated by Edmont. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Relevant Product Markets </ITAG>LRC and Playtex comment that unsupported nitrile industrial gloves do notcomprise a separate relevant product market, as set forth in the Complaint.Rather, they contend that the relevant market is comprised of all liquidproof unsupported industrial gloves, including those made of latex andneoprene. LRC claims that in such a market the merger would be unlawful,and that the proposed Final Judgment does not adequately redress such aviolation.The short answer to this contention is that consideration of markets otherthan those that are the subject of the Complaint is beyond the purviewof these proceedings. The APPA provides, in pertinent part:<ITAG tagnum="21">Before entering any consent judgment proposed by the United Statesunder this section, the court shall determine that the entry of such judgmentis in the public interest. For the purpose of such determination, the courtmay consider_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including <T3>termination of alleged violations</T3>, provisions for enforcementand modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternativeremedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing uponthe adequacy of such judgment; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generallyand individuals alleging specific injury from the <T3>violations set forth in the complaint</T3> including considerationof the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of theissues at trial.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(15 U.S.C. 16(e)) (emphasis added.) In <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>BNS, Inc., </T3>858 F.2d 456, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988), the court stated:``[T]he APPA does not authorize a district court to base its public interestdetermination on antitrust concerns in markets other than those allegedin the government's complaint.'' \18\<NOTE/> <T3>Accord, United States </T3>v. <T3>Waste Management, Inc., </T3>1985-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) andpara; 66,651,at p. 63,045 (D.D.C. 1985). Clearly there is no basis in the Act for thecourt to review the decision of the Government to allege, or not to allege,antitrust violations in any given market, as LRC and Playtex would havethis Court do. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ In <T3>BNS, </T3>the court did state that it is appropriate to take into accountin its public interest consideration the effect of the transaction in otherareas of the economy, to the extent those effects resulted from the antitrustviolation in the markets alleged. For example, said the court, in a casealleging a violation in a grain market the court could consider ``the resultingincrease in the price of bread.'' That analogy is not applicable here,however. Unsupported nitrile gloves are not an input for unsupported latexgloves. In this case LRC and Playtex simply urge that the Court rejectthe product market alleged by the Government, an issue that is not properlythe subject of the pub1ic interest determination under the APPA. But further, for the reasons outlined above at section F.1., unsupportednitrile gloves and unsupported latex gloves are clearly in separate productmarkets. While it is true that unsupported nitrile, latex and neoprenegloves have some overlapping uses, there is little, if any, price sensitivityin demand for the three products, and the Government's investigation hasdetermined that a small but significant change in the relative prices ofthe three products would not affect consumers' choices of them. In determining which type of glove to purchase, a consumer's initial concernis the resistant qualities that a particular glove material has to thetype of chemical agent with which the consumer works; manufacturers thusinclude chemical resistance tables in their catalogues. For many chemicals,either latex, nitrile, or neoprene is clearly superior. Where the differencesare not so clear, cost is usually the determining factor. LRC acknowledges that nitrile is substantially more expensive than latex,but asserts that it also is twice as durable, and thus that its value toa customer is virtually identical when nitrile costs twice what latex costs.LRC's assertion that nitrile wears twice as long as latex, offsetting itsgreater cost, is too simplistic, however. The relative durability of thosematerials can vary substantially depending upon the chemical agent involved.Safety is the primary concern of users of these gloves, and the cost ofgloves usually is small compared to other costs. Thus, customers purchasenitrile gloves when they are convinced those gloves are clearly superiorto latex. Otherwise they purchase latex gloves, since latex is substantiallycheaper. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Ability to Exert Market Power </ITAG>LRC and Playtex assert that even assuming that separate industrial gloveproduct markets exist, the acquisition will enable PDH to increase itsmarket power in those individual markets. They contend that PDH will beable to force customers to purchase its full line of products to the exclusionof other glove manufacturers. More specifically, LRC claims that the acquisitionwill enable PDH to engage in unlawful marketing practices. Our investigationdid not produce evidence that would lead to such a conclusion, but in anycase, if PDH were to violate the law at some future time there are adequatemeans for redress of such a violation, short of prohibiting what is nowa lawful merger. PDH's acquisition of Edmont does in fact combine leading positions in twodistinct markets_latex and nitrile_but that fact does not itself make theacquisition anticompetitive. There is every reason to expect that buyerswill continue to purchase both types of gloves on terms that are most advantageousto them, and hence, to consumers. As noted by LRC, currently there is diversityin the buying patterns of distributors, even though Edmont has been ina position to fill most, if not all, of their needs. This condition reflectsthe desire of distributors to maintain relationships with multiple manufacturers,and their willingness to purchase gloves from other sources when thosegloves are competitive in price and of sufficient quality. In sum, there is no significant evidence that PDH's acquisition of Edmontwill give it any greater ability to engage in predatory practices thanEdmont alone possessed, if any. Most telling is the absence of complaintsfrom buyers on this point, and further, if PDH does attempt to engage inpredatory practices, appropriate relief can be sought at that time. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Alternative Remedies Are Not Necessary </ITAG>LRC takes the view that nothing less than a permanent injunction prohibitingPDH's acquisition of Edmont would provide an adequate remedy for the violationalleged in the Complaint. In effect, it argues that <T3>no </T3>settlement of this litigation should be permitted. Acceptanceof that argument would represent an extraordinary restriction on the prosecutorialdiscretion of the United States. It would require this Court and the Departmentof Justice to undertake the substantial costs, risks, and delays of litigatingto final conclusion a case of substantial complexity, despite the Department'sconsidered judgment that an adequate remedy can be obtained without imposingsuch costs on the taxpayers. We are unaware of any instance in which a court has rejected a proposedconsent decree in its entirety in the course of a public interest review.Such a conclusion should not be reached absent a compelling demonstrationof the inadequacy of other forms of relief, and no such demonstration hasbeen made here. LRC further suggests that short of an outright injunction barring the acquisition,there are alternatives that should be included in the Final Judgment. Comasecalso offers suggested modifications. Both believe PDH should not be permittedto market certain brand name products. Three of the five products identifiedby LRC, Ansell Conform (unsupported latex), Ansell 224 (unsupported neoprene-latexblend), and Edmont True-Touch (disposable vinyl), and both products identifiedby Comasec, Edmont Neotek (unsupported neoprene) and Edmont Puretek (unsupportedlatex), are not in product markets that are identified in the Complaint.There is no basis for requiring PDH to divest products not in product marketscharged in the Complaint. The two remaining products that LRC identifies, Edmont's Sol-vex and PDH'sChallenger, are both unsupported nitrile glove products. Requiring thedivestiture of one of them is not necessary to preserve competition. Mostnitrile glove purchases are made by relatively large, sophisticated distributors,who are likely to be willing to purchase a new product of satisfactoryquality and price. The proposed Final Judgment, as amended, will ensurethat the purchaser of the Canton plant can produce unsupported nitrilegloves comparable in quality to Edmont, the industry leader. The purchaserwill be producing gloves at a facility at which Edmont currently producesa substantial quantity of the gloves it sells. Consequently, PDH's maintenanceof both the Sol-vex and Challenger brand names does not appear to giveit an unfair market advantage. LRC also suggests that Edmont's unsupported nitrile plant in Juarez, Mexicoshould be divested rather than the Canton facility. Such a divestitureis unnecessary to correct the competitive problem caused by the acquisitionin the unsupported nitrile glove market. As noted above, the new operatorof Edmont's Canton facility will occupy a position in that market at leastas significant, and probably more so, as that formerly held by PDH. Thereis no need for it to replace Edmont as a competitor.Comasec suggests that the proposed Final Judgment be amended to prohibitPDH from competing against the purchaser or purchasers of Ansell Granetand the Canton facility for at least two years, and to restrain it fromincreasing production of unsupported nitrile gloves at Edmont's Juarezplant or its own plant in Redditch. Such a non-competition requirementwould be unworkable as well as undesirable. It would be impossible to preventcompetition between PDH and the purchasers of the divested assets withoutsimultaneously inhibiting PDH's ability to compete with other competitors,and such a restraint would deprive customers of the benefits of competition.Comasec's suggestion that PDH be restrained from increasing productionof unsupported nitrile gloves at the Juarez and Redditch plants, wouldalso be harmful to competition, and is not necessary to enable the purchaserof the Canton plant to establish itself in the nitrile market.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ LRC further suggests that the proposed divestitures berequired as a precondition to the acquisition. This cannot be done sincethe acquisition has already occurred. The proposed Final Judgment, as amended,requires PDH to maintain the businesses it has agreed to divest separatelyfrom its other operations, and PDH has agreed to be bound by the proposedFinal Judgment, as amended, pending its entry by the Court. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Determinative Documents </ITAG>LRC notes that the Government identified no determinative documents inthe Competitive Impact Statement filed with the Court and published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. There were no documents relied upon by the UnitedStates that directly caused it to enter into the proposed Final Judgment,as amended. <ITAG tagnum="81">III </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the Competitive Impact Statement and thisResponse, the Court should find, after publication of this Response inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, that the proposed Final Judgment, as amended,represents a reasonable exercise of the Department of Justice's antitrustenforcement discretion, is in the Public interest, and should be entered.<ITAG tagnum="21">Respectfully submitted, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Richard S.

Pacific Dunlop HoldingsInc., Becton, Dickinson and Company; and Edmont, Inc., Defendants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Final Judgment</ITAG>Dear Mr. Hughes: This letter is in response to the Notice on this subjectwhich appeared in the Federal Register/Volume 54, No. 121/Monday, June26, 1989.The United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum andamp; Plastic Workers of America (URW)is an international labor union headquartered in Akron, Ohio. The URW isaffiliated with the AFL-CIO, the Canadian Labour Congress and the InternationalFederation of Chemical, Energy and General Workers Unions. We representapproximately 120,000 workers in the United States and Canada.URW Local Union No. 688 represents the hourly employees at Edmont's Canton,Ohio plant, one of the facilities to be divested under terms of the FinalJudgment. These employees stand to be directly impacted by whatever finaldecision is made in this antitrust proceeding and their interests shouldbe fully considered in the making of that decision.Upon careful reading of the Complaint, the Final Judgment and the CompetitiveImpact Statement, we feel there are some issues that have not been adequatelyaddressed. As a labor union, our primary concern is that our members havegood secure jobs with decent pay and benefits. We are opposed to anythingthat threatens our members' livelihoods.As you know, the Final Judgment calls for a number of safeguards in orderto try to ensure that the divestiture of the Canton facility will not havean adverse impact and that the facility will be given a chance to continueas a viable operation. We appreciate the efforts of the Court and the JusticeDepartment in that direction.If the Canton facility should be unable to remain a viable operation andbe forced to close, the result would be to decrease competition in themarket_the direct opposite of the result intended and desired.We are also concerned about what happens if sale of the Canton facilityis not made within a year. The Judgment is not clear on this point.During efforts to sell the Canton plant, the Judgment requires PacificDunlop to operate the plant as a going business and to use all reasonableefforts to maintain the Canton plant as a viable and active competitor.We would submit that the motivation and thus the effort referred to inthe preceding sentence might very well mean different things to an ownerwith a future to work toward and an owner who is marking time while tryingto sell the business. Future competitiveness and thus the future of theemployees could easily be affected.The Judgment also requires Pacific Dunlop to supply a purchaser of theCanton facility a nitrile formulation that will enable the production ofgloves of a quality, manufacturing efficiency and yield substantially equivalentto that currently achieved at the Canton facility. It would seem to bein the interest of Pacific Dunlop to ensure that ``substantially equivalent''means not quite as good as what the Canton facility currently achieves.That could be detrimental to the purchaser and the employees.In the interest of both the well-being of the employees at the Canton facilityand maintaining competition in the nitrile glove industry, we believe thesequestions need more thorough examination and we would urge the AntitrustDivision to withdraw its consent pending a resolution to the questionswe have raised in these comments.Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.<ITAG tagnum="21"> Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steve Clem,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Research andamp; International Affairs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Exhibit D</ITAG>Hand Delivered<ITAG tagnum="16">John J.

Pacific Dunlop Holdings, Inc., BectonDickinson and Company, and Edmont, Inc. (E.D. Pa. Civil No. 89-4522)</ITAG>Dear Mr. Hughes: We represent LRC-Surety Products, Inc., a competitor ofPDH and Edmont in liquidproof unsupported industrial gloves. In responseto the notice in the June 26, 1989 issued of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 26854), this letter explains our viewthat the proposed settlement of this case is not in the public interestbecause(1) It does not provide adequate relief from the antitrust violations chargedin the complaint_the proposed divestitures are unlikely to be achieved,and even if affected, they would be competitively meaningless;(2) It ignores the market for unsupported industrial gloves as a whole,including unsupported latex gloves, which PDH will dominate if the settlementproceeds; and(3) It permits PDH to enhance its current market power in latex and toextend it into other related markets.The proposed acquisition will result in a substantial reduction of competitionin the U.S. Superficially, such a reduction in competition in the U.S.might seem to benefit those few suppliers who are left (though it clearlydisserves the consumer, as the complaint recognizes). Indeed, you may alreadyhave observed that the major distributors, who themselves have acquiredcompetitors in recent years, welcome further concentration at the supplylevel. Why then should LRC-Surety complain about a concentration-increasingmerger of its to largest competitors?The answer is that LRC-Surety's business interest in this matter coincideswith consumer interests. The geographic market involved here is worldwide.If the settlement is approved, the world's largest seller of unsupportedlatex gloves will join the world's largest seller of unsupported nitrilegloves. The acquisition will bring together the worldwide number one andnumber two in industrial gloves in a combination that will outstrip itsnext nearest competitor by nearly three-to-one in worldwide gross sales.PDH will control an agglomeration of industry-leading trademarks, state-of-the-artproduction facilities, technical expertise and pervasive distribution networksthat will dominate industrial gloves in virtually every country where thosegloves are sold.Being among the few survivors in a global market so completely dominatedby PDH is not an attractive prospect for LRC-Surety, and it thus opposesthe merger as fervently as would any sophisticated, cost-conscious consumer.At all events, irrespective of our admitted business interest in the matter,I trust that our comments will be judged on their merts.We think the proposed settlement fails the APPA's public interest testin at least three ways.<ITAG tagnum="26">1. The ``relief'' proposed in the settlement will not prevent, oreven reduce, the merger's illegal impact.</ITAG>The complaint correctly charges that the proposed merger will eliminateactual and potential competition in U.S. markets for industrial gloves,in clear violation of Section 7. But the settlement will do nothing tocure the illegalities the complaint identifies; nor will it stem the eliminationof competition in unsupported latex gloves, or in unsupported gloves asa whole, which the government has completely overlooked (<T3>see</T3> pp. 6-8 below). The proposed divestitures won't even touchthe problem of enhanced market power that will enable PDH to raise or lowerprices at will in the relevant markets without regard to competitive pressures.A. It is no cure for the anticompetitive consequences in unsupported nitrilegloves when PDH gets to keep Edmont's state-of-the-art manufacturing plantin Juarez, Mexico, and its dominate Sol-Vex brand, and has only to divesta 60-year old, thoroughly obsolete plant in Canton, Ohio.The settlement merely requires PDH to do something it would have done anyway.Before it transferred its main nitrile production from Ohio to Mexico,Edmont was posting a wholesale price of $10.00 per dozen for its Sol-Vexnitrile glove. Since the move the wholesale price has dropped to $8.70per dozen. Based on its own production costs at its competing facilityin Carrollton, Ohio, LRC-Surety estimates Edmont's Canton cost at closeto $8.00. But we estimate Edmont's cost in Mexico at about $5.00 per dozen,which permits an $8.70 wholesale price. It defies belief that PDH wouldcontinue to operate the Canton plant after the merger, irrespective ofthe proposed settlement.No one can compete out of obsolete facilities with that kind of costs disparity.No rational competitor would want the Canton facility, and no new entrantwould take it even temporarily to get a ``foothold,'' since the high barriersto entry go far beyond production economics (Compl. andpara; 18). Withoutan established distributor network and the trademarks excluded from thesettlement, even a facility as cost-efficient as Juarez is at best of marginalvalue to a potential competitive entrant.Thus, it is unrealistic to expect, as predicted in the Competitive ImpactStatement, that the settlement will result in divestiture of the Cantonfacility or, if divested, that it will be to a purchaser who ``will <T3>compete effectively</T3> in the United States market for <T3>unsupported nitrile gloves,</T3> and will supplant the loss of PDHin this market'' (CIS at 8) (emphasis added). The proposed Final Judgmentitself says only that the divestiture shall be to a purchaser who can operatethe plant ``as [a] <T3>viable,</T3> ongoing business engaged in the production of <T3>industrial</T3> gloves'' (Judgment, andpara; IV, E). There is no requirementthat the plant continue to produce nitrile gloves or any other kind ofunsupported gloves or that the purchaser be able to compete <T3>effectively</T3> as to those products.Edmont's move to Mexico further belies the government's promise to preserveeffective competition. No one can ``compete effectively'' out of the obsoletefacility in Canton, not even Edmont as shown by its move to Mexico. Norwill there be any ``loss of PDH in this market'' (CIS at 8). To the contrary,PDH will forcefully be in the market, with all its financial muscle, itsdistributor relationships, its technical and marketing infrastructure,but now joined with Edmont to build upon, facilitate and enhance the marketpower of both parties.B. The divestiture of Ansell Granet does not eliminate the problems ofPDH's enhanced market power and acquisition of dominance in new markets.The Granet supported glove operation, acquired by PDH in 1987, is almostas big a white elephant as Edmont's Canton plant. Even before the PDH acquisition,Granet was a small player in supported industrial gloves, accounting atmost for about 5 percent in the U.S. against Edmont's nearly 40 percent.After PDH brought Granet, the word in the industry was that Granet beganto lose what market share it had. There is a real question whether PDHdevoted any significant resources to Granet once the Edmont merger becamea possibility. (For example, PDH apparently never acquired the buildingin which the Granet plant is housed, ostensibly for environmental reasons;it is still owned by Granet's prior owner, Wilson Granet Miller, Inc.).Granet has such a small place in the industrial glove industry that itoffers little incentive to anyone else to ``fully replace it,'' despitethe promise in the Competitive Impact Statement (at 9). Meanwhile, PDH'sacquisition of Edmont would now make it the dominant force in supported,as well as unsupported, industrial gloves. It no longer needs Granet and,had there been no government intervention, PDH would probably have terminatedits operations or folded them into Edmont.The Granet divestiture proposal gives a cynical message to antitrust counselors_ifyour client wants to become the dominant market force through an acquisition,advise it to acquire a ``dog'' first; then have your client agree to divestthe ``dog'' to clear the way for the really anticompetitive merger.<ITAG tagnum="26">2. The settlement ignores unsupported latex gloves and misses altogetherthe merger's effect on the market for liquidproof unsupported industrialgloves.</ITAG>PDH and Edmont somehow have succeeded in arguing gerrymandered markets.In unsupported gloves, the complaint charges defendants only with foreclosureof an alleged market limited to nitrile gloves. To be sure, Edmont hasthe dominant nitrile brands, and adding in PDH's smaller but still significantcompeting products, the combination is indeed illegally preemptive.But as a matter of economic reality, the product market is broader thanjust unsupported nitrile. It includes gloves made from latex (natural rubber),where PDH is dominant. Latex and nitrile unsupported gloves compete directly,and can be produced on the same equipment in the same plants. There iscross-elasticity both at the production level and at the consumption level.Latex is generally cheaper but also less durable than nitrile. At the pointwhere the price of nitrile falls or latex rises so that the ratio is lessthan 2 to 1, the products are virtually interchangeable. Just ask the consumers_the food processors, electronics manufacturers,chemical producers and other businesses who buy these gloves in massiveguantities. Look at Edmont's own advertising and promotion. Its explicitmarket strategy is to offer its industry-leading Sol-Vex nitrile glovesas a replacement for latex. And it's working. End-users have increasinglyswitched from latex to nitrile (or occasionally back again) for the sameglove applications, based on a single calculus of product life versus comparativecosts. To ignore latex in this proposed settlement is to ignore the teachingsof the <T3>Cellophane</T3> case, the wellspring of the law of market definition.If the settlement proceeds, the dominant latex producer, PDH, will joinforces with Edmont to acquire overwhelming dominance in the U.S. marketfor liquidproof unsupported industrial gloves. The settlement would resultin an increase in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by at least 900 points,to 1850. The next closest competitor, Pioneer would be at 225. (LRC-Surety,number four in the market, is at 36). The Department's Merger Guidelinesshould not be ignored (Guidelines, andSection; 3.11(c) at II-135).<ITAG tagnum="26">3. The settlement enables PDH to extend its dominance in latex glovesinto related markets.</ITAG>Even if unsupported latex gloves are treated as a separate market fromunsupported nitrile gloves (as the government has apparently done), thesettlement still furthers a disturbingly anticompetitive combination. Itenables PDH, dominant in unsupported latex, to extend its power into unsupportednitrile, as well as into the four lines of supported gloves identifiedin the complaint. It opens the way for conduct such as ``full line forcing,''by which PDH can use its illegal dominance in unsupported lines to achievesimilar dominance in supported lines. <T3>See Smith-Kline v. Eli Lilly andamp; Co.,</T3> 575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir.),<T3>cert. denied,</T3> 459 U.S. 838 (1978).There is no doubting that such dominance will occur as to both unsupportedlatex and nitrile, even viewed separately. Measured in dollars, PDH's marketshare of unsupported latex is currently 38.4%, Edmont's 8.9%. The HHI forPDH following the proposed settlement would be 2237, an increase of over760 points. In unsupported nitrile, Edmont's market share in dollars iscurrently 40%, PDH's 4.4%. The resulting combined HHI would be 1971, anincrease of 371 points.Thus, even accepting the government's approach to market definition, theincrease in concentration in <T3>both</T3> latex and nitrile is improper under the Merger Guidelines.The increase in latex, ignored by the government, is even <T3>worse</T3> than in nitrile, which the government has attacked as illegal.The proposed settlement enables PDH to extend its dominance into areas,such as unsupported nitrile where it has not previously played a majorrole. Distributors of liquidproof unsupported industrial gloves maintainstocks of both latex and nitrile products. As long as PDH and Edmont competewith each other, distributors and consumers benefit from competitive pricingand product choice. Suppliers such as LRC-Surety can still find a marketniche with the distributors for their products.But if PDH acquires Edmont, it can offer the leading brands in both latexand nitrile. And Edmont brings market power in supported gloves_nitrile,PVC, neoprene and latex_as stated in the complaint. PDH can then offerdiscounts based on tied-together product lines, the classic ``if you wantour best price on x, you've got to buy y and z as well'' condemned in <T3>Smith-Kline.</T3>The dangers of this bundling and leveraging, <T3>i.e.</T3> ``full line forcing,'' are increased by the structure ofthe industrial glove industry. As the government has correctly observed(Complaint, andpara; 18), industrial glove producers must have substantialdistributor relationships to compete effectively in the U.S. Distributorslink the supplier and the consuming public. Edmont in particular has builta large, disciplined distributorship network that reaches every cornerof the nation.To date, no supplier (including PDH and Edmont) has had the ability toproduce every line of industrial gloves. This has encouraged diversityin the buying patterns of distributors, even the most disciplined Edmontdistributors, and enhanced competition. But now, the proposed settlementwill allow PDH to add Edmont's dominance in nitrile to its own market powerin latex, as well as to acquire dominance in at least four distinct marketsfor supported gloves. Such power enhancement has a simple description inantitrust law_monopolization and attempt to monopolize.

Pacific Dunlop Holdings Inc.;Becton, Dickinson and Company; and Edmont, Inc. (E.D. Pa, No. 89-4522,Filed June 16, 1989)</ITAG> Dear Mr. Hughes: We submit this letter pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Paragraph16(d) as a formal written comment on the proposed consent judgment relatingto the above-reference matter. Comasec, Inc. produces dipped supportedgloves at its plant in Enfield, Connecticut and has considerable familiaritywith the sale and manufacture of various types of industrial gloves inthe United States. Comasec International, S.A., its parent company, isthe second largest producer of synthetic industrial gloves in the world. In this action, the United States government challenges the proposed acquisitionof the United States assets of Edmont, Inc. by Pacific Dunlop Holdings,Inc. as a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Paragraph18. To eliminate the competitive threat posed by the acquisition, the governmentproposes to require PDH to divest itself of its Ansell Granet, Inc. plantin North Carolina and of Edmont's manufacturing facility in Canton, Ohio.The competitive Impact Statement explains that an acceptable purchaserof the Ansell Granet plant will fully replace PDH as a competitor in themarket for liquid dipped supported gloves and that an acceptable purchaserof the Canton facility will replace PDH as a competitor in the market forunsupported nitrile gloves. Unfortunately, the consent judgment submitted in this matter will failto accomplish both of the government's objectives. PDH acquired the Granet plant in North Carolina through its subsidiaryAnsell, Inc. several years ago. Utilizing the information thus obtainedrelating to customer identity, buying trends and prices, PDH markets Granetproducts through the Ansell distribution network, no longer through anindependent sales force. Divestiture of this plant does not eliminate PDAafter the Edmont acquisition from the liquid-proof dipped supported glovemarket as the government surmises, because PDH will continue selling theproducts formerly known as Granet to former Granet customers and compensatefor any shortfall in production by increasing output at the newly acquiredEdmont facilities in Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana and Canada. This allthe more so since major products in the dipped supported gloves markettend to overlap significantly across the various manufacturer ranges. There is not so much proprietary technology or patent protection in makingthe products per se, as in achieving low cost position, constant high qualityand market recognition of a specific item within a widely produced type. In order to ``fully replace'' PDH as a competitor in this market, theprospective purchaser must be given the Ansell Granet customer lists accompaniedby a non-compete agreement from PDH of at least two years in duration.Even then, the purchaser would have to reconstruct the Granet marketingnetwork and re-establish its name recognition in order to compete effectively. The Edmont facility in Canton, Ohio suffers similar disabilities and furtherhas been plagued with labor problems in recent years. PDH production requirementswill remain largely unaffected by the proposed divestiture since any shortfallwill be met by increased output at the Edmont plants in Juarez, Mexicoand Bristol, UK K., both of which are currently operating below capacity.To preserve the present level of competition in the unsupported nitrileglove market PDH must be required to enter into a non-compete agreementwith the prospective purchaser coupled with a limitation on productionincreases at the Juarez and Bristol plants for a minimum two-year period.Additionally, PDH must refrain from marketing other gloves currently producedin Canton, including the unsupported neoprene and natural rubber glovesknown respectively as Neotek and Puretek. Although these product linescomprise a relatively minor part of the unsupported industrial glove market,their unavailability from PDH/Edmont should facilitate transfer of currentcustomers of Canton to the purchaser of the facility. Unless modified as suggested above, the divestiture ordered by the judgmentoffers prospective purchasers two older production facilities with no marketshare, no brand name recognition, no sales organization and no establishedmanagement team. Without the benefit of the intangibles required to makethe operations competitive, purchasers would merely be accommodating PDHby taking unnecessary equipment off its hands. It would be cheaper andsimpler to organize an independent company for entry into these segmentsof the industrial glove market. We trust these comments will assist you in evaluating the future efficacyof the proposed consent judgment and the impact of its entry upon the public.Thank you for your consideration.<ITAG tagnum="21">   Very truly yours, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">COMASEC, INC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Francis T.

This would lead me to believe that the Canton facility is by it'svery nature antiquated and noncompetitive.The divestiture of Ansell Granet, Inc. would, in my opinion, result inthe transfer of the production at the Snow Hill facility to other Edmontfacilities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Ansell has throughit's operation of Granet obviously obtained access to all Granet's marketinginformation and this is certainly the big plus when it comes to a companythat has more than adequate production facilities. The divestiture of old,and possibly obsolete, facilities or equipment serves no practical purposeunless there is a procedure to prevent ``DHL'' from calling on or sellingany of the accounts that were part of Ansell Granet's, Inc. marketing program.I do not have access to Edmont's production information, the above commentsare intended to prompt further investigation and possibly a better answerto the question at hand.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Respectfully,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">W.J.

Rosenberg, Attorney</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Reference: 60-2381-0001, </ITAG><T3>United States v. Pacific Dunlop</T3>Dear Mr. Rosenberg: Thank you very much for sending me a copy of the proposedfinal judgment from the subject case. Our company may be interested inacquiring the Canton facility and Ansell Granet and have expressed thatinterest directly to Pacific Dunlop. However, in reviewing the terms ofthe final judgment there are several questions which come to mind.Under sections IV.B and IV.C, we understand that the divestiture of theCanton facility excludes nitrile formulations. However, section C statesthat the purchaser of the Canton facility will be provided with proprietaryinformation to manufacture each type of industrial glove product producedat Canton since 1987. To our knowledge, this would include nitrile industrialgloves for which a nitrile formulation would be required. Please explainthis apparent discrepancy.We have taken note of Section H which provides that Pacific Dunlop willsupply the purchaser with a nitrile formulation to make gloves of a quality,manufacturing efficiency, and yield substantially equivalent to those manufacturedby Edmont at Canton but it is our belief that those three criteria wouldin fact require that the gloves be made using the nitrile formulation currentlyused by Edmont at the Canton facility.Section I includes a prohibition from the manufacture or sale of a greennitrile glove for seven years following the date of divestiture. The worldmarket for nitrile gloves has basically standardized on a green color andgloves of any other color account for a minimal percentage of both theAmerican market and world market for nitrile gloves. All other Americanproducers of nitrile gloves including our company use the green color.There acre, since our company has been manufacturing green nitrile gloves,we could not consider the acquisition of the Canton facility without removalof the prohibition from selling a green nitrile glove for seven years.Although we have not yet seen financial statements relating to the EdmontCanton facility or Ansell Granet, we are concerned about our ability toobtain sufficient financing to acquire these assets as well as supply sufficientworking capital to maintain and expand these businesses on an ongoing basis.Therefore, with reference to section VII, we would appreciate knowing underwhat conditions the United States, as plaintiff, would consent to defendantsfinancing any part of a proposed purchase.Thank you again for your consideration and assistance. We look forwardto hearing from you soon.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard A.

(``Edmont'')by Pacific Dunlop Holdings Inc. We recently were informed of the proposedsettlement reached by the parties to the acquisition and the Departmentof Justice, and we wanted to bring to your attention our views.Playtex is a small producer of unsupported neoprene latex gloves, with1988 sales of approximately $2.5 million. The gloves manufactured by Playtexare used interchangeably with other unsupported gloves, including unsupportednitrile gloves and unsupported latex gloves, and with some supported neoprenegloves. For example, photo processors use both unsupported neoprene latexgloves and unsupported nitrile gloves. The same is true of various electronicsmanufacturers, such as makers of computer micro-chips, and other manufacturerswhose processes include handling acids. Manufacturers of fiber optic cable,who use neoprene latex gloves, could also use other gloves which are cutresistant, such as nitrile gloves in response to a price difference amongvarious types of cut resistant gloves. We believe Edmont is the dominantproducer in the U.S. market for unsupported gloves while Pacific Dunlop'ssubsidiary, Ansell Granet, is the third largest producer. The proposedcombination, even allowing for the divestitures proposed by the settlementagreement, will be the dominant firm in the manufacture and sale of unsupportedgloves.The proposed combination will also result in a dominant producer of industrialgloves, which includes both supported and unsupported gloves. Ansell willpossess a full line of industrial gloves, which it currently does not possess.This is important because of the means of distribution used in the industrialglove market. Virtually all industrial gloves are sold by producers todistributors, who make the actual sales to end users. We believe that approximately95% of industrial gloves are sold through such distributors. One hundredpercent of Playtex's industrial glove production is sold through distributors.Such distributors are interested in carrying a full line of industrialgloves, and the proposed combination of Edmont and Pacific Dunlop willallow Edmont and Pacific Dunlop to offer a full line of products to suchdistributors. This could easily result in small producers with limitedproduct lines, such as Playtex, being squeezed out of the only access tothe market.The pricing plan already adopted by Edmont suggests that such foreclosureis a distinct possibility. Edmont offers discounts for larger orders. Forexample, under its ``Alpha'' pricing plan, distributors are rewarded withlarger discounts for the purchase of $40,000 of a combination of industrialgloves and rain suits. By offering discounts for large orders coveringall types of industrial gloves, Edmont will be able to use its market powerto prevent producers with limited lines and limited sales of industrialgloves, such as Playtex, from sales to distributors, effectively foreclosingsuch producers from reaching the consumers of industrial gloves.In sum, we believe that further investigation is required before the proposedsettlement is approved. We believe that your Department should investigatefurther the implications of Ansell possessing a full line of products inlight of the only existing means of distribution in this industry.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Very truly yours, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ronald B.
