The flight restriction order, which is indefinite in length, willallow the choppers ``to fly search-and-rescue missions but restrictall other flying until a thorough investigation has beencompleted,'' the Air Force said.   ``Once the command can assure adequate flight safety, the fleetwill be returned to full operational status.''   The restrictions affect 33 H-3s assigned to active duty Air Forceunits and 27 assigned to the Air National Guard or Air ForceReserve, the service said.   The order follows a crash last Sunday night in the Arizona desertin which 15 servicemen were killed. On Tuesday, another H-3 crashedin the ocean off the coast of Japan while on a routinesearch-and-rescue training mission, killing three.   The Air Force has said it has no evidence suggesting the twocrashes were caused by the same problem. The precautionary groundingorder was issued, however, because accidents with the H-3 are fairlyunusual, the service added.   In the past six years, there have been only four major accidentswith the H-3.   The H-3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s andearly 1960s and used extensively in Vietnam. Nicknamed the ``JollyGreen Giant,'' the helicopter is still flown by the Navy and CoastGuard in addition to the Air Force.   The Navy said Friday it was aware of the Air Force's action, buthad not issued any similar grounding order.   Earlier this month, the Air Force temporarily grounded all of itsH-3s for a one-time inspection of the main rotor head shaft nut, ahuge nut that holds the rotor blade assembly to the main engineshaft.   That grounding was ordered after the Air Force said it haddiscovered that defective nuts had been received from a spare partscontractor. The Air Force said both of the helicopters that crashedthis week had undergone those mandatory inspections and were flyingwith good shaft nuts.</TEXT></DOC>
