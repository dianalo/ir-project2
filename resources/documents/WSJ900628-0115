Yesterday, hundreds of AIDS activists shouting &quot;Shame,shame&quot; demonstrated at NIH's Bethesda, Md., campus to demandmuch higher funding for research into AIDS and relateddiseases.</LP><TEXT>   The protests reflect a host of fiscal and politicalproblems at NIH that threaten to blunt its edge as theworld's leading medical research organization. Wideningbudget demands are limiting its ability to fund qualifiedresearch projects, and below-market salaries are making ithard to retain bright young scientists. Meantime, the Bushadministration's anti-abortion politics forced out the NIH'sdirector last July, and fears that politics, not science,will shape future research priorities have made it tough torecruit a replacement.   &quot;This is happening at the worst time,&quot; says EdwardSchneider, a gerontologist at the University of SouthernCalifornia. &quot;The Japanese have targeted biomedical researchbecause they know that the spinoff for pharmaceuticals isenormous,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't have that many fields in whichwe are really ahead of the Japanese and the West Europeans,&quot;and it would be tragic to squander that lead, Dr. Schneidersays.   NIH pays senior research physicians about 50% less thanthey could make at universities or in industry. As a result,the NIH has 28% fewer senior researchers than a decade agoand hasn't been able to hire a single senior researcher fromoutside the government to run a lab. All of NIH'sneurosurgeons have left for higher-paying jobs, forcing theagency to contract out operations to local medical schools.&quot;The NIH brain drain is a national tragedy,&quot; says Rep. SilvioConte, a Massachusetts Republican. &quot;Soon NIH will mean NobodyIs Here.&quot;   Although NIH's annual budget has more than doubled to $7.6billion in the past decade, much of the new money has gonetoward AIDS research, an ambitious project to map the humangenetic system and compliance with a new law to protectanimals used in research. Overall, NIH, which supportsscience in universities across the country, can fund only 25%of projects approved as justified by NIH peer review groups,down from 40% in 1980. &quot;A lot of good ideas are goingunfunded,&quot; says John Sherman, executive vice president of theAssociation of American Medical Colleges.   The Alliance for Aging Research, a group established toimprove the health of the elderly, says budget restraints arepreventing the National Institute on Aging from fundingpromising projects that could lead to new therapies forosteoporosis and ways to improve balance, both of which couldhelp reduce broken bones suffered from falls. The NationalInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has alist of 18 clinical trials it can't fund to study such issuesas the treatment of hypertension renal disease in blacks andthe role of diet and exercise in the treatment of noninsulindependent diabetes.   The AIDS demonstrators yesterday demanded twice as muchmoney for NIH to pursue speedier development of newtreatments for AIDS and a broader search for treatments forcancer and dozens of other diseases that strike people withAIDS. But Anthony Fauci, the director of the NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which conductsAIDS research, warned that the demonstrations could backfire.&quot;I think there may ultimately be a backlash. People arethinking that we're doing too much for AIDS relative to otherdiseases. This could undermine their efforts.&quot;   Congress and the administration are studying ways tostrengthen NIH, but the immediate challenge is to find aprominent scientist to head the research center. Last summerthe Bush administration removed NIH Director James Wyngaardenafter seven years on the job. Dr. Wyngaarden differed withthe administration on abortion and research involving fetaltissue transplants that could lead to treatments for suchdegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.   The administration has blocked federal funding of thisresearch out of fear that success could boost the demand foraborted fetuses. &quot;To ban areas of investigation for politicalreasons is regrettable,&quot; says David Korn, dean of theStanford University Medical School. &quot;It's an area of greatpromise that essentially is obliterated from the Americanrepertoire.&quot; Rep. Ted Weiss, a New York Democrat who ischairman of the House panel that oversees NIH, says theremoval of Dr. Wyngaarden contributed to a &quot;sense thatpolitics rather than science drives health research.&quot;   But the biggest problem arose last fall, when a WhiteHouse official queried candidates for the NIH job about theirviews on abortion and fetal tissue research. Word immediatelycirculated that the administration was imposing anideological litmus test, and several candidates rejected thepost. Dr. Schneider blames the administration's inability tofill the NIH job on &quot;the whole abortion issue.&quot;   Even Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivanconcedes that the administration's handling of the initialsearch &quot;has frankly been an embarrassment.&quot; Others areharsher. &quot;The NIH has suffered a severe and needless setbackbecause of politics and ideology entering into who should bedirector,&quot; complains Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat whoheads the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that fundsNIH.   Dr. Sullivan has tried to repair the damage. After talksat the White House, he announced last fall that &quot;standards ofscientific and administrative excellence and leadership,&quot; notpolitics, would prevail in the selection process. He alsoappointed an advisory committee to suggest ways to make theNIH post more attractive.   The panel, expected to issue its report soon, willrecommend giving the NIH director a fixed six-year term toinsulate the post from political pressure, new authority totarget funds on areas where breakthroughs appear imminent,greater influence over policy, a reduction in red tape and amuch higher salary. Dr. Sullivan hopes the prospect of suchchanges will make finding an NIH chief easier when he resumesthe search in a few weeks.   Congress is likely to support these changes. Rep. Conteand Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts haveintroduced a bill to raise NIH salaries to make them morecompetitive. Currently, the head of NIH makes about $100,000,about half of what medical school department heads earn. Thebill, which has growing support in both the House and theSenate, also would raise starting salaries for doctors at NIHto $60,000 from $37,000. Sen. Harkin notes that at a timewhen doctors leave medical school with tuition debtsaveraging $42,000, many can't afford to choose research overmedical practice.   In recent years, Congress has treated NIH generously,generally adding several hundred million dollars to theadministration's budget request. The Bush administrationrequested $7.93 billion for NIH in fiscal year 1991, whichstarts Oct. 1, or $350 million more than in the current year.But Congress seems headed toward a $750 million increase.Still, this is less than the $1.65 billion increase that theresearch community wants.   Rep. Conte, who is the ranking minority member on theHouse Appropriations Committee, faults the administration forslighting NIH and medical research. During a recent budgetmeeting at the White House, he says he told President Bushthat &quot;you've got to do something at NIH.&quot; The response? &quot;Hejust shook his head,&quot; Rep. Conte says. &quot;The meeting ended,and they threw me out.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE NEUROSURGERY DEPARTMENT of the National Institutes ofHealth continues to operate, NIH says. Based onmisinformation provided by NIH, a story in the May 22 editionincorrectly reported that NIH no longer performsneurosurgery.   (WSJ June 28, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
