Although technology advances are not restricted to any particulararea or type of fuel, there now seems to be growing evidence that mostprobably the balance will tilt substantially in favour of natural gas.This paper is an attempt to account for the impact of present and futuretechnical changes on the longer term European primary energy mix.</TEXT></DOC>
