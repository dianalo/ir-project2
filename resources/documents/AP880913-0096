Effort for Anderson's Release</HEAD><DATELINE>BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of America's longest-heldhostage in Lebanon says she is pushing for a United Nationsresolution condemning international kidnapping by extremist groups.   Peggy Say said during a news conference Monday that her brotherTerry Anderson will celebrate his 41st birthday Oct. 27, and shewould like to see the resolution passed on that date.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by a pro-Iranian group inMoslem West Beirut.   Say said she and the Journalists' Committee to Free TerryAnderson are also attempting to arrange an appearance by formerFrench hostages on the ``Donahue'' television talk show.   Say said she has deliberately been quiet in recent months sincemoving from Batavia to Kentucky, hoping that the lack of mediaattention might bear some positive developments in her brother'srelease.   ``I have to believe the end is near,'' Say said. ``It could be alogical assumption that he could be here by the end of the year.''Prospects appear more promising because of negotiations to end thewar between Iran and Iraq, she said.   After his release by the Islamic Jihad earleir this year, Frenchnational Marcel Fontaine met with Say and told her of her brother'scondition. That meeting produced the last reliable informationabout Anderson, Say said.   Say said she believes the Reagan administration has negotiatedvigorously for the release of other American hostages _ such asduring the hijacking of the TWA jetliner to Beirut in 1985 _ butnot for Anderson.   ``I don't see the administration doing anything now,'' she said.``What we're being told is to devalue these hostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
