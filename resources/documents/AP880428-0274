Shortly after his top trade negotiator repeated Reagan's plan toveto the just-passed trade legislation, the president was askedwhat quarrel he had with the worker-notification provision.   ``As an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matterthat belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unionsand the people,'' the president said. Reagan was questioned as hegreeted Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for a private lunch.   Reagan is a former president of the Screen Actors Guild.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said earlier thatReagan would veto the massive trade bill but congressionalDemocrats called on the president to ``rethink his position'' andsign the measure.   ``This bill isn't dead yet,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters today. ``The ball is in the WhiteHouse court. If there is a demise of this bill it will occur at theWhite House, not here.''   House officials said it would be next week before the 1,000-pagebill could be put into proper form and delivered to the WhiteHouse. Reagan would then have 10 days to either sign it or veto it.   The bill would increase the power of the U.S. traderepresentative to act against other countries that use unfair tradepractices, make it easier to curb imports, repeal the windfallprofits tax on oil companies, and increase agricultural subsidies.   Yeutter said Reagan will veto the bill because of thecontroversial plant-closing provision. He urged that the Senateeliminate that provision ``very quickly.''   ``We need a trade bill this year,'' Yeutter said on NBC-TV's``Today'' program.   ``There are a lot of good things in that legislation, so if acouple of necessary corrections are made and the bill comes back,I'm really quite confident the president would sign it,'' Yeuttersaid in another interview on ``CBS This Morning.''   Byrd, however, said the Senate had only about 90 legislativedays left this year and had a heavy schedule. Asked if it wouldaccept proposed changes from the White House, Byrd said, ``we'renot spoon-fed from the White House.''   ``I hope the president will rethink his position and come downon the side of the American people,'' Byrd said.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, pleaded for Reagan to signthe bill, which he said has overwhelming popularity across thecountry.   ``There has to be a warm side to the president,'' he said. ``Ican't believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty heart.''   Wright said Reagan's promise to veto the bill was made to``captains of industry'' who would understand if he changed hismind.   But Byrd said, ``The White House doesn't want this bill. TheWhite House doesn't want any trade bill.''   The governments of Japan and Korea today urged Reagan to vetothe measure. There was also a warning from the European EconomicCommunity of retaliatory action if Reagan doesn't kill it.   Japan's chief government spokesman, Keizo Obuchi, said the billwhich imposes sanctions against Toshiba Corp. may hinder worldeconomic development. ``The government of Japan strongly hopes thatsuch a bill will not finally be enacted,'' said Obuchi.   South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Hwang-kyung said thebill would hinder international trade and the government hopes theReagan administration ``will take appropriate actions in line withits much publicized stand on the bill.''   Willy de Clercq, EEC commissioner for external trade, said theEEC ``will react'' to measures in the bill it considersprotectionist and harmful to European interests if Reagan does notveto it.   The Senate approved the bill 63-36 Wednesday. That leftDemocrats at least three votes short of the two-thirds majorityneeded to enact their version over Reagan's objections.   The bill would get Reagan's signature, said Yeutter, if it werenot for the provision, strongly backed by Democrats and labor,requiring companies to give workers 60 days notice of intendedplant closings.   Only 11 Republicans voted in favor of the measure produced afterthree years of congressional debate over soaring U.S. tradedeficits. One Democrat voted against the measure _ Sen. WilliamProxmire, D-Wis., who criticized a provision easing the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act.   ``I believe that this bill is dead,'' said Sen. John C.Danforth, R-Mo., a GOP sponsor. He and other supporters held outhope, however, that a revised version might pass later this year.   The centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system underwhich the United States retaliates against trade law violations. Itwould transfer authority to act from the president to the U.S.trade representative.   It also would streamline the system under which the UnitedStates imposes import curbs to protect U.S. industries threatenedby foreign-made goods.   Other provisions range from billions of dollars in agriculturalsubsidies to repeal of the oil profits tax. Also included aresanctions against Toshiba of Japan and Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk ofNorway for selling submarine-silencing equipment to the SovietUnion.   Federal aid for those left jobless by imports would be expandedunder the bill, which calls for a 0.15 percent import fee to payfor the program.   Curbs on overseas shipment of high-tech equipment would beeased. The government would be barred from buying goods fromcountries that freeze out U.S. exports and the president empoweredto halt any corporate merger or takeover on national securitygrounds.</TEXT></DOC>
