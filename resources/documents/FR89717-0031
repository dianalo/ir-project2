Background </ITAG>This proposed change results from problems associated with enforcementof FAR 47.303-6 and the clause at 52.247-34, coupled with a recognitionof the following factors: It is unrealistic to expect a truck driver to be able to move heavy orbulky freight to the truck's tailgate. If the consignee has the personnel and equipment needed to remove heavyor bulky freight from the truck's tailgate, the same personnel and equipmentmay be used to remove the heavy or bulky freight from the inside of thetruck. If the consignee does not have such equipment and/or personnel, the contractingofficer should require the contractor to perform the necessary deliveryservices by using the clause at 52.247-35, F.o.b. Destination, within Consignee'sPremises. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because the proposed change willnot impose any new requirements on business, large or small. It is anticipatedthat business would view this change favorably because it would eliminatethe need for them to make special handling and delivery arrangements withmotor carriers when delivering heavy or bulky freight under Governmentcontracts containing the clause at FAR 52.247-34, F.o.b. Destination. Therefore,an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been performed. Commentsare invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Commentsfrom small entities concerning the affected FAR sections will also be consideredin accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submittedseparately and cite 89-610 (FAR Case 89-56) in correspondence pertainingto Tailgate Delivery. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changesto the FAR do not impose recordkeeping information collection requirementsor collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members ofthe public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et.seq. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 47 and 52 </ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 7, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.
