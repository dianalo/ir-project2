Care Plus, a home medical care company, said CP indicated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it may purchase additional securities and may convert its debentures to vote the underlying common stock in an attempt to influence the company's management and direction. However, the filing added that CP doesn't have any present intention to make such a move and is reviewing Care Plus's management, Care Plus said.    Neither concern could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
