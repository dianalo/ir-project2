(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 9-foot-tall stained glass window thatwas headed for the trash heap after being found in a church garagehere was made by Louis Tiffany, an expert says.   ``There's no question in my mind whatsoever that it's Tiffany,''said Dan Oppenheimer, who owns a stained glass studio in Memphisand is the author of numerous published articles about the craft.``It's a glorious find.''   The window depicts the figure of Jesus and features examples ofdrapery glass, a technique unique to Tiffany about 1905 when thepiece was made, Oppenheimer said.   He said the window's intricate leading and the plating of glassin multiple layers caused him to suspect right away it was byTiffany, who lived from 1848 to 1933 and was America's most famousstained glass artisan.   The window, which measures 4{-by-9 feet, was found last week ina packing crate in a garage at Grace St. Luke's Episcopal Church,Oppenheimer said.   ``The maintenance people were going to throw it out. Theythought it was a crate of broken glass,'' he said.   Oppenheimer said the value of the window has not beendetermined, but another Tiffany window at the church was appraised10 years ago at $132,000.   In 1977, Oppenheimer identified three of the church's windows asTiffany's and his findings were confirmed by Sotheby Parke Bernet,the art auction house.   Oppenheimer said the crate with the newly discovered windowapparently was stored in the church basement in the 1960s but wasmoved recently to the garage.   He said the window is probably one of seven commissioned by theGrace Episcopal Church, which merged with St. Luke's Church in 1944.   Tiffany Co. records document at least three installations atGrace Church and Sotheby's vouches for three others. All sixwindows are at Grace St. Luke's.   Oppenheimer said the newly discovered window is apparently theseventh work commissioned from Tiffany.   ``There are certain earmarks you look for, including the glassitself,'' he said. ``When you find all of them in one panel and itcomes from a church that has a history of commissioning stainedglass from Tiffany, you just have to take a leap of faith andpronounce it Tiffany.''</TEXT></DOC>
