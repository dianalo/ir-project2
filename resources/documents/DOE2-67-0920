Recentchanges are discussed which affect the energy sector, and thus the energyprogram: these include oil/gas resources agreements with the provinces,the worldwide economic recession, and a decline in oil consumption. Issuesrequiring action by the program are presented, including the growingsurplus of natural gas, expanding the gas supply infrastructure to easternregions, the tightening of the nuclear power market, and large volumesof shut-in oil in the western regions. The report concludes with an outlookfor the future Canadian energy situation and the corresponding role forgovernment policy. An overall conclusion is that Canadians now have astable environment guaranteeing made-in-Canada energy prices for thenext five years, and that oil imports will probably not reach their 1980peak again. 14 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
