In recent weeks, the chairmen of two major integrated oilcompanies, Atlantic Richfield Co. and Phillips Petroleum Co.,both trimmed stock holdings in their own companies throughmillion-dollar sales, filings with the Securities andExchange Commission show.</LP><TEXT>   So, according to the filings, did the chairman of HarkenEnergy Co., a Grand Prairie, Texas, oil and gas explorer.   Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman of Atlantic Richfield, sold18,225 shares for $2.1 million on Nov. 1, the SEC filingsshow. That was just days after the company announced anunexpected third-quarter loss. Since the sale, the price ofthe Los Angeles-based company's stock has plummeted,reflecting the quarterly loss and other factors.   Mr. Cook received $119 a share for his holdings, whichrepresented 23% of his total holdings in the company,according to SEC filings. Atlantic Richfield shares werequoted yesterday at $103.625, up $1.75, in late New YorkStock Exchange trading.   Mr. Cook, in a telephone interview, said &quot;Arco is in goodshape&quot; and that he sold the shares to finance construction ofa new home. Atlantic Richfield's stock price has fallenrecently, he added, because of investor bearishness on theindustry as a whole and because of rumors, which he denied,that the company plans to cut the stock dividend.   Moreover, Mr. Cook says investors have overstated thenegative impact that new California state environmentalrequirements will have on the company. Last Friday,California's Air Resources Board approved rules that requirerefiners to make gasoline by 1996 that is 30% to 40% lesssmog-forming. Arco estimates it will cost $700 million to$800 million to comply with the rules, but Mr. Cook said ithas been a &quot;planned expense for the company&quot; for over a yearand that the costs will be spread out over several years and,in part, passed onto the consumer.   Bernard Picchi, oil-industry analyst at Salomon BrothersInc., says he's cautious on oil stocks on the whole and thatAtlantic Richfield is in a more vulnerable position right nowthan most.   The oil companies &quot;are doing battle with each other to winmarket share,&quot; figuring their increased costs of complyingwith new government environmental regulations couldeventually be amortized through a bigger customer base, hesaid. &quot;Unocal in particular has taken the gloves off and, asa result, it's been a bloodbath.&quot; Unocal Corp. is a majorcompetitor of Arco in the California gasoline market.   Meanwhile, says Mr. Picchi, Atlantic Richfield hasincreased its debt; it has more exposure to the troubledchemicals industry than most other oil companies; and itsquarterly results continue to disappoint Wall Street.   On Oct. 28, Atlantic Richfield reported a $156 millionthird-quarter loss equal to 99 cents a share, vs.year-earlier net income of $462 million, or $2.79 cents ashare, which included $80 million in one-time gains. In thethird quarter of this year, $340 million in one-time chargeswere taken for personnel reductions and writedowns on about1,100 domestic oil and gas properties placed on the block.   On Nov. 22, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered AtlanticRichfield's commercial paper ratings to A-1 from A-1-plus.Sandamp;P said the downgrading reflected &quot;a reduction in thecompany's historically strong liquidity position caused byArco's somewhat weakened cash flow, acquisitions, and a stockrepurchase program, which together resulted in a rise indebt.&quot;   Still, the word on Atlantic Richfield isn't all negative.&quot;Wall Street is giving Arco almost no credit for Arco'spotential to turn around,&quot; says Charles Ober, oil-industryanalyst at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore. Ifinvestors &quot;are willing to look down the road one or twoyears,&quot; the oil firm has &quot;a lot of potential overseas&quot; and isbeefing up management in that area, he says.   Moreover, says Mr. Ober, the stock &quot;is coming into a rangewhere it's more attractively priced, and we'd certainly takea hard look at it in the double digits.&quot;   At Phillips Petroleum, Chairman Cecil J. Silas sold 72,471shares, or 18% of his stockholdings, in sales from Oct. 29through Oct. 31, SEC filings show. The sales, at pricesranging from $26.50 to $27.375 a share, totaled just under $2million, according to the filings. Mr. Silas acquired thestock through the simultaneous exercise of company-grantedoptions at an average price of $12.71 each.   Since the sales, the price of the Bartlesville, Okla.,company's stock has eased. In late New York Stock Exchangetrading, Phillips Petroleum shares were quoted yesterday at$22.50, down 37.5 cents.   Mr. Silas said he sold the shares to raise cash to pay offloans and &quot;for personal investments.&quot; As for the timing, hesaid he chose late October because there was a &quot;window&quot;available between releases by the company of potentiallymarket-moving information, such as quarterly results.   &quot;I still am substantially committed to Phillips Petroleumstock,&quot; he said. Mr. Silas exercised stock options topurchase 92,320 shares in late October, and retained 19,849of them. In total, the company said he holds 327,544 shares,either directly or as part of Phillips' long-term stocksavings and thrift plans.   Harken Energy's chairman, Alan Quasha, sold 1,108,525shares between Sept. 20 and Oct. 23, SEC filings show. Theshares fetched an average price of $5.54 each, or a total ofabout $6.1 million. Mr. Quasha retains a stake of over 7.9million shares. He couldn't be reached for comment.   That company's stock price has edged higher since thechairman's sales, closing at $6.375, down 12.5 cents, incomposite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday.   Insider selling at Harken Energy was in the news earlierthis year when George W. Bush, eldest son of the president,reported a large 1990 sale. The report last March came almosteight months after the federal deadline for disclosing suchtransactions.   Mr. Bush sold 212,140 shares in Harken Energy, where heserves as a director and consultant, for $4 a share, on June22 of last year. The sale represented 66% of his holdings inthe company, and raised $848,560.</TEXT></DOC>
