William Dotterweich, president, said the company felt it was time to investigate its alternatives; it hasn't been approached by interested buyers, he said.    The announcement pushed the company's stock up $4.25 to close at $20.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company has 10.3 million common shares outstanding, including preferred shares convertible into common, giving it a current market value of about $215 million.    Specialty Equipment was formed in January 1985 when Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd. organized a leveraged buy-out of five Beatrice Cos. food-service equipment divisions. Specialty Equipment went public last July.    For the fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, Specialty Equipment earned $14.2 million, or $1.43 a share, on sales of $287.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
