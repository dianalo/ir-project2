RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today left intact the currentsystem for giving members of Congress pay raises.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the process _which produced a $12,000 congressional pay raise last year _ givestoo much power to the president to determine salary levels.   The justices also declined to use the case to examine what powermembers of Congress have to challenge the constitutionality offederal laws.   The system for approving congressional pay hikes, established bya 1967 law, was challenged by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and fiveRepublican House members after congressional pay was raised $12,000last year to $89,500.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the pay-raisesystem last May 31.   The system also controls salary increases for federal judges andhigh-ranking executive branch officials. But the challengers to thelaw did not attack those provisions.   The appeals court said the system is constitutional because itallows Congress to override salary increases granted by thepresident.   From the founding of the nation until 1967, Congress passedlegislation to set its salary scale.   Seeking to share the responsibility for giving itself pay raises,Congress passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967.   The law calls for convening every four years a salary studycommission appointed by all three branches of government. Thecommission makes a recommendation to the president, who then submitshis pay plan to Congress.   The president's recommendations become effective unless Congressdisapproves them within 30 days of receiving them.   The act was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses tooverride the president's recommendations. The original law permittedeither house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative vetowas declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1983.   The appeals court here said the elimination of the legislativeveto causes ``marginally increased practical difficulty'' forCongress to override a presidential recommendation.   But the fact remains, the appeals court said, ``Congress isafforded the opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or allof the president's recommendations before they go into effect.''   The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hikestatute on independent grounds. It said federal courts have anobligation not to rule in disputes where Congress has the power toremedy the problem itself.   The court also rejected an argument that delegating a role to thepresident in setting congressional salaries violates theconstitutional separation of powers among the three branches ofgovernment.   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Reps. Robert Dornan,R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.   They were joined by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and theNational Taxpayers Union.   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold thepay-raise system.   In other action, the court:   _ Refused to let a Jewish organization display a menorah,symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a Pittsburghgovernment building next month.   The justices, by an 8-1 vote, turned down an emergency requestaimed at allowing display of the 18-foot menorah.   _ Agreed to referee an important railroad industry disputeaffecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines andreduce their work forces.   The court said it will use appeals involving the small Pittsburghandamp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issuestroubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.   _ For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legalpower to prevent their wives from having an abortion.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a Michigan manwho sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his then-estrangedwife from ending her pregnancy. The justices also turned down acompanion appeal by a court-appointed guardian of the fetus.   _ Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in NewYork to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from fourcarpenters union locals.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the rights ofthe union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals toturn over the lists.   _ Left intact a North Dakota law that requires parents who teachtheir children at home to be certified by the state.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents whosaid the law violates their right to practice their religion freely.   The congressional pay-raise case is Humphrey vs. Brady, 88-352.</TEXT></DOC>
