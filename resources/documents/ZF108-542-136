Mestrovich, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for healthmanagement systems, leads a group of about 30 health care professionalsdeveloping the functional requirements for medical systems within DOD'scorporate information management (CIM) program.andM;In an interview after a week-long meeting, Mestrovich said, &quot;I think we canbe moving to what I'll call standard interim systems that are elected by thedepartment within 12 to 18 months.andP;  Certainly, it shouldn't take more thantwo years.&quot;andM;Some DOD officials have said the medical group might have an advantage overthe other CIM groups because doctors and other medical professionals are notas partisan about how their own services function as other groups of DODspecialists are.andM;Medical information systems were not part of the CIM effort when DeputyDefense Secretary Donald Atwood announced it last year.andP;  Cynthia Kendall,DOD's deputy comptroller for information resources management, said medicalfunctional requirements were added earlier this year in part to answercongressional concerns.andM;Mestrovich said officials determined at the preliminary meeting that thefirst four areas the medical group will concentrate on will be requirementsfor blood management, dental management, theater medical and logisticssystems.andM;These focus areas likely will be followed by work on requirements for how DODwill standardize coordinated care.andP;  Mestrovich said coordinated care &quot;occursin different or changing health care settings, so that will get us to a pointwhere we can begin spreading out to cover more ground.&quot;andM;He said the group's general task is to define the overall business plan formedical systems in DOD.andP;  The group also will examine how medical systemsshould interface with &quot;other areas outside of medical -- finance, personnel,logistics, those types of things,&quot; he said.andM;Seven OperationsandM;CIM functional groups are examining seven broad categories of operations.andO;Mestrovich said the medical group includes representatives from all theservices and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.andM;He described members of the group as &quot;people who are in the business ofdelivering health care, people from clinics, laboratory officers, as well asstrategic planners or logisticians, or dentists or nurses.andP;  We have a fewpeople who have done work on the computer side, but the job right now is toset up the requirements for a functional plan of the future.andP;  We will bringin the computer people later.&quot;andM;Mestrovich said a draft architecture of DOD's medical systems produced lastyear will be an &quot;input into the CIM process.&quot;andP;  The architecture was producedby the Defense Medical Systems Support Center (DMSSC) in Alexandria, Va.andO;DMSSC published a summary of the architecture in January.andM;The need for an overall architecture was dramatized in the 1980s whendeficiencies in medical records systems made the identification of bodiesdifficult after the terrorist assault on Marines in Lebanon and the crash ofa military transport in Newfoundland, officials have said.andM;According to the DMSSC summary, medical information systems within DOD rangefrom centralized, mainframe-based systems to field or theater systems thatoperate on Zenith data Systems Z-248s and other microcomputers.andP;  Overallthese medical systems are known as the Military Health Services System(MHSS).andM;Mestrovich said the group also will examine the components of MHSS andeventually determine which among them are &quot;CIM candidates.&quot;andP;  He said it wastoo soon to identify any specific systems.andM;However, officials within the DOD medical community have said the CompositeHealth Care System, the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System andthe Automated Quality of Care Evaluation Support System are likely to beincluded in an interim CIM system, if one is developed.andM;The functional group also will examine the Theater Army Medical ManagementInformation System (TAMMIS), a prototype system that was fielded in Decemberduring Operation Just Cause to aid in getting supplies to doctors in Panama.andM;Congressional concerns about the compatibility of TAMMIS with other medicalsystems were part of the reason for adding the medical systems to CIM.andM;Other theater systems include the Navy's Shipboard Non-tactical ADP Program'sAutomated Medical System, which runs on Z-248s, and the Air Force's AutomatedPatient Evacuation System, which the DMSSC summary runs on microcomputers.andM;A blood management system for blood banks is being tested by DOD users, thesummary said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
