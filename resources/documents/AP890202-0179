A giant U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy cargo plane carrying the gearand experts landed in Punta Arenas, on the straits of Magellan, theofficial news agency Orbe reported.   From there, the mission was to board the Polar Duke, a U.S.research ship bound for the spill, about 590 miles south of the CapeHorn.   Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for theWashington-based National Science Foundation, said the Polar Dukewas to depart Friday and take about four days to reach the spill,just off the Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S.scientific base Palmer Station.   ``Our concern right now is primarily for the birds,'' he toldreporters at Santiago's airport. ``All the young penguins are justabout at the age where they take their first swim.   ``When these birds enter the water for the first time, it couldbe the last time.''   There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, whichoccurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rockSaturday and listed before sinking Tuesday.   The 9,300-ton vessel, the Paradise Bay, was carrying 250,000gallons of diesel fuel, according to the Science Foundation.   The boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, andhundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slippedfrom its decks, the foundation said.   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday``there really wasn't a (significant) spill.''   A short communique issued by the Argentine navy said its planeswill fly over the sunken vessel ``to make a visual evaulation of thedamage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best meansto employ to combat the effects that could be presented.''   Also, an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene Friday to ``assessthe best ways available to combat the pollution,'' the communiquesaid.   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have saidhundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created aslick up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reportsappeared exaggerated.   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''said navy spokesman Lt. Juan Pablo Barros.   Jack Renirie, a Science Foundation spokesman said, however, thata slick did exist and that personnel at Palmer Station weregathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from aroundthe grounded ship.   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200barrels in the water'' that slipped from the vessel's deck, Reniriesaid in a telephone interview from Santiago. ``And there's still oilcoming out of the ship.''   Inderbitzen said the Science Foundation, which organized thecleanup mission and directs all U.S. activities in Antarctica,feared lasting environmental damage.   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick hadcaused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,Renirie said.   Inderbitzen said Antarctica's delicate, unspoiled environmentrequires special measures to contain the spill, which is near twoareas set aside for special scientific study under terms of theAntarctic Treaty.   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals torecover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in Antarctica, it takesplants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.It's a very, very fragile environment.''   The U.S. cargo plane, which is twice the size of a Boeing 747,carries a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil andpumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatablebooms to contain drifting oil.   The cleanup work will be peformed by Marine Pollution ControlCo., under contract to the U.S. Navy, Renirie said.   The Chilean navy said it will provide logistical support anddispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist ``incase any contamination exists.''</TEXT></DOC>
