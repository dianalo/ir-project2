On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled down 11cents to $14.92 a barrel Tuesday, after trading as high as $15.25.Other contract months mostly were lower.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,the December contract for wholesale home heating oil lost 0.86 centto settle at 47.79 cents a gallon. The December contract forunleaded gasoline settled at 46.87 cents a gallon, up 0.50 cent fromMonday.   Analysts said the market was directionless following Monday'sagreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tolimit crude production to 18.5 million barrels a day, well under theestimated 22.5 million it now is pumping.   ``I think confusion is the watchword,'' said Peter Beutel, anenergy analyst for Elders Futures Inc. ``I don't think OPEC answereda lot of questions the market has.''   Beutel said many traders are wondering what the cartel memberswould do before the accord takes effect Jan. 1, whether some wouldflood the market with oil before the date or start cuttingproduction early. He said traders also are wondering whether allmembers would adhere to the voluntary cuts once the agreement is inplace.   Just after the pact was announced Monday, the United ArabEmirates said the output level set in the OPEC agreement was not hisofficial ceiling, although the nation's oil minister later promisedto abide by the quota.   Runaway oil production has been responsible for worsening aworldwide surplus that has sharply reduced oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
