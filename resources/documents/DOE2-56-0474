<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0474 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report presents analyses of dynamic instability and frequency responsecharacteristics of boiling flow systems based on an unequal velocity,unequal temperature two-fluid model of such flow. The dynamic instabilityanalyses in the time domain are incorporated into three options of acomputer code SAT (steady state, or equilibrium point analyses; linearstability analysis; and nonlinear analysis). The frequency response analysisis incorporated into a fourth option FREQ. Results from dynamic instabilityexperiments carried out in a Refrigerant-113 boiling flow rig are alsoreported as are comparison of these with linear stability analysis predictions.Descriptions of the model, the computational techniques, the computercodes, the experiments and model validation are divided into the followingvolumes: Volume 1, theoretical model and computational formulation; Volume2, coding description; Volume 3, user's manual; and Volume 4, experimentsand model validation. Instability experiments run in our Refrigerant-113boiling flow facility are described in this document. Results from theseexperiments are compared with predictions of the theoretical model. Instabilityexperiment data from two other facilities and frequency response resultsfrom one are compared with theoretical model predictions also. 19 refs.,41 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
