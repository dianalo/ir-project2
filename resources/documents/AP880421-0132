Idaho Maximum Security Prison, however, was a perfect fit.   ``It connotes exactly what kind of place it is,'' said L. JamesKoutnik, a member of the Idaho Board of Correction. ``It's not aflower garden or a country club. It's a maximum-security prison.''   Tim McNeese, assistant corrections director, said the departmenthas received suggestions for a name including Owyhee View Prison toSouthern Desert Correctional Facility. The prison is being built inthe high desert from which the Owyhee Mountains are visible.
