They're ripping up the downtown streets to put in the first 4.4miles of a subway, and trolly-like light rail lines are being builtbetween downtown and Long Beach, and across a patchwork of southside neighborhoods.   That's a dramatic departure from tradition for a city thatstands alone among major U.S. metropolises in having no railtransit whatsoever.   Here's a look at the projects under construction:   _Metro Rail: A 4.4-mile, $1.2 billion, subway scheduled to openin 1993 will start at Union Station in the northeast, pass underthe civic center and financial district and terminate nearMacArthur Park. A 13-mile extension into the San Fernando Valleysuburbs is tentatively scheduled to be done in 1998. It will befinanced 55 percent from the federal government, 17 percent fromthe state, 14 percent from a sales tax surcharge, 11 percent frommerchant assessments and 3 percent from the city.   _Long Beach-Los Angeles light rail: A $752 million, 21.5-miletrolly style line mostly on existing tracks and powered by overheadwires is meant for both commuters and as a local train for those inlargely low-income neighborhoods. It will be funded through salestax.   _Norwalk-El Segundo light rail: A $400 million, 19.5-mileeast-west trolly will follow the Century Freeway, which is beingbuilt at the same time. At the west end is Los AngelesInternational Airport and aircraft factories. Funding comes fromthe sales tax.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs May 8</NOTE></DOC>
