Late returns from Thursday's voting indicated that Haughey'sFianna Fail party would return to the parliament, known as the Dail,with fewer seats.   ``It's quite clear that you can't impose stringent financialpolicies which are unpopular and expect the people to give you thesort of majority we were looking for,'' Haughey said.   Haughey failed to win a majority in four previous elections,although he twice was able to form governments with the support ofother parties. He served his first term as prime minister afterassuming leadership of the party while it was already in power.   Haughey said, however, he did not intend to resign as leader ofthe Fianna Fail party. ``We will form a government,'' he said.   With a half-dozen seats short of a majority, Haughey must findsupport among the opposition before June 26, when the Dailreconvenes and the new prime minister will be chosen.   Alan Dukes, conservative leader of second-place Fine Gael, saidhe could not predict what would happen.   ``Wait and see,'' Dukes said Saturday, ``because the vision wehave in the heat of the moment may not be the best in the longterm.''   The election returns showed a shift to the left. Labor and theWorkers Party gained seats, a Social Democrat won a seat and, forthe first time, so did a member of the Green Party.   The results prompted talk of a historic realignment of Irishpolitics.   ``We have never had an ideological base to Irish politicsbefore,'' said Labor leader Dick Spring. ``This election has seen afurther right-left realignment and we are going to build on that.''   With all seats decided, Fianna Fail had won 77, a loss of 3; FineGael 55, a gain of 5; Labor Party, 15, up 4; Workers Party 7, up 3;Progressive Democrats 6, down 8; Social Democrats 1, Green Party 1,independents and others 4.   Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) and Fine Gael (Family of theIrish) are both conservative economically, but Fine Gael tends to bemore liberal on social issues. The Progressive Democrats arebreakaways from Fianna Fail.   The returns indicated that Fianna Fail was hurt by public angerover cuts in health service, over new fishing licenses in westernIreland and perhaps by a campaign by army wives for better pay forsoldiers.   In the past, the 63-year-old Haughey thrived in adversity.Appointed to his first Cabinet post in 1961, he was dropped from thegovernment in 1970 after being charged with smuggling arms to theIrish Republican Army in Northern Ireland.   Acquitted in court, Haughey battled back to become minister ofhealth and social welfare in 1977 and prime minister in 1979. Healso was unscathed by a 1982 scandal in which his justice ministerwas accused of ordering wiretaps on members of the Dail.   Haughey had been running well in opinion polls, with a peak of 54percent in February, but Fianna Fail pulled 44 percent in theelection, slightly up from two years ago.   Gerry O'Sullivan of the Labor Party, who finished first innorth-central Cork, said closings of 15 hospitals were a factor inhis victory.   ``You cannot phase out billions and billions in debt in twoyears,'' he said of Haughey's budget cuts.   The fishing license issue cost Fianna Fail a seat in west Galway,said Dick Willis, president of the Munster Trout Angling Council.Outraged anglers have refused to pay for the new licensing.   Frank Durcan, an independent who opposed the licenses, fell shortin west Mayo, where Fianna Fail held its two seats.   None of three army wives who campaigned for higher pay for theirhusbands won a seat, but they made a decent showing.   June Kiernan polled 3,207 first preference votes in Longford-Westmeath, where 8,460 votes were required for election. FiannaFail lost one of its three seats in the district.   Fianna Fail claims the mantle of forces that originally opposedthe partition of Ireland in 1921. Its nationalism has kept it inpower for most of the republic's 68-year history.</TEXT></DOC>
