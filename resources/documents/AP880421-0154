Roh said if North Korea changes its longstanding policy to makethe Korean peninsula communist through military force, South Koreawould move actively to improve relations.   ``The Olympics are dictating changes in the situation of thispart of the world, and I, therefore, believe that North Korea'spolicy would also inevitably change,'' Roh told a nationallytelevised news conference.   Roh said relations would reach an ``epochal turning point'' infour or five years, and said he hoped he could lay a firmfoundation for unification.   Despite the November bombing of a South Korean civilian airlinerin an attack South Korea blamed on North Korean agents, Seoul andPyongyang have been talking and must keep channels open, he said.   Roh, who took office Feb. 25, did not say what channels the twoKorean states were using for dialogue. But he said, ``The mosteffective way to solve problems is summit talks.''   Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, proposed a summit with NorthKorean President Kim Il-sung on many occasions, but the Pyongyanggovernment turned him down.   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea andanti-communist South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. Theyfought a bloody civil war from 1950 to 1953.   They have held intermittent talks since the early 1970s. Theirlatest dialogue was broken off in 1986 when North Korea disputed amajor joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise.   Relations took another nosedive last November when a Korean Airjetliner disappeared near Burma, killing all 115 people on board.   A North Korean agent in the custody of South Korean intelligenceauthorities confessed in Seoul in January that she and a male agentput a time bomb on the plane to disrupt the Olympics in Seoul.   Roh deplored the bombing, but said his government still needs topromote dialogue with North Korea to avoid a ``possibly more tragicincident.''   Roh also said increasing violence in the National Assemblyelections would be suppressed.   ``Whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must bepunished severely in the name of people,'' Roh said.   Roh said his governing Democratic Justice Party needs a majorityin the 299-member National Assembly in elections next Tuesday.   Top opposition leaders have said that if the party tries to rigthe elections, they will call for violent protests similar to thosein June that forced democratic reforms.   ``The ruling party will face popular resistence and disobedienceif its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' saidopposition leader Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy.   Rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the ReunificationDemocratic Party said he would have to make a ``grave decision'' ifthe government cheated.   Roh was elected in December when the two Kims split theopposition vote.   Corruption and violence are among major campaign issues in thelegislative elections, the first test of public confidence in theRoh government.   Government officials say 15 people have been arrested forinvolvement in campaign violence, including six members of Roh'sparty. Another 120 people were charged but not jailed for violatingelection laws, they said.   In keeping with a campaign pledge, Roh publicly declared hispersonal wealth at $693,000.   The president also said he would lead a clean public life duringhis single five-year term and would not tolerate any attempts byhis relatives to sell influence or make an illicit fortune duringhis tenure.</TEXT></DOC>
