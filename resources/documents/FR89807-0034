The petitioners, the Municipal CastingsFair Trade Council and its individually-named members, requested in accordancewith andSection; 353.53a(a) of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 353.53a(a)(1988)) that we conduct an administrative review. We published a noticeof initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on June 19,1987 (52 FR 23330). The Department has now conducted that administrativereview in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``theTariff Act'') <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). Imports covered by the review are shipments of certain heavy and lightiron construction castings. Heavy castings are limited to manhole covers,rings and frames, catch basin grates and frames, and cleanout covers andframes used for drainage or access purposes for public utility, water andsanitary systems. During the review period, heavy castings were classifiableunder items 657.0950 and 657.0990 of the Tariff Schedules of the UnitedStates Annotated (``TSUSA''). This merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS items 7325.10.00.9 and 7325.10.00.50.0. Light castings are limitedto valve boxes, service boxes and meter boxes which are placed below groundto encase water valves, gas valves, and other valves, or water and gasmeters. During the review period, light castings were classifiable underTSUSA item 657.0990. This merchandise is currently classifiable under HTSitem 7325.10.00.50.0. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenienceand Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers 11 manufacturers/exporters of certain Indian iron constructioncastings and the period October 28, 1985 through April 30, 1987. East CoastCo., Victory Iron Works, Paharimata Iron Works, Kamala Iron Foundry, ShreeLaxmi Metal and S.K. Iron Foundry and Engineering failed to respond tothe Department's antidumping duty questionnaire. For these six firms, weused the highest rate for responding firms, as best information availablefor assessment and cash deposit purposes. On June 28, 1988, Neenaa Foundry Pvt. Ltd. (``Neenaa'') and Overseas FoundryPvt. Ltd. (``Overseas'') requested that we consider merchandise exportedby Neenaa and Overseas to be excluded from the antidumping duty order.Their request is based on the exclusion of Kajaria Castings from the scopeof the order. In our final affirmative antidumping duty determination,we excluded Kajaria Castings because we found it had a <T3>de minimis </T3>dumping margin (51 FR 9486, March 19, 1986). At thetime of the final determination, Neenaa and Overseas were castings producersrelated to Kajaria, which exported castings directly to the United States.Neenaa and Overseas did not export castings to the United States duringthe period of investigation. Therefore, we used Kajaria's prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States for purposes of establishing U.S. price.Since that time, Kajaria has changed its name to Select Steels and no longerexports castings. Further, Neenaa and Overseas now export castings directly.Since our exclusion covers only mechandise exported by Kajaria Castings,we consider merchandise exported by Neenaa and Overseas to be subject tothe antidumping duty order. On May 4, 1988, the petitioners alleged that third-country sales from R.B.Agarwalla andamp; Co., Carnation Enterprises, Pvt. Ltd. (``Carnations'')and Govind Steel Co., and home market sales from Uma Iron andamp; Steel Co./CommexCorporation were at prices below the cost of producing the merchandise.The Department determined that there was a reasonable basis to initiatea cost of production investigation for all four firms. We requested thatcost of production data be submitted on a quarterly basis. Super Castingsprovided cost of production on a quarterly basis. All other companies reportedcost of production on an annual basis. For these companies, as best informationavailable, we made adjustments to their annual costs based upon Super Castings'quarterly cost of production. We calculated an annual cost of productionfigure for Super Castings based on a weighted-average of its quarterlycosts. We then compared its quarterly cost figure to its annual cost figure.For each quarter that Super Castings' quarterly costs exceeded its annualcost figure, we adjusted the annual cost figures for the other companiesby the same percentage. For Super Castings, we used their quarterly costfigures. We compared the home market and third-country selling prices, net of allapplicable movement expenses, to the cost of production. Based on our analysis,we found all home market sales and all third-country sales, with the exceptionof R.B. Agarwalla, to be at or above the cost of producing the merchandise.For R.B. Agarwalla, we found that a significant percentage of third countrysales was below cost of production. For this company, we used only thethird country sales above the cost of production as our foreign marketvalue. On May 1, 1989, we amended the final determination and antidumping dutyorder to exclude Serampore Industries Pvt. Ltd. (``Serampore'') from thescope of the antidumping duty order in accordance with the court decisionupon remand (54 FR 18562). We instructed the Customs Service to terminatethe suspension of liquidation and refund any cash deposits for subjectmerchandise produced by Serampore. Therefore, we are not reviewing Serampore'ssales in our preliminary results of review. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>In calculating United States price, the Department used purchase price,as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, since all sales were madeto unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to the date of importation.Purchase price was based on the packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedpurchasers in the United States. Where applicable, we made deductions forforeign inland freight, ocean freight, insurance, inspection charges, andbrokerage and handling charges. When comparing purchase price to home marketor third-country sales, we added the Cash Compensatory Support (``CCS'')rebate of indirect taxes. The CCS is designed to rebate indirect taxesand is paid as a percentage of f.o.b. price. When comparing purchase priceto home market or third country sales, we added the excise duty drawback,which rebates a fixed amount per metric ton of castings exports. No otheradjustments were claimed or allowed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In calculating foreign market value, the Department used home market pricewhen sufficient quantities of such or similar merchandise were sold inthe home market. When there were insufficient home market sales for comparison,we used third-country sales. When there were no third country sales, weused constructed value, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act. Home market price was based on the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated customersin the home market. Where applicable, where adjusted for differences inpacking and credit expenses and the International Price Reimbursement Scheme(``IPRS'') rebate. IPRS rebates are designed to offset the differencesbetween the domestic and ostensible world market prices for pig iron. Whencommissions were paid on U.S. sales, but not on home market sales, we adjustedby adding U.S. commissions to foreign market value and deducting home marketindirect selling expenses, not exceeding U.S. commissions, from foreignmarket value. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. Third-country price was based on the packed f.o.b., c. andamp; f. or c.i.f.price to unrelated customers in third countries. We made adjustments, whereapplicable, for inland freight, ocean freight, brokerage and handling,inspection charges, discounts and differences in packing and credit expenses.When commissions were paid on third-country sales, but not U.S. sales,we adjusted by deducting third-country commissions and adding U.S. indirectselling expenses not exceeding third-country commissions to foreign marketvalue. We added third-country CCS rebates and the excise duty drawbackto foreign market value. We made a difference in merchandise adjustmentfor a extra fittings for Carnations. No other adjustments were claimedor allowed. We calculated constructed value as the sum of materials, fabrication costs,general expenses, profit, and the cost of packing. We requested quarterlyconstructed value data from respondents. Super Castings provided constructedvalue data on a quarterly basis. All other companies reported constructedvalue figures on an annual basis. For these companies, we made adjustmentsto their annual costs based upon Super Castings' quarterly constructedvalue figures. We calculated an annual constructed value for Super Castingsbased on a weighted-average of its quarterly costs. We then compared itsquarterly cost figures to its annual cost figure. For each quarter thatSuper Castings' quarterly costs exceeded its annual cost figure, we adjustedthe annual cost figures for the other companies by the same percentage.For Super Castings, we used their quarterly cost figures. Raw material costs did not include indirect tax rebates through the CCSprogram, the excise duty drawback and the IPRS rebate. When actual generalexpenses were greater than ten percent of the sum of materials and fabricationcosts, we used the actual general expenses. When actual general expenseswere less than ten percent of the sum of materials and fabrication costs,we used the statutory minimum of ten percent of the sum of materials andfabrication costs, as provided by section 773 of the Tariff Act. Sincethe profit rate was less than eight percent of the sum of materials costs,fabrication costs, and general expenses, we used the eight percent statutoryminimum, as provided by section 773 of the Tarrif Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the followingmargins exist for the period October 28, 1985 through April 30, 1987: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7</C>  <H1>Manufacturer/Exporter </H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">R.B.

Any interested party may request a hearingwithin 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter.Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submittednot later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs andrebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in those comments,may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. Copiesof case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested partiesin accordance with andSection; 353.38(e) of the new Commerce Regulations(published at 54 FR 12785, March 28, 1989) (to be codified at 19 CFR 353.38(e)).The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review,including the results of its analysis of any such written comments or oralargument. Representatives of interested parties may request disclosure of proprietaryinformation under administrative protective order within 10 days of thedate that the interested party becomes a party to the proceeding but inno event later than the date case briefs are due. The Department will determine, and the Customs Service will assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisementinstructions directly to the Customs Service. Article VI.5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that``[no] product * * * shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailingduties to compensate for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.''This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Tariff Actwhich provides that ``the purchase price and the exporter's sales priceshall be adjusted by being increased by * * * the amount of any countervailingduty imposed on the merchandise under subtitle A of this title or section303 of this Act to offset an export subsidy.'' The amount of countervailingduty to be imposed on each customs entry will not be known until outstandingadministrative reviews of the countervailing duty order are completed.Therefore, we will implement this section of the Tariff Act by requiringthe U.S. Customs Service to add the unit amounts of any assessed countervailingduty for export subsidies, to the extent that they have not already beenaccounted for in the dumping calculations, to the purchase prices containedin our liquidation instructions implementing the final results of thisreview. Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cash depositof estimated antidumping duties based on the above margins will be required.Since the margin for Super Castings is less than 0.5 percent and, therefore,<T3>de minimis</T3> for cash deposit purposes, the Department shall notrequire a cash deposit of antidumping duties on entries from this firm.For any future entries of this merchandise from a new exporter, not coveredin this administrative review, whose first shipments occurred after April30, 1989, and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm, a cash deposit of8.43 percent shall be required. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 353.22 of the newCommerce Regulations (to be codified at 19 CFR 353.22).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
