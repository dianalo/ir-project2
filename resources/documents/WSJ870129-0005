In the first official move indicating the scope of his effort, Mr. Walsh recently told senior Justice Department prosecutors that at least at the beginning, he intends to take over only three separate criminal investigations involving supplies, weapons or aircraft provided to the Nicaraguan insurgents, law-enforcement officials said.    Justice Department officials and even some of Mr. Walsh's associates previously speculated that he would assert jurisdiction over more pending criminal investigations delving into the activities of the rebel groups, known as the Contras.    Mr. Walsh's strategy has prompted unexpected disagreements with some senior Justice Department prosecutors, according to officials familiar with the continuing high-level discussions. And the department is privately urging Mr. Walsh to read his mandate more broadly by asserting control over several other, related criminal probes of suspected gun-smuggling and other violations by the Contras or their supporters.    Meanwhile, new disclosures of corporate records from Panama establish a firm link between Swiss associates of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and payments covering maintenance work on aircraft used to ferry supplies to the Contras in Nicaragua.    In a recent letter outlining his plans to Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, law-enforcement officials said Mr. Walsh indicated that two of the pending investigations he intends to take over involve the operations of Miami-based Southern Air Transport and its links to a pair of C-123 cargo planes. Investigators believe the two planes were used in 1985 and 1986 in the private resupply network helping the Contras.    One of the investigations, which Mr. Walsh immediately will assume control of, was prompted by the crash of one of the planes last October and the capture of American crew member Eugene Hasenfus, after the aircraft was shot down by Nicaraguan troops. As part of the same probe, the independent counsel also will investigate why the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at the request of Attorney General Edwin Meese, suspended its inquiry of the matter for at least 26 days.    Law-enforcement sources said that Mr. Walsh also decided to take over a Customs Service investigation of whether use of the two cargo planes to help the Contras, apart from whatever was shipped, violated federal export-control laws. Investigators believe the planes were maintained by Southern Air. The company has maintained that it didn't violate any laws, but has declined to elaborate.    The third investigation Mr. Walsh will take over, according to these officials, is a Macon, Ga., grand jury investigation focusing on the role of Mr. Secord and others in purchasing a short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft that investigators believe ended up in the hands of the Contras.    Mr. Walsh's office has declined to comment on which investigations he will take over, and some department officials said the matter may not be resolved for weeks. the Justice Department intends to pursue its investigations until a final resolution is worked out.    As part of Mr. Walsh's overall investigation, a grand jury was impaneled here yesterday to take testimony and issue subpoenas. </TEXT></DOC>
