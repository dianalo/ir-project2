<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-0577 </DOCNO><TEXT>A rapid and reliable experimental technique developed through the yearshas been used for a comparative study of the appearance and subsequentdecay of stable radicals in carbonization process. A number of simplecompound and other carbonaceous materials were submitted to heat treatmentand their ESR investigated in the range 400 to 1000 degrees C. All materialsshow surprising similarities in behavior, the spin concentration reachinga maximum of (1.8 plus or minus 1.0) x 10{sup 20} spin/gm at HTT of 680to 750 degrees C, with the exception of PVDC for which HTT /sub m//suba//sub x/ 500 degrees C. Studies of the kinetics of formation and destructionof the C radicals (time-temperature relationship) lead to the conclusionthat both the formation and the subsequent mutual annihilation of radicalsby fusion represent an essential step in a local transformation of thesemiconductive molecular solid into a conductive carbon. The formationof these large radical structures of not less than about 60 carbon atomseach starts to occur at similar stages of molecular condensation irrespectiveof the chemical composition of the starting material.</TEXT></DOC>
