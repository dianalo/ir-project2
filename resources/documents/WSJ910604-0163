But the fastpace of technology may soon seem less dispiriting, as PCsemerge that can easily accommodate technical advances.   At Equitable Life Assurance Society in New York City, forexample, Senior Vice President Robert McNulty is introducinga new generation of PCs powered by Intel Corp.'s speedy 486microprocessor. Instead of replacing its old machines, theinsurance company is simply upgrading many PCs by popping ina single circuit board. The process takes maybe 10 minutes oflabor per computer and costs much less than buying new 486machines, which can run $8,000 or more apiece.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The minute you buy a personal computer, something elsegets announced, and you're already behind the times,&quot; hesays. &quot;With upgradable computers, those investments aren'tsuch a gamble.&quot;   Many other buyers are coming to the same conclusion --which isn't lost on computer makers. Such companies asInternational Business Machines Corp., AST Research Inc. andAdvanced Logic Research Inc. are promoting computers thatwill house any one of several different microprocessor brains-- even very speedy ones that haven't been invented yet.   Unisys Corp. will today unveil a revamping of its popularcommercial work stations, which are easily upgradable, whileApple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and DigitalEquipment Corp. all now offer some form of upgradability.Even Intel itself has gotten into the act, introducing lastmonth a module that allows certain previous-generation PCs touse its 386SX chip.   The move to upgradability can help PC manufacturers: Fewerpart types need to be kept in stock, for example, anddecisions about exactly which model to build can be delayeduntil the last moment. Upgradable designs can also speed theintroduction of new products, since all that needs to be madeis a fresh upgrade module. As soon as Intel announced its486SX chip last month, a slew of companies unveiled machinesbased on the new technology; almost all used upgradabledesigns that had been updated for the 486SX.   &quot;If done correctly, {upgradable PC designs} can definitelyreduce development time,&quot; says Robert Carberry, who overseestechnology for the personal-systems arm of IBM, one of theearliest 486SX entrants.   IBM says its newest PCs, models 90 and 95, are designed sothey won't be compromised if they are upgraded: Eachmachine's Intel brain is contained on a snapin card, alongwith memory chips and other devices that depend on the mainchip's speed and power. The rest of the machine staysconstant, meaning that a Model 90 that has been upgraded by adealer or a user is identical to a comparable machine fromIBM's factory.   AST, based in Irvine, Calif., has taken a similar approachwith its fast-growing Premium family of PCs. &quot;We weredesigning things over and over again, and we realized therewas no need for it,&quot; says Larry Fortmuller, director ofhigh-performance systems.   Upgradability comes naturally for AST, which got its startmaking add-in circuit boards for IBM's original PC. Still,Mr. Fortmuller says AST's upgradable computers are about 10%more expensive to make than comparable non-upgradable models,since it is cheaper to put all of a PC's parts on a singleboard than to separate those that are upgradable.   But the comparison isn't always clearcut. Besides usingmany common parts and speeding development, upgradablemachines can produce savings in unexpected ways. For example,once the Federal Communications Commission has tested thebasic version of an upgradable machine for radiation levelsand approved the machine, future versions need far lesstesting before they can be sold.   For users, Mr. Fortmuller adds, the extra expense of anupgradable machine can be offset by such factors as improvedcompatibility with other models in the same family. &quot;Bigcorporations, especially, are starting to focus on the `costof ownership' of a personal computer -- including maintenanceand training -- rather than the list price,&quot; Mr. Fortmullersays.   Other computer makers are skeptical that PC buyers can beso farsighted and have focused on making their upgradesaffordable in the short term. The add-in modules sold byAdvanced Logic Research, for example, are half the size ofAST's circuit boards and are also less expensive: To upgradean AST computer from Intel's fastest 386 chip to its fastest486 chip costs $3,995, while a similar ALR upgrade costs$2,695 -- minus a $200 rebate for the old module.   &quot;With inexpensive upgrades, people don't need to be afraidof technology,&quot; says Dave Kirkey, a vice president of ALR. &quot;Alot of companies tout upgradability, but they make it soexpensive that no one will ever make the change.&quot;   Scrappy ALR has built its advertising, and image, aroundthe slogan &quot;Just Upgrade the CPU,&quot; which stands for centralprocessing unit, a computer's brain. Mr. Kirkey concedes thatseparating other parts, such as memory chips, from theupgrade module could slow a PC down. But he says ALR morethan compensates with other technical tricks, and he citescomputer-magazine reports that rate ALR's machines as thefastest available.   Another entrant, Everex Systems Inc., Fremont, Calif.,also admits it has made some compromises in its Stepupgradable computers. For instance, users can trade up onlyto an Intel chip that accepts its commands at exactly thesame speed as the old chip, and users must do some fiddlingto effect an upgrade.   Kimball Brown, director of investor relations for Everex,says the company plans to address both issues soon, but headds that upgradability often boils down to marketing anyway.The feature &quot;makes {PCs} a better buy at the time you layyour credit card down,&quot; says Mr. Brown.   Steve Lair, a vice president of market-researcherDataquest Inc., concurs, saying that some upgrades mayinvolve more trouble than PC users realize. Some couldrequire changing the PC's internal power supply, memory ordisk storage, he says -- hassles that may only make sense forthe most powerful personal computers.   &quot;My considered judgment is that what {PC makers} aretrying to do here is differentiate themselves in themarketplace,&quot; Mr. Lair says. &quot;No one has done a statisticalstudy yet, but I think that such a study would find that fewpeople ever upgrade.&quot;   Many PC buyers, however, claim the economics ofupgradability are impossible to ignore. &quot;If we spend $3,000to $4,000 on a PC, the last thing we want is to toss it aftera year,&quot; says Keith Kozier, senior microcomputer analyst atthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an ALR customer. &quot;Once youstart talking about 30 or 40 machines, that's a lot ofmoney.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
