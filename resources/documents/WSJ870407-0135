The World Bank offering met a favorable response because of a combination of factors, including the status of the issuer, a slight pricing concession and a firming U.S. Treasury market. The World Bank, an international development agency, made the offering in an unusual manner by deciding to sell an additional portion of a $300 million 7% issue sold in January. Underwriters led by Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. apparently believed the bonds would appeal to investors seeking liquidity.    The issue was priced at 99 7/8, and with fees at 1 3/4 points, it yielded about 1/4 percentage point more than a U.S. Treasury issue of similar maturity. At the time of the launching, the World Bank bonds outstanding were trading at 98.30. At the close, the new bonds were trading at 98 1/4 less 1 5/8.    But market participants said that despite the success of the World Bank issue, investors are wary of straight dollar issues because of uncertainty over the currency's future direction.    Meanwhile, Atari Inc. and Ranger Oil Ltd. each launched a $75 million convertible issue.    The U.S. consumer electronics concern's issue, with an indicated coupon rate of 5% to 5 1/4% and an expected conversion premium of 20% to 25%, was trading late in the session at 100 3/4, compared with an issue price of par. The Canadian oil company's issue, with the same conversion premium but an indicated coupon rate of 6 1/4% to 6 3/4%, was trading at between 99 and par. It also was priced at par.    Equity-linked issues continued to be best-sellers on the Swiss franc foreign bond market, as stock markets in Tokyo and New York remained bullish.    But syndicate managers said they don't believe there will be an increase in the number of issues launched this month.    Despite the recent strength of the Swiss currency, other market forces are influencing borrowers to stay away from the Swiss franc market, syndicate managers said. Differences in interest rates between the U.S. and Switzerland do not permit swaps that are necessary for issues to be launched, they said, and a pricing war this year among Switzerland's three largest banks created a flood of straight issues at low rates that investors don't want.    Aluminum Co. of Canada's 5 3/8% bonds of 2003 were trading at 94 1/4 to yield 6.03% yesterday, and Standard Oil Co.'s 4 7/8% bonds of 1999 were quoted at 98 1/4 to yield 5.12%.    Most long-term bonds were trading at yields just below 5%. Equity-linked issues continued to soar in active trading.    In government paper, British securities, or gilts, closed broadly higher in response to opinion polls released Sunday that showed a rise in the popularity of Britain's governing Conservative Party. A surprise victory by West Germany's Christian Democratic Party in the Hesse state election Sunday, meanwhile, gave a boost to West German government bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
