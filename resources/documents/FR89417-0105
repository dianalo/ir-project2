Itestimates the loan authority that is expected to be available for projectsfor the elderly in each HUD Field Office jurisdiction. However, these unitand loan estimates are subject to change by Regional or Field Offices.Changes may be necessary to assure that there is enough loan authorityin each Field Office to support housing projects of feasible size. EachHUD Field Office receiving Fiscal Year 1989 loan authority will publishone Invitation for Applications for section 202 Fund Reservation (Invitation)for its jurisdiction indicating the amount of loan authority and the maximumnumber of units this amount is expected to assist, as well as the totalnumber of units available for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Whetheran area is ``metropolitan'' or ``nonmetropolitan'' will be determined inaccordance with the redefinitions of metropolitan statistical areas announcedby the Office of Management and Budget, effective June 30, 1983 (See OMBPublic Affairs Issuance 83-20, June 27, 1983, and subsequent changes madeJune 27, 1984, June 27, 1985 and October 18, 1986.)To provide equitable geographic distribution of the limited number of section202 units for the elderly, a Field Office may establish a maximum numberof units that may be requested under any one application. This unit limitationwill vary by Field Office, depending on the number of units available foreither the metropolitan or nonmetropolitan category of funds. Additionally,the limitation set forth in Paragraph (11) below will apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Priority Categories for Selection</ITAG>The purpose of the priority system for the section 202 program is to assurethat applications from localities that have been relatively underfundedover the years receive priority consideration and are treated in an equitablemanner.In view of the limited funds for projects in Fiscal Year 1989, and in orderto assure open competition, Field Offices will not suballocate funds withintheir jurisdiction. However, 20-25 percent of available funds will be allocatedto nonmetropolitan areas to meet rural housing needs. Field Office Invitationswill identify the total number of units available for metropolitan andfor nonmetropolitan areas of the jurisdiction. Applications received forprojects in metropolitan areas will compete against each other; applicationsreceived for projects in nonmetropolitan areas will similarly compete againsteach other. The 20-25 percent of funds allocated to the nonmetropolitanareas will not necessarily be such in each area if there are not enoughapprovable applications to accommodate the allocated loan authority. Atthe time of end-of-year selection determinations, the Department may transferunused authority from Field Offices that are without sufficient approvableapplications to other Field Offices within the same State where there isnot sufficient authority for all approvable applications. When a FieldOffice jurisdiction covers more than one State, separate metropolitan ornonmetropolitan allocation areas may be established, to the extent practicable,for each State's part of the jurisdiction. Any amounts allocated to a Stateor to areas or communities within a State will not be reallocated for usein another State unless the Department determines that other areas or communitiesin the same State cannot use the amounts within that same fiscal year.In order to assure that applications are funded in the areas of greatestneed, approvable applications will be divided into two categories, eachof which shall have two subcategories. The categories and subcategoriesare as follows:Category A_Applications for the elderly projects which will be locatedin localities which have previously been underfunded relative to theirneeds and the funding needs of other localities.(1) Such applications for elderly projects which are in localities withinjurisdictions having rental vacancy rates of 5 percent or less;(2) Such applications for elderly projects which are in localities withinjurisdictions having rental vacancy rates in excess of 5 percent.Category B_Applications for elderly projects which will be located in localitieswhich have not been underfunded relative to their needs and the fundingneeds of other localities.(1) Such applications which are in localities within jurisdictions havingrental vacancy rates of 5 percent or less; (2) Such applications which are in localities within jurisdictions havingrental vacancy rates in excess of 5 percent. Applications shall be selected for funding first from Category A(1), secondfrom Category A(2), third from Category B(1), and finally from CategoryB(2). An application in a lower subcategory which is judged clearly superiorto one in the next higher subcategory, i.e., its final score is at least10 points higher, may be selected for funding. For example, if an applicationin Category A(1) has a final score of 57, and an application in CategoryA(2) has a score of 67, the higher-scored application may be selected overthe lower-scored application. The rule would not apply to projects thatare more than one subcategory apart, as for example, a higher-scored projectin either B(1) or B(2) could not be selected over a lower-scored projectin A(1). <ITAG tagnum="85">Schedule for Section 202 Invitations, Workshops and Application Deadline</ITAG>All applications for section 202 Fund Reservations submitted by eligibleSponsors must be filed with the appropriate HUD Field Office and must containall exhibits and additional information as required by 24 CFR 885.210,except as modified by this Notice. In April 1989, HUD Field Offices will publish a one-time Invitation innewspapers of general circulation, and in any minority newspapers servingthe Field Office jurisdiction. Field Offices will accept applications afterpublication of the Invitation. No application will be accepted after theregular closing time of the appropriate Field Office on June 15, 1989 unlessthat time is extended by Notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Applications that are mailed may be acceptedprovided they bear a postmark date or receipt of mailing that is no laterthan the regular closing time of the appropriate Field Office on June 15,1989. Organizations interested in applying for a section 202 Fund Reservationshould provide the appropriate Field Office with their names, addressesand telephone numbers, advise the Field Office whether they wish to attendthe workshop described below, and secure the program handbook and ApplicationPackage. HUD encourages minority organizations to participate in this programas Sponsors. Field Offices will conduct workshops during late April orearly May 1989 to explain the section 202 Program and the Seed Money Loanprogram under section 106(b) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of1968. Under this latter program, HUD makes direct, interest-free loansto approved nonprofit section 202 eligible Borrowers to cover certain preconstructionexpenses. At the workshops, Application Packages will be distributed, applicationprocedures and requirements (including the Department's equal opportunity,environmental, design and cost containment requirements and required exhibits)will be discussed, and concerns such as local market conditions, buildingcodes, historic preservation, floodplain management, zoning and housingcosts will be addressed. HUD strongly recommends that prospective applicantsattend the local Field Office workshop. More detailed information coveringthe time and place of the particular workshops will be set out in the FieldOffice Invitation. Interested disabled persons should contact the FieldOffice Invitation. Interested disabled persons should contact the FieldOffice to assure that any necessary arrangements can be made for them tobe able to attend and participate in the workshop. Section 162 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988) amended section 202 to better servethe special housing and related needs of nonelderly handicapped familiesand individuals. Section 162 authorized a new type of project assistancepayment to replace assistance made under section 8. On November 2, 1988(53 FR 44288) HUD published a proposed rule implementing the program. TheDepartment is analyzing the public comments received and will publish theCinal rule shortly. A separate Notice of Fund Availability for the FiscalYear 1989 nonelderly handicapped program will announce the deadline forfiling applications as well as the workshops to be conducted for the nonelderlyhandicapped program.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information</ITAG>(1) Part 885 currently requires the Borrower to be in existence when theapplication for the section 202 fund reservation is submitted, and requiresthe application to include specific information concerning the Borrower.In Fiscal Years 1986 and 1988, the section 202 NOFA permitted the Sponsorto delay the formation and submission of information on the Borrower untilafter the issuance of the fund reservation. Based on this experience, HUDhas determined that the deferral of the formation of the Borrower resultsin more and better applications, reduces the costs to Sponsors that arenot funded, and reduces HUD processing time and effort thus helping tomeet the tight deadline for application processing. Accordingly, the formationof the Borrower corporation will not be a prerequisite to submission ofan Application for Fund Reservation this fiscal year. The submission requirementfor Borrowers described in andSection; 885.210(b)(g), (12) and (13) may besatisfied with all application requirements with respect to the Sponsor,and in addition, the requirements imposed on the Borrower under andSection;885.210(b) (3), (4), (5), (7), and (8).Because the formation of the Borrower corporation is not required at theApplication stage, the applicants will be the Sponsors and the applicationswill be reviewed and rated based solely on the qualifications of the Sponsor,as well as other program requirements, as modified by this NOFA. If a Sponsorsubmits information on the Borrower, the information will not be reviewed,and approval of the application will NOT constitute approval of the Borrower.The requirements under andSection; 885.225 for issuance of the fund reservationto the Borrower are modified to provide that the fund reservation shallbe issued to the Sponsor and transferred to a separate single-purpose Borrowercorporation upon satisfactory compliance by the Borrower with all submissionrequirements and approval of its Conditional Commitment Application.The request for direct loan financing and Conditional Commitment Applicationunder andSection; 885.400 shall be submitted by an eligible single-purposeBorrower corporation created by the Sponsor receiving a fund reservationwhich shall submit with such Application evidence of compliance with therequirements waived at the fund reservation application submission stage.Any information below that makes reference to an eligible Borrower corporationis provided as guidance for use at the Conditional Processing stage.(2) In evaluating applications for section 202 Fund Reservations, the Department'sequal opportunity, environmental and cost containment requirements aresignificant factors in the ranking process. Further, in order to eliminateminimally qualified applications, only those proposals that meet certainthreshold scores on the standard ranking format will be considered forfunding. These requirements will be included in the section 202 ApplicationPackage available at the local HUD Field Office. The section 202 workshopswill include discussions of these and other application requirements.(3) Religious bodies may serve as project Sponsors, but must establisha Borrower corporation as a separate legal entity to be the owner, priorto the submission of a Conditional Commitment Application. When the Borrowercorporation is created, no reference to religion or religious purposesmay be included in the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of that corporation.The mere recital in a Borrower's Articles of Incorporation that it is organizedexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educationalpurposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal RevenueCode will not by itself make a Borrower ineligible. However, the dissolutionclause must provide that, upon dissolution or winding up of the corporation,its assets remaining after payment of all debts and liabilities, shallbe distributed to a nonprofit fund, foundation or corporation other thanone created for a religious purpose, which has established its tax exemptstatus under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.(4) Borrower corporations will not be permitted to engage in any otherbusiness or activity, including the operation of any other rental project,or to incur any liability or obligation not in connection with the proposedproject. The intent of this requirement is to give HUD sole claim to theassets of the Borrower corporation in case of default under the RegulatoryAgreement.(5) Sponsors, including churches, must have a current nonprofit tax exemptionruling under the IRS Code.(6) Applications will be accepted only from eligible Sponsors which mustbe eligible entities as defined in 24 CFR 885.5.(7) Because of the nonprofit nature of the section 202 program, no officeror director of the Sponsor or Borrower, or trustee, member, stockholderor authorized representative of the Borrower is permitted to have any financialinterest in any contract in connection with the provision of services,the provision of goods or supplies, project management, procurement offurnishings and equipment, construction of the project, procurement ofthe site or other matters whatsoever, except that this prohibition doesnot apply to any management contracts (or management fees associated therewith)entered into by the Borrower with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate.(8) Where the proposed project site is being optioned or acquired froma general contractor or its affiliate, the section 202 Borrower will beprohibited from selecting that contractor to construct the project forwhich an Application for funding is being made. Further, the proposed contractormay not be the attorney, architect, housing consultant or management agentfor the project. This prohibition extends to any firm or subsidiary havingan identity of interest with the contractor.(9) The Sponsor must have control of the project site at the time of submissionof its loan application. The contract of sale, option agreement, or otherbinding agreement must have been executed prior to the application deadlinedate.In cases involving sites to be acquired from a local public body, satisfactoryevidence of site control consists of evidence that the public body(a) possessesclear title to the land and (b) has entered into a legally binding commitmentto the Sponsor to convey the property to a Borrower corporation createdby the Sponsor upon its receiving section 202 funding. A mere recitationof intent to convey the land to a Borrower to be created by the Sponsormade by an official of the public body to the Sponsor or preliminary actionson the part of the public body are not adequate evidence of site control.(10) Under 24 CFR 885.215, no single Sponsor may submit an Applicationor Applications in any HUD Region for more than 300 units.(11) Reservations for projects intended for the elderly will not be approvedfor more than 200 units, including units for the elderly already on ornear the site, as well as the units being requested. This policy is intendedto expand the number of areas in the community where the elderly can livein housing specifically designed to meet their needs. This limitation doesnot rule out housing for the elderly in submarket areas of major citieswhere privately or publicly financed housing for the elderly already exists,but is designed to discourage additional housing for the elderly in proximityto existing privately or publicly financed facilities where the additionalunits would result in a concentration of over 200 units. However, the FieldOffice Manager may waive the requirement in a given area or locality, if,for example, there are no other suitable sites available for housing forthe elderly.(12) To be responsive to the Invitation, Sponsors must not request in asingle application more units than advertised for the respective metropolitanor nonmetropolitan areas designated in the Invitation, and the number ofunits applied for must not exceed any maximum number of units per Applicationthat may be established by the local Field Office. Applications exceedingthese limits will be rejected.(13) If the Sponsor elects to use a housing consultant, it should be carefulto select a consultant who is knowledgeable about the Section 202 housingprogram. Failure to meet program requirements will be a cause for rejectionof the application, whether or not a housing consultant is used by theSponsor. Sponsors may wish to contact previous groups which have used theconsultant under consideration in order to make a determination as to theconsultant's qualifications.(14) Deficiency letters will be issued by the Field Offices and the Sponsorswill be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of the letter to submitthe identified missing information or to explain inconsistencies in theapplication submission. No amendments or corrections to applications willbe permitted after the June 15, 1989 application filing deadline. Further,all necessary actions (e.g., adoption of corporate resolutions) must havebeen taken on or before the deadline date for filing applications.(15) HUD will make contact authority and budget authority under section8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 available for successful Sponsors,subject to the availability of funds.(16) A notice of approval will be sent to the Sponsors selected in accordancewith the requirements of 24 CFR 885.220 (Review of Application for FundReservation) and on the basis of information furnished by the Sponsorsas set forth in the Field Office Application Package.(17) To be considered for Fiscal Year 1989 funding, new applications mustbe submitted under this Notice of Fund Availability.(18) 24 CFR 885.410(j) contains a minimum capital investment requirement.This requirement applies to all section 202 projects receiving fund reservationsin Fiscal Year 1989. The minimum capital investment is currently establishedat one-half of 1 percent (0.5%) of the total HUD-approved mortgage amount,not to exceed $10,000. Section 106(b) Seed Money Loan Funds, under 24 CFRPart 271, may not be used to satisfy the minimum capital investment requirement.(19) HUD's regulations at 24 CFR Part 885 do not reflect several recentchanges made to the section 202 program that may be of relevance to Sponsorsmaking applications under this NOFA. These changes were contained in theHousing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, approvedFebruary 5, 1988) (1987 Act); and the Housing and Urban Rural RecoveryAct of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-181), approved November 30, 1983) (HURRA).Three statutory changes made in section 223(e) of HURRA have not, as yet,been covered by HUD's regulations. The statutory changes include:_HURRA added a provision specifying that, unless otherwise requested bythe Sponsor, a maximum of 25 percent of the units in a project may be efficiencyunits, subject to a HUD determination that such units are appropriate forthe elderly or handicapped population residing in the vicinity of the projector to be served by the project. The Department, in its annual housing noticegoverning each fiscal year's program, states that all projects for theelderly must include 25 percent efficiency units, unless a Sponsor candemonstrate that there is an insufficient market for such units. It alsoallows a Sponsor to choose to pay the additional cost of providing allone-bedroom units. (At its discretion, a Sponsor may elect to include morethan 25 percent efficiency units.) In a final rule revising Part 885 publishedAugust 5, 1987 (52 FR 29010), HUD indicated that this change would be incorporatedinto a pending proposed rule. HUD now intends to implement this HURRA requirementwith a proposed rule that addresses certain 1987 Act changes._HURRA also added a provision prohibiting the Secretary from denying anySponsor the opportunity voluntarily to pay for amenities or design featuresnot included in the loan. The annual housing notice specifies that a Sponsormay elect to pay for excess amenities that would not be permitted underthe Department's cost containment guidelines or, if the Department deniesa request for a waiver of the 25 percent efficiency unit requirement, mayelect to pay the additional cost of one-bedroom units. (Note: Payment forexcess amenities is permissible only if the residential characteristicof the proposal is not altered.) This change will also be incorporatedin a proposed rule making the 1987 Act changes._Finally, HURRA added a provision requiring the Secretary to take intoaccount special design features necessary for housing for the elderly andhandicapped and to adjust cost limits at least once annually to reflectchanges in construction costs. The Department modifies the base cost limitspublished in 24 CFR 885.410, as necessary, by adjusting upward or downwardthe high cost percentages for each base locality. HUD annually reviewsthe high costs percentages to assure that adjustments are made to reflectchanges in construction costs.
