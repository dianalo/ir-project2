Hundreds gathered for a noontime march and most businesses in theneighborhood participated in a three-hour work stoppage in thegrowing protest of the Justice Department's decision to deportOrlando Bosch.   ``We're trying to do the most that we can for Bosch,'' said SoniaAlfonso, a Cuban-American who closed her Universal Unisex hairsalon. ``If Cubans don't stand up for him, who's going to do it?''   The Justice Department announced last week it will deport Boschbecause secret U.S. intelligence information implicates Bosch inseveral bombings and assassination attempts during Fidel Castro's30-year rule of Cuba. The Justice Department has said its requeststhat other countries expel terrorists will not be taken seriously ifit grants asylum to Bosch.   The deportation order galvanized Bosch supporters, many of themCuban exiles who consider the 62-year-old pediatrician a patriot. Hehas been in federal prison since he returned to the United Statesillegally in February 1988.   His daughter, Myriam Bosch, said she was heartened by Thursday'sshow of support.   ``My father was never alone,'' she said. ``He's very happy to seethis kind of outpouring from the Cuban community.''   Demonstrators rallied at a monument to participants in the Bay ofPigs invasion.   ``Dr. Bosch isn't sitting alone in his jail cell. He's got theentire Cuban community sitting beside him,'' said Domitila Sanchez,a friend of the Bosch family. ``This is the most visible display wehave given to date. Never since the Cuban community arrived in Miamihave they united this strongly for a cause.''   Miami Herald Publisher Richard Capen told listeners of WQBA radiohe had raised the Bosch case during a recent meeting with PresidentBush, but that the president said he could not comment on the casewhile it was under review.   U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., has requested a meeting withPresident Bush to discuss the case, and a Spanish-language radiostation asked listeners to send telegrams to the White Houserequesting a review of the case.   Justice Department attorneys told U.S. District Judge WilliamHoeveler on Tuesday that the government would not deport Boschbefore July 14.   Hoeveler has set a Sept. 13 hearing to examine whether theJustice Department has handled the Bosch case properly.   Lauri Filppu, an attorney for the department, said the governmentprobably would not deport Bosch before the September hearing.   Bosch was jailed from 1968 to 1972 for firing a bazooka at aPolish freighter docked in the port of Miami. He then spent 11 yearsin Venezuelan prisons fighting charges that he masterminded the 1976bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 passengers. He wasacquitted three times in Venezuela.   Bosch's son, William, ended a protest hunger strike Tuesday formedical reasons. But at least 18 other supporters of Bosch said theywere on hunger strikes Thursday, while several would-be fasters wereturned away by a doctor who said they would be health risks.   Several Nicaraguan exiles joined the hunger strike. Severalothers marched through a Little Havana street Tuesday night carryinga casket they said symbolized what would happen to Bosch if he isdeported.   Nicaraguan exiles have identified with the plight of Miami'sCuban community because they fled their country after it was takenover by the leftist Sandinistas in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
