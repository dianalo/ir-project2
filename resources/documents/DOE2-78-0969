To remove the particles from thefibres the background magnetic field must be reduced to zero. The largesuperconducting magnets which are used to produce the background fieldcannot be de-energised quickly (i.e. in less than 1000 s). As the separatoris fully loaded in approximately 1000 s a way must be found to reducethe cleaning time significantly.</TEXT></DOC>
