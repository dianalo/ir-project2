Glendale isthe home of Paruyr Hayrikyan, an upstart Armenian whom theSoviets thought they got rid of when they stripped him ofcitizenship and dumped him in Ethiopia in 1988. Now thisexiled democrat is a registered candidate for election to theArmenian Supreme Soviet. Armenia has not yet reached thepoint of declaring independence like Lithuania. But voterswho hope this Sunday's election will bring change aremarching through the streets shouting &quot;Hayrikyan,Independence.&quot;   Over lunch at The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr.Hayrikyan outlined a future for Armenia. &quot;We need politicalindependence first, and then economic independence -- thehead must come before the stomach.&quot; He worries aboutindependence movements throughout the Soviet Union. &quot;AfterLithuania, we are sure: The Western governments are with thecommunists and the democratic movements are alone.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The answer, he believes, is for independence movements tojoin hands. In Paris last year, he helped to found Democracyand Independence, an umbrella group that pulled togetherexiled leaders of prodemocracy movements from many republicsof the Soviet Union. Democracy and Independence operates outof an office in Glendale whose answering machine talks tocallers in English and Armenian.   News of strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis hasovershadowed reports of democratic heroism from Mr.Hayrikyan's part of the world. Mr. Hayrikyan takes theclassic Armenian stance: He believes the disputed region ofNagorno-Karabakh &quot;was taken&quot; from Armenians by Moscow andgiven to Azerbaijanis.   But Mr. Hayrikyan argues that much of the inter-ethnicstrife has been fomented by Moscow to obscure theindependence struggle. During the past six months, Moscow hasopened its armories of tanks and guns to rebels from bothsides to escalate the conflict. In January, Moscow &quot;closedher eyes&quot; during six days of killing in which more than 100died. For now, he says, Azerbaijanis and Armenians havelittle hope of resolving their difficulties on hometerritory. But he hopes international meetings -- such as oneset up by Czech President Vaclav Havel for July 4 in Prague-- will ease the violence.   Hope is something in which Mr. Hayrikyan has a fair amountof practice. &quot;I was very young&quot; he says, recalling his firstarrest in 1969. He was arrested for his activities as leaderof what was then Armenia's only noncommunist party, theNational United Party. &quot;But I was a real anti-communist.&quot; Hespent the following four years in prison -- much of them insolitary confinement in a small cell. In 1974, he wasarrested again, and didn't go free until 1988. Of the 41years of his life, 17 have been spent in some form of prison.   Time behind bars was, for Mr. Hayrikyan, time to thinkabout what kind of freedom Armenia needed. &quot;I asked, `What isthe revolutionary way and what is the peaceful way?'&quot; Inprison he learned a new term that seemed to him like thepeaceful solution: referendum. &quot;When I talked about`referendum' after I got out of prison, people didn't knowwhat I meant. I had to explain -- referendum is the action ofdemocracy.&quot; He also used the prison time to studyindependence movements outside Armenia, and learned Latvianwell enough to do some Latvian-Armenian translation.   It was another talent that made Mr. Hayrikyan a nationalsymbol: songwriting. His last words to the Soviet court afterone prison sentence were: &quot;You may kill me, but after mydeath you have to fight against my songs.&quot; His words heldtrue. Armenians sing his lyrics: &quot;We are in prison, we are inexile, but, Fatherland, you will be free.&quot;   In the end the Soviets resorted to deporting their gadfly.But even this plan went wrong at first: Foreign governmentsrefused to accept Mr. Hayrikyan unless he came willingly, andMr. Hayrikyan preferred prison at home to exile.   Finally the Soviets found a country that did not seemfussy about whether Mr. Hayrikyan wanted to emigrate or not:Ethiopia. With seven KGB men and a doctor to babysit him, theArmenian was put on a nine-hour flight from Moscow to AddisAbaba. There Mr. Hayrikyan found asylum with the U.S.Embassy. Later, in Paris, he returned a pair of shoes the KGBhad given him. &quot;`These are for the Soviets' revolutionarymuseum,' I said. Shoes of the last person forcibly exiledfrom the Soviet Union.&quot;   Oddly enough, this kind of heroism has not always sat wellwith the large Armenian community in Glendale. Historically,many Armenians have seen Moscow as the Armenians' protectoragainst Turkey, the nation that killed so many Armeniansseven decades ago. Even today, many California Armenianssupport a tolerant attitude toward Mr. Gorbachev. When, in aninterview with a Turkish paper, Mr. Hayrikyan said Turks andArmenians should forget old differences, they got angry. ButArmenians closer to Moscow -- Armenians in Soviet Armenia --&quot;want my return&quot; says Mr. Hayrikyan.   For now, Mr. Hayrikyan's name is on the ballot. WhetherArmenians will get more than this contact with one of theirown nation's candidates depends on Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr.Hayrikyan, for one, is optimistic. &quot;Several years ago,Gorbachev was saying that the Soviet Union didn't need amultiparty system. Now he's saying different things.&quot;   &quot;Every change,&quot; he says, &quot;is good for Armenia.&quot;   ---   Miss Shlaes is deputy editorial features editor of TheWall Street Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
