The appeals court, split along ideological lines, reversed itself in three cases Friday, throwing out previously announced plans to have the cases decided by the full 11-member court and reinstating earlier opinions by three-judge panels.    The split was between five judges appointed by Democratic presidents, including four by President Carter, and five appointed since 1982 by President Reagan.    The deciding vote that broke this 5-5 deadlock was cast by Judge Laurence Silberman, another Reagan appointee. He apparently first voted with the other conservatives to have the full court hear the cases and then changed his mind.    The actions represent an unusual public display of politics in judicial decision-making. They also demonstrate the increasing polarization occurring in the country's federal appeals courts, with about one-third of the judges appointed by President Carter and more than one-third named by President Reagan.    Ideological differences in the appeals court for the District of Columbia could have an impact throughout the country. That court decides most appeals of federal agency decisions, from disputes involving Federal Communications Commission policy to lawsuits over Environmental Protection Agency regulations.    Moreover, it is from that appeals court that President Reagan nominated Judge Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court last summer and has selected Judge Robert Bork for the current vacancy.    The appeals court, known as the D.C. Circuit, once had a national reputation as one of the most liberal in the country. But the 11-judge court now has a six-member majority appointed by President Reagan and a vacant seat for which a Reagan nominee is awaiting approval by the Senate.    The dispute that became public Friday involved the practice under which a federal appeals court sometimes throws out a decision by a panel of three of its judges and rehears the case as a full court. In the D.C. Circuit, it takes a majority -- currently six judges -- to vote to rehear a case. It is a practice usually reserved for a handful of cases, because it takes up the court's limited time.    In recent months, however, the full court has agreed to hear what one lawyer familiar with the D.C. Circuit said were &quot;an extraordinary number&quot; of cases. While the details about who voted for rehearing aren't made public, courthouse sources say the conservatives in recent months were voting in a bloc to rehear cases in which they didn't like the outcome reached by primarily liberal three-judge panels. The decision to rehear a case automatically voids the three-judge panel's opinion.    On Friday, the court released six separate opinions explaining the conflict of whether to rehear the three cases. Liberal or moderate Judges Harry Edwards, Patricia Wald, Abner Mikva and Ruth Ginsburg, all appointed by President Carter, together with Spottswood Robinson, appointed by President Johnson, said the initial decisions to rehear the cases were &quot;ill-conceived,&quot; based on &quot;self-serving and result-oriented&quot; criteria.    &quot;Collegiality cannot exist,&quot; the liberals wrote, &quot;if every dissenting judge feels obliged to lobby his or her colleagues to rehear the case . . . in order to vindicate that judge's position.&quot;    Judge Silberman, the deciding vote, said in a separate opinion that he had &quot;reconsidered his views&quot; on rehearing by the full court and that they should be reserved for &quot;cases of exceptional importance.&quot;    Reagan-appointed Judges Bork, Kenneth Starr, James Buckley, Stephen Williams and Douglas Ginsburg said in a joint opinion that the three cases should be reheard because the three-judge decisions were &quot;clearly wrong&quot; or &quot;at the very least highly dubious.&quot;    In one case, the three-judge court ruled that a judge should hear a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional discrimination in Medicare benefits, although the amount in question is less than the $1,000 established by the Medicare law as a minimum for a lawsuit. The original 2-1 decision was written by Judge Edwards, with Judge Bork dissenting.    A second case involved a federal judge's dismissal of a lawsuit charging the District of Columbia police with violating an individual's rights. The appeals court reinstated the lawsuit in an opinion by Judge Ruth Ginsburg, with Judge Starr dissenting in part.    The third case involved a federal judge's finding that prosecutors were &quot;vindictive&quot; in charging persons arrested in an April 1985 demonstration outside the White House. The appeals court, in a 3-0 opinion by Judge Mikva, agreed that the facts allowed a presumption that prosecutors acted vindictively. </TEXT></DOC>
