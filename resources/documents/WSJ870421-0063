The company isn't Swedish or Norwegian, or even Irish. It's Oy Nokia, the flagship of Finnish industry and Finland's largest publicly traded concern. Like its homeland, Nokia has an image problem: Outside of Finland it barely has one.    But with publicity campaigns like the ones in Stockholm and Oslo, Nokia is trying to change that. Under its chief executive, Kari Kairamo, it has transformed itself from an insular maker of pulp, paper, chemicals and rubber into a fast-growing, international leader in such high-tech pursuits as televisions and mobile telephones. The company seeks to make itself better known outside Finland so it can sell more products and raise more capital abroad for even more growth.    Nokia &quot;wants to forget being a Finnish company and become more Scandinavian, more European,&quot; the 54-year-old Mr. Kairamo says. That's important because, with Finland's sheltered Soviet-bloc markets shrinking, Finnish industry is being forced into the more rigorous competition of Western markets. Nokia is leading the way and may be the most likely candidate to become Finland's first international company. But the irony is that in doing so, it may have to move its headquarters away from Finland -- an idea Mr. Kairamo has raised but hasn't formally proposed.    There are plenty of hurdles to completing Nokia's transformation. Mr. Kairamo is expected in the next couple of years to sell off some of the company's old core divisions to generate cash. He worries about rising protectionism. Already the company faces a shortage of engineers. And skeptics question whether Nokia has the financial or management muscle to compete on a broad front in the fast-moving electronics industry with its heavy marketing and product-development costs.    &quot;So far they've done pretty well, but there are nagging doubts that the easiest part is over,&quot; says Angela Dean, a telecommunications specialist who tracks Nokia for the London stock brokerage firm Robert Fleming andamp; Co. She adds that &quot;Nokia is big enough now to begin attracting attention from competitors.&quot;    Originally a pulp and paper maker located in the northern city of Nokia, the company first jumped into the spotlight in 1966 when it acquired a rubber manufacturer and a large cable concern. The resulting conglomerate was of awesome size by Finnish standards, and it sailed along serenely until the 1973 oil crisis.    That sent tremors through energy-intensive heavy-industry concerns like Nokia. Mr. Kairamo recalls that when the Nokia board took a hard look at the company's prospects, &quot;we came to the conclusion that we couldn't grow in Finland with cables or tires any more. . . . We decided to keep what we had but also to put all the new money we could scrape together into high tech.&quot;    Nokia thus set out to expand its electronics business, which a decade ago was only a small part of the cables unit. Now, electronics activities account for more than 40% of sales.    But few products bearing the Nokia brand name have ever reached dealers' shelves. That's because Nokia-manufactured personal computers are used almost exclusively in larger systems or sold to better-known rivals. Competitors like Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. and Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson acknowledge they sell equipment supplied by Nokia under their brand names. Other big-name concerns also sell Nokia equipment but don't want it advertised, Mr. Kairamo says.    For this reason, says Dennis Exton, a telecommunications analyst at the London stockbrokerage Paribas Quilter Securities Ltd., outsiders usually underestimate the size of Nokia's computer and telecommunications operations. &quot;Nokia has gone against the trend sometimes but carved out a very good niche for themselves by a typical Nordic willingness to listen to the customer,&quot; Mr. Exton says.    Nokia built its consumer electronics business with some major acquisitions. In 1983, it took full control of the Finnish concern Salora Oy, Scandinavia's biggest maker of color televisions. Previously, it had held a 17% stake. Then it acquired Luxor AB, Sweden's faltering state-owned electronics and computer concern. The resulting combination created one of Europe's biggest TV manufacturers.    Perhaps the most promising of Nokia's high-tech ventures is its Mobira Oy unit, set up in 1979 as a joint venture with Salora to supply phones for Finland's fledgling mobile phone network. Mobira's fortunes soared when Scandinavian countries in 1983 formed the world's first, and still largest, international network -- the Nordic Mobile Telephone System.    When Tandy Corp. proposed a joint venture to make mobile phones in Korea, Mobira quickly agreed.    Such joint ventures are the quickest way to build volume, but they also expose Mobira to risks. The penchant for partnerships shaves Mobira's profit margins, and the lack of a strong brand-name image &quot;leaves them extremely vulnerable&quot; to being shut out of a market if there should be a falling-out with a partner, observes Edward Mier, a telecommunications specialist in London for Dataquest Ltd., a consulting concern.    Moreover, analysts predict an imminent period of intense pressure on profit margins, spurred by price cutting by Japanese electronics concerns entering the mobile-phone business. As a result, Nokia is anxious to tap global sources of capital. Last year, well over half the new shares issued by Nokia were subscribed by investors outside Finland.    The company's prospects in foreign capital markets got an added boost in February when the Finnish parliament doubled the ceiling on foreign ownership in Finnish companies to 40% from 20%. The measure, says Nokia's finance director, Jorma Ollila, permits Nokia to issue as many as 10 million new shares, up from the present 47 million shares outstanding.    In the meantime, Mr. Kairamo must contend with other woes that could block the path of continued expansion. One is the threat of protectionism -- which could make Mr. Kairamo's dream of moving to a Common Market country come true sooner than many realize. &quot;Europe is going to be changing even faster, and European companies are going to emerge,&quot; Mr. Kairamo muses. &quot;People like (Italian financier Carlo) De Benedetti have already begun, and Finnish companies have to try and play the same game.&quot;    ---   Nokia: Finland's Corporate Giant Shares Outstanding:         47.85 million Employees:                  27,600                             Pre-tax                 Sales       Earnings               (In millions of dollars) 1983            $1,576      $ 94.3 1984             2,122       104.5 1985             2,499       189.1 1986             2,719       165.7</TEXT></DOC>
