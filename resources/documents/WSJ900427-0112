But their recent downturn is considered byanalysts here as mostly guilt by association rather thanfundamental investor disenchantment.   News of weak quarterly earnings and potential creditdowngradings at U.S. banks, along with similar trouble inJapan's banking sector, has focused attention on thevulnerability of the British banking sector, analysts andfund managers say.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If you're frightened about U.S. banks you're not going toget into banks in general,&quot; says Julian Robins, bankinganalyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., the investmentbanking and securities arm of Britain's largest commercialbank, Barclays Bank PLC.   &quot;Everyone is trying to draw parallels between the U.S. andBritish banks right now,&quot; says Christopher Ellerton, bankinganalyst for S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd.   But the comparisons, he adds, are &quot;not completely fair.&quot;   Many of the larger U.S. institutions have unveiled sharplyweaker earnings for the first quarter as a result of lowerborrowings for corporate takeovers, mounting bad loans andcuts in interest payments by Brazil and other Third Worlddebtors.   And in Japan, where banks are being hurt by weakness inthe Tokyo real estate sector, news hit the markets earlier inthe week that Moody's Investors Service Inc. was reviewingthe credit of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank, which areamong Japan's largest banking institutions.   All of Britain's five largest commercial banks reportedlower earnings in 1989 as a result of further loan-lossprovisions, the bulk related to credits to developingcountries. Of the top five, Lloyds Bank PLC and Midland BankPLC reported losses for the year.   While the 1989 results largely fell within expectations,analysts and bankers suggested 1990 would see further reducedprofitability in the core U.K. market as a result of highinterest rates and reduced consumer spending.   Analysts added that the banks would be increasinglyexposed to defaults within the real estate and commercialloan markets as a result of weak conditions overall in theBritish economy.   Even with that, bankers and analysts maintain that thesituation isn't necessarily as serious as in the U.S. andJapanese banking sectors.   They point to more solid U.K. foundations, namely theabsence of widespread bankruptcies now plaguing the U.S.savings and loan industry.   Also, British banks on the whole have diversified theirloan portfolios to hedge against a chain reaction ofdefaults. And they are tending to hold a greater proportionof traditionally secure home mortgages relative to theirAmerican counterparts.   &quot;If you look at the real estate on the books of U.S. banksvs. real estate on the books of banks here, the English banksaren't bad off at all,&quot; says Barclays de Zoett Wedd's Mr.Robins.   Analysts add that internally British banks have positionedthemselves for leaner times, moving aggressively in the pastyear to cut operating costs as a hedge against uncertaintimes.</TEXT></DOC>
