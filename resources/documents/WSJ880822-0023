That's what a federal judge ruled last week in the case of child prodigy Stephen A. Baccus, who applied for admission to the bar when he was 17 years old. The judge upheld the New York State bar's rule that an applicant must be at least 21.    However, Judge Gerard L. Goettel struck down as unconstitutional the bar's requirement that an applicant for admission to the state bar must have begun the study of law after age 18.    In 1987, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the bar's age requirement for applicants, stopping Mr. Baccus from taking the 12-hour New York State bar exam that year. Instead, he went to New York University, obtained a master's degree in computer science at age 18, and then moved to Miami to start his own firm.    Mr. Baccus began his legal education at the age of 14. He whizzed through University of Miami's law school and obtained his degree at 16. He then passed the Florida bar exam and was sworn in as the nation's youngest attorney when he was 17.    At his Miami firm, Baccus andamp; Marinello, Mr. Baccus is practicing in the areas of entertainment and computer law.    &quot;I am pleased that the more important part of the New York law, which would have prohibited me from taking the exam forever, was overturned,&quot; Mr. Baccus, now 19, said Friday. &quot;Of course, I'm disappointed that the '21' law stands.&quot;    Mr. Baccus said he doesn't plan to appeal the federal court ruling. &quot;By the time the case would get through the Second Circuit (federal appeals court), I would probably be 21,&quot; he said.    Instead, Mr. Baccus plans to apply again to take the New York bar exam in February 1989. At that time, he will be close to the age of 20 -- Feb. 25 is his birthday -- which might help him win a waiver from the &quot;21&quot; requirement, he said. Also in his favor, he said, is that he has been practicing law elsewhere.    He and his partner, who is 26 and a member of the New York bar, are considering opening a New York branch soon. If so, his partner would sign the papers and go to court, while Mr. Baccus would act in the capacity of a law clerk until he is old enough to take the bar exam.    Judge Goettel, in a 30-page opinion, said the thrust of the age-21 requirement is &quot;to help ensure that the New York bar possesses the requisite maturity to interact with clients and serve as effective advocates of their clients' interests.&quot; The bar, in effect, uses the age level as a &quot;presumptive gauge of maturity. . . .We cannot say that such a scheme is irrational.&quot;    However, the judge said Mr. Baccus's objection to the minimum-age requirement for a legal education &quot;has more bite.&quot; There is a difference between the maturity requirements of school and business. &quot;Law schools are not in the maturity business,&quot; said Judge Goettel. </TEXT></DOC>
