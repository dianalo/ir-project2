 As a separate wordprocessing column, however, The Working Word will provide an additionalopportunity to take an editorial look at new word processing applications,ancillary programs, and developing trends whose implications will affectevery reader who works with words.andM;One such trend is the increasing integration of graphical elements with wordprocessing, a trend epitomized by Microsoft' s recently released Word forWindows.andP;  The Windows graphical environment gives this new incarnation ofWord many of the capabilities of a page-formatting program such as PageMakeror Ventura Publisher; it also can display, while you edit, how your textlooks in Times Roman, Palatino, and a variety of other typefaces that youused to have to wait for your laser printer to crank out.andM;Overall, I found Word for Windows an enormously impressive product,especially when considered in the corporate context that is its naturalsetting.andP;  A detailed examination of some of its features must be deferred toa subsequent column, but even a mere enumeration of some of its features isproof enough that Word for Windows is as flexible and powerful a wordprocessor as you're likely to find.andM;* A print-preview procedure allows you to see the overall page layout, atwo-page spread, or a view of as much of your text as will fit on-screen.andM;* You can create tables including text and graphical elements automaticallyand with amazing ease.andP;  Once it's created, you can then customize a table'sappearance and the contents of each of its &quot;cells&quot; to suit your specificrequirements.andM;* For insertion and placement of pictures in the TIFF file format, Word forWindows treats the pictures as if they were ordinary characters.andP;  Onceinserted, however, images can be scaled and cropped, and text flows aroundthem automatically.andM;* Not only can you cut-and-paste spreadsheet data into your document via theClipboard, but (at least with Microsoft Excel) you can form an actual livelink that automatically updates the information of one program based onchanges in the other !andP;  * Document templates and style sheets simplify thetask of maintaining formatting consistency and can be modified easily usingpull-down windows.andP;  (While I find menu-based procedures in general-and Word's&quot;select, then apply&quot; formatting method in particular-a nuisance, many userswill consider these among the program's most appealing features.)andM;* Macro creation and editing have been enormously simplified, while the macroprogramming language (called WordBASIC) has been expanded.andP;  Macros can beassigned not only to key combinations, but also to the pull-down menus.andM;* Glossaries-Microsoft's term for what other word processors usually callkeystroke macros-can include pictures as well as boilerplate text.andM;* Multiple annotations and revisions can be separately made, tracked, andcompared using a split-window technique (called panes).andP;  Document reviewersmay be barred from making changes, and a document summary (including timespent editing) can be maintained.andM;* The document summary is used to provide full search facilities by filenameor text, though the multitiered procedure seems rather cumbersome.andM;* Up to nine documents can be kept active simultaneously, with full copyingand moving facilities for graphical elements and text.andM;* Scientific and mathematical equations can be presented on-screen and solvedfrom within the program.andM;* A nine-level outlining facility will help users organize their thoughts andtheir documents.andP;  Sections can be &quot;promoted&quot; (shifted a notch to the left inoutline form) or &quot;demoted, &quot; sentences can be made into headings, and thedisplay can be switched to show only information of a certain level or above.andM;* Spell-checking, thesaurus, mail-merge, indexing, tables of contents,figures, footnotes, and endnotes-all the accoutrements of full-featured wordprocessors-are supported.andP;  So is an enormous list of printers, though an HPLaserJet is required for some features.andM;THE GRAPHICAL CONNECTIONandM;With all this going for it, what more would I want from Word for Windows?andO;Leaving aside my personal antipathies toward mice and menus, I find theprogram unacceptably weak in actually working with words.andP;  Paradoxically, thegraphics environment that gives the program so much of its strength is alsoits Achilles heel.andM;No one doubts that printed books and the Times Roman fonts produced on alaser printer are easier to read and more aesthetically satisfying thantypescript copy and the monospace screen displays of traditionalcharacter-mode word processors.andP;  Graphically based applications such asWordfor Windows offer the possibility of visual high fidelity, usually dubbed&quot;true WYSIWYG&quot; (what you see is what you get).andM;When you're working with words, however, it is not a foregone conclusion thattrue WYSIWYG screen display-or even printout-is desirable at any point shortof the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; stage.andP;  As readers who have followed the sometimesheated debates on the subject on PC MagNet win know, this can be anemotionally charged subject.andP;  But here, from my own experience in workingwith editors at all levels at PC Magazine, are some of the situations inwhich it is not:andM;* Missing or erroneous punctuation marks are far easier to detect in amono-space than in a proportionally spaced environment.andP;  Moreover, for copyediting, missing underlining is easier to spot than the absence of trueitalics.andM;* Where copy must be marked, double-spacing is mandatory, and headline fonts,while they should be larger than body copy, should generally not be as largeas they will be in print.andM;* Editing a printout in 10-point Times Roman  the size that appears in PCMagazine) is ridiculous.andP;  A slightly scaled-up, 12-point representation (withcolumn widths correspondingly widened) is far easier to work with than trueWYSIWYG.andM;Additional problems with WYSIWYG arise when you do your editing at thescreen.andP;  For one thing, even VGA screens today provide nowhere near thenecessary resolution for reading small type sizes.andP;  The use of &quot;Greeking&quot; forsmall point sizes is universal, but you can't very well edit that.andP;  Word forWindows' help screens seem to be displayed in an 8-point Helvetica type thatI find desperately hard to read.andP;  (Microsoft seems to be aware of thisproblem, as it provides a page-printout option for the program's helpscreens.)andM;Indeed I find even the 10-point default (NORMAL.DOT) Times Roman screen fontused by Word for Windows very tiring on my over-40 eyes, and in either 10- or12-point Times or Helvetica, the screen resolution makes words like littlesignificantly harder to read than monochrome, EGA, or VGA monospace fonts.andO;(Positioning a mouse cursor properly within such words is also verydifficult.) All this translates into more time spent editing at thegraphics-based screen than if you were working in character mode.andM;Even on a 25-MHz 386 machine, I find that speed is still the great drawbackof graphics-oriented applications.andP;  Microsoft has done a commendable job ofspeeding up screen updates in Word for Windows, but again and again I foundmyself waiting for the display to catch up-sometimes long enough for thehourglass icon to appear.andP;  The moment you become aware that you're waitingfor the computer, you've broken your concentration, as Martin Buber wouldphrase it, your &quot;I-thou&quot; relationship with your words has popped back intothe everyday &quot;I-it&quot; relation.andM;This is a problem that will continue to bedevil writers and editors whoattempt to edit in graphics mode rather than character mode, even when theresolutions of screen displays improve.andP;  Doubling the resolution involvessquaring the number of screen pixels that must be turned on or off.andM;The present answer-incorporated in Word for Windows-to the screenresolution/screen speed problem is the provision of (you guessed it) amonospace draft-mode screen font.andP;  The program provides no handy keyboardshortcut to switch between draft and page display modes, so you have to go upto the menu to do so.andP;  You can, however, construct your own macro to assignthis function to a key.andM;I found Word for Windows' sans serif draft-mode screen font both morereadable and faster in displaying than the graphical screen fonts.andP;  I alsofound, however, that in toggling between draft and page modes, the displaywas often reset to the beginning of page 1, and that the draft-mode printoutstill came out in Times Roman.andP;  (I was working with a prerelease copy, andpresumably these small bugs will have been swatted in the final version.)andM;Draft mode makes entering and editing text easier, but it doesn't provide afully satisfactory solution.andP;  In draft mode, all character attributes(italics, boldface, and others) in Word for Windows are displayed asunderlined.andP;  Even the old green-screen monochrome PC did better than that,and I find it convenient to display different attributes with differentcolors: red for italics, white for bold, blue for superscripts, green forsubscripts, and so on.andM;More serious, however, is that the line breaks on the monospace draft font donot correspond to the line breaks of the typeface they are nominallyreplacing.andP;  Of course, not all character-based word processors use theirprinter-font-width tables to show true line breaks on a character-basedscreen.andP;  But some do, and this is an absolute requirement for my editing, atleast.andP;  I must know whether a given headline or subhead will fit in the one,two, or three lines allotted to it.andP;  You can do this in Word for Windows, butonly at the cost of shifting to the less-readable graphics-based screen.andM;The 1989 treaty protocols between IBM and Microsoft divide the PC world ofthe future into the Windows sphere of influence (all PCs with up to 2MB ofRAM) and the OS/2 Presentation Manager domain (all PCs with more than 2MB ofRAM).andP;  Since both of these application environments are graphics-oriented,the direction that future word processors will likely follow is clear.andP;  So,too, are some of the problems this creates for those of us who make ourliving working with, and not merely arranging, words.andM;TIPS FROM WORKING WORD SMITHSandM;Tell fellow users about your latest word processing tips, and we'll pay you$50 for any tip we print.andP;  Please send your letter on-disk along with aprintout.andP;  Mail your contributions to The Working Word, PC Magazine, One ParkAvenue, New York, NY 10016.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
