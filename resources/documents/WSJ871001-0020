Southern and Western states accounted for 90.9% of the 14.5 million increase in population between April 1, 1980, and July 1, 1986, the bureau said, with more than half the increase attributable to migration from other states and countries.    The bureau said California, Texas and Florida accounted for 53% of U.S. population growth from 1980 to 1986 and had the largest numerical increases. Since 1983, however, the growth rate in several energy producing states, including Texas, Louisiana and Utah, has dropped.    The fastest growing states were Alaska, with a population increase of 32.8%, Arizona at 22.1%, Nevada at 20.3% and Florida at 19.8%. Total U.S. population increased 6.4%.    The Northeast and Midwest accounted for only 9% of the nation's population growth. The District of Columbia, West Virginia and Iowa lost population during the period.    The national median age also rose to 31.7 years in 1986 from 30 in 1980.    The estimates were developed by using current data such as school enrollment figures, income tax returns and reported vital statistics against a base of 1980 figures. </TEXT></DOC>
