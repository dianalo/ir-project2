said Dan Yurman, who also is on theinformation management staff of the Environmental Protection Agency'sHazardous Waste Program.andM;&quot;Generally, there are formal limits on the scope of discussion about expertsystems.andP;  The task force won't impose any limits, and I think the governmentwill benefit from that,&quot; Yurman said.andM;The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created the taskforce in early March at its annual meeting in San Francisco.andM;In addition to Yurman, several other government officials have served on thesteering committee that formed the group.andP;  They included Ted Rogers, directorof the IRS' artificial intelligence laboratory, and Bruce Ramsey, a developeron Rogers' staff.andM;Air Force Capt.andP;  David Howell has been a major government presence on thesteering committee.andP;  Howell, is deputy director of the AI Program Office atthe Air Force Logistics Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio,acts as liaison to other expert systems applications developers and users inthe Defense Department.andM;&quot;We are experiencing an explosion of interest and activity in expert systemsapplications in almost all sections of government, business and education.andO;This is taking place due to the wide distribution of affordable expert systemshells on personal computers and workstations,&quot; Yurman said.andM;Yurman called expert systems the most mature and resilient products to emergefrom the AI community.andP;  He noted that the EPA has used expert systemssuccessfully to help clean up hazardous waste.andM;Yurman also noted that expert systems, when applied to specific knowledge-intensive applications, can improve productivity and return high yields.andP;  Heestimated that there are more than 2,000 operational expert systems, with 80percent running on PCs.andM;While the task force has been established as an international, wide-rangingactivity within the IEEE, it will have both functional and geographicalorientations.andP;  The Washington group probably will emphasize governmentoperations, because locally sponsored events will be tied to the majorinterest areas of expert systems developers and users, Yurman said.andM;Overall, the task force will sponsor activities at the national andinternational levels but also will support locally sponsored events.andP;  At thenational and international levels, task force members will publish anewsletter, exchange electronic mail, provide speakers for conferences,organize tutorials and symposiums, and convene meetings on standards.andM;The group will do this either on its own initiative or jointly with otherIEEE Computer Society functions, Yurman said.andM;Yet the task force's greatest benefits will come from regular discussionsamong its participants, Yurman said.andP;  &quot;In some ways this will resemble theinformal interactions of a user group,&quot; he said.andP;  In other ways, theinteraction will complement many of the activities within the IEEE ComputerSociety, he said.andP;  The task force will concentrate on several areas, &quot;inorder to cast the widest possible net to attract interest and participation,&quot;Yurman said.andM;He said these areas of emphasis will include expert system developmentstrategies, planning, testing and training issues, software maintenance anduser support.andM;Contact Dan Yurman, tel.andP;
