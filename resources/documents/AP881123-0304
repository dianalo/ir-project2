On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the Januarycontract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude, closed at $13.97 a barrel, up 11 cents from Tuesday'ssettlement price. The contract had traded as much as 74 centshigher. Other contract months also rose.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparentlyremained deadlocked Wednesday in its efforts to reach a newagreement on reducing the cartel's output and boost world crudeprices.   The ministers from the 13-nation cartel meeting in Vienna,Austria, postponed until Thursday a planned formal meeting scheduledfor Wednesday but continued to meet in small, informal groups.   Analysts said oil prices opened sharply higher in brisk tradingbut then began to backtrack after the announcement that the OPECministers had postponed their plenary session for the second timesince Monday.   Minutes before the early Thanksgiving eve closing at about 1 p.m.EST, a wave of frenzied selling drove prices sharply off theirhighs, analysts said.   Nevertheless, the market closed with a ``positive bias,'' saidMike McDermott, an analyst with Benchmark Futures Inc.   ``(Investors) think there is going to be an agreement but they'renot sure so they don't want to have an outright position'' goinginto the long weekend, he said. The U.S. oil markets will remainclosed until Monday.   In other futures trading, the prices of refined crude productsfinished the day mixed, with unleaded gasoline down sharply andheating oil up.   The December contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.87 cent agallon to 44.46 cents after rising more than a penny on Tuesday.Analysts said the drop was in response to an American PetroleumInstitute report showing gasoline stocks rose 6.5 million barrelslast week.   Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., saidthe higher gasoline supply reflected sharply higher imports andweaker consumer demand.   ``There had been talk of unseasonably high demand for gasoline,''Baker said. ``In fact, we have not had that kind of change. Gasolineconsumption trends are moderate and the market is selling offbecause of the adjustment.''   Heating oil for December rose 0.28 cent to 45.72 cents a gallon,pulled up by the higher crude prices, analysts said.   Despite the Thanksgiving Day holiday, analysts said some tradingwould continue Thursday and Friday through the London InternationalPetroleum Exchange.   Analysts said they expect OPEC either to reach some kind ofagreement by Friday or adjourn the meeting.   ``A couple of ministers have said they will return home by theend of this week,'' Baker said, ``so most probably the time for asolution is Friday. They can't see staying around if they don't havean agreement by then.''</TEXT></DOC>
