Meyer faces a difficult, dualtask: re-establishing Cincinnati Milacron Inc. as aworld-class competitor in the cutthroat machine tool businesswhile restoring its traditional level of profitability.   Mr. Meyer, Milacron's president and chief operatingofficer since 1987, yesterday was named to the additionalpost of chief executive officer of the maker of machinetools, plastics machinery and robots. The 53-year-old Mr.Meyer succeeds James A.D. Geier, 64, who will continue aschairman until year end, when he retires.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Meyer becomes the first chief executive who isn't amember of the Geier family since Frederick A. Geier,grandfather of the current chairman, bought control of theconcern nearly a century ago. All of the company's operationswill continue to report to Mr. Meyer, who was widely expectedto get the post. Directors didn't name anyone to fill Mr.Meyer's old title of chief operating officer.   Both competitors and analysts respect the depth ofmanufacturing technology Milacron's developed under theleadership of the retiring Mr. Geier, who headed the companysince 1970. He is credited with moving Milacron, the nation'slargest machine tool concern, into plastics machinery, robotsand electronic controls.   But in the early 1980s Milacron got ahead of the market.Milacron's big beige machine tools attended only by itscanary yellow robots, all controlled by computers, were thehit of many a trade show. Few companies, however, werewilling to lay out $10 million or $20 million for theflexible manufacturing systems in a bet that the newtechnology would work.   Meanwhile, aggressive Japanese producers -- aided by a lowvalue on the yen -- stole away sales. Foreign producers, ledby the Japanese, seized half of the U.S. market for machinetools, and beat out Milacron in many foreign countries aswell. Profits plummeted.   Mr. Meyer, a home handyman, has been putting together anorganization to fix Milacron's problems. Analysts say hisfinancial background already is creating a moreprofit-oriented company, though results still areunsatisfactory. He served as chief financial officer from1977 to 1987, and was elected to the board in 1985.   &quot;He has to create a fine balance between the bottom lineand a commitment to advanced technology,&quot; says EliLustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc. At thesame time, he's changing the corporate culture from &quot;a verypaternalistic company&quot; into a focus on profits, which takestime, says Mr. Lustgarten.   Milacron's sales in each of the past two years were justover $850 million, 9% below the nearly $935 million in 1981.And the company hasn't earned a satisfactory profit since the1982 recession. Net income last year was $17.4 million, or 70cents a share, and a third of that came from an extraordinarytax credit.   Yesterday the company reported first-quarter net income of$2.5 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with year-earlierprofit from continuing operations of $6.2 million, or 26cents a share. Net for the 1989 quarter, includingdiscontinued operations and a tax credit, was $10 million, or41 cents a share.   Sales rose slightly to $190.6 million from $188.3 milliona year earlier. The company had lower shipments of plasticinjection molding machines and other higher-margin products,officials said, but they expect improved profits in thesecond half.   Milacron is moving to a focus factory approach, where eachfactory specializes in one type of machine, such as lathes ormachining centers. The change from a bureaucratic, highlycentralized organization responsible for all types of machinetools and robots is intended to increase efficiency and tobring the people who design and manufacture the machines intocloser contact with the buyer.   &quot;Dan Meyer is the architect of Milacron's restructuring,and his promotion is a vote of confidence,&quot; saysPaineWebber's Mr. Lustgarten.   One of Mr. Meyer's reforms was pushing much of the Randamp;Dwork, including that for computerized advanced manufacturingsystems, out into the focus factories. Each factory is aprofit center, which exerts discipline on product developmentspending.   The next phase for Milacron is a redesign of many machinesto make them more efficient to manufacture, Mr. Meyer says.He cites an $80,000 vertical machining center produced byMilacron's British unit as an illustration of the newgeneration of &quot;world competitive machines&quot; that willrecapture market share.</TEXT></DOC>
