These battles have given the Republicans terrific opportunities, especially in presidential elections. But now some analysts, including some Republicans, believe that one price the GOP may be paying for its growth in the Reagan years is that many of the cutting issues in American politics may divide Republicans more than Democrats.    &quot;The divisions within the Republican Party,&quot; says Gary Orren, a Harvard University specialist in voting behavior, &quot;dwarf those within the Democratic Party right now.&quot;    Today's Democrats, for example, agree overwhelmingly that government cutbacks in social spending are bad; Republicans, according to a Time/Yankelovich poll late last month, are split evenly. Four-fifths of Democrats agree that government spending to assist the poor ought to rise, while Republicans are divided. And Democrats, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, agree that social spending should grow even if it means higher taxes; Republicans are split evenly. Democrats canvassed in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll want the president to compromise with Congress on the budget, even if it means a tax increase; Republicans are about evenly split.    &quot;The Democrats have a consensus on government, a clear acceptance of the fact it has a role to play in the economy and social life of this country,&quot; says Larry Berg, director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. &quot;That's not true in the Republican Party.&quot;    Democratic members of Congress, for example, have acted with remarkable unity in the first three months of this year, passing an $88.5 billion highway bill over President Reagan's veto and winning House approval of a budget plan.    To be sure, the Democrats' apparent unity may be ephemeral, based in large measure on the fact that, after six years of the Reagan presidency, many of the leading political issues are framed in Republican terms. If the burden of governing forces issues to be framed in Democratic terms -- how to address the trade deficit, for example -- and if Democrats are forced to create policy initiatives rather than respond to those of others, this unity may be in danger of dissipating.    Now that the Republicans have grown into a larger force, they are facing some of the same questions Democrats confronted when they sought to reconcile diverse elements of their party.    &quot;Because of the expansion of Republican constituencies in the last few decades, they're more vulnerable to being divided,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist. &quot;And the issues seem to be doing that.&quot;    Many Republicans agree that the party faces twin challenges in 1988: agreeing to a standard bearer and learning to manage the divisions that have been hidden from public view during much of the Reagan administration.    &quot;Republicans have changed in the past six years from a homogeneous party into a coalition, and one of the tests now is whether we can manage that coalition,&quot; says Robert Teeter, a Republican political pollster. &quot;Republicans have got to learn to tolerate conflict and controversy. It's the biggest test the Republican Party faces in 1988.&quot;    Ameliorating those differences will be particularly difficult as the party and its candidates seek to retain the support of the religious right while wooing the young, upwardly mobile professionals who have flirted with the GOP during the Reagan years but who haven't become emotionally committed to it. Many Republicans believe that danger is exacerbated as the Rev. Pat Robertson, a television evangelist, contemplates a presidential campaign.    &quot;Religion could be the kind of divisive force for the Republicans that race was for the Democrats,&quot; says William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;If Robertson runs, he could offend traditional Republicans. Like Jesse Jackson did in the Democratic Party, he could force his party to talk about something they'd rather not talk about.&quot;    At the same time, the party's candidates are campaigning for the nomination in a system that, because it rewards states that traditionally vote Republican, gives disproportionate voice to the right wing.    &quot;There is a danger that the Republican candidates will chart a course quite out of synch with the national electorate, including a major proportion of the Republicans,&quot; warns Douglas Bailey, a Republican political consultant. &quot;They may be making it very difficult for a Republican candidate to make an appeal to the middle of American politics.&quot;    Some Republicans, especially conservatives, believe the divisions the party faces are a fair price for growth.    &quot;The lesson here is that the Democrats are in lockstep and that the Republicans are still having a debate, and that's healthy for Republicans,&quot; says Phillip Truluck, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in the capital. Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, adds: &quot;Sure, we're fighting each other, but if you're going to become the party of ideas, you're doing well if you move the arguments into your tent.&quot;    But Mr. Phillips sees the specter of as much as a fifth of the GOP bolting to the Democrats, a level not reached in presidential voting since Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona was buried in the Lyndon Johnson landslide of 1964. Mr. Phillips notes that half of Republicans today disapprove of President Reagan's spending and tax positions and roughly two-thirds dissent from the Reagan administration's efforts to reduce federal involvement in health, poverty, housing and education.    ---   'Some people say President Reagan should reach a compromise with Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit, while others say he should not because such an agreement might include an increase in taxes. Do you think the president should agree to a budget compromise with Congress, even if it results in a tax increase?                            All      Dem.      Rep.      Ind.
