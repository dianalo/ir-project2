The suspension also prevents the information-systems concern from bidding on contracts with any executive branch agency.    Recognition said the suspension won't affect its five current Army contracts, but said those contracts cannot be expanded or renewed. It didn't disclose the size of the contracts, but said all government contracts provide less than 10% of its total revenue.    Recognition said it plans to appeal the suspension. As previously reported, the company and two executives were indicted last month on charges that they tried to manipulate the award of Postal Service contracts. The company has denied the allegations. </TEXT></DOC>
