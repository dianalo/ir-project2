The British colony has no plans toprovide more housing, and conditions in the centers coulddeteriorate seriously.   About 50,000 Vietnamese are in the detention centers, withroom for only about 4,000 more, the Japanese news agencyKyodo reported. More than 6,800 Vietnamese have arrived inHong Kong so far this year, exceeding the 6,045 total for allof 1990. In the past three days alone, 1,050 migrants pouredin.   Most of the boat people face forced repatriation, as theyare regarded as economic migrants, not political refugees.   Hong Kong's Legislative Council, angry about the surge inarrivals and the lack of international support for massrepatriations, has resisted spending for more housing for theVietnamese. Contingency plans call for converting classroomsand other areas in the detention centers into dormitories.                                                                                                          U.S.S.R. CELEBRATES SAKHAROV                                                                                                          Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev joined dissidents andworld dignitaries at a Moscow celebration of the late AndreiSakharov, the human rights champion Gorbachev freed fromexile only to face as a tireless critic. Long reviled as atraitor, the Nobel peace laureate and physicist who helpedspark the democratic movement in the Soviet Union, was hailedas a great 20th-century figure. In a ceremony markingSakharov's 70th birthday, a memorial plaque was unveiled athis home. He died in December 1989.                                                                                                          UNIFORM EC PHONE PREFIX URGED                                                                                                          The European Community Commission proposed using theprefix 00 across the EC for access to international telephonelines. Callers in the 12 EC member countries now must use aplethora of two- and three-digit prefixes. The EC's executivebody wants to have the new system in place by Dec. 31, 1992,though countries could adopt it later.                                                                                                          BRITAIN GETS TOUGH ON DOGS                                                                                                          Prime Minister John Major, telling Parliament he washorrified by brutal dog attacks, banned British imports ofdogs bred for fighting, and officials said some dangerousdogs could be put to death humanely. He invoked the order forbreeds such as American bull terriers. Recent pit bullattacks caused widespread outrage in Britain, but the countryhas no national dog registration and few laws to deal withnegligent owners.                                                                                                          PRAGUE CLEARS A LAND BILL                                                                                                          Parliament voted to return to potentially 3.3 millionpeople or their heirs some farmland seized after Feb. 25,1948, by Czechoslovakia's former Communist regime, and beforeJan. 1, 1990, two days after Vaclav Havel became president.The bill failed in a first vote last month. Land ofcooperatives, which cultivate 90% of farmland, will behandled in a separate measure. Laws on restitution andprivatization of nationalized industrial and businessproperty were passed earlier.                                                                                                          ALBANIA'S PAY OFFER REJECTED                                                                                                          Continuing a strike, Albanian workers' representativesrejected the Communist government's 50% pay-raise offer,saying it was linked to higher prices for many consumergoods. The union called the strike last Thursday, demanding a50% increase in wages and pensions, a workweek cut to 36hours from 48 and better job conditions for women. Thewalkout by about 300,000 of Albania's 1.8 million workers hascrippled most industries.                                                                                                          ITALY OPTIMISTICALLY PLANS AHEAD                                                                                                          The Italian cabinet approved a three-year budget plan thatforecasts rising growth, falling inflation and lowerunemployment.   It also pledged spending cuts and asset sales to hold downthe public debt, now about 100% of gross domestic product.The plan for 1992-94 comes as Rome prepares for tough talkswith unions and employers next month on overhauling nationalwage bargaining, crucial to keeping the economy on track.   The plan calls for 120 trillion lire ($93.38 billion) ofadditional spending cuts and revenue increases, and advocatesfunding this partly through asset sales of 10 trillion lire ayear. It forecasts inflation falling steadily to 4.5% in1992, 4% in 1993 and 3.5% in 1994 from this year's expectedrate of 5.8%. The economy is forecast to grow a real orinflation-adjusted 3% next year, 3.2% in 1993 and 3.5% in1994 after only about 2% this year. Unemployment, whichhovered near 11% early this year, is seen falling graduallyto about 9.6% by 1994.   Analysts regard these figures as optimistic. Even thetreasury minister conceded they are ambitious but said Italymust meet these targets to bring its economy into line withEuropean rivals.

Romania will use former Communist dictator NicolaeCeausescu's largely finished palace as parliament'sheadquarters and allocate $233 million to complete the Houseof the Republic, the world's second-largest building afterthe Pentagon, though legislative agencies will occupy onlyabout 28% of the structure. . . .
