(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police on Wednesday identified a murdervictim whose dismembered body was found in a freezer as a womanwith a record of prostitution arrests.   The body of Kimberly Hanlon, 30, a native of East Liverpool,Ohio, was discovered Sunday by two teen-agers, police said. It wasnot known when she died, said detective Maj. Tom dePolis.   Identification was made Tuesday afternoon based on fingerprintsfrom the woman's arrest record, which included severalprostitution-related charges, dePolis said. The last arrest was inAugust 1983, he said.   Ms. Hanlon was last seen alive in early 1984 by a sister wholives in north Tampa, dePolis said. The sister told police shereported Ms. Hanlon missing in April 1984, dePolis said, but policehave been unable to find such a report.   DePolis said Ms. Hanlon was dead when her body was dismemberedand placed in the freezer at the home of James Warren Bailey, whohas been charged by police with first-degree murder. AssistantState Attorney Michael Benito said the state will seek a murderindictment when the grand jury meets next week.   Bailey was being held in the Hillsborough County Jail withoutbond.   Homicide Capt. Buzz Sawyer said police don't know exactly whenthe woman was killed, but it apparently was between early 1984 andmid-1985, when James Jr., 18, son of the suspect, said he first sawthe body in the freezer but told no one about it.   Two teen-agers, the daughter of the suspect and a son of thesuspect's girlfriend, ignored admonishments to stay away from thelocked freezer on their back porch and pried it open Sunday. Theynotified police.   DePolis said the cause of Ms. Hanlon's death was being withheldbecause of the investigation.   While Bailey remains the prime suspect, dePolis said, ``we'renot positive who caused her death.''</TEXT></DOC>
