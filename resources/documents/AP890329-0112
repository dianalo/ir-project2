Col. John Reitz,an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.   ``We don't expect deliveries with the new design to begin untilMay,'' Reitz said in a recent interview.   In the meantime, the Army has decided to reduce by two-thirdsthe number of times gun already in use may be fired beforereplacing the chamber slide mechanism, the defective part.   Noting an accident earlier this year in which a chamber slideshattered, the Army reduced from 3,000 to 1,000 the number offirings allowed before the slide was replaced.   The change is expected to have little effect for the time being``because most personnel fire the pistol fewer than 100 times peryear,'' the spokesman said.   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. The Army,which has designated the 9mm pistol the M-9, is serving as theexecutive buying agent for all the services and awarded Beretta aninitial contract worth $75 million for 315,000 pistols.   Beretta USA is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker ArmiBeretta SpA and has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols. Itagreed last August to suspend deliveries, starting in September,until it corrected the problem of cracking slides.   At the time, company and Army officials announced that thegunmaker had agreed to change the way it made the metal slides byforging them with an improved heat process to ensure theirstrength. The company also agreed to fit each gun, including thosealready produced, with a pin device to capture any slide that didcrack.   The pin device would keep the slide or fragments from beingthrown back into the shooter's chest or face in the event of afailure.   When that agreement was hammered out last summer, Beretta andArmy officials said deliveries of the improved gun would begin inJanuary.   ``It's just taken longer than we thought,'' Reitz said.   Reitz said the production delay was not having much of an impacton the services because ``the troops still have their olderweapons; there's no shortage.''   Ralph Cole, a spokesman for Beretta USA, said Wednesday thecompany planned to begin delivering in April new slides and safetypin devices for guns already in use. He agreed with Reitz thatdeliveries of complete pistols would not resume until May, butdeclined to detail the reasons for the additional delay.   The January accident was the fifth in which a chamber slide on aBeretta cracked, sending fragments toward the shooter. In thiscase, Reitz said the incident left a Marine only slightly injuredbut prompted the Army to establish the new safety standard for gunuseage.   The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot isfired as part of the process of loading a new round into the gun'schamber.   In a related development, the Army spokesman said the Navy'sSEAL commando forces had ``backtracked'' and decided not to switchto the Beretta 9mm, in part because of concern over the slidefailures.   ``The Army agreed with that decision because of the specialcircumstances that apply,'' Reitz said.   ``First of all, their level of usage is just incredible, as muchas 30,000 rounds a year. And they're dragging the guns in and outof the water. So the Navy decided to look at other pistols and theArmy is going to do the same when it comes to our SpecialOperations Forces.''</TEXT></DOC>
