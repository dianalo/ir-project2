But is this really true?    The view that the U.S., for example, is a welfare laggard compared with European countries is based on a widely used measure of &quot;welfare effort&quot; -- the percentage of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) spent on social programs. On the face of it, this index has a certain common-sense appeal in characterizing a country's welfare effort as: &quot;How much it gives compared with what it has got.&quot; There are, however, several assumptions implicit in this conventional approach that deserve to be challenged.    A different measurement of welfare, which takes into account the social needs and tax burdens of individual countries, shows that among 10 industrialized nations, Sweden falls from second to 10th place while Japan rises to near the top of the heap. The U.S. and Canada also improve their relative positions.    The first debatable assumption of conventional measurements of welfare effort is: the more the better-countries that spend a high proportion of their GDP on welfare programs are leaders, and those that don't are laggards. In the absence of any criteria of need, however, this judgment amounts to an implicit indictment of the market economy as a way of allocating resources. Should a country with a relatively small elderly population be regarded as making an inferior welfare effort if it spends a lower proportion of its GDP on social security pensions than a country with a substantially larger group of elderly citizens? What if the first country spent less on the elderly as an overall percentage of GDP, but more per capita? If welfare efforts are made to achieve a desirable social condition, then to compare these efforts without reference to need implies that needs are either equal among the countries under comparison or irrelevant to the condition being pursued.    The second assumption is that taxes don't count in assessing welfare effort. But if two countries spend the same percentage of GDP on social welfare, and one collects proportionately twice as much in taxes as the other, are their welfare efforts equal? Surely the country with proportionately smaller tax revenues would be making a greater commitment to social welfare at the expense of other programs. It would be making less of an effort to collect taxes, but more of an effort to spend what it collects on social welfare.    These assumptions suggest there is another way to look at welfare effort, one that would factor in not only expenditures but also levels of need and the tax burden. A number of indicators might plausibly be used to compare social needs among countries. The percentage of poor people before the allocation of social-welfare benefits would offer, perhaps, the best estimate. These measurements are difficult to obtain. Not only are there limited cross-national data on the percentage of poor people that would exist without government programs, but definitions of poverty vary considerably among countries. Another approach is to focus upon those groups likely to be not working and in need of assistance, such as children, the elderly, single-parent families and the unemployed. While these indicators are less rigorous than accurate poverty statistics, data on the size of dependent groups are much more readily available.    What happens if we measure welfare effort by adjusting the conventional expenditure/GDP index for the proportion of tax revenues devoted to social welfare and for the relative size of dependent groups? Several notable changes emerge when 10 major countries' positions on the conventional index are compared with their ranks on the alternative measure -- what I call the Need, Expenditure, Tax (NET) index of welfare effort. Note especially the reversal of the positions of Sweden and Japan. Weighed down with the highest tax burden and level of need, Sweden drops to 10th place on the NET index. Buoyed by the lowest tax burden and level of need, Japan climbs to second place on the NET index. For similar reasons, but to a lesser degree, Canada and the U.S. also move up the scale.    (The 1980-81 period is used here because it is the most recent one for which comparative data on all the variables in the NET index have been compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Since 1981, changes in welfare effort have been relatively modest. The general trend in both the U.S. and Europe has been a leveling off in the growth rate of social-welfare budgets as a percentage of GDP.)    There are additional refinements that could be made to measure welfare effort. The NET index, for example, could include tax expenditures for social-welfare purposes along with direct government outlays for welfare. A refundable tax credit of $300 for child care in one country and a direct government payment of an equal amount for child-care expenses in another country yield the same financial relief to eligible families. The exclusion of tax benefits from an appraisal of social-welfare expenditures results in underestimating the welfare efforts of countries that rely most heavily on &quot;indirect&quot; provisions of social support through the tax system. However, a number of technical difficulties still limit a neat factoring in of tax expenditures.    Private and voluntary efforts also contribute to the care of dependent groups. An ideal measurement of expenditures would also factor in the value of cash and in-kind benefits that are transferred through charitable agencies and informal arrangements with family and friends. A country with a high amount of charitable giving would require less in the way of government programs to achieve a given level of welfare effort.    In Japan, for example, 64% of people over age 65 in 1980 lived with relatives, in most cases their children. In the U.S. the proportion of elderly living with their children declined to less than 14% in 1984 from 38% in 1957; still, estimates indicate that almost 80% of home health services for the elderly in the U.S. are provided by family members. Beyond family care, about 24% of U.S. citizens 14 years old and over did some volunteer work in 1975, two-thirds for more than 25 hours a year. Similarly, 20% of the Japanese interviewed in a 1982 poll had done volunteer work and the Minseiiin, an elite core of volunteers appointed by the Minister of Health and Welfare, made some 18 million home visits that year. National differences may play an important role in comparing the level of private provision of welfare among countries, but the data aren't sufficient to factor such differences into the NET index.    Admittedly, there are many ways to measure welfare effort. But the flaw in the conventional measurement is that it assumes that more direct public expenditures are better and that social needs and taxes are irrelevant to assessing welfare efforts. These assumptions create a one-sided view that there are obvious international leaders and laggards in the provision of social welfare. The NET index offers policy analysts a broader perspective on how to assess such efforts. From this viewpoint, the popular perception that countries such as the U.S., Canada and Japan are welfare laggards is no longer sustained by the facts.    ---   Mr. Gilbert is a professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley.
