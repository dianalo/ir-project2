Regina Gordilho, elected to public office for the first time inNovember, says she has received death threats almost every daysince her ``moralization campaign'' got under way.   Mrs. Gordilho, 54, was a small businesswoman until two yearsago, when her son was beaten to death by five state policemen.After a judge freed them all, she ran for the City Council and won.   Her Democratic Labor Party, which won the most seats, chose herto be the Council's president.   When she took office in January she found that about 3,000public employees worked for the Council, which had just 42 members.Many of them were friends and relatives of officeholders, earningsalaries of up to $600 a month in contrast to the national minimumwage of $64 a month and the average monthly wage in Rio de Janeiroof about $90.   It as a time, too, that the city government had imposedbelt-tightening measures and cut service cuts to save Rio deJaneiro from bankruptcy. Rio's streets were full of potholes,garbage often sat uncollected and hospitals and schools frequentlywere shut down.   Mrs. Gordilho focused on the 3,000 employees.   She discovered that many of them had been hired illegally and,though cashing paychecks every month, never came to work.   ``There's no need for more than 500 functionaries at theCouncil,'' she said in an interview. ``But councilmen are using theadministrative section to benefit themselves, their friends, andtheir families.''   Mrs. Gordilho investigated hiring practices and discoveredforged personnel documents. She demanded that all employeesreregister to receive their paychecks.   As a result, 398 employees hired with falsified documents werefired. About 500 others who failed to reregister were dropped fromthe payroll. Five ex-councilmen and three currently in office werearraigned on criminal charges, with three of the eight being fromMrs. Gordilho's own party.   ``We had 14- and 15-year-old kids _ relatives of councilmen _hired as advisers,'' she said.   She said one councilman alone was responsible for 93 fraudulenthirings.   ``The irregularities are so widespread, it will take some timeto discover them all,'' she said. ``But the certainty of impunityis gone forever.''   Mrs. Gordilho said it never entered her mind to become apolitical crusader until March 17, 1987, the day her son23-year-old son Marcellus was beaten to death by the state troopers.   He was surfing with several friends in a poor section of thecity when a misunderstanding arose with a trooper who claimedMarcellus had improper identification. The trooper and four of hiscolleagues decided to take Marcellus into the police station forquestioning.   When the youth struggled to avoid being thrown into the back ofa police van, the officers beat him so severely he suffered twobroken legs and brain damage. By the time Mrs. Gordilho arrived atthe hospital he was dead.   Mrs. Gordilho crusaded for punishment of the troopers, butdespite six months of legal action and street protests, a judgeexonerated four of the policemen.   The fifth, the commanding officer, was given a 18-month,suspended jail sentence, but he was able to keep his job because apoliceman can be dismissed only if sentenced to more than two yearsfor a crime.   She maintained that ``impunity for the powerful'' is a leftoverfrom Brazil's 1964-1985 military government and that ordinarycitizens ``still are struggling to recover their rights.''   Her attempt to clean up the city government has gained Mrs.Gordilho widespread backing. She said she has been receiving asmany as 300 letters a from all over Brazil.   Maria Helena Moreira Alves, a professor of political economy atthe University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, said Mrs. Gordilho'spopularity stems from ``a growing sense of outrage over corruptionat all levels of society.''   Mrs. Gordilho has her detractors as well, including those whothreaten to kill her in letters and in telephone calls.   ``The machine gun already has arrived from Paraguay,'' said aletter she received in March. ``The bullet will be a dum-dumwithout salvation.''   ``These sorts of abuses are common throughout Brazil,'' Mrs.Gordilho said. ``Somebody's got to try to change that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 16</NOTE></DOC>
