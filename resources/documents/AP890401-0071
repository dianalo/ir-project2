Exxon fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood on Thursday, thesame day the National Transportation Safety Board revealed bloodand urine tests taken about nine hours after the accident showed hehad been drinking.   On Friday, the state charged Hazelwood with three misdemeanorsand issued a warrant for his arrest, Alaska Attorney General DougBaily said today.   Hazelwood, 42, was charged with operating a motorcraft whileunder the influence, reckless endangerment and the negligentdischarge of oil.   The three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two yearsand three months, and fines totaling up to $10,000. If convicted,Hazelwood would have to spend at least 30 days in jail because hehas two prior drunken driving convictions in the past five years,Baily said.   Magistrate Tracee Schnell signed the arrest warrant forHazelwood, and set bond at $50,000. Authorities believe Hazelwoodleft the state several days ago, but Baily said the state wouldseek his extradition.   In Washington, the FBI said Friday it is looking at possiblefelony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the``negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters.'' Thestate is also investigating.   The 240,000 barrels of oil that spewed into Prince William Sounda week ago from the Exxon Valdez has now tainted more than 1,000square miles of water. Norwegian environmental specialists were enroute to advise cleanup crews, and wildlife officials feared tahtthe number of oil-slicked birds and sea animals would overwhelm alocal recovery center.   The iridescent slick began seeping into the Gulf of AlaskaFriday, threatening additional fishing communities and a 600-milestretch of coastline that includes a national park.   Workers at the Kenai Fjords National Park hustled to protectfertile salmon streams draining Alaska's rocky underbelly.   ``We expect the windward side of our boundary ... to beslimed,'' said park Superintendent Anne Costellina. ``There's not alot we can do about it.''   Ten sea otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to Valdez forcleaning, and federal wildlife experts said more than 1,000 taintedbirds _ some alive, some dead _ had been spotted on a single island.   Workers in Valdez hurried to build cages for an expected floodof oil-soaked otters at a wildlife recovery and rehabilitationcenter set up at Prince William Sound Community College. Butofficials expressed concerned that the center couldn't handle aburgeoning number of oil-soaked animals.   ``A thousand oiled live and dead birds in the whole scheme ofthings probably is not that significant,'' said EverettRobinson-Wilson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``But that'sonly one place in the sound. There may be many other places in thesound that bad that people haven't gotten to yet.''   The Alaska Department of Fish and Game estimated the sound'sotter population at 4,000 to 5,000 and said the otter is the area'smost plentiful marine mammal. Other marine mammals found in thesound year-round include sea lions, harbor seals, porpoises andkiller whales.   Meanwhile, the mayor of this picturesque coastal community saidFriday the ruptured tanker should be repaired elsewhere to preventfurther contamination.   Also Friday, angry residents, many of them fishermen who dependon the sea for their livelihoods, disrupted Exxon's daily newsbriefing, demanding to know why the company that owns the tanker isnot hiring them for the cleanup work.   A sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because ofthe spill.   Gov. Steve Cowper's office announced that the Soviet Union isplanning to send a skimming ship next week to help in the cleanup.   The Coast Guard said the disabled Exxon Valdez no longer wasleaking oil, but it could do so again when the vessel is moved.   Although about two-thirds of the 1 million barrels of oil thatremained aboard have been removed, the ship could be carrying up to50,000 barrels of oil and up to 600,000 barrels of oily bilge waterwhen refloating is tried, possibly Wednesday, Exxon officials said.   Valdez has the area's only port capable of handling the 987-footship that has been impaled on a reef 25 miles away since March 24.   ``If they bring that tanker in here leaking oil, then we'regoing to have oil in Valdez Bay,'' Mayor John Devens said, addingthat ducks, geese, wetlands and a fish hatchery could be threatened.   Devens criticized Exxon for not hiring townspeople to help inthe cleanup and accused the company of pressuring residents ``tosettle their claims hurriedly.''   The company said that it had established an emergency assistancefund, and that users were not precluded from making future claims.   The outburst at Friday's news conference broke up the briefingas security guards struggled with environmentalists trying to forcetheir way in.   The audience kept interrupting the proceedings with shoutedquestions and accusations.   Before the session disintegrated into chaos, Exxon spokesman DonCornett denied a reporter's suggestion that the spill has gottenout of control and the cleanup has been a failure.   ``Absolutely not, it has not gotten away from us,'' Cornettinsisted. ``We are making good progress on this cleanup.''   But he said later that only 300,000 of the more than 10 milliongallons of oil spilled have been recovered.   Exxon Shipping President Frank Iarossi said that ``most skimmingequipment is inefficient'' because of the changing consistency ofthe oil, which he likened to ``black mayonnaise.''</TEXT></DOC>
