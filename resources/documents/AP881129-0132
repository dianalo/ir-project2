Herring said Monday.   Just last month, Energy Department officials said their SavannahRiver Plant, near Aiken, S. C., would begin a phased restart of itsK reactor in December, and that it could resume production oftritium in January. None of the three reactors at Savannah River hasproduced weapons material since last April.   ``We are hoping to start (the K reactor) in the spring, summer,''Herrington said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We arenot going to start up or operate a reactor that we are not satisfiedis totally safe.''   Since October, engineers with the Energy Department and theoperating contractor, the E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., have beendeveloping much more stringent operating and safety criteria.   ``We're not slipping. We are using more caution, OK?'' Herringtonsaid in the interview.   ``I am satisfied with the progress. I think our start-upcriteria, our modifications and our upgrade are proceeding well. Ido not want to put a predicted date on the start-up,'' saidHerrington.   ``As we proceed toward start-up, we want to make sure thateverything is right. I don't want to have an arbitrary date ofDecember and then find out that all of the procedures are not inplace. I am now saying spring because I now think that is areasonable date. It may be that when we get to spring that it won'tbe til summer. I don't see it going much farther than that,'' hesaid.   The three reactors at Savannah River are the only operationalfacilities in the United States capable of producing two criticalnuclear weapons materials, tritium and plutonium. Herrington hastold Congress that the United States is ``awash'' in plutonium.   Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year andadministration and congressional sources say stockpiles will bedepleted badly within six months to two years, although the exactnumbers are classified. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen,is used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons.   Asked when tritium would be in critical short supply, Herringtonsaid: ``I think we are OK with spring and summer,'' but declined togive an exact date.   Herrington listed these new safety measures for Savannah River:   _Requiring the shift superviser to have an engineering degree.Officials at Savannah River say that nine out of the 12 shiftsupervisers hold degrees, and the gap can be closed by reassigningengineers from other duties.   _Adding more technical support on each shift.   _Using a five-shift rotation for key operations workers, one moreshift than before, freeing an entire shift for training at any giventime. This will double the hours each shift spends per year on acomputer simulator;   _Completing seismic reviews and modifications necessary to assurethe ability of safety systems to shut down the reactor, remove decayheat, and monitor conditions.   _Increase Energy Department headquarters oversight and approvalof key start-up procedures.   Both DuPont and the Energy Department are beefing up theirmanagement and oversight of the Savannah River Plant, officials say.For the first time, federal officials will be stationed directly ateach reactor rather than at the regional headquarters, which islocated at one edge of the sprawling 300-square-mile complex.   DuPont, which agreed to run Savannah River in 1950 at thepersonal request of President Harry S Truman, is turning theoperating contract over to the Westinghouse Corp. starting April 1.   DuPont has reassigned the senior official in charge of reactoroperations to Savannah River from company headquarters inWilmington, Del., 500 miles away. When the contract changes hands,the duties of 500 other key engineers who had been in Wilmingtonwill be moved to Aiken.   Herrington said that beause of the changes, Savannah River andother nuclear weapons facilities ``will emerge as a strongercomplex.''   He initiated a review of the 17 major weapons facilities shortlyafter taking office in February 1985, he said, and began a reformcampaign shortly thereafter, creating a new post of assistantsecretary for safety, health and environment with the power to shutdown plants.   ``After Three Mile Island (a partial meltdown of a Pennsylvaniautility reactor in March 1979), the commercial nuclear powerindustry got its act together. But the government procedures,policies, plans did not keep pace,'' he said.   ``A legitimate case can be made that some of our reactors ...were being run with a pre-Three Mile Island mentality,'' he said.Tighter oversight and monitoring are needed, he said, ``to bring usup to the level of training and operation that the commerical sectorhas attained.''</TEXT></DOC>
