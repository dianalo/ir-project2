In the year-earlier quarter, the freight railroad earned $83 million, or $1.21 a share. James A. Hagen, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that earnings advanced &quot;in the face of a drop in business, brought on by the general economic slowdown.&quot; Revenue slipped 4.6% to $835 million from $876 million.    For the rest of 1989, Mr. Hagen said, Conrail's traffic and revenue &quot;will reflect the sluggish economy, but Conrail will continue to take steps to control and reduce costs.&quot;    For the nine months, Conrail earnings grew 0.4% to $229 million, or $3.34 a share, from $228 million, or $3.31 a share. Revenue was flat at $2.59 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
