(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker says he andhis wife, Tammy, should have a chance to salvage the failingministry before its liquidation in bankruptcy court.   ``I think everybody else has had a chance,'' Bakker toldreporters Tuesday outside PTL headquarters. ``It's gone through somany regimes; it's being sold off. What would be wrong with givingJim and Tammy a chance?''   Similar previous pleas by the PTL founder to leaders whosucceeded him have been rebuffed.   PTL's opinion that Bakker could never return as the ministry'sleader has not changed, ministry spokesman David West said Tuesday.U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds, who is overseeing theministry's bankruptcy reorganization, ``agrees with the legalopinion presented by our attorneys that Bakker cannot return,''West said.   Bakker, who left the television ministry in March 1987 amid asex-and-money scandal, returned to PTL's Heritage USA theme park atthe request of Roe Messner, its primary builder and PTL'ssecond-largest creditor.   Bakker said the meeting was to back up Messner's claims againstPTL in bankruptcy proceedings.   He said he was shocked by what he heard in the meeting withMessner and attorneys for PTL, Messner and Bakker. Bakker said mostthe records left behind when he left PTL were destroyed. ``Almostall of the blueprints of all the buildings are missing,'' he said.   When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, ``Anyof them who might want to take over the ministry.''   Pressed for specifics, he said, ``I don't know.''   Bakker said he wants to buy back the ministry if it isliquidated.   ``I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do,''he said. ``As every piece of ministry comes up for sale, I wouldbuy it to restore it to the people it was meant for.''   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt. A reorganizationplan calling for the sale of much of PTL's assets is up for finalapproval by Reynolds in Columbia on June 16.   ``I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' Bakkersaid, adding that the future ``looks bleak'' for the ministry. ``Wewant it brought back. We want it redeemed.''   Later, at the offices of the Bring Bakkers Back Club andConcerned PTL Partners, Bakker said he was back to stay ``untilHeritage USA is a full Christian retreat again.''   The Bakkers have left their home in California, and arereturning to their home in Gatlinburg, Tenn., said Bakker attorneyRyan Hovis.   ``We are here today to say we are going back on television,''Bakker told about 60 jubilant supporters at the Brinn Back BakkersClub. ``If the good folks at PTL won't let Jim and Tammy try tosave PTL, then we'll go on television ourselves out here and wewill make our appeal to the nation.''   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a churchsecretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter withhim. His departure was followed by revelations the Bakkers led alavish lifestyle at PTL.   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigatingBakker, and he is involved in lawsuits with PTL and former Bakkerattorney Roy Grutman.</TEXT></DOC>
