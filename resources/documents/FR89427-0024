Daphne Reese, Margie G. Hegy, Project Manager, and ChristenaGreen, Project Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), authorizesthe Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating toestablish traffic separation schemes (TSS) and shipping safety fairways,where necessary, to provide safe access routes for vessels proceeding toor from United States ports.Shipping safety fairways and TSSs are different measures which providesafe port access routes for vessels. Where the primary risk to vesselsis collision with offshore structures, a shipping safety fairway is anappropriate routing measure. Where the primary risk is collision with othervessels because of disorganized traffic patterns, a TSS is the preferredrouting measure.A TSS is an internationally recognized routing measure that minimizes therisk of collision by separating vessels into opposing streams of trafficthrough the establishment of traffic lanes. To be internationally recognized,a TSS must be approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).IMO approves TSSs only if the proposed routing system complies with IMOprinciples and guidelines on ships routing. Vessel use of a TSS is voluntary;however, vessels operating in or near an IMO approved TSS are subject toRule 10 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,1972 (72 COLREGS).A shipping safety fairway is an area in which no fixed structures, temporaryor permanent, are permitted. Vessel use of shipping safety fairways ofvoluntary and the direction of traffic flow within the shipping safetyfairway may be recommended. Shipping safety fairways and inhibit explorationfor and exploitation of mineral resources in the designated area. Shippingsafety fairways, however, may be a necessary measure to reconcile convenientmineral exploitation needs and concern for navigation safety. Presentlythere are three IMO approved TSSs and one shipping safety fairway off thecoast of California: a three-pronged TSS in the approaches to San FranciscoBay; a TSS through the Santa Barbara Channel; a two-pronged TSS in theapproach to Los Angeles/Long Beach; and a shipping safety fairway off PointHueneme.Before either a new TSS or shipping safety fairway can be established,the PWSA requires the Coast Guard to conduct a port access route studytaking into account all other uses of the area under consideration andensuring that the interests of all affected parties are considered. Theseuses include, as appropriate, the exploration for, or exploitation of,oil, gas or other mineral resources; the construction or operation of deepwaterports or other structures; the establishment or operation of marine orestuarine sanctuaries; and activities involving recreational or commercialfishing. Publication of a notice of study advises all bidders in futurelease sales that occupancy rights within the study area may be restrictedby a routing system developed as a result of the study. In the interestof promoting a multiple use approach to offshore waters, the Coast Guard,as far as practicable, will try to minimize impacts on other uses of thearea. Once a shipping safety fairway or TSS is designated under the authorityof the PWSA, however, the paramount right of navigation is recognized withinthe designated area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory History</ITAG>The 1978 amendments to the PWSA required the Coast Guard to undertake aport access route study to determine the need for traffic separation schemesor shipping safety fairways to increase vessel traffic safety in offshoreareas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The Coast Guardinitiated this study by publishing a Notice of Proposed Study on April16, 1979 (44 FR 22543).For the purposes of the port access route study, the U.S. coastline wasdivided into 32 geographically defined areas. Study area 22 included thecoast of southern California and was assigned to the Eleventh Coast GuardDistrict for study. Study areas 23 to 25 included the central and northernCalifornia coast and were assigned to the former Twelfth Coast Guard District.Through public participation and government agency consultation, the studiesevaluated potential traffic density patterns, waterways use conflicts,and the need for safe access routes in offshore area.The Study Results for the coast of southern California (area 22) were publishedon June 24, 1982, at 47 FR 27430. An additional study of the Port AccessRoutes, Northern Approach to Santa Barbara Channel, was announced on July26, 1984, at 49 FR 30078, with results of that study published on December5, 1985, at 50 FR 49861.The Study Results for the central and northern coast of California (areas23-25) were published on October 14, 1982, at 47 FR 46043. An additionalstudy on Port Access Routes, Entrance to San Francisco Bay was announcedon December 17, 1984, at 49 FR 48946, and the study results were publishedon May 8, 1986, at 51 FR 17071.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposal</ITAG>The port access route studies recommended amendments to the TSSs currentlyestablished off the coast of California and the designation of new shippingsafety fairways to establish a comprehensive safe routing system for vesselsproceeding to, from, or between the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles/LongBeach. The Coast Guard believes the proposed routing measures are necessaryto meet present and future needs of safe navigation by providing clearlanes for vessel traffic between San Francisco and Los Angeles/Long Beach.The proposed routing measures represent the most practicable reconciliationbetween safe access routes and the needs of all other reasonable uses ofthe areas involved.The proposed California offshore routing system includes the followingelements: (1) Los Angeles/Long Beach TSS_amendments to the TSS and precautionaryarea in the approach to Los Angeles/Long Beach, and establishment of ashipping safety fairway overlaying the Los Angeles/Long Beach precautionaryarea;(2) Santa Barbara Channel TSS_an extension of the TSS approximately 18miles northwest and a shift in the lanes of the southern section of theTSS;(3) Coastal Fairways_Establishment of two parallel one-mile wide shippingsafety fairways along the central California coast connecting the SantaBarbara Channel TSS and the San Francisco TSS; and(4) San Francisco TSS_amendments to the lanes of the TSS and the precautionaryarea and establishment of a shipping safety fairway overlaying the reconfiguredprecautionary area and a new TSS segment in the main ship channel.The details of each of these elements are discussed below.Los Angeles/Long Beach TSSThe TSS in the approaches to Los Angeles/Long Beach is comprised of theSouthern Approach, the Western Approach and a precautionary area. The TSSwas approved by IMO in 1975. As a result of the port access route studiesfor southern California, the Coast Guard believes navigation safety willbe improved if the following modifications are made to this TSS: shiftinga lane in the Western Approach to the Los Angeles/Long Beach TSS; reconfiguringthe precautionary area; and establishing a new shipping safety fairwayoverlaying the precautionary area.<ITAG tagnum="81">Western Approach</ITAG>At the time of the study, vessels were departing from Long Beach, turningwest at the breakwater and crossing through the pilot boarding area toenter the northbound lane of the TSS. The modification to the Western Approachconsists of reducing a portion of the TSS separation zone from two milesto one mile in width; relocating the outbound lane one mile to the south;and merging the existing two-mile separation zone at a slightly adjustedturning point in the TSS. This adjustment will alleviate the problems ofvessel traffic crossing in and near the pilot boarding area at the harborentrance. This modification was approved by IMO in 1983.<ITAG tagnum="81">Precautionary Area</ITAG>The port access route study found that the eastern side of the precautionaryarea was not normally used by vessels proceeding in or out of the TSS lanes.The Coast Guard proposes to reduce the size of the precautionary area bymoving the eastern boundary away from the coastline, releasing the unusedarea to offshore oil and gas activities or other uses. The western boundaryof the area will be extended to connect with the outbound lane of the adjustedWestern Approach TSS. The northern boundary will be moved south to lineup with the breakwater. This modification was approved by IMO in 1983.<ITAG tagnum="81">Shipping Safety Fairway</ITAG>As a result of the port access route studies, the Coast Guard proposesto designate a shipping safety fairway to overlay the precautionary area.This change is necessary to resolve the potential conflict between vesselnavigation and offshore oil and gas activities in the area between theWestern Approach TSS lanes and the Southern Approach TSS lanes. At thepresent time there is no express prohibition against structures being erectedwithin a precautionary area. Establishment of the shipping safety fairwayto overlay the precautionary area will prohibit fixed structures in thisarea.The Santa Barbara Channel TSSThe TSS in the Santa Barbara Channel, comprised of a north-westbound trafficlane and a south-eastbound traffic lane between Point Vicente and PointConception, was approved by IMO in 1973. The Coast Guard proposes extendingthe north-west end of the TSS and shifting the lanes off Anacapa Island.<ITAG tagnum="81">Lane Shift</ITAG>The lanes of the Santa Barbara Channel TSS would shift one-half mile southwardat a point off Anacapa Island, resulting in a slight shift at the westerlyend of the present scheme, and a readjustment of the turning point whereit joins the existing TSS ``In the Approaches to Los Angeles/Long Beach.''This modification is intended to facilitate development of a known oiland gas field while protecting traffic lanes from interference by offshorestructures. The modification was approved by IMO in 1983.<ITAG tagnum="81">Extension to Point Arguello</ITAG>The Coast Guard originally proposed a thirty mile extension of the SantaBarbara Channel TSS but IMO did not approve the entire extension. InsteadIMO approved an extension of the north-west end of the Santa Barbara ChannelTSS 18 miles north-west to a point 13 miles off Point Arguello. This extensionwill carry traffic west of an area expected to undergo offshore developmentfor gas and oil in the future. Exploration in the area shoreward of thisproposed extension has revealed large quantities of resources, and platformsare anticipated to be located in this area as development takes place.The modification was approved by IMO in 1985. The IMO has conditioned extensionof the TSS on the placement of a radar beacon and light on platform <T3>``Harvest'',</T3> located at position 34anddegrees;28.09andmin172;N, 120anddegrees;40.46andmin172;W,to ensure vessels can fix their position when entering the TSS.Shipping Safety Fairways Off CaliforniaThe Coast Guard had originally considered the establishment of a five-mile-wideshipping safety fairway between the San Francisco TSS and the Santa BarbaraTSS. This five-mile width was intended to provide space for designationof TSS lanes if the need arose in the future, and to allow room for adjustmentif a narrowing of the shipping safety fairway was the only means of providingaccess for future offshore development of a particular area. The largenumber of offshore tracts which could not be leased if a five-mile-wideshipping safety fairway were established caused the Coast Guard to modifyits proposal. The Coast Guard determined that two one-mile-wide shippingsafety fairways would still serve the purpose of providing obstructionfree corridors for coastwise traffic.This rulemaking proposes two parallel one-mile-wide shipping safety fairwaysapproximately 165 nautical miles long between the southern end of the IMOapproved San Francisco TSS extension and the end of the IMO approved extensionof the Santa Barbara Channel TSS at Point Arguello. Shipping safety fairwaysare needed in areas where blocks have been leased off the central Californiacoast in the Santa Maria Basin near Point Conception, and where exploratorydrilling has confirmed that the area has promise as a major site for oiland gas production.A Congressional moratorium and action by California state and environmentalgroups have limited the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to offering onlya few blocks for lease in offshore California. Preliminary indicationsare that several areas off the coast of California, including the SantaCruz Basin near San Francisco, are of high interest to offshore developers.Since MMS has adopted an area wide leasing plan, it is impossible for theCoast Guard to identify the exact areas where drilling is likely to beconcentrated until leases are actually awarded. Because of expected industryinterest and the uncertainties inherent in MMS area wide lease sales, theCoast Guard believes that the proposed shipping safety fairways best meetthe mandate of the PWSA that safe access routes be established to reconcile,as far as practicable, the potential for future multiple use conflicts.The Coast Guard proposes to place the shipping safety fairways in areaswhere it is essential to guarantee obstruction free routes to vessel trafficduring the time of oil and gas exploration and exploitation off California.The shipping safety fairways are especially important in this area whereIMO navigational requirements for establishment of a TSS cannot currentlybe met, but where a right of way for navigation is necessary as offshoreareas are leased.Off San Francisco TSSThe TSS in the approaches to San Francisco, comprised of the Southern Approach,Main Approach, Northern Approach, and a precautionary area, was approvedby IMO in 1973. As a result of the port access route studies, the CoastGuard proposes modifying the Southern and Northern TSS segments; renamingthe Main Approach segment; reconfiguring the precautionary area; redescribingthe separation zone within the precautionary area as an ``area to be avoided'';establishing a new TSS segment over the Main Ship Channel into San Francisco;and establishing a new shipping safety fairway to overlay the precautionaryarea.<ITAG tagnum="81">Southern Approach</ITAG>The Southern Approach lanes would be rotated approximately two degreesin a clockwise direction away from the coastline and would be lengthenedby approximately 28 miles. This adjustment would have the effect of routingtraffic two miles further away from the coast. Vessel traffic would travelno closer than five miles to the coastline. The lengthening of the trafficlanes would help to separate opposing traffic transiting coastwise betweenSan Francisco and the Santa Barbara Channel. It would also provide saferouting for vessels transiting through the Santa Cruz Basin, an area ofhigh interest to offshore oil and gas developers.<ITAG tagnum="81">Main Approach TSS</ITAG>Although no modifications are proposed to the original Main Approach TSSsegment, it will be renamed the Western Approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">Northern Approach</ITAG>The Northern Approach lanes will be slightly rotated in a counterclockwisedirection, to keep vessel traffic approximately a mile further offshoreand away from the Point Reyes-Farallon Island Marine Sanctuary.IMO has approved the modifications to these three segments conditionedupon the establishment of a radar beacon at Ano Nuevo, on the central coastof California near the termination of the southern lane of the scheme,to ensure that vessels can adequately fix their position when enteringthe Southern Approach lanes of the TSS.<ITAG tagnum="81">Main Ship Channel TSS</ITAG>A new TSS segment will be established over the Main Ship Channel in theentrance to San Francisco Bay. The present traffic pattern in the MainShip Channel is divided into separate east and westbound lanes by the arrangementof aids to navigation in the channel and by recommendation of the San FranciscoVessel Traffic Service. The effect of this change will be to make Rule10 of the 72 COLREGS mandatory on vessels approaching the entrance to SanFrancisco Bay.<ITAG tagnum="81">Precautionary Area</ITAG>The Coast Guard proposes that the existing precautionary area in the OffSan Francisco TSS be reconfigured to exclude certain shoal areas that arenot suitable for safe navigation. The existing precautionary area is acircular area six miles in radius from the center at the Large NavigationBuoy (LNB). This IMO approved precautionary area may imply to inexperiencedmariners that the entire precautionary area is available for navigation.However, the eastern part of this area contains several hazardous shoalareas. The U.S. charts appropriately indicate a break in the circle ofthe precautionary areas for these shoals. The IMO has approved a reconfigurationof the precautionary area to exclude these shoal areas. This will contributeto safe navigation by clarifying the safe waters when proceeding into SanFrancisco Bay.<ITAG tagnum="81">Separation Zone</ITAG>The Coast Guard proposes to appropriately redesignate the present separationzone under IMO guidelines as an ``area to be avoided.'' The use of a circularseparation zone of one-half mile radius centered on the LNB in the IMOapproved precautionary area has been effective in keeping mariners awayfrom the buoy. However, a separation zone is intended only to separateopposing lanes of traffic, a function which does not apply in this situation.This modification would not alter the purpose of the area or reduce navigationsafety. It would serve only to bring the scheme into alignment with IMOdefinitions and principles. The redesignation of this area has been approvedby IMO.<ITAG tagnum="81">Shipping Safety Fairway</ITAG>The precautionary area in the San Francisco TSS is at the junction of fourTSS segments. Placement of structures in the precautionary area would createa hazard to navigation. At the present time there is no express prohibitionagainst structures being erected within a precautionary area. A shippingsafety fairway overlaying the precautionary area is the most appropriatemeans of keeping the precautionary area free of obstructions for the paramountright of safety of navigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Future Adjustment Process</ITAG>The Coast Guard is aware of the multiple use conflicts which may arisein the future due to the restrictions and regulations governing shippingsafety fairways and TSSs. The PWSA provides discretion for adjusting designatingrouting measures to accommodate other needs, if the need cannot be reasonablyaccommodated otherwise. The adjustment, however, cannot unacceptably adverselyaffect the purpose for which the existing designation was made and theneed for which continues. Generally, where vessel traffic lanes (TSS orshipping safety fairway) are one-mile-wide, underlying resources are accessiblevia directional drilling. In the future, however, adjustments to vesseltraffic lanes may be appropriate to allow recovery of known oil, gas, ormineral deposits. If that situation develops, a port access route studywould be conducted to determine whether alternative routing is possiblethrough areas where other lease rights may be affected and whether, inthe case of a TSS, the proposed adjustment would conform with IMO guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>The proposed regulations are considered non-major under Executive Order12291. They are, however, considered significant under Department of Transportationregulatory policies and procedures (DOT Order 2100.5 of May 22, 1980).A draft regulatory evaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemakingdocket. It may be inspected and copies at the Marine Safety Council, U.S.Coast Guard, Room 3600, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday exceptholidays.The proposed offshore routing system, comprised of shipping safety fairwaysand traffic separation schemes, is necessary to increase the level of navigationsafety along the coast of California. The proposed routing systems recognizethe paramount right-or-way for navigation. TSS segments will reduce therisk of vessel collisions in areas of heavy traffic density by separatingthe vessels into designated directional lanes. The shipping safety fairwayswill reduce the risk that vessels will collide with oil and gas drillingplatforms in areas of offshore development.Impact on the Shipping IndustryThe distance offshore of the proposed routing system varies depending uponthe configuration of the California coastline, the complexity of the offshoreport approaches, and the extent to which traffic routes can be kept direct.The system is approximately nineteen miles off Point Arguello, thirty milesoff Morro Bay, and eight miles off Point Sur.The proposed routing system follows current traffic patterns along thecoast of California, with one exception. In the area off Point Conception,the proposed extension of the Santa Barbara Channel TSS would route trafficslightly further west than its present direct course. The PWSA mandatesthat routes be established where conflicts with safe navigation are determinedto exist. This routing will encourage vessels to navigate clear of theknown areas of most concentrated present and expected future drilling activityin the Santa Barbara and Santa Maria Basins.Since development has not been permitted within a substantial area offthe central and northern California coast, it is difficult to assess whateffects the proposed lanes will have on vessel traffic patterns. The CoastGuard intends to review the lanes after they have been in place for sometime to ensure they are accomplishing their purpose.Several alternative routing configurations were given consideration duringthe three port access route studies, the results of which are the basisof this rulemaking. Some of those alternatives considered locating theTSSs and safety fairways as much as fifty miles offshore. However, thefurther offshore the routing, the greater the impact to the shipping industryin additional hours in transit time between ports, and the likelihood thatthe routing would not be used.The Coast Guard anticipates that vessel traffic which operates along thecoast of California for navigational and commercial convenience will continueto do so. Vessels which routinely operate further offshore will not movecloser to shore to use a routing measure unless there is an advantage indoing so. Similarly, those vessels operating close to shore to take advantageof aids to navigation and a radar return from objects on the shorelinecannot be expected to move further offshore unless it is in their navigationalor economic interest.Neither traffic separation schemes nor shipping safety fairways will bemandatory for vessels. A vessel voluntarily entering an IMO approved TSSbecomes subject to Rule 10 of the 72 COLREGS. Rule 10 requires that vesselsproceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of trafficflow for that lane. It also requires that vessels shall not normally entera separation zone or cross a separation line. Fishing vessels are allowedsome latitude to operate in the separation zone, but they shall not impedethe passage of any vessel following a traffic lane.Impact on the EnvironmentImplementation of the routing system itself will have no direct effecton the environment of the coast off California, and will have only positiveeffects by reducing the risk of casualties. Implementation of the rulewill provide deep draft vessels with established navigation routes betweenLos Angeles/Long Beach and San Francisco where structures will not be permitted,and where lanes of opposing traffic will be separated.The proposal will benefit the marine environment to the extent it reducesthe risk of pollution from vessel/structure or vessel/vessel casualties.The shipping safety fairways will prohibit erection of structures in areasof expected offshore development. However, at this time the total numberand exact location of future structures is unknown. Therefore, an accurateassessment of the risk of casualties between vessels and structures isdifficult because of the limited data on future offshore development. Therisk of collision between vessels and structures, with resulting oil spill,has been demonstrated in the Gulf of Mexico. Twenty years of experiencewith the shipping safety fairway network in the Gulf of Mexico providessome evidence that shipping safety fairways reduce the risk of casualtiesin areas where offshore structures are numerous along popular navigationroutes.The San Francisco and Santa Barbara Channel TSS amendments will reducethe risk of vessel/vessel casualties by extending the TSS lanes into areaswhere the need for traffic management was shown to exist by the port accessroute studies.Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that this action will not havea significant impact on the environment.A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is on file in the docket.Impact on Endangered or Listed SpeciesThe Coast Guard prepared an environmental assessment on the proposed offshorerouting system with particular attention given to any potential impacton the California Sea Otter. The assessment concluded that this routingsystem will have no adverse effect on endangered species or any criticalhabitat designated as endangered or threatened pursuant to the EndangeredSpecies Act of 1973. The Coast Guard will discuss with the Fish and WildlifeService any comments on sea otters or other marine life which are submittedin response to this proposed rulemaking.The modification to the San Francisco TSS, which shifts the northern approachaway from the coast, is specifically intended to keep traffic further awayfrom the Point Reyes/Farallon Island Marine Sanctuary.Impact on Offshore Leasing and DevelopmentThe PWSA requires that the Coast Guard establish safe access routes formovement of vessel traffic proceeding to or from U.S. ports. Expected developmenton the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California will resultin the acquisition of leases and the uncontrolled placement of structureswhich would interfere with the establishment of safe routing measures inthe future. The Coast Guard, in anticipation of future offshore resourcedevelopment, is proposing to establish shipping safety fairways and toextend existing TSSs to create a comprehensive system of vessel routingmeasures. The proposed routing measures reconcile, as far as practicable,the potential conflict between resource development and safety of navigation.The proposal to extend the TSSs and establish shipping safety fairwaysin advance of extensive offshore development is similar to actions takenby the COE when it first developed its system of shipping safety fairwaysin the Gulf of Mexico. This proposal will establish safe port access routeswith minimal restrictions on future offshore development. This rulemakinghas no impact upon present lease holders and the Coast Guard believes itwill have the least adverse impact upon future lease blocks.The primary economic impact of this proposal will be its effect on theMinerals Management Service (MMS) offshore leasing program. Shipping safetyfairways prohibit erection of structures such as drilling platforms andcould make oil and gas deposits inaccessible. Also, the oil and gas industryis likely to be reluctant to bid on blocks that have surface occupancyrestrictions. The perceived value of a block to a prospective bidder wouldbe reduced by the additional costs of operating in areas with these encumbrances.This would result in fewer bids in MMS lease sales and ultimately in reducedoil and gas recovery as well as lost revenues to the Federal Government.The Coast Guard originally considered establishing a five-mile-wide shippingsafety fairway along the coast of California connecting the San Franciscoand Santa Barbara TSSs. This was not acceptable to MMS because a largenumber of offshore tracts would be totally precluded from oil explorationand development. The proposed TSS extensions and the two one-mile wideshipping safety fairways, separated by a two-mile wide non-fairway area,would provide structure-free corridors for coastwise traffic. No singlethree-mile square lease tract would be entirely foreclosed from explorationor development. The two one-mile wide fairways along the coast will havelittle or no effect on resource development because industy can exploreand develop affected resources form surface areas directly adjacent tothe vessel traffic lanes, inlcuding the two-mile corridor separating thenorthbound and southbound lanes. The Coast Guard invites comments on thepotential resource impacts of this proposal.The Coast Guard also proposes to overlay the San Francisco and Los Angeles/LongBeach precautionary areas with shipping safety fairways. In the San Franciscoprecautionary area, vessel traffic from eight TSS lanes (four inbound andfour outbound) converge and pilots embark and debark vessels, arrivingor departing the port of San Francisco. In the Los Angeles/Long Beach precautionaryarea, two inbound and two outbound TSS lanes converge. This area also haspilot embarking and debarking areas. The entrances to the port of Los Angelesand port of Long Beach are through two openings in the breakwater and allvessels must enter the precautionary area when arriving at or departingfrom these ports. In these high density vessel traffic areas where marinersare already on notice to navigate with caution, the Coast Guard believesthe erection of structures would present an unacceptable additional riskto navigation safety.The shipping safety fairways overlaying the precautionary areas will prohibiterection of structures and will preclude potential resource developmentin the San Francisco and Los Angeles/Long Beach precautionary areas. Thegreat majority of the San Francisco precautionary area is already underdeferral from leasing by the Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary,the Point Reyes Wilderness area, as well as an additional area deferredby the Secretary of the Interior.MMS estimates that the potential loss of revenues to the Federal Governmentresulting from this proposal is significantly less than $100 million annually.The Coast Guard anticipates that future population shifts, changes in transportationroutes, knowledge of resource locations, and technological breakthroughsmay make adjustment to the fairways desirable. If this occurs, the CoastGuard will restudy the affected areas, and, if appropriate, modify thefairways.In circumstances where it is asserted that structures must be placed inan area designated as a shipping safety fairway or TSS to gain access tosignificant quantities of oil or gas, a request for adjustment would begiven the appropriate consideration in accordance with the PWSA and rulemakingprocedures. A port access route study will normally be required beforea rulemaking can commence.The Coast Guard believes that the proposed routing system effectively meetsthe mandate of the PWSA to reconcile the need for safe access routes withthe needs of all other uses of the area, and minimizes the potential economicimpact on MMS's offshore leasing program and future offshore development.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility</ITAG>The Coast Guard certifies, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (94 Stat. 1164; Pub. L. 96-354), that this proposed rulemakingwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. If any economic impact results from the proposed shippingsafety fairways, it will be felt by major oil companies which compete foroffshore lease rights in the area affected by the fairway restrictions,and by the Federal government to the degree that revenues from royaltiesmay be deferred while production is inhibited by a shipping safety fairway.A substantial number of small businesses, local governments or organizationswill not be economically affected.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>33 CFR Part 166Anchorage grounds, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Waterways, Shippingsafety fairways.33 CFR Part 167Navigation (water), Vessel, Traffic separation scheme.In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend 33CFR Parts 166 and 167 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 166_SHIPPING SAFETY FAIRWAYS</ITAG>1.
