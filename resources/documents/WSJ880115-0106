Some people thought so when the New York Yankees plucked slugger Jack Clark away from St. Louis last week. But Mr. Clark moved more out of pique than for profit after talks with the Cardinals soured. St. Louis insisted it would have topped New York's offer of a two-year contract for $1.5 million a year plus incentives that could total $650,000 a year.    So it goes in the acrimonious world of baseball's labor relations. Owners may bid on some select free agents, and a few of them may actually change teams -- but rarely for economic reasons. And to the players' union, that still constitutes collusion and price-fixing. &quot;The locks aren't on as tightly as they used to be, but it's still far from a free market,&quot; insists Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.    Indeed, for the third straight year, the union is expected to file a grievance contending that management has conspired to restrict bidding on free agents, those players who, after at least six years of major league duty and the expiration of their contracts, seek to market their services to the highest bidder. Last fall, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that owners had conspired to close down the market for free agents after the 1985 season.    This is emerging as a pivotal year on baseball's labor front. Arbitrator George Nicolau has been hearing testimony in New York this week on the union's 1986 grievance, which most sports law authorities consider an even more-compelling example of collusion than the 1985 case. On Monday, Mr. Roberts begins hearings in the remedy phase of the 1985 case. Both arbitrators are expected to rule by spring, decisions that will go a long way toward determining the future of the free-agent market and the likelihood of a crippling strike when baseball's current labor agreement expires after the 1989 season.    In reality, free agency hasn't existed in baseball since Peter Ueberroth transferred his considerable financial-management skills to the commissioner's office after the 1984 Olympic Games. Suddenly, teams were talking about fiscal responsibility and the foolhardiness of wildly bidding on free agents. So they didn't. Period.    But things opened up a bit this year. Cleveland's Brett Butler accepted a contract offer from San Francisco. Chili Davis and Mike Davis moved down the California coast from San Francisco and Oakland, respectively, to Anaheim's California Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers. A half-dozen teams bid for journeyman pitcher Dennis Martinez, enabling him to pry a hefty raise out of the Montreal Expos, for whom he performed last season. &quot;With certain groups of players, particularly superstar players and effective pitchers who may not be superstars, there is some kind of market activity,&quot; says Ronald M. Shapiro, the Baltimore lawyer who represented Mr. Martinez.    Yet, for the second-straight year, Detroit Tiger pitcher Jack Morris, who has won more games in the 1980s than any other pitcher, received just one offer -- from the Tigers. He returned to his former employer, as did most top-drawer free agents. Those who did change addresses rarely did so for much more money than was being offered by the present team.    Even the signing of Mr. Clark by the Yankees isn't that encouraging, says Stephen F. Ross, a sports-law authority at the University of Illinois. &quot;Jack Clark represents a thawing of the market in the sense that the previous market not only was collusion on price, but a boycott -- nobody was bidding on other teams' players at any price,&quot; Mr. Ross says. &quot;Ultimately, he's not that encouraging because he was not bid away from the Cardinals.&quot;    Part of the problem, player agents say, is that management negotiators are openly exchanging information about contract offers. &quot;In our judgment, that's still a form of rigging the market,&quot; says Randal Hendricks, a Houston agent. Even in cases where several teams make offers, Mr. Hendricks says, the bids all land within a tight salary range -- as if that range had been predetermined. And preference is still given to the player's old team, he insists, with other bidders careful to stay close to that team's offer. &quot;There is a group viewpoint to low-ball and hang together,&quot; he says. &quot;What the clubs are trying to do is figure how close they can get to breaking the law.&quot;    Management denies any wrongdoing. Free agents, they say, are expensive and haven't always given owners their money's worth. &quot;I still think clubs evaluate it from the standpoint of what's in their best interest,&quot; says Tal Smith, a former baseball executive and currently a consultant who represents several teams in arbitration hearings.    Any boost to the free-agents' market this year came primarily from more realistic expectations from players and their agents, contends Mike Port, general manager of the California Angels.    Still, concern over the pending arbitration rulings prompted the Player Relations Committee, management's labor arm, to discourage direct communication between clubs about free-agent dealings, says Barry Rona, PRC executive director. &quot;We've told the clubs if they're seeking salary data to go through us as a conduit, we have no vested interest,&quot; he says. &quot;We can obtain data for them without the appearance of collusion.&quot;    Agents disagree, and the issue will surely be part of the union's yet-to-be-filed 1987 grievance. In light of the increased market activity, the exchange of data may be the union's best evidence of continued collusion, although it isn't a &quot;lead-pipe-cinch argument,&quot; says Robert Berry of Boston University, an authority on sports labor law. &quot;I think there may be a winnable case this year, but it will be much more difficult.&quot;    The union hopes that stiff penalties in the current grievances, will crack open the market. If, however, arbitrators impose a fine of, say, $10 million, that amounts to only about $400,000 a team, points out Mr. Hendricks, the agent. &quot;And maybe they've saved $2 million a team&quot; from the conspiracy, he adds. &quot;They've got to say, 'That's cheap, let's keep it up.'&quot;    Beyond monetary damages, the union is expected to request that free agents affected by the conspiracy be given the option to test the market again. (That prospect reportedly squelched a proposed trade of Detroit's Kirk Gibson, the top 1985 free agent, to Los Angeles.) &quot;We're obviously opposed to it,&quot; Mr. Rona says. &quot;It goes beyond the remedial stage and is rewriting the basic agreement.&quot;    Meanwhile, if the owners' position doesn't change, Mr. Hendricks says, it will force the union to also act in concert. One proposal: Certifying a small number of agents to represent players. In that way, the union, with the power to withdraw certification and shut an agent out, could keep more control over contract talks, ensuring that some maverick agent couldn't accept an offer that would lower the market.    Such proposals only add to the bad feelings brewing between owners and their employees, agents say. And it increases the chance of a crippling strike two years hence. &quot;There are so many hard differences between players and owners and I have seen no efforts toward peace,&quot; says agent Tom Reich. &quot;I see no reason whatsoever to be optimistic that there won't be a serious work stoppage.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
