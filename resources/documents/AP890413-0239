The conclusions of politicians often vary widely from those ofeconomists, so the conflict isn't unusual. Political decisionsoften make bad economics and bad economics often have strongpolitical backing.   What is unusual is that some of those who see only benefits tothe rich in a lower capital gains tax are the same ones who see athreat to poorer folks in another proposal: Limiting thedeductibility of interest on home mortgages.   As that law reads, a homeowner is entitled to deduct interest onmortgages totaling $1 million, a level which obviously excludeslower and middle-income homeowners. Only the wealthy could attemptor afford to borrow that much money.   In contrast, hard-working, middle-income families who haveinvested or saved small sums for long periods of time _ denyingthemselves in order to meet long-term goals _ could benefitenormously from a capital gains tax cut.   Nevertheless, respected members of Congress, such as Rep. DanRostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,defend the $1 million ceiling as a threat to the poor whileopposing a tax cut as a gift to the rich.   The most popular rationales for the apparent inconsistenciesinclude these:   _If you lower the $1 million ceiling on home-mortgagedeductibility you open the door to more cuts. Said a real estatespokesman: ``All it takes is a pen (for Congress) to scratch outone zero and $1 million goes to $100,000.''   Therefore, it is argued, a stand must be taken at $1 million;otherwise, the poorer households are indeed endangered, if notimmediately then in the future. Congress, it is said, might even betempted to erase the deduction.   For this reason, say Realtors, Rostenkowski has assured themthat as long as he remains chairman of Ways and Means the ceilingwill remain where it is.   _While recent history shows that reductions in capital gainstaxes can lead to much higher revenues _ because people feel freerto cash in long-term investments such as homes or stocks at lowerrates _ some studies suggest only minimal revenue gains.   Such are the ingredients of political disagreements.   Somehow lost in the oratory, however, is the very basis for thearguments: The rich versus the poor _ the contention that the poormust be saved even if the rich are denied. A noble stance, perhaps,but is it straightforward?   Assume an investment of $5,000 in stocks, held for seven years.If the appreciation averages 10 percent a year you will haveapproximately doubled your money. Your capital gains would be$5,000, your tax $1,400.   But, while you appeared to have earned 10 percent, your realgain was only 6 percent a year because of inflation. At 6 percentyour money won't double in seven years; it will grow to only $7,000or so. Your taxes remain at $1,400.   After taxes, your investment, therefore, is only about $5,600,an average gain of $100 a year for having denied yourself the useof the money and, in fact, put it at risk.   Because your capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, what ifyour investment lost money, thereby lowering your income? Would yoube able to claim a lower tax base? No. Gains count, losses don't.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, April 14</NOTE></DOC>
