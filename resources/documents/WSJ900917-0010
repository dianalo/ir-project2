Vagley, president of the trade groupfor property and casualty insurance companies, told the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee panel.</LP><TEXT>   The hearing was held in connection with the subcommittee'sinvestigation of insurance company insolvencies.   Mr. Vagley said the AIA is considering several proposalsto complement state insurance regulations, including federalminimum standards and the creation of a self-regulatoryorganization.   The trade group official said the most serious problemconnected with state regulation of insurance companies &quot;isthe lack of will on the part of state regulators to takeaction against troubled insurers.&quot;   He added, however, that the insurance insolvenciesdetailed in a February report by the oversight subcommittee&quot;were not representative of the thousands of well-managedcompanies that characterize the property-casualty insuranceindustry.&quot;   Mr. Vagley also objected to comparisons between theinsurance industry's problems and the thrift crisis.   &quot;Whereas regulation of the savings and loan industry wasliberalized to permit operations to become more risky,regulators of the insurance industry have enacted strictersolvency standards over the past decade,&quot; Mr. Vagley said.&quot;Having said that, it is important to note that insuranceregulation for solvency can and should be improved,&quot; he said.   Meanwhile, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of thesubcommittee, repeated his call for more stringent regulationof the insurance industry, warning that it could be headedfor &quot;a solvency crisis rivaling the savings and loandebacle.&quot;   Mr. Dingell said the panel's investigation shows that thecurrent system for preventing insurance insolvency &quot;isfailing to meet the needs of the public and the insuranceindustry in several crucial areas.&quot;   &quot;Our goal is to combine the industry's expertise with theappropriate governmental authority to see that propersolvency regulation is implemented before a national crisisdevelops,&quot; Mr. Dingell said.</TEXT></DOC>
