Despite the limited area affected, theair pollution impact is significant because the affected area containsthe highest population, largest number of lakes, and intensive forestryand agricultural production. Forest ecosystem impacts have been estimatedas a 3-5% growth decline for 1975-1985 (5-7% for 1985-1995) due to long-rangetransported air pollutants. Attention in this area has tended to concentrateon the sugar maple industry, but decline has been observed in numerousother tree types. Aquatic impacts include fish mortality and consequentdecline in recreational fishing, and the need to lime the surface watersin order to combat the problem. Agricultural system impacts due to ozonehave been investigated and yield reductions are estimated for fifteencrops, ranging from a 12% loss for white beans to 1% for tobacco. Varietalchanges coupled with altered cropping patterns have counteracted thenegative impacts of elevated ozone. 35 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
