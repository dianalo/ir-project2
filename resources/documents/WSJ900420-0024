For the first time, the EPA said it might ban uses ofpesticides that have long been on the market if theirresidues in processed foods pose more than a minimal cancerrisk to consumers. Up to now, the agency had agreed toenforce a cancer-risk standard on processed foods only fornewly registered pesticides; environmental groups said thatleft out at least 66 pesticides that are suspected of causingcancer in test animals.</LP><TEXT>   While the new policy is a theoretical victory, it is&quot;really a mixed blessing,&quot; said Janet Hathaway, a lawyer withthe Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalgroup. For example, the policy doesn't mean that EPA willlaunch cancer-risk investigations for the 66 pesticides. EPAofficials said their approach will be more gradual; cancerrisks in processed foods will be examined at the same timethe agency conducts lengthy studies on the general safety ofeach pesticide now on the market.   Ms. Hathaway also argued that the EPA's minimal-riskstandard is too lenient. She said her group intends to go tocourt to try to force a stricter interpretation of theso-called Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug andCosmetic Act, which she contends demands that any pesticideposing any cancer risk be banned from food.</TEXT></DOC>
