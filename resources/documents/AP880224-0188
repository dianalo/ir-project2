JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation must double its spending on publicworks projects ranging from highways to waste disposal plants tokeep them from falling into ruin, a government-appointed commissionsaid Wednesday.   But in an era of high budget deficits and a push to reducespending, not increase it, there are few signs that either Congressor the White House is prepared to embrace the call for spendingbillions of additional dollars for such programs.   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said he was introducinglegislation calling for an additional $5 billion a year in publicworks spending, but aides acknowledged there is little chance thebill would go far this election year.   The White House gave little notice to the report by the NationalCouncil on Public Works Improvement, although it appointed three ofits five members. The administration recently sent a proposedfiscal 1989 budget to Congress calling for reduced highway and masstransit spending.   The special government council, created four years ago toexamine the nation's public works needs, concluded that ``thequality of America's infrastructure is barely adequate to meetcurrent requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of futureeconomic growth'' without sharply increased spending.   ``For America's public works, the yellow light is flashing. Thedanger sign is apparent. There is serious and very real cause foralarm,'' Joseph Giglio, the council's chairman and a Wall Streetinvestment banker.   ``If we do not act to shore up our nation's infrastructure, wecould very soon be faced with enormous problems that imperil futureeconomic growth,'' Giglio said at a news conference.   The report called for all levels of government and the privatesector to double their capital spending on public works projectsfrom an annual level of $45 billion to $90 billion by the end ofthe century.   The council criticized the federal government for hoarding fundsin various public works trust funds _ a cash balance of $24 billionin 1987, according to the report _ but said additional revenue mustalso be obtained.   It suggested possible sources of new money ranging from higherfederal fuel taxes to local ``impact fees'' on developers.   ``In most cases we cannot rely simply on wiser spending. We alsomust generate additional sources of funding,'' the council declared.   The five council members acknowledged that the call for billionsof dollars of increased spending for public works comes as avariety of social programs, the military and other government needsare competing for limited funds.   ``To throw one more urgent monetary request into the pot mayseem foolhardy,'' said panel member Freeman Holmer, president ofEugene, Ore., City Council. ``It is anything but. Ignoring ourinfrastructure, the foundation of our economy, will be even morecostly in the long run.''   The study also included a ``report card'' on progress made indealing with each major type of public works.   The panel gave no failing grades. However, it raised seriousconcerns about efforts to deal with toxic wastes, which received agrade of D, as well as attempts to grapple with mass transit, solidwaste disposal and waste water treatment needs. All three areasreceived a C or C-minus grade.   Highway programs did a little better with a C-plus. Programs tomanage water resources was given a B, the best grade, followed byB-minuses for aviation and water supply management.   ``As a whole, this is a report card that would make most parentsweep,'' said council member Peter Goldmark Jr., a vice president ofthe Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles.   Discussing hazardous wastes, the council said that whilespending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold inthe last two years, ``only a small fraction of the 2 tons of wasteper capita produced in America each year is being treated safely.''   On water quality, the council suggested that governments at alllevels have been fighting a losing battle. ``Despite (a) $44billion federal investment in sewage treatment since 1972, waterquality has not improved significantly. ... due in part touncontrolled sources of pollution ...,'' it said.   The report said overall spending on public works has declinedfrom 3.6 percent of the gross national product in 1960 to 2.6percent in 1985. Money for public works programs accounted for 20percent of total government spending in 1950, but only 7 percent in1984, it said.   ``In effect, we're drawing down past investments without makingcommensurate investments of our own,'' the report said. ``Failureto reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation inthe future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reducedeconomic competitiveness.''   Other members of the council are Lowell B. Jackson, anengineering consultant from Aurora, Colo., and Freida K. Wallison,a Washington, D.C., lawyer.</TEXT></DOC>
