The nine-member court was split into two four-person opinions and one solo opinion. But taken together, the opinions suggest that a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of wrongdoing -- a less-stringent standard than probable cause -- is sufficient to justify a search.    The ruling adopted a middle ground on the issue of public employees' rights to privacy in the workplace.    The justices unanimously rejected the Reagan administration's suggestion that public employees don't have any right to privacy at work and that the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches doesn't apply. The justices were unanimous in saying that government workers have an expectation of privacy for their desk drawers and files.    &quot;Individuals do not lose Fourth Amendment rights merely because they work for the government instead of a private employer,&quot; wrote Justice Sandra O'Connor for a four-person plurality opinion.    By a 5-4 vote, the justices said that government workers are also entitled to some expectation of privacy and Fourth Amendment protection in their offices.    But the high court rejected, by a 5-4 vote, arguments by some public-employee unions and the American Civil Liberties Union that a warrant and probable cause are required for public employers to conduct investigative searches of workers' offices and files.    &quot;It is simply unrealistic to expect supervisors in most government agencies to learn the subtleties of the probable cause standard,&quot; Justice O'Connor wrote.    Because the legal dispute centers on the Fourth Amendment, the ruling is important to millions of public employees at the federal, state and local level, but doesn't affect private workers. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals against government action, not against searches by private employers. Indeed, in a separate opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the types of searches involved in the case are already considered &quot;reasonable and normal&quot; in the private sector.    Because of the different standards in three separate opinions, the full impact of the ruling won't be clear until state and federal courts have interpreted it in a variety of cases, which will probably include challenges to random drug-testing programs for government workers.    Organizations representing public employees said they were encouraged by the decision, even though it rejected their view that searches should require warrants. &quot;It rejected the extreme position proposed by the Reagan administration. Workers do have Fourth Amendment protections in the workplace,&quot; said Craig Becker, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.    David Goldstein, a lawyer for the ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the National Education Association, said the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; test &quot;isn't a great standard, but at least it's some protection for workers.&quot;    Justice O'Connor's opinion specifically said that the issue of testing government workers for drugs and alcohol wasn't involved. But Mr. Goldstein said the court's focus on an employer's suspicion of particular workers makes a &quot;pretty powerful&quot; case against random drug testing. &quot;It would be very difficult for any court reading this opinion to think random drug testing is all right,&quot; he said.    The Supreme Court case involved a search of the office of Dr. Magno Ortega at California's Napa State Hospital, where he had worked for 17 years. Hospital officials in 1981 were investigating alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Ortega and whether he improperly acquired a computer for the hospital's residency program.    A federal district court dismissed a lawsuit, filed by Dr. Ortega, that alleged the search was illegal. But a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the search was illegal and ordered the district court to decide the amount of damages Dr. Ortega was owed.    Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court decision and ruled 5-4 that the case should go back to trial to determine whether the search was reasonable, based on the standards spelled out by the high court.    Justice O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and Lewis Powell. The fifth vote against Dr. Ortega came from Justice Scalia, who wrote a separate opinion    The dissenters, Justices Harry Blackmun, William Brennan,Thurgood Marshall and John Stevens, said a search warrant isrequired in such cases. Justice Scalia agreed with thedissenters that government workers are entitled to someprivacy in their offices.</TEXT></DOC>
