Ross Johnson, is considering taking the food and tobacco giant private for about $75-a-share, or $17.6 billion, in what would be the largest-ever business transaction.    The contemplated leveraged buy-out, which also would include the assumption of $5 billion in RJR debt, reflects Mr. Johnson's frustration at a persistently depressed stock price. After the announcement, the stock soared $21.375 a share yesterday, to close at $77.25.    The price closed above the contemplated offer because analysts say the company's true value is more in the range of $90 to $100 a share. Wall Street speculators doubt that another industrial bidder will emerge, but they say that the offer is low enough to leave room for such well-heeled financiers such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. or a corporate raider. Moreover, several of the Atlanta-based company's institutional investors said they believed that, even without rival bidders, the board may demand a higher price of Mr. Johnson's group.    Regardless, Mr. Johnson stands to profit, either by buying RJR on the cheap, even at that enormous price, or by drawing a higher bidder. In either event, he will utterly transform a company on which he had already done radical surgery in less than two years of being in charge.    According to people familiar with his plans, Mr. Johnson intends to keep the company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit after the buy-out and to divest the company of as much of its non-tobacco businesses, including Nabisco Brands and Del Monte foods, as necessary to pay off debt.    Edward A. Horrigan Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the tobacco unit, was the only other executive identified as part of the management group involved.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is serving as the financial adviser to the management group. Shearson, which is 60%-owned by American Express Co., will be arranging the financing, including putting up some of its own money.    As financial adviser, Shearson Lehman would arrange bank financing, underwrite an offering of high-yield &quot;junk bonds,&quot; and use some of its own $1.8 billion buy-out fund. Shearson and the other investors in that fund, such as Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan, would have the right to make additional equity investments in the leveraged buy-out.    A special committee of outside directors, headed by company chairman Charles E. Hugel, will consider the offer, if made. The committee retained Dillon, Read andamp; Co. and Lazard Freres.    Mr. Hugel stressed in a statement that the committee &quot;has not determined to recommend the sale of the company and may not accept any such proposal.&quot; But Mr. Johnson enjoys close relations with his directors, and sources say he probably wouldn't have gone public with his plans had he sensed opposition. Several people close to the board said directors were receptive to the notion of a buy-out at a meeting yesterday, though it wasn't known whether a higher price will be asked.    Despite the modest initial offer, most analysts don't think another public U.S. company will surface as a suitor. The threat of liability litigation and the steady decline of unit sales has, until now, depressed tobacco-company stocks to a multiple of about eight times annual earnings. Another public company probably wouldn't want its own stock price dragged down by tobacco.    Of those industrial buyers mentioned as being possibly interested, Unilever is believed to be too small to swallow RJR and B.A.T Industries PLC, which has tobacco interests, has already agreed to acquire Farmers Group Inc. for $5.2 billion.    The problems with the valuation of the company's stock is one big reason Mr. Johnson hatched the idea of going private. The tobacco business has made the company's stock lackluster, even though it has been the major contributor to annual per-share profit gains of more than 20%. Kurt A. Feuerman, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst, recently estimated that the company's food business would trade at $55 to $60 a share if it were an independent company. At the time, RJR's stock was trading at about $49 a share.    But in private form, the tobacco business wouldn't present that penalty and its cash flow would enable RJR to carry the enormous potential debtload of this deal. Mr. Feuerman estimates tobacco will generate $2.1 billion in cashflow next year before taxes and debt costs. David A. Goldman, an analyst at Fahnestock andamp; Co., estimates the buy-out group is proposing to pay only about half as much a premium for RJR's cashflow as Philip Morris Cos. would for Kraft Inc. in the $90-a-share bid it made for that foods company.    RJR's proposed buy-out contrasts with Philip Morris's initiative in other ways, too. While that company wants to build its food business, RJR is dismantling its own. Indeed, by setting up the food businesses as separate operating companies earlier this year, Mr. Johnson has made it easier to sell them off. Del Monte, the fresh fruit and canned vegetable concern, is believed to be first in line to go. The international business of Nabisco Brands, a cookie and cracker maker, would also be on the block. The company would like to hang on to as much of domestic Nabisco as possible, according to people familiar with the plan, but would sell it if necessary to service debt.    A leveraged buy-out also raises questions about whether R.J. Reynolds Tobacco would be run aggressively or milked for cash. The new &quot;smokeless&quot; cigarette, Premier, requires a huge investment, which some analysts feel may be pulled back if cash is needed to pay debt. The slide of such core brands as Winston and Camel may only accelerate if marketing support is sacrificed to debt payments.    But some observers say they believe a private tobacco company could do better than the public one, which has been steadily losing ground to Philip Morris.    Stanley Katz, chairman and chief executive officer of FCB/Leber Katz, one of RJR's primary advertising agencies, believes RJR would put more money into research and development and marketing after a buy-out. &quot;You're judged on a very short-term basis (as a public company); that is the thing that drove them to do this,&quot; said Mr. Katz. The executive, whose agency handles much of Reynolds's cigarette advertising, describes the company's thinking this way: &quot;What do we have to answer to Wall Street for? The analysts don't own this company.&quot;    A corporate raider could still enter the picture. The existence of easily salable units, such as the pieces of RJR Nabisco, often attracts raiders. Also, the prospect of doing the largest buy-out in history is likely to have numerous fee-hungry investment banking firms working the phones to find a client willing to make a bid. Some arbitragers said RJR even was being rumored as the possible target of a hostile bid prior to Mr. Johnson's proposal.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc. promptly placed RJR Nabisco's debt ratings under review for possible downgrades. Standard andamp; Poor's said the contemplated transaction would &quot;severely weaken the firm's balance sheet;&quot; Moody's said it &quot;is likely to result in sharply increased debt levels and substantially lowered debtholder protection.&quot;    RJR Nabisco's debt securities tumbled yesterday. Its intermediate debt securities, which had been trading Wednesday at between 60 and 80 basis points over Treasuries, saw their spreads grow to roughly 200 basis points.    Also yesterday, RJR Nabisco reported that its third-quarter net income rose 11%, to $355 million, from $320 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose 25% to $1.55 from $1.24, because the company has been buying back stock.    Profit from operations in the company's tobacco business, including pre-launch costs of the Premier &quot;smokeless&quot; cigarette, rose 6% in the quarter. In the food business, profit from operations rose 4.5%. The company's third-quarter sales rose 8.5%, to $4.16 billion, from $3.84 billion a year earlier.    RJR Nabisco's net income for the nine months rose 17%, to $982 million, from $839 million a year earlier. Per-share net income climbed to $4.14 from $3.24. Sales rose 7.9% to $12.2 billion from $11.3 billion a year earlier.    ---           10 Largest Completed Leveraged Buy-Outs                       1981 to Present                                                  Amount                                              (In billions)   Target Name: Beatrice                           $6.2   Acquiror Name: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Announced: 10/16/85   Effective: 4/17/86   Target Name: Borg-Warner                        $4.7   Acquiror Name: Merrill Lynch Capital   Announced: 4/13/87   Effective: 7/30/87   Target Name: Southland                          $4.6   Acquiror Name: Thompson   Announced: 7/3/87   Effective: 12/15/87   Target Name: Safeway Stores                     $4.3   Acquiror Name: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Announced: 7/25/86   Effective: 11/24/86   Target Name: Montgomery Ward (Mobil)            $3.8   Acquiror Name: Brennan, Bernard F.
