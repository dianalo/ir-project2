This policy was the basis for regulations printed in the Code ofFederal Regulations Title 50. In September 1987, the Service, believingrevisions of the existing cabin policy and regulations were needed, publisheda Draft Cabin Management Policy for cabins on National Wildlife Refugesin Alaska. Comments and suggestions on the draft policy were solicitedduring a 60-day public review period.Because of the number and nature of comments received during the publicreview of the draft policy, the Service made such extension revisions thata revised draft of the cabin management policy is being published to givethe public another opportunity to comment before the policy is made final.The revised draft has been completely reorganized, more clearly describesthe objectives of the policy, and sets forth the guidelines needed to complywith the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 and theNational Wildlife Refuge system Administration Act of 1966.The purpose of the draft policy and guidelines is to provide uniform guidanceto both the public and refuge managers on human use and occupancy of cabinslocated on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. The draft policy furtherserves to define under what conditions use and occupancy of a cabin maybe compatible with purposes for which the refuge was established.Compatibility with refuge purposes is implicit in all cabin managementdecisions.Copies of the revised draft policy are available from any national wildliferefuge in Alaska, from the Regional Office (address above), or by callingMs. Gina Mullen in the Alaska Regional Office at (907) 786-3390.Once the policy is finalized the Service will develop draft regulationsfor the public's consideration and subsequent incorporation into the Codeof Federal Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 18 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Walter O.
