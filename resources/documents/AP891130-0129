(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury meeting next weekwill consider new indictments in the PTL ministry investigation,apparently against witnesses who may have committed perjury, anewspaper reported Thursday.   Richard Dortch, PTL founder Jim Bakker's former right-hand manat the television ministry, is expected to appear before the grandjury, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting sources familiarwith the PTL investigation.   The government's latest targets apparently are witnesses who mayhave perjured themselves before a special grand jury that indictedBakker, Dortch and two other PTL associates.   The names of the witnesses were not disclosed. Bakker himselfwas not a witness before the grand jury.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, who prosecuted Bakker andDortch, would not talk about the grand jury.   Bakker was sentenced in October to 45 years in prison and fined$500,000 after being convicted of 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy. Dortch pleaded guilty to reduced charges and wassentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000.   Dortch's plea agreement allowed him to remain free until he hadfinished cooperating with the goverment. He testified againstBakker at the former PTL leader's trial.   Dortch had been scheduled to begin serving his sentence Oct. 13.But on Oct. 5, his attorneys filed a motion asking that Dortch notbe required to report to prison until at least Jan. 15, ``so thathe might continue to comply with his agreement to cooperate withthe United States.''   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, who sentenced Bakker andDortch, granted the request.</TEXT></DOC>
