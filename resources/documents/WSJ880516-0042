Mr. Mitterrand dissolved parliament Saturday night and called the new vote, for 577 deputies, in two rounds on June 5 and June 12.    According to a poll taken for the newspaper Journal du Dimanche, 41% of those surveyed said they would vote for the Socialists, 24% for former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic Party, 15% for the centrist Union for French Democracy Party, 8% for the extreme-rightwing National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and 6% for the Communists. If those results are confirmed in the voting next month, the Socialists could win between 350 and 400 seats in the new assembly, largely at the expense of the moderate right. Both the Communists and the National Front are likely to lose about half their seats, thus losing the right to form independent parliamentary groups.    In the last previous parliament, elected in 1986 under a proportional representation system that won't be used this time, the right-center parties together had 289 seats, the Socialists 214, the National Front 32 and the Communists 35, with seven nonaligned seats.    During the past week, Mr. Rocard, a moderate Socialist appointed to replace Mr. Chirac after President Mitterrand's re-election a week ago, tried but largely failed to tempt centrist leaders into his government. Faced with a potentially hostile parliament, he urged the president to call a new election.    The election, however, threatens to delay Mr. Mitterrand's hoped-for overture to the center because the ballot will be fought along the traditional left-right battle lines. Nonetheless, Mr. Rocard said at a news conference Friday that the new vote could later lead to a revamping of the French political system. He pledged to again offer cabinet posts to center-right politicians after the vote and said he would probably make several changes in his newly appointed government after the election.    &quot;The president's first term was one of economic modernization,&quot; he said. &quot;The second will be one of political modernization.&quot; Mr. Rocard's aides explained that this means winning consensus on laws and policies from a large majority of viewpoints, not just from Socialists or rightists.    Mr. Mitterrand, who beat Mr. Chirac by 54% to 46% in the May 8 presidential voting, asked voters to now &quot;decide in favor of the opening which I wish.&quot; The new election was immediately condemned by Mr. Chirac's party but welcomed by former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, another unsuccessful presidential candidate.    The suddenness of the vote, in the wake of Mr. Mitterrand's big victory, creates big problems for the divided right wing. Some of Mr. Chirac's backers favor pre-election pacts with the National Front, carving out certain safe constituencies for each party. If that happens, the centrists who backed Mr. Barre will be more tempted to make similar alliances with the Socialists, assuring the centrists some parliamentary seats and perhaps cabinet posts. </TEXT></DOC>
