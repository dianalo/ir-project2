OPM received comments from 11 agencies and3 labor unions. Following is a discussion of the comments received andOPM's response to these comments. The final regulations following the commentand response material.1. Section 430.404 <T3>Definitions</T3><T3>Comment on definition of ``Rating of record'': </T3>One agency commentedthat it concurred with the proposed revision to the definition of ``ratingof record,'' which eliminates the requirement to assign an ``unacceptable''rating before initiating an opportunity to improve for employees coveredby the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS), but only witha related change made to 5 CFR 540.108(a). The suggested change would providethat if an employee covered by PMRS cannot be rated at the end of the appraisalperiod because he or she is serving under an opportunity to improve, heor she may not be granted a merit increase. The agency believes that togrant such an increase during an opportunity to improve would be inconsistentwith the philosophy of pay-for-performance, and would undermine the agency'scase for a performance-based action if the employee appeals to a thirdparty. <T3>Response: </T3>The revision to the definition of ``rating of record,''which eliminate the requirement to assign a rating of record when givingan employee a written notification of unacceptable performance, appliesto those situations where the written notification occurs during the appraisalcycle. At the end of each appraisal cycle, a rating of record is requiredfor PMRS employees in accordance with 5 CFR 430.406(a). Thus, if a PMRSemployee is serving under an opportunity to improve at the end of the ratingcycle, the agency is obligated to give a rating of record (unless the agency'sperformance appraisal system provides for extending the rating period underthese circumstances). In most cases the rating of record given when anemployee is undergoing an opportunity to improve would be ``unacceptable.''However, the agency may determine that, after viewing the employee's performancefor the overall rating period, a higher rating is warranted under certaincircumstances. By adopting the agency's suggestion, OPM regulations would, in essence,require agencies to determine that an employee's performance would be ``unacceptable''under the circumstances described. OPM believes that such a requirementmight, in some cases, deter agencies from notifying and assisting employeesin improving unacceptable performance at the earliest possible. time whenthere is the greatest chance for improvement. Moreover, OPM believes thatagencies are in the best position to determine, on a case-by-case basis,how to rate the employee's overall performance for pay-for-performancepurposes. For these reasons, OPM has not adopted the agency's proposalto make a change in Part 540. 2. Section 430.405 Agency Performance Appraisal Systems<T3>Comment on paragraph (j)(3): </T3>One agency commented that the currentwording of the provision which requires that a reassignment, reductionin grade or removal be initiated if an employee's performance is unacceptableafter an opportunity to improve is inconsistent with OPM's position, asstated in the supplementary information of the reproposed regulations,that there are other alternatives available to an agency under these circumstances.The agency recommended that OPM change the word ``must'' to ``may'' inorder to allow agencies to consider other alternatives. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM agrees with the agency and believes that the languagein the reproposed regulation is more restrictive than required by law.While agencies in the great majority of cases should reassign, reduce ingrade or remove an employee whose performance is unacceptable at the conclusionof an opportunity to improve, OPM recognizes that legal authority existswhich permits agencies to legitimately consider alternatives other thanreassignment, reduction in grade or removal. Therefore, OPM has changedthe regulation to reflect that an agency may reassign, reduce in gradeor remove an employee if his or her performance is unacceptable at theconclusion of an opportunity to improve.3. Section 432.103(b) Actions Excluded <T3>Comment on Reassignments: </T3>A union suggested that this sectionlist as an exclusion a lateral reassignment based on unacceptable performanceto help clarify that reassignments are not covered by this part and toindicate that agencies have the choice of reassigning as well as reducingin grade or removing all employees who continue to perform unacceptably.An agency asked that OPM consider listing as an exclusion the reassignmentinto a supervisory position of an employee who subsequently fails the supervisoryprobationary period required under 5 U.S.C. 3321.<T3>Response: </T3>OPM agrees with the union's position that the proceduresof this part apply only to reductions in grade and removals based on unacceptableperformance and that agencies do not have to reduce in grade or removeall employees who perform unacceptably. However, OPM believes that thetitle of the regulation, ``Reductions in Grade and Removal Based on UnacceptablePerformance,'' coupled with its sole focus on reductions in grade and removalactions, make clear that reassignment based on unacceptable performanceare not included in the actions covered by this part. With respect to theagency's suggestion, OPM notes that this section already lists as an exclusionactions to demote supervisory employees from their positions based on theirfailure to complete satisfactorily the probationary period required undersection 3321. In any event, lateral reassignments which place employeesinto supervisory positions, even if the employee fails to perform satisfactorilyas a supervisor, are not reductions in grade or removals covered by thispart. For these reasons, there is no need to change this section. <T3>Comment on Involuntary Retirement: </T3>One agency pointed out thatthe reproposed regulation dropped the earlier proposed regulatory provision,paragraph (15) of andSection; 432.102(b), which specifically excluded involuntaryretirement because of disability under Part 831, and did not discuss areason for not incorporating it in the current proposed regulations.<T3>Respose: </T3>OPM notes that the omission was, as the agency surmised,accidential, and OPM is incorporating the paragraph in the final regulation.<T3>Comment on Minimally Acceptable Performance/Non-Critical Elements:</T3>One agency recommended that actions based on minimally acceptableperformance and on unacceptable performance of a noncritical element shouldbe listed under the exclusions of actions despite OPM's earlier explanationfor deleting these proposed exclusions. <T3>Response: </T3>In its earlier explanation for deleting these actions,OPM pointed out that listing them as exclusions under Part 432 could implythat such actions might be possible under another regulatory authority.OPM explained that since this was not its intent, and that since such actionswere clearly outside the domain of Part 432, it was removing them fromthe list of exclusions. OPM continues to believe that 5 U.S.C. 4301(3),along with the definition in andSection; 432.103, make it clear that onlyactions based on unacceptable performance of one or more critical elementsare covered under Part 432. Therefore, OPM does not agree that reinsertingthese actions as exclusions is necessary and, as stated in its earlierresponse, could lead to misunderstandings. <T3>Comment on paragraph (b)(1): </T3>An agency recommended that andSection;432.102(b)(1) reflect that these regulations do not apply to the reductionin grade of a supervisor who is serving a supervisory probation exceptwhen the action is based on a critical element not related to supervisoryresponsibilities. <T3>Response: </T3>5 U.S.C. 3321(b), 5 CFR 315.907(a) and 315.909(b) makeit clear that only reductions in grade based on unacceptable performancerelated to supervisory performance are excluded from Part 432 coverage.If an agency takes action against a probationary supervisor for unacceptableperformance in a critical element which is unrelated to supervisory ormanagerial performance, the agency would use Part 432 procedures. Therefore,OPM is changing the regulation to clarify that only reductions in gradebased on unsatisfactory supervisory or managerial performance are excludedfrom coverage.<T3>Comment on paragraph (b)(3): </T3>One agency found this paragraph,which excludes actions against employees in the competitive service whohave not completed 1 year of current continuous service, to be unclear.The agency recommended that the language be changed to: ``an employee inthe competitive service serving in an appointment that requires no probationaryor trial period (i.e., temporary appointments pending establishment ofa register (TAPER), status quo, or special tenure appointments) who hasnot completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similarposition under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year orless.''<T3>Response: </T3>OPM agrees that the language recommended by the agencywill help clarify employee coverage under Part 432 and has adopted thesuggestion, except for the parenthetical language, which it believes ismore appropriately discussed in FPM guidance. <T3>Comment on paragraph (b)(11): </T3>One agency recommended listing asa new exclusion ``a removal or reduction in grade made in accordance withthe failure to comply with an enforceable settlement agreement.'' The agencybelieves that such an action is not necessarily covered by the exclusionof ``voluntary actions'' under andSection; 432.102(b)(11) since the settlementmay be alleged to be involuntary.<T3>Response: </T3>OPM notes that under case law developed by MSPB andthe courts, a settlement agreement is only enforceable if it is knowinglyand voluntarily established. Thus, the exclusion the agency proposed iscovered in fact by the exclusion of voluntary actions. If the employeebelieves the settlement agreement is not voluntary, he or she may challengeits validity or implementation before an appropriate third party. For thesereasons OPM has not adopted the agency's suggestion. <T3>Comment on paragraph (b)(13): </T3>A union recommended that OPM refrainfrom incorporating MSPB's holding in <T3>Phipps </T3>v. <T3>Department of Health and Human Services </T3>(that returns from temporarypromotions are not covered under Part 432 even if the promotion has beenextended for more than 2 years) since the union believes that this caselaw is not widely accepted and ``deviates from the conventional wisdom.''<T3>Response: </T3>OPM believes that the Board's holding in <T3>Phipps </T3>is an accurate statement of the law. Further, OPM has earlierpointed out in its comments on both the reproposed regulations and on finalpublished Part 752 regulations, that the MSPB has adopted the <T3>Phipps </T3>holding in subsequent decisions. Therefore, OPM cannotagree that the holding in <T3>Phipps </T3>are not now well-established. 4. Section 432.102(f)_Employees Excluded<T3>Comment on categories of employes excluded: </T3>A union noted thatOPM listed 12 categories of employees excluded that are not referencedin law or the current Code of Federal Regulations. It believes that OPMhas expanded the categories of employees excluded from Part 432 coverageto cover more employees than are excluded by statute or current regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>Contrary to the union's comment, all of the employeeexclusions are listed in the law (5 U.S.C. 4301(2)) or current regulations(5 CFR Parts 430 and 432). OPM has merely incorporated them into one sectionin order to assist agencies and employees who use the regulations. <T3>Comment on paragraph (f)(2): </T3>An agency recommended inclusion underPart 432 of employees who have not completed 1 year of current continuousemployment but who have previously completed a probationary period. <T3>Response: </T3>Employees meeting this description are individuals whopreviously served under appointments requiring a probationary period (careerand career-conditional) but who now are serving under appointments notrequiring one, such as TAPER and similar non-status appointees. Under currentpolicy, to be accorded Part 432 coverage while serving under one of theseappointments, an employee must have completed 1 year of current continuousservice in the same or similar non-temporary positions regardless of theirpast employment. This policy is consistent with Civil Service Rule 1.3(e)which provides that tenure is governed by the type of appointment underwhich the employee is currently serving ``without regard to whether hehas competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive positionor an excepted position.'' For this reason, the agency's suggestion wasnot adopted.5. Section 432.103 Definitions <T3>Comments on definition of ``Acceptable performance'': </T3>Four agenciesasked that OPM further review and clarify the definition of ``acceptableperformance.'' The agencies noted that the definition requires only thatemployees meet ``established standards'' and fails to indicate what levelof performance described by an employee's standards must be met in orderto achieve acceptable performance. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM agrees that the definition given in the reproposedregulations does not sufficiently clarify what level of performance isrequired to achieve acceptable performance. Accordingly, OPM is revisingthe definition to clarify that ``acceptable performance,'' for the purposeof this part, means performance that meets an employee's performance requirement(s)or standard(s) at the level of performance above ``unacceptable'' in thecritical element(s) at issue. Since each agency has the flexibility todevelop performance appraisal systems to meet their particular needs, theacceptable level of performance may vary from one agency to another. Forexample, in agencies which have a performance appraisal system that providesfor rating an employee's performance on individual performance elementsat one of five levels, acceptable performance would be between the ``fullysuccessful'' and ``unacceptable'' levels (e.g., performance which is ``minimallysatisfactory''). In agencies which have a performance appraisal systemthat provides for rating an employee's performance on an individual performanceelement at one of three levels, acceptable performance would be ``fullysuccessful'' performance because there is no defined level of performanceprovided for between the ``unacceptable'' and ``fully successful'' levelsin such a system. In revising the definition of acceptable performance,OPM has taken into account agencies' different performance appraisal systemsand has attempted to clarify that, for the purpose of this part, acceptableperformance is properly determined in reference to the level of performanceat which individual performance elements may be rated. <T3>Comments on definition of ``Current continuous employment'': </T3>Aunion stated that it disagrees with OPM's proposed definition of ``currentcontinuous employment'' as defined in both the earlier and current reproposedregulations. It suggested that OPM not define this term, or else defineit to conform to the Board's decision in <T3>Roden </T3>v. <T3>Tennessee Valley Authority, </T3>25 M.S.P.R. 363 (1984). Along theselines, the union suggested defining current continuous employment as ``theperiod of service which effectively enters the agency into a continuingemployment contract with the employee, that, despite brief periods of breaksin service, lasts 1 year or more.'' An agency recommended adding languageto make it clear that the definition applies only to appointments thatrequire no probationary or trial period, for example, TAPER, status quoor special tenure appointments. <T3>Response: </T3>The definition of ``current continuous employment''suggested by the union is based on the union's interpretation of MSPB'sdecision in <T3>Roden</T3>. However, the Board's holding in <T3>Roden, </T3>which characterized a series of temporary limited appointmentsfor excepted service employees as a ``continuing employment contract''and allowed brief breaks in service (as opposed to allowing no break) incomputing current continuous service, was based, in large part, on OPM'searlier FPM guidance which was in effect at the time of the <T3>Roden </T3>decision. This guidance was superseded by 5 CFR 752.402(b)which became effective on July 11, 1988. The regulation makes clear thatOPM's policy governing the computation of current continuous employmentallows for no break in Federal civilian employment. Since the definitionsuggested by the union for Part 432 is not consistent with establishedpolicy, OPM has not adopted the suggestion. Regarding the agency's commentthat OPM should make it clear that the definition applies only to appointmentsthat require no probationary or trial period, OPM notes that this is trueonly for competitive service appointments. Since the definition also appliesto excepted service appointments, the agency's recommended change wouldnot be a complete illustration of the appointments and positions coveredby the definition. For this reason, OPM has not adopted the agency's suggestionto change the definition of current continuous employment. <T3>Comment on definition of ``Similar positions'': </T3>An agency recommendeddefining ``similar positions'' as that term is currently defined in FPMchapter 752, i.e., positions which would fall in the same competitive levelfor purposes of a reduction in force under Part 351. The agency believesthat if this recommendation were carried out, it would clarify that positionsin the competitive service are not similar to positions in the exceptedservice and that various positions in different competitive levels wouldnot be similar. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM notes that its definition of ``similar positions''in the reproposed regulations is the same as the definition in the recentlypublished final Part 752 regulations. This definition, which focuses onthe similarity of duties and qualifications for the positions in question,was developed after extensive opportunity for comment and consultation.The new definition in the Part 752 regulation superseded the language inFPM <T3>chapter </T3>752. (OPM plans to issue a revised FPM chapter 752 inthe near future to reflect all the changes in Part 752.) Contrary to theagency's understanding, OPM proposed to define ``similar positions'' sothat positions in the excepted service meet the same test as those in thecompetitive service which require no probationary or trial period. Forthese reasons, OPM has not changed the definition of ``similar positions''in these final regulations. 6. Section 432.104 Addressing Unacceptable Performance <T3>Comments on notification of unacceptable performance: </T3>Two agenciescommented that the current wording of the provision regarding notificationof unacceptable performance could be construed incorrectly to mean thatthe agency is not required to notify the employee of unacceptable performanceand inform the employee of the standards for retention. They recommendedthat OPM change the word ``may'' to ``shall'' in order to indicate thatthese steps are required. One union recommended that the notification shouldbe at the earliest possible date after the supervisor becomes aware ofthe employee's work deficiencies and provide for assisting, counseling,and guidance to aid the employee in bringing his or her performance upto an acceptable level. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM agrees with the agencies' comments and has adoptedtheir suggestion to change the word ``<T3>may</T3>'' to ``<T3>shall</T3>'' in the final regulation in order to reflect OPM's intentthat notifying the employee of the critical element(s) for which performanceis unacceptable and informing the employee of the performance requirementsor standard(s) that must be attained to demonstrate acceptable performanceare steps that should be carried out as part of the notification process.Regarding the union's comment, OPM agrees that the notice of unacceptableperformance should take place at the earliest possible time, although thisis not a requirement. However, OPM believes that the language in the proposedregulations, i.e., ``At any time during the performance appraisal cyclethat an employee's performance becomes unacceptable * * *'' already allowsfor notification of unacceptable performance at an early point and thatagencies are in the best position, on a case-by-case basis, to know whenthe employee should be put on notice of unacceptable performance. Therefore,OPM does not believe that the regulations should be changed. Regardingthe union's comment that agencies should provide for assistance and guidanceto employees in improving performance, OPM agrees with the union and requiresin andSection;432.104 of the regulation that agencies offer assistance asa part of the employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.<T3>Comments on notification requirements for PMRS employees:</T3> Oneagency commented that it favored OPM's clarification that the notificationof unacceptable performance for PMRS employees need not be an official``rating of record.'' A second agency suggested that the sentence regardingPMRS employees being provided written notice of the employee's unacceptablerating should be deleted and a corresponding change should be made to thedefinition in andSection; 432.103(i) since OPM is removing the requirementfor a ``rating of record'' if a PMRS employee's performance becomes unacceptableduring the appraisal cycle. A third agency recommended that andSection; 432.104state that the agency ``shall provide written notice of the employee'sunacceptable <T3>performance''</T3> instead of ``shall provide written notice of theemployee's unacceptable <T3>rating</T3>.'' <T3>Response:</T3> As stated in the supplementary information of the reproposedregulations, OPM believes that PMRS employees are entitled, under 5 U.S.C.4302a(b)(6) to written notification of unacceptable performance on oneor more critical elements, although the written notification need not bein the form of a ``rating of record.'' The supplementary information furthernoted that as a conforming amendment, the requirement for a ``rating ofrecord'' at times other than at the end of a rating cycle is being deletedfrom the Part 430 regulations. The provision to give a PMRS employee awritten notice of the employee's unacceptable rating has remained in andSection;432.104 in order to make it clear that the notification of unacceptableperformance must be in writing if it involves a PMRS employee and thatit should be a determination made in reference to the employee's performanceon individual critical element(s) (rather than a summary performance rating).Further, the definition section (432.103(i)) also explains that the meaningof the term ``written notice of unacceptable rating,'' in the context ofthis part, consists of an agency's written notification (which need notbe in the form of a performance rating) to an employee that his or herperformance is unacceptable in one or more critical elements. Therefore,OPM believes that no change is necessary to the provision in the regulationsregarding PMRS employees' entitlement to written notification of unacceptableperformance. <T3>Comment on Reassignments:</T3> One union commented that the proposedPart 432 regulations should include reassignments as an alternative toremoval and reduction-in-grade actions based on unacceptable performanceas provided in 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6). It suggested that andSection; 432.104include reassignment as one of the actions the agency may take if an employee'sperformance does not improve. <T3>Response:</T3> OPM agrees with the union that reassignments are analternative to removal and reduction in grade actions based on unacceptableperformance. Other management actions are also possible when an employee'sperformance is determined to be unacceptable. However, consistent with5 U.S.C. 4303, Part 432 deals only with removals and reductions in gradebased on unacceptable performance. (Reassignments, as part of the performancemanagement and appraisal process, are covered by Part 430. (See 5 CFR 430.204and 430.405.)) Therefore, OPM has not adopted the recommendation. <T3>Comment on assistance:</T3> One union commented that andSection; 432.104does not convey the idea that the employee's opportunity to improve isa time for the employer and employee to work together in an effort to assistthe employee in performing up to his or her potential, but rather appearsto be merely a step an agency must follow prior to initiating an unacceptableperformance action. It also suggested that this section include specificexamples of assistance, such as counseling and regular feedback, requiredof the employer. <T3>Response:</T3> OPM agrees that the employee's opportunity to demonstrateacceptable performance is not merely a procedural step the agency mustfollow in route to initiating a removal or reduction-in-grade action. Inthis regard, the final regulations require agencies to give employees a``reasonable opportunity'' to demonstrate acceptable performance priorto making a determination on whether to propose a reduction-in-grade orremoval action. A requirement for agencies to offer employees assistancein improving their unacceptable performance is also included in regulationas a part of the opportunity to improve. In addition, the FPM guidancethat is being issued concurrently with these regulations includes specificexamples of assistance agencies should consider offering to employees tohelp them improve their unacceptable performance. For these reasons, OPMbelieves that the regulations and accompanying guidance satisfy the union'sconcerns. <T3>Comments on length of the opportunity to improve:</T3> One union andone agency recommended that the regulations state a minimum length of timeto be given to employees to demonstrate acceptable performance. The unionstated that a minimum of 60 days is required but that the opportunity toimprove time frame may be longer than 60 days. The agency urged that theconcept of a time-bound opportunity to improve be put into the regulationssince the agency believes that the governing statute requires the opportunityto be time-driven. <T3>Response:</T3> OPM has not adopted the suggested changes for two reasons.First, applicable law does not require that time periods be set for theemployee's opportunity to improve. 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6) merely requiresan agency to afford an employee ``an opportunity to demonstrate acceptableperformance.'' Obviously, such an ``opportunity'' takes place over thecourse of time. But nowhere does the statute require or imply that OPMfix minimum or maximum time limits for a predetermined ``opportunity period''that would apply rigidly to all covered employees in all job categories.In addition, experience has shown that not all opportunities to improvecan easily be geared to predetermined time limits. Second, OPM has determined that an efficient and effective Government wouldbest be served by allowing agencies to tailor the opportunity to improvein such a way that the employee who is performing in an unacceptable mannerwill be given a reasonable change to meet the requirements of his or herposition. Individual managers, and not OPM, are in the best position tounderstand the mission and requirements of their units and to exercisejudgment in determining how to structure the employee's opportunity toimprove. Accordingly, although agencies remain free to establish minimum or maximumtime frames, OPM will not require through regulation that an employee'sopportunity to improve be a predetermined length of time or that agenciesestablish specific time frames in structuring an employee's opportunityto improve. <T3>Comments on requirement that PMRS employees demonstrate performanceat the ``fully successful'' level:</T3> Three agencies commented on theprovision requiring PMRS employees to be provided a reasonable opportunityto demonstrate performance at the ``fully successful'' level or higher.One agency commented that under this requirement an opportunity to improvefor an employee who improved his or her performance only to the minimallyacceptable level could go on indefinitely. Another agency recommended thatthe regulations clarify that only PMRS employees who perform unacceptablymay be required to demonstrate performance at the fully successful level.The third agency recommended that OPM spell out its intent to retain aPMRS employee in an opportunity to improve status until performance improvesto level 3 or reverts to level 1 in a manner similar to the way it didin the Supplementary Information section of the reproposed regulations.<T3>Response:</T3> The statute at 5 U.S.C. 4302a(b)(6) requires PMRS employeeswho perform unacceptably, and who are given an opportunity to improve,to demonstrate performance at the fully successful level or higher. Therefore,if a PMRS employee who has been given an opportunity, improves only tolevel 2 (minimally satisfactory), but not level 3 (fully successful), heor she has not fulfilled the statutory requirement to demonstrate performanceat the successful level. As explained in the reproposed regulation, OPMsees no alternative course of action than continuing such an employee inan opportunity to improve status until such time as his or her performanceimproves to level 3 (fully successful) or reverts to level 1 (unacceptable).Thus, in terms of reduction in grade or removal under this part, if a PMRSemployee's performance continues at or reverts to level 1 (unacceptable),once the employee has been given an opportunity to improve, the agencymay propose a reduction-in-grade or removal action.  <T3>Comment on consideration of performance on all elements:</T3> One agencyrecommended that the regulations permit an employee to be advised at thestart of an ``opportunity period'' of the requirements for acceptable performancefor all his or her critical elements (regardless of whether the employeewas performing unacceptably in all elements) and allow removal or reduction-in-gradeaction to be proposed if performance under any critical element is unacceptableat the end of the ``opportunity period.'' In making its recommendationthe agency stated that it seeks to resolve the problem of the employeewho improves in the one critical element for which he or she was givenan opportunity to improve only to fall down to an unacceptable level inanother area. The agency does not believe that Congressional intent wouldbe served by allowing a continuing series of element-by-element based ``opportunityperiods.''  <T3>Response:</T3> OPM believes that the intent of the law in the areaof taking performance-based actions under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 was to ensurethat an employee is put on notice of his or her performance deficienciesin specific critical elements and given a chance to correct them priorto the agency making a decision on whether to remove, reduce in grade ortake other action. In determining whether action is appropriate, the overallstructure of the law, OPM's current regulations implementing the law, andapplicable case law in this area focus on an employee's performance onindividual critical elements. For example, the language of 5 U.S.C. 4320(b)(6)referring to removing or reducing in grade an employee who ``continuesto have unacceptable performance, but only after an apportunity to demonstrateacceptable performance * * *'' strongly implies than the opportunity toimprove is to be provided for the areas of performance which an employeeis performing unacceptably (as opposed to all performance areas). 5 U.S.C.4302(b)(5), which requires that agency performance appraisal systems providefor assisting employees in improving unacceptable performance, likewiseimplies that such assistance be given in areas of performance which theemployee is performing unacceptably. Further, 5 U.S.C. 4303(b)(1)(A) (i)and (ii) require that a proposed action must be based on specific instancesof unacceptable performance, with each instance being related to an individualcritical element. The current regulation at 5 CFR 432.203(b), in effectsince 1981, requires that an agency ``* * * identify for the employee thecritical element(s) for which performance is unacceptable and give theemployee a reasonable time to demonstrate acceptable performance * * *.''The merit system principle at 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(6) requiring that ``* ** inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separatedwho cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards''also suggests that an employee be given a chance to correct inadequateperformance in specific areas. While OPM sympathizes with the concernsof the agency, it believes that a reasonable interpretation of the lawsgoverning the taking of performance-based actions precludes adoption ofthe agency's suggested change.  7. Section 432.105 Proposing and Taking Action Based on Unacceptable Performance <T3>Comments on proposing action based on unacceptable performance followingan employee's opportunity to improve:</T3> Two unions and five agenciescommented on the provisions allowing agencies to propose a reduction-in-gradeor removal action, subject to the 1-year limitation in 5 U.S.C. 4303(c)(2)(A),if an employee's performance again becomes unacceptable on the criticalelement(s) at issue after having been given an opportunity to demonstrateacceptable performance. One union believes that the reproposed regulationwould allow an employee to be removed for failure to meet a critical elementwhich is broadly written following an opportunity to improve even thoughthe circumstances were totally different. It also claims that the applicablestatute and case law entitle an employee to an opportunity to improve everytime his or her performance falls to an unacceptable level (even afterhaving been given a prior opportunity to improve). Another union claimsthat an employee whose performance improves to an acceptable level duringan opportunity to improve has satisfied the requirement to demonstrateacceptable performance and, under 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6), cannot be reducedin grade or removed when the employee's acceptable performance does notcontinue. Two agencies endorsed the regulation as proposed. Three otheragencies, while supporting the concept of requiring an employee to sustainimprove performance, stated that the regulation as proposed was not clearon how long an employee could be required to sustain acceptable performanceafter having been given an opportunity to improve. These agencies contendedthat, read literally, the regulations could allow an agency to requirean employee to sustain acceptable performance following an opportunityto improve for an indefinite period of time. One of these agencies suggestedthat the regulations state that an employee should be expected to sustainacceptable performance for a reasonable time, depending on the circumstances.Another agency suggested that OPM consider a time limit of some sort. Theother agency suggested that, in the interest of equity, the employee shouldbe required to sustain acceptable performance for 1 year commencing withthe beginning of the employee's opportunity to improve.    <T3>Response:</T3> OPM has clarified that agencies may propose a reduction-in-gradeor removal action when an employee resumes unacceptable performance afterhaving been given an opportunity to improve, to address the problem ofemployees who improve their unacceptable performance only during a formalopportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance but who cannot or willnot maintain that improved level of performance afterwards. This occurs,for example, when an employee improves his or her level of performanceto an acceptable level, but does so only when threatened with removal orreduction in grade, or when an employee makes a good faith effort to improve,but can do so only for the period of time covered by the opportunity toimprove by working extra hours or working only on the tasks assigned underthe critical element(s) at issue. In other cases, an employee may be ableto perform while being given specific assistance, but cannot independentlyperform acceptably on his or her own afterwards. Instead of requiring thatemployees be provided additional opportunities to improve in situationssuch as these (which necessarily means providing more time and assistanceassociated with additional opportunities to demonstrate acceptable performance),OPMis clarifying that agencies have the authority under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43to propose a reduction-in-grade or removal action when an employee performsunacceptably after having been given a reasonable opportunity to improve.Congress, in creating the removal and reduction in grade provisions ofchapter 43, sought to give agencies clear authority and make it easierto take actions against employees who continue to perform unacceptablyafter being given an opportunity to improve. This notion is reflected inthe legislative history of the CSRA and the language of 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6).In line with this authority, OPM has concluded that implicit in the requirementthat an agency provide an employee who is performing unacceptably witha reasonable opportunity to improve, is the corresponding responsibilityof the employee to maintain any improved performance which results fromthe opportunity. An agency has a right to expect acceptable performanceonce it has identified the employee's performance deficiencies, informedthe employee of the performance requirements or standards that must beattained in order to demonstrate acceptable performance in his or her position,and provided the employee with a reasonable opportunity to improve (whichincludes assistance in improving unacceptable performance). In this regard,OPM's regulation, developed consistent with congressional intent and action,clarifies that employees may be subject to removal or reduction in gradeif acceptable performance demonstrated during the opportunity to improveis only short-term or temporary.Regarding the agencies' comments that the reproposed regulations, readliterally, could allow an agency to require an employee to sustain acceptableperformance for an indefinite period of time without affording an additionalopportunity to improve, OPM recognizes that the language in the reproposedregulations referring to a 1-year limit could be interpreted in such away. This was not OPM's intent. Therefore, OPM is revising the regulationto clarify that an agency's proposed reduction in grade or removal actionmay be based on instances of unacceptable performance which occur within1 year prior to the date of the proposed action and that action may beproposed if the employee's performance in one or more of the critical element(s)at issue is unacceptable during or following the employee's opportunityto improve. However, OPM, in exercising its regulatory discretion, hasdetermined that if an employee had performed acceptably for 1 year fromthe beginning of an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance (inthe critical element(s) for which he or she was afforded an opportunityto demonstrate acceptable performance), and the employee's performanceagain becomes unacceptable, the employee shall be afforded an additionalopportunity to improve before the agency may determine whether to proposea Part 432 action. OPM believes that this change, which sets reasonablelimits on requiring employees to improve unacceptable performance, is consistentwith congressional intent and strikes a balance between the needs of agenciesfor an efficient and effective work force and the rights of employees toa reasonable chance to demonstrate they can overcome serious performancedeficiencies.<T3>Comment on advance notice and final written decision: </T3>An agencyrecommends that OPM delete the words ``the instances of'' and ``those instancesof'' unacceptable performance from the subparagraphs relating to the advancenotice and final written decision. While the agency notes that the law(5 U.S.C. 4303(b)(1)(A)(i)) uses the words ``specific instances of unacceptableperformance,'' the agency believes that these subsections interpret thelegal language unnecessarily to require that specific examples of unacceptableperformance be stated in the proposal and decision notices.<T3>Response: </T3>OPM believes that the purpose of the legal requirementfor agencies to specify the instances of unacceptable performance on whichthe action is based is to inform employees with sufficient specificityabout the charges on which the action is based so that they may respondfully to those charges, both before an agency's final decision is madeand afterwards if the employee chooses to appeal. Therefore, OPM has notdeleted the language in these subsections as suggested by the agency.<T3>Comment on representation: </T3>A union requested that OPM provideclarification on the issue of representation. It noted that this sectionof the regulation provides for employees to select their own representativebut that agencies can disallow as an employee's representative an individualwhose activities would cause a conflict of interest or whose release fromhis or her position for representation purposes would give rise to unreasonablecosts or preclude the completion of priority assignments. The union statedthat employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are entitledto union representation and suggested that the regulation state that agenciesdo not have the authority to ``disallow'' such employees from participatingas representatives.<T3>Response: </T3>The provision of the regulations which permits an agencyto disallow an employee's representative under limited circumstances hasbeen in effect since 1979. OPM is aware of no problems with the administrationof this provision and believes that there is good justification for circumscribingan employee's latitude in choosing a representative in certain limitedsituations. Further, OPM expects that agencies will continue to deny anemployee's choice of representative only in the very limited circumstancesprovided for in the regulation. This provision is not aimed at denyingunion representation of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.The regulation is intended to provide agencies with the authority, in verylimited circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable negotiatedagreement, to disallow as an employee's representative an individual whoseabsence from the workplace would create serious disruption, be very costly,or raise a significant conflict of interest.<T3>Comments on consideration of medical conditions: </T3>One agency statedits belief that the language in the reproposed regulation which allowsemployees to present pertinent medical information during the notice periodbefore the agency decision, might be interpreted as relieving employeesof any responsibility to raise medical issues earlier in the process ifthey wish the agency to consider it. It noted that, in practice, employeeswhose performance may be affected by a medical condition have ample opportunityto raise the condition before the notice period, and have it consideredby the agency well before it has to decide whether to propose action. Further,it noted that the current regulation provides that if the employee wantsthe agency to consider a medical condition in connection with a performancedeficiency, the employee should, whenever possible, raise the issue whenthe agency offers him or her an opportunity to improve. The agency alsopointed out that the early identification of medical conditions also allowsemployees to be informed of disability retirement options before the noticeof proposal. The agency stated that failure to require early submissionof medical evidence and to inform the employee of disability retirementoptions would delay further what is already a long and cumbersome process.Another agency expressed concern that the reproposed regulation seems torequire the agency to inform the employee in the notice of proposed actionof the employee's right to raise a medical issue, thus shifting the burdenfrom the employee to the agency to raise medical issues in connection withthe employee's unacceptable performance. A third agency recommended thatOPM change the language in this section from requiring that an agency ``<T3>shall be aware of</T3> the affirmative obligations of 29 CFR 1613.704''to ``<T3>shall consider</T3> the affirmative obligations of 29 CFR 1613.704.''<T3>Response:</T3> Although the reproposed regulation did not intend thatemployees wait until the notice period to raise medical issues, OPM agreesthat the reproposed regulation could be interpreted in this manner. Accordingly,OPM has clarified its position along the lines of the requirements in thecurrent Part 432 (and included in the initial proposed regulations) thatemployees should, whenever possible, raise medical issues (and supply appropriatemedical documentation) at the time they are notified by the agency of unacceptableperformance or at the latest, as part of the employee's response to a proposedreduction in grade or removal action. In addition, the regulation doesnot require agencies to inform the employee in a notice of proposed actionof a right to raise a medical issue. OPM hopes the revisions to the regulationwill clarify that employees who believe that medical issues may be contributingto their unacceptable performance have the responsibility to raise theissues at the earliest possible time.Regarding the agency's recommendation to change the language from ``shallbe aware of the affirmative obligations of 29 CFR 1613.704'' to ``shallconsider * * *,'' OPM notes that the affirmative obligations of 29 CFR1613.704 require that an agency make reasonable accommodation to the knownphysical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped employee unlessthe agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an unduehardship on the operation of its program. Agencies need to be aware ofthese obligations so that they can consider whether reasonable accommodationis appropriate under the circumstances of the case. Thus, OPM continuesto believe that the term ``aware'' is appropriate in the context of theregulation and has not adopted the agency's suggested change. (Note thatthis language is identical to the language in the current Part 432 as wellas the current Part 752.) 8. Section 432.106 Appeal and Grievance Rights <T3>Comment on appeal rights:</T3> An agency requested that OPM clarifyappeal rights with regard to the coverage of those employees who were inthe competitive service at the time their positions were first listed underSchedule A, B, or C and still occupy those positions. <T3>Response:</T3> Employees who were in the competitive service at thetime their positions were first listed under Schedule A, B, or C and stilloccupy those positions remain in the competitive service in accordancewith 5 CFR 212.401(b). Since these employees are in the competitive service,they have appeal rights in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 4303(e). <T3>Comments on grievance rights:</T3> Three unions and one agency commentedon the regulation's exclusion of nonpreference eligible excepted serviceemployees challenging removal or reduction-in-grade actions under negotiatedgrievance procedures. The commenters claim that 5 U.S.C. 7121 providesfor negotiated grievance procedures to cover a broad variety of disputeswith limited exceptions and that no specific restriction is stated fornonpreference eligible employees in the excepted service. One union statedthat what may be appealed to the MSPB does not restrict what is grievable.Two unions stated that the FLRA, and not OPM, has the authority to determinewhat is grievable or not grievable. The unions cited <T3>National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and HumanServices, Region V, Chicago, Illinois,</T3> 25 FLRA 94, in which the FLRAheld that grievance rights can be negotiated to cover nonpreference exceptedservice employees, as support for their position. <T3>Response:</T3> As stated in the reproposed regulations, OPM believesthat it is helpful to the users of the regulations to set forth in oneplace the specific categories of employees who have appeal and grievancerights for challenging removal and reduction in grade actions taken underthis part. In the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress enacted a comprehensiveremedial plan which specified the rights of certain categories of employeesto challenge certain personnel actions taken against them. The plan doesnot provide nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service the right tochallenge adverse and performance-based actions. The reproposed regulationsreflected the remedial framework set forth in the Civil Service ReformAct and thereby did not provide an appeal or grievance right for nonpreferenceeligibles in the excepted service. OPM's position reflected the UnitedStates Supreme Court's decision in the <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Fausto,</T3> 108 S.Ct. 668 (1988), which emphasized in particular theexclusivity of the remedies that the CSRA provides for employees in theexcepted service. Specifically, in emphasizing the preferred position ofcompetitive service employees over excepted service employees, the SupremeCourt concluded that ``[i]n the context of the entire statutory scheme,we think it [CSRA] displays a clear congressional intent to deny the excludedemployees the protections of Chapter 75_including judicial review_for personnelactions covered by that chapter.'' 108 S.Ct. at 673. Although OPM is aware that the FLRA, in <T3>National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and HumanServices, Region V, Chicago, Illinois,</T3> 25 FLRA 94, held that grievancerights can be negotiated to cover non-preference excepted service employees,this FLRA decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals forthe Seventh Circuit in <T3>FLRA</T3> v. <T3>HHS</T3>, 858 F.2d 1278 (7th Cir. 1988). In reversing the FLRA decision,the Seventh Circuit relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Fausto.</T3> The Seventh Circuit stated that the Supreme Court's reasoningin <T3>Fausto</T3> applies to the right to appeal an adverse action to anarbitrator even though that right comes under a different portion of theCSRA. The court stated that ``arbitration * * * entails the same type ofafter-the-fact review * * * of an agency's decision as do the statutoryappeals procedures. It simply substitutes an arbitrator for MSPB review.''The Seventh Circuit concluded that the rights and remedies available toa nonpreference eligible excepted service employee when an agency takesan adverse action are ``a maximum'' and therefore are not conditions ofemployment subject to collective bargaining under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71.In addition, a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia Circuit, <T3>Department of the Treasury</T3> v. <T3>FLRA,</T3> No. 88-1159 (D.C. Cir. May 2, 1989), also reversed the FLRAand ruled that nonpreference eligible employees in the excepted servicehave no right to arbitral review of Chapter 43 actions. The D.C. Circuit,as did the Seventh Circuit in <T3>FLRA </T3>v. <T3>HHS</T3> (discussed above), relied heavily on the Supreme Court's decisionin <T3>Fausto</T3> to find that giving grievance/arbitration rights to nonpreferenceeligibles in the excepted service would be inconsistent with congressionalintent in the CSRA to provide an ``integrated scheme'' for adjudicatingemployee appeals, and would run the risk of inverting the preference grantedto competitive service employees and veterans. The court explained thatarbitral review of cases involving nonpreference eligibles would not besubject to the substantive law requirements which bind MSPB and arbitratorsruling on parallel appeals by competitive service employees and veteransand would not be subject to Federal Circuit review. Accordingly, OPM's reproposed regulation accurately reflect the uniformholdings of the courts which have addressed the issue of which categoriesof employees, against whom actions based on misconduct or unacceptableperformance have been taken, are entitled to appeal and grievance rightsunder law. Therefore, the language in the final regulation is consistentwith that in the reproposed regulation regarding grievance rights of bargainingunit employees who have been reduced in grade or removed under this part.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it applies only to Federalemployees. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>5 CFR Part 430 Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Reportingrequirements. 5 CFR Part 432 Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM amends 5 CFR Parts 430 and 432 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 430_PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT </ITAG>1.
