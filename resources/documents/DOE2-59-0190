A heat transformer used in an industrial process (a secondtype heat pump) is one of the systems. When the exhausted heat entersan evaporator, the cold medium heated by the exhausted heat evaporatesand is absorbed into the absorbent liquid in an absorber. The heat generatedin this process is used to generate steam. This system uses exhaustedheat as the in-coming heat and generates the out-going heat the temperatureof which is about 30 degrees higher than that of the exhausted heat.It is, therefore, highly effective in conserving energy. As an example,it is used to recover the heat of the alcoholic steam generated by anethyl alcohol distillatory plant. The quantity of heat it recovers isone and a half times as much as the latent heat of the steam. The recoveredheat is used to heat the distillatory tower reboiler. So far, the systemannually saves the heat energy equivalent to 698kl of crude oil. (7 figs,2 tabs, 1 photo, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
