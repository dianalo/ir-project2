The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's jobless rate of5.3 percent was due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in thecivilian labor force _ the number of people either holding jobs orlooking for them, the Labor Department said.   The labor force had remained essentially unchanged from Augustthrough October and has grown by only 2 million people in the past12 months, including the big gain in November, reflecting a taperingoff of the Baby Boom generation entering the job market.   Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, thegovernment figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs lastmonth, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Bothare record highs, said Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L.Norwood.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attributed therise to ``a large increase in the labor force'' and noted that thetotal number of employed reached an all-time high. ``There were morepeople looking for work,'' he said.   The number of factory jobs climbed by 71,000 in November on topof a four-year record-high 99,000 new assembly line workers inOctober following a slight decline in the late summer.   ``Over the past year, the number of factory jobs has risen by425,000,'' Norwood said in prepared testimony before the JointEconomic Committee of Congress. `This growth has been concentratedin a limited number of industries, with machinery alone counting formore than a quarter of the gain.''   Meanwhile, factory workers continued to average four hours ofovertime a week last month, indicating that the manufacturing sectoris continuning to boom and there is no slowdown in the rate ofeconomic growth.   Many economists are concerned that inflation will continueincreasing unless the growth rate is slowed, but there was noindication that it did in November, acording to the job figures, thefirst economic indicator of the month.   Construction employment increased by 55,000 over the month,reflecting an upturn in housing starts, after sluggish activity fromJuly through October.   The November job figures officially mark the sixth birthday ofthe current economic expansion, the longest in the nation's history.But the pattern of growth has not been consistent throughout.   Factory jobs, for example, rose by 1.4 million in the first twoyears of recovery following a loss of nearly 2 million jobs in the1981-82 recession. But in 1985 and 1986, they declined by 600,000before rebounding by 850,000 over the past two years.   `Not unexpectedly, changes in the unemployment rate for adult menhave tracked closely with the factory job swings,'' said Norwood.`It fell from 10 percent to 6.2 percent during the initial rebound,was unchanged in the middle years, and dropped from 6.2 percent to4.8 percent in the past two years.''   The pattern of female joblessness, meanwhile, has shown a moreconsistent, gradual decline. It, too, was 4.8 percent last month.   The service side of the economy added 345,000 new jobs lastmonth, including 40,000 in transportation, reflecting an improvementin the health of the airline industry.   Retail trade employment climbed by 19,000 despite a decrease of2,000 workers in department stores. Department store employment hasnow been falling for five months in a row, an indication to someeconomists that consumer spending is slowing and that exports ofU.S. manufactred products abroad are propelling the nation'scontinued growth.   Health service jobs rose by 56,000 last month while employment inbusiness services such as data processing climbed by 31,000 afterseveral months of sluggish activity.   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings were unchanged at $9.45 inNovember after rising by a nickel in October, setting off fears of awage-push inflation then.   An alternate employment rate that includes the 1.7 millionmembers of the Armed Forces stationed in the country also rose lastmonth, from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent.   Unemployment rates for various population groups showed little orno improvement. They climbed from 11 percent to 11.2 percent forblacks, from 7.7 percent to 8.1 percent for Hispanics and from 26.5percent to 30.4 percent for black teen-agers.</TEXT></DOC>
