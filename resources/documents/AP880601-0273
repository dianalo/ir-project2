Yesterday's conclusions have away of becoming quickly outdated.   Jeffrey Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist who hasestablished himself as one of the country's leading students ofelectronic religions, took both risks in ``Televangelism: Power andPolitics in God's Country,'' written with Anson Shupe, of IndianaUniversity.   In their book, Hadden and Shupe make the case that Pat Robertsoncould win the Republican Party nomination for president. By thetime Hadden came to New York to promote the book, he was trying toexplain how Robertson lost.   Robertson's candidacy was dead after he finished third in SouthCarolina, a state he had once boasted of winning, and buried afterhe came up empty in the Super Tuesday primaries in the South.   Robertson failed to mount a serious challenge to George Bush,even though he beat the vice president in the Iowa caucuses, andHadden believes it is an open question whether the Christian rightis capable of electing a candidate.   Hadden and Shupe argue that a candidate from the Christian rightstands to benefit from these factors:   _President Reagan has legitimized religious conservatism.   _The religious right overhwelmingly dominates religiousbroadcasting.   _Ministries such as Robertson's ``700 Club'' have developedimpressive fund-raising skills.   _There is evidence of a conservative shift in the electorate.   The reality, though, was that Pat Robertson couldn't win thisyear.   Robertson's failure, Hadden said in a recent interview, was acombination of mistakes and a miscalculation of his base of support.   ``He got so tangled up in his own words, and his own gaffes,that once he had attention there was never a moment to say, `Thisis why I have a better vision for America.'   ``He also erred very badly,'' Hadden said, ``in not addressingthe religion issue head-on very early... (John F.) Kennedy was ableto wait until he had the nomination before he felt he had to dothat; Pat should have done it very early.''   Robertson also overestimated the size of his base, Hadden said.   ``He had measured the size of the evangelical Christian vote,and mistook it for his core constituency, which is charismatic,''he said.   ``Even the charismatics, upon seeing the way he was performing _in New Hampshire basically, but between Iowa and South Carolina _began to shake their heads and say, `This does not look like a manwho is presidential.' So he didn't get the turnouts.''   That suggests, Hadden said, that there is no monolithic``Christian right'' bloc.   ``There is a huge conservative-evangelical-Christian sentimentout there, there is no doubt in my mind about that, but it isitself divided,'' he said. ``They are not warring in quite the waythey warred in earlier times, they are loyal around particularclusters and leaders.   ``It is not a matter of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell vyingfor the leadership of the Christian right. They are, respectively,leaders of the charismatic and fundamentalist contingents, neitherof which has a whole lot of influence over the Southern Baptists,who in turn are split into at least two very significant camps, northe people who are roughly aligned with the National Association ofEvangelicals, which is yet another sector.   ``Politically, if you can do what Bush was successful in doing,getting significant figures lined up to support you, then you helpkeep them polarized.''   It may be, he said, that someone like President Reagan, who isnot identified with any particular denomination, will have moresuccess in courting that vote.   ``I think there is a very important lesson there,'' Hadden said.``He speaks their language without being one of them.''
