JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush called Friday for banning theproduction and use of ozone-depleting chemicals entirely by the endof the century if adequate substitutes can be found.   The moves to protect the world's ozone layer, which shields theearth from much of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, cameon the heels of a decision Thursday by 12 European countries topursue a ban on the chemicals instead of only cutting back onproduction, as the world's industrial nations had earlier agreed todo.   The United States accounts for about one-third of the productionof ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and airconditions and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computerequipment.   Richard K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,had sought the stronger administration position on CFCs prior to hisdeparture Friday for London where representatives from more than 100nations are meeting to discuss the ozone-depletion problem.   Reilly, according to administration sources, had stronglyrecommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the United Statesshould join its European allies and call for the completeelimination of CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by only 50percent as required by current treaty.   Under a 1987 treaty, the industrial nations are committed tohalving CFC production by the year 2,000, but many scientists havesaid that such a cutback would not be enough to protect againstserious ozone depletion.   On Thursday, the 12 nations of the European Economic Communityannounced in Brussels, Belgium, that they have agreed to a total banon the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. Reillyis known to have wanted to carry a similar commitment with him tothe London conference, which is scheduled to begin Sunday.   ``We intend to reaffirm the strong position of the United Statesabout chlorofluorocarbon manufacture and use,'' Reilly said Friday,adding that ``we intend to maintain our leadership'' among theworld's nations in dealing with the ozone-depletion problem.   Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because itdoes not break down at lower altitudes and floats into thestratosphere, where it breaks down and interacts with the gaseousveil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causingultraviolet rays.   After scientists detected increasing ozone depletion, theindustrial nations agreed in September, 1987 to a pledge of sharpcut in the production of ozone-depleting chemicals _ primarily CFCsbut also three halon chemicals _ by the end of 1999.   The treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including theUnited States, Japan, most of Western Europe and Soviet Union. Butit includes a provision that allows additional measures, including acomplete ban, if further ozone damage is found.   The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider anaccelerated phase out schedule _ which is provided for in the 1987accord _ at a meeting in Helsinki in early May. The meeting thatwill begin Sunday in London, attracting representatives from morethan 100 nations, is described as a dress rehearsal for the Helsinkisession.   According to the World Resources Institute, the United Statesproduces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. DuPont deNemours andamp; Co. the world's largest producer. There were 750 millionpounds of CFCs produced in the United States last year and about thesame amount in Western Europe, according to Dupont.   Dupont, which accounts for about half of the U.S. production, hasannounced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as themid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.   ``We think in the mid-90s is when we'll see the wide scaleintroduction of the alternatives,'' said Catherine Forte, a Dupontspokeswoman said in a telephone interview. The manufacturers ofpackaging for many food containers already have stopped using CFCsas a blowing agent in the formulation of plastics.   But industry and EPA officials have acknowledged continuingproblems in developing adequate CFC substitutes for some uses. Asubstitute for CFCs used widely as a cleaning solvent for computerand electrical equipment has been particularly difficult, suggestedindustry experts.   The EPA is still conducting toxicity tests for a number of theCFC substitutes, said agency spokesman Chris Rice. Ms. Forte atDupont also said the substitutes ``are going to be more difficult toproduce than the existing product.''</TEXT></DOC>
