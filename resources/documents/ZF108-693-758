(products)Apple Computer Inc. (products).andO;Product:   Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (design andconstruction).andO;Topic:     Graphical User InterfaceMarketingComparisonPerformance Improvement.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>I have been a lifelong critic of Windows, but when Microsoft released its newversion 3.0, I was one  of the first in line to upgrade.andM;When Windows 1.0 was released in 1985, the PC/XTs and ATs of that time werewholly inadequate to drive Microsoft's graphical environment-even if therehad been major applications available.andP;  Later, when the basic Windows 2.0 wasrenamed Windows/286 to discourage its use on XTs, the software still didnothing to exploit enhanced 286 features, and it lurched erratically withinits limited 640K-byte memory area.andM;The 386-aware version of Windows 3.0 has replaced the former weakling,changing the field of software develpment dramatically.andP;  And Microsoft'sWindows strategy has become clear.andM;Windows 3.0 will outsell OS/2andM;For starters, Microsoft acknowledges that only 300,000 copies of OS/2 havebeen shipped from its introduction in December 1987 through March1990disappointing in a world that installs well over 10 million DOS PCs everyyear.andM;By contrast, the early, limited incarnation of Windows has moved over Imillion copies.andP;  And Windows 3.0 will probably tack on another 1 millionusers every year, beginning this year.andM;Furthermore, while Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has urged commercialprogrammers to develop OS/2 applications since 1987, which OS/2 apps didMicrosoft itself develop? Not PC Excel, Word for Windows, Powerpoint orMicrosoft Project.andP;  All of these appeared in Windows versions long beforeOS/2 Presentation Manager versions were available-or even announced.andM;The winners in all this? Microsoft, certainly, but also all those developersand corporate users who invested in Windows.andP;  The losers? Such companies asLotus and WordPerfect which spent millions of dollars devoted to OS/2, onlyto be left with a tiny market.andM;OS/2 copies will still sell, mostly as the core of network-server operatingsystems.andP;  But Windows 3.0 will vastly outsell OS/2 for years to come.andM;Any dedicated Macintosh user understandably found Windows 2.x laughablecompared to the fully integrated environment that almost all Mac softwareadheres to.andP;  But the laughter is turning to concern among many Apple vendors.andM;Top-of-the-line 33-MHz 386 compatibles (on which Windows 3.0 flies) areavailable for fully $2,000 less than comparably equipped Macintosh IICi's.andO;That's including a hard drive, a 640-by480-pixel color display, a mathcoprocessor and an Ethernet adapter.andM;Windows 3.0's icon-based front end has added some features that still aren'tavailable on the Mac after years of steady grousing by Finder users.andP;  Andeven the loudly proclaimed superiority of the Mac in &quot;multimedia&quot;applications-what more sober minds would call desktop video-is beingseriously challenged.andM;When you investigate the Mac desktop video field, you find products like theMicroTV from Apps Inc. The MicroTV board for the Mac displays a moving imageon a 3-by-2.5-inch portion of an Apple monitor.andP;  That small, black-and-white,image is not resizable.andM;But at least two companies, with much less hubbub, are already shippingproducts that display full-color, resizable images on PC monitors underWindows.andP;  These products, from New Media Graphics, Billerica, MA, andVideoLogic Inc., Cambridge, MA, permit sophisticated image manipulation withcommon VGA or EGA hardware.andM;Of course, Windows will never sway heavy Mac users, such as professionalpublishers who separate glossy fourcolor photos with specialized Macsoftware.andP;  And Windows can never hope to be as artsy as the Mac, with itscute animations.andM;But many corporate buyers don't care about these Mac niceties.andP;  Windows 3.0'spoint-and-click power may be enough to turn the graphical tide toward PCs,when departmental budgets are drawn up for the year.andM;Windows shines above VGAandM;Part of the $2,000 savings mentioned above could be invested in higherresolution displays that approach workstation functionality.andP;  Yes, we'veheard this before-PCs competing with workstations.andP;  But add to your 386 botha 1,024by-768-pixel graphics coprocessor board from Paradise or fromRenaissance GRX Inc. and a Mitsubishi 16inch 6615 Monitor.andP;  You've put on thedesktop a graphical powerhouse for only $1,200 more than the basic VGAsystem.andM;The bane of early Windows usersthat the display was too sluggish-is almosttotally eliminated by a graphics coprocessor, like the Texas InstrumentsGraphic Architecture (TIGA) chip used in the Renaissance and similar boards.andO;The TIGA coprocessor frees the CPU from positioning pixels, greatly speedingup screen redraws.andM;This coprocessor may even eliminate the need for a particularly fast,expensive 386 to run Windows in the first place.andP;  Renaissance product managerGrant Wells says, &quot;Running AutoCAD, our board is almost as fast in an 8-MHzAT as a 25-MHz 386, give or take 10 to 15 percent.&quot;andM;Next month we'll see how these products can bring serious graphicscapabilities to PCs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
