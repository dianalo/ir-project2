He played Nintendo video games at home in the family roomfor hours, alone or with friends, sometimes until 3 a.m. &quot;Iwas, like, hooked,&quot; says the Concord, N.H., youngster, whosecollection of Nintendo gear and 20 games cost his parentsmore than $1,000. &quot;It kind of took over my life,&quot; he says. &quot;Ididn't feel like doing anything else except that.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But things change. Now, says Kevin, &quot;I can't remember thelast time I played the game.&quot; His current passion isbaseball. &quot;I love being outdoors.&quot;   After zapping America's kids into a video-game frenzy fiveyears ago, Nintendo Co.'s games are losing their zip. TheJapanese company's U.S. sales -- along with those oflicensees that make games for Nintendo -- have slumped. Attoy stores, discount tags have replaced &quot;sold out&quot; signs.   But parents shouldn't be celebrating just yet. Coming soonto a toy store near you will be a new Nintendo game systemwith a more powerful computer chip for sharper colors,clearer sound, better graphics, faster action.   If it sells, the new Super Nintendo Entertainment Systemwill propel Nintendo to still greater heights. It already isa hit in Japan, where it was introduced five months ago.Nintendo plans to spend $25 million on advertising when theproduct is introduced in the U.S. this summer. And it hasbeen generating advance interest for the new product byrunning teasers about it for months in Nintendo Powermagazine, which has two million readers. &quot;Kids all overAmerica are going to go, `Wow]'&quot; predicts Peter Main, vicepresident of marketing for Nintendo of America Inc., the U.S.unit. (Mr. Main, at the same time, confirmed that the companyhas put on pause a plan to exploit the computer possibilitiesof its game system in banking, shopping and investing athome.)   Selling Super Nintendo, however, will be one of thebiggest and riskiest marketing challenges of the high-techage. The new system will make the existing Nintendo systemobsolete, because old games won't work on the new machine. SoNintendo must persuade parents -- many already turned off byvideo games -- to write off what they have spent and shellout an estimated $190 for the new system, plus $60 for eachgame. (Their old Nintendo probably cost them $100, plus $35to $40 per game.)   &quot;No way,&quot; vows Donna McCarthy, a Boston mother of three.&quot;We're not shoving the old Nintendo in the closet. I've got$700 invested in that baby.&quot; Adds Ann Edgerton, a mother oftwo Nintendo-playing boys in Tempe, Ariz.: &quot;I don't likeNintendo, and I'm not buying it any more.&quot;   If Super Nintendo bombs, Nintendo could be in big trouble.&quot;Video games are a cyclical business, and history tends torepeat itself,&quot; says Michael Katz, a former executive atrival video-game makers, citing the industry's boom-and-bustpast. &quot;With market saturation, and the overdose of productswe have today, wearout in consumer interest is a very likelyoutcome.&quot;   Nintendo was one of the great consumer-product successstories of the 1980s. Founded 103 years ago as a manufacturerof Japanese playing cards, Nintendo entered the video-gamebusiness despite the dramatic collapse of Atari Inc. in theearly 1980s after breakneck growth. Toy companies sneered atNintendo, saying the video-game craze was dead and buried.But in 1986, Nintendo's first year on the market in the U.S.,consumers bought $300 million in players and game cartridges.Its first megahit game: the Legend of Zelda -- asword-and-sorcery thriller in which the hero, Link, mustrescue Zelda.   Nintendo became a &quot;gotta-have&quot; toy, with parentsdesperately seeking game players at stores that often didn'thave any left. U.S. retail sales nearly tripled, to $830million in 1987. Extremely popular games, Super Mario Bros.for instance, spawned sequels. (Nintendo produces some gamesitself and licenses other companies to make games, too,including Atari Games Corp., a spinoff of the original.)Despite slowing growth, sales reached $3.4 billion last year.Nintendo, which reports its U.S. sales only in retail terms,expects consumers to plunk down $4 billion on its systems andgames this year, with the dropoff in sales of its existingsystem to be offset by the success of Super Nintendo and GameBoy, Nintendo's wildly popular portable video game.   Nearly 30 million U.S. homes have Nintendo systems. Andthe company's share of the video-game market is better than80%. Its name is right up there with Coca-Cola and Clorox andXerox in name recognition, observes Jack Trout, of Trout andamp;Ries, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing consultant.   Still, many American kids seem to have discovered there islife after Nintendo. Sales of the original Nintendo gameplayer declined 20% in 1990. Game sales rose 20%. But thisyear has been considerably worse. Nintendo of Americareported last week that sales of its existing game playerdropped 29% in the first quarter, and sales of its videogames fell 12%. (The company projects a 38% drop in sales ofits existing system this year and a 25% decline in gamecartridges.)   Some of the biggest U.S. makers of Nintendo games havesuffered as well. Software Toolworks Inc., in Novato, Calif.,expects to report a $20 million loss for the quarter endedMarch 31, and Acclaim Entertainment Inc., in Oyster Bay,N.Y., reported a 27% revenue decline in the quarter endedFeb. 28.   Scoring a hit with Super Nintendo is critical, therefore.But duplicating Nintendo's original success may beimpossible.   For one thing, there is more competition, though not fromU.S. companies. Two other Japanese concerns, NEC Corp. andSega Enterprises of Japan, beat Nintendo to the market in1989 with advanced games that use 16-bit computer chips(which are what Super Nintendo will have). The 8-bit computerthat powers the original Nintendo system has less pizazz. SNKCorp. of Japan came out this spring with a very upscale,24-bit computer game called NeoGeo that costs $650 for theplayer and $200 for each game cartridge.   While the success of these less-well-known rivals has beenlimited (together, they have less than 18% of the 1990market), the products themselves are comparable to SuperNintendo, and that alone could make Nintendo's new systemseem less novel and exciting. Maybe 95% name recognition willdo the trick for Nintendo anyway.   James Wilcox, editor of Twice, a consumer-electronicstrade magazine, who has played the new Nintendo game, callsit &quot;an evolutionary, not a revolutionary&quot; product. &quot;I don'tthink Nintendo will have trouble selling the first twomillion. The question is, what success will they have afterthat? It's not the quantum leap that people think it mightbe.&quot; Better sound, better color, better graphics and the restmay not excite the market in the middle of a recession.   Nintendo is also on the defensive about its marketingpractices. It recently settled one part of a JusticeDepartment complaint alleging price fixing. After a jointinvestigation by the Federal Trade Commission and the statesof New York and Maryland, the federal government allegedNintendo had bullied retailers into keeping prices high,threatening to cut off shipments, one state official said, ifretailers lowered prices by as much as a nickel.   Nintendo settled the matter by agreeing to send buyers $25million in $5 coupons, but without admitting guilt. Nintendosaid it wanted to avoid &quot;a lengthy court battle,&quot; and to&quot;maintain the good will our company enjoys with millions ofconsumers,&quot; according to a company spokesman.   Nintendo remains under investigation for allegedly usingits product design and licensing policies to lock others outof its business. Justice Department officials won't commenton the case. But Nintendo has been accused in a series ofcivil lawsuits of designing its video console so consumerscan use only Nintendo game cartridges with the machines.Competitors have complained that the company has aggressivelytried, and succeeded in several instances, to block rivalsfrom selling unauthorized imitations of Nintendo games.Nintendo denies those allegations.   The biggest obstacles to the success of Super Nintendo,however, are probably declining interest among kids and thesales resistance of parents.   Per Anderson, of Tempe, Ariz., recently invited 16 friendsto help him celebrate his 13th birthday playing baseball in apark. &quot;Before,&quot; he says, &quot;I would have been too busy tryingout a new Nintendo game {given as a birthday gift} to even goto the bathroom.&quot; He didn't get a new game this year becausehe had made it known he didn't want one.   Matthew Bonner, 11, of Concord, N.H., recently asked hisparents not to renew his subscription to Nintendo Powermagazine. &quot;If I had to make a list,&quot; he says, &quot;I would rankriding my bike No. 1, doing my homework No. 5 and playingvideo games No. 8.&quot;   Some parents particularly resent the pressure to buy anexpensive new system. &quot;I'm trying, believe me I'm trying, toteach my children not to grow up to be good littleconsumers,&quot; says Mary Love, a single mother of three inDenver who works in a health-food store. She says she can'tafford a new video-game system after paying, she figures,$1,000 over the past few years on a Nintendo game player andmyriad cartridges (there are more than 300).   Barry Rothberg, toy and video-game analyst for MabonNugent andamp; Co., says: &quot;The $3-to-$4 billion {a year} businessis going to become a $1-to-$2 billion business in a couple ofyears.&quot;   Of course, nobody really knows how Super Nintendo willfare. And Nintendo's marketing prowess shouldn't beunderestimated.   Game Boy is a good example of the company's feel for whatcustomers want. (President Bush was seen playing Game Boywith his grandson during his stay this week as a patient atBethesda Naval Medical Center.) Though Game Boy -- like SuperNintendo -- has its own game cartridges incompatible with theexisting stay-at-home Nintendo system -- it has been a hugesuccess. First-quarter Game Boy sales rose 61% (bringingtotal sales since it was introduced in 1989, to 4.7 millionunits), and sales of game cartridges quadrupled in thequarter (bringing the total to 15 million). Game Boy isn'tcheap, either. The basic apparatus sells for about $89, andgames run between $29 and $39.   And as for Super Nintendo, it has been a big hit back homein Japan (where it goes by the name Super Famicom). Since itwas introduced there in November, more than 1.5 million unitshave been sold, the company says. To increase interest inSuper Nintendo, the company will produce most of the best newgames only for the new system, including the fourth SuperMario Bros. sequel.   Nintendo also is using its Nintendo Power magazine togenerate demand even before the product is available. Formonths, the magazine has been touting features of the newsystem in breathless prose: &quot;awesome graphics and almost-livedigital sound,&quot; &quot;extra controller buttons,&quot; &quot;more enemiesthan ever {in games} for greater challenge.&quot; It warns thatquantities will probably be limited at first -- so rush outand buy one -- when there is one out there to buy. (Thestrategy has almost been too successful: Fans are cautionednot to buy &quot;illegal imports&quot; of the 16-bit Japanese gameplayers, which aren't compatible with the version to be soldin the U.S.)   &quot;You've got to say one thing about Nintendo,&quot; says RobertKleiber, an analyst for Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood inMinneapolis. &quot;It knows how to prime the pump.&quot;   Moreover, peer pressure among kids themselves has yet tobe reckoned with. Notes Janice Gibson, a child psychologistwho writes an advice column in Parents magazine: &quot;Themiddle-class upwardly mobile family is the most vulnerable tothis sort of thing.&quot;   And some kids just can't wait, they are so excited. &quot;I'llsell my BMX {bicycle} if I have to,&quot; says Ronnie Stedelhough,a 12-year-old in Burlington, Vt. &quot;I got to get one. Myfriends will come over, and it'll be a blast.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
