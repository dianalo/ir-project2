Yesterday five justices agreed that Pennsylvania could effectively expropriate unmined coal without having to pay any compensation to the owners. Four justices dissented in shock at this reading of the Fifth Amendment prohibition that private property not &quot;be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot; Adding insult to injury was the fact that in 1922, the Supreme Court voted 8 to 1 that Pennsylvania would have to pay compensation under a nearly identical statute.    The blow to property rights came in Keystone Bituminous Coal vs. DeBenedictis, written by Justice Stevens and joined by liberal Justices Brennan and Marshall and fence-sitters White and Blackmun. The 1980 law required that coal owners leave half the coal beneath certain structures in the ground to avoid subsidence. There is no question that states can make such requirements to protect the health or safety of its citizens under its &quot;police power.&quot; States can also condemn land to build roads. But the Fifth Amendment protection requires states to compensate the owners for their losses. The losses here amounted to 27 million tons of coal, and up to 9% of the coal in some mines.    The coal owners figured they had an awfully good case. The only obvious difference with the earlier case, Pennsylvania Coal vs. Mahon, was that the 1920s law regulated the mining of hard coal while this one had to do with soft coal. But the majority found what it thought were two big distinctions: First, that the commonwealth stated more clearly in the recent law the intention to benefit the public, and second, that in any case the law didn't &quot;make it impossible for petitioners to profitably engage in their business.&quot;    Both distinctions are classics for those who delight in catching justices counting angels on pinheads. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for dissenting Justices Powell, O'Connor and Scalia, found that the differences between the two cases &quot;verge on the trivial.&quot; The takings clause does not say that if a taking benefits the public (as opposed to private parties) then no compensation needs to be paid. It says that a taking can be made, but only if it is to benefit the public and if compensation is then paid.    The takings clause does not make the second distinction either. Compensation must be paid when takings cause owners losses, even if they still manage a &quot;profit.&quot; Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out that the owners' &quot;interests in particular coal deposits have been completely destroyed . . . every bit as much as if the government had proceeded to mine the coal for its own use.&quot; When other types of civil-rights claims are considered, the court rightfully doesn't ask if discrimination against a minority member only robs him of a little equal treatment; if a little discrimination is unlawful, so too is a little taking without compensation.    This decision may turn out to be an aberration from the recent trend back toward judges reading the text of the Constitution and respecting the original intent of the Founders. The justices will have several chances to acquit themselves better when the high court soon decides several other takings cases. These include the rent-control law discussed here yesterday and a challenge to a California law that requires beachfront-property owners to grant public access without getting reasonable compensation.    The basic problem here is that five justices somehow read into the law less deference for &quot;mere&quot; economic rights. The closer they look at the unchanging text, the more obvious it will be that this is a distinction without justification. It would add immeasurably to the celebration of the Constitution's bicentennial if the justices decide to grant equal protection to all civil rights. </TEXT></DOC>
