The test kiln was of 7 x200 ft size with a design rating of 53 tonnes/day lime product. Conversionof the kiln to dual wood waste/oil operation necessitated a number ofmodifications detailed in this report. Representative baseline test datawere recorded for oil-fired operation in order to establish the impactof dual-firing. For several levels of oil substitution, wood-heat inputwas varied with fixed oil flow to determine the effect on lime availability.Computer simulation was used to develop parameter profiles for an insightinto the thermal aspects of dual-firing, to predict optimal performanceof the test system, and to evaluate performance limits for dual-fueloperation. The simulation indicated that efficient conversion of an existingkiln should include consideration of reduced kiln speed, increased refractorythickness, increased Wet-Cell gas temperature, and reduced ingress air.Optimization of the test kiln was explored assuming reduction in speedand ingress air only. It is recommended that a computer simulation beemployed for evaluation of dual-fuel conversions on other kilns. In approachingconversion particular attention should be given to the following areas:fuel moisture content, hot gas duct design, kiln speed, draft fan capacity,and kiln hood and scrubber improvements. The influence of economic factorson kiln conversion was investigated. Based on current world residualoil price, lime kiln conversion is economic, if hog fuel is availablefor $30/unit or less. 12 refs., 40 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
