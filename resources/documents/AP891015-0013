The unidentified source also provided assurances that two otherBritons missing in Lebanon, journalist John McCarthy and NorthernIrish teacher Brian Keenan, are alive, said Eve Keatley, aspokeswoman for Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.   Waite, 50, the archbishop's personal emissary, vanished inBeirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release oftwo U.S. hostages. He was on his fifth mission to Lebanon, and iswidely believed to have been taken captive by Iranian-backed ShiiteMoslem extremists.   ``We have had further assurances this weekend from Iraniansources that the three British hostages are alive,'' Ms. Keatleysaid.   ``We still have no concrete proof of this,'' she said. ``Theinformation comes via a channel that we think is reliable but whichwe do not wish to identify.''   A prayer by the archbishop was being said Sunday at churchesacross Britain.   ``Give Terry a sense of your abiding presence and the assurancethat fellow believers are one with him in spirit; encourage him andall other hostages to face each new day in confidence and hope; andgrant that they may soon be restored to those whom they love,'' itsaid.   On Sunday, McCarthy had been missing for 1,278 days and Keenanfor 1,283 days.   No group has claimed to hold them or Waite and there have beenno photographs or videotapes to prove they are alive. The Britishgovernment says no demands have been made for their freedom.   Thirteen other Westerners, including eight Americans, aremissing. All Americans are believed held by Shiite factions.   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
