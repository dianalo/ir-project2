Strong, electromagneticand weak decays are examined for a {pi}NN bound state with a mass belowthe {pi}NN threshold and the cases of isospin T=2,1 or 0. States in thesemultiplets with charge 0,1 and 2 have interesting properties and mightbe observed as narrow resonances decaying electromagnetically, in particularstates with J{sup P} = 1+ with charge 0 and 2 which are Pauli-forbiddenfor two nucleons. The lifetimes of the charge {minus}1 and +3 statesshould be much longer than the pion lifetime because of drastically reducedphase space. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
