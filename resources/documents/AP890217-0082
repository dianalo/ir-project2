Higgins, abducteda year ago today while serving as a U.N. observer, is alive despitehis captors' statement that he was sentenced to death as a spy, aShiite Moslem leader said.   ``He'll be released eventually'' by the pro-Iranian Shiiteextremists who seized him, Abdul Majid Saleh, political officer ofthe Amal militia in this ancient port 50 miles south of Beirut, saidThursday.   Higgins, from Danville, Ky., commanded a 76-man U.N. observergroup monitoring the Lebanon-Israel border. He was kidnapped bygunmen who stopped his car on the highway south of Tyre 20 minutesafter he had met with Saleh.   Saleh would not say how he knew Higgins had not been killed bythe Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which claimedresponsibility for the abduction.   His militia claims to have undercover agents who track hostagedevelopments. The moderate Shiite movement, backed by Syria, opposesthe pro-Iranian fundamentalist Shiites who hold most of the 15foreigners missing in Lebanon.   Amal and Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for thoseholding the hostages, were at war for months and nearly 600 peoplewere killed. They reached a peace agreement in January that wasmediated by Syria and Iran.   In an interview today on ABC television's ``Good MorningAmerica,'' Higgins' wife, Robin, said she held out hope that Saleh'scomments about her husband being alive were true. ``Of course we'veseen many reports, some very much in conflict with that. I hope it'strue. I hope we get better news and I hope we get him releasedsoon,'' she said.   Militia officials and other sources interviewed in south Lebanonshed new light on Higgins' abduction near Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. His44th birthday was Jan. 19.   A security source told The Associated Press that members of Amaltried to rescue Higgins three days after he was kidnapped, but wereoverwhelmed by Hezbollah gunmen in the village of Jibcheet.   He said 15 Amal fighters ``infiltrated Jibcheet the night of Feb.20 last year and surrounded the house where Higgins was being held.A dozen gunmen were guarding Higgins, but Amal was determined to sethim free.   ``A few shots were fired, after which about 200 Hezbollahissurrounded the Amal men and disarmed them. A golden opportunity torelease Higgins was lost.''   No independent confirmation of the report was available, but Amaldid make a considerable effort to find Higgins. Angered that he waskidnapped in territory it considered its turf, the militia created adragnet and rounded up scores of Hezbollah activists.   Reflecting on the meeting a year ago, Saleh said: ``We talkedabout the hostages and several other things.''   Nine of the foreign captives in Lebanon are Americans, includingTerry A. Anderson, 41, who has been held the longest. Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Higgins' unit, since withdrawn, was attached to the U.N. InterimForce in Lebanon. Its 5,800 men from nine nations patrol a narrowstrip of south Lebanon separating Israel's self-proclaimed``security zone'' from the rest of the predominantly Shiite region.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the peacekeeping force, said: ``As apeacekeeper, Higgins didn't deserve such a treatment. We hope thatone day the kidnappers will realize what a mistake they made andrelease him.''   Goksel, interviewed at the force's headquarters in the coastalvillage of Naqoura, said U.N. officials have ``no way of knowing''whether the kidnappers carried out the threat to kill Higgins. Theymade it in a statement Dec. 12, the last received about the U.S.Marine.   U.N. and U.S. government have denied allegations by thekidnappers that Higgins was a spy for Israel and was planningpossible missions to rescue the other Americans.   Mohammed Harqous, Amal's security chief in Tyre, said ``theabduction was perfectly planned and carried out.''   He said the kidnappers ``drove Higgins in heavy rain through 10villages and changed cars three times in the Tyre region beforecrossing the Litani River on foot the night of Feb. 18.''   Harqous said Higgins ``injured one of his legs during the roughhike'' northward and ``one of the kidnappers carried Higgins on hisback across the Litani.'' He would not reveal his sources ofinformation.   Higgins then was taken to Jibcheet, Harqous said, but he wouldnot comment on the report of a rescue attempt by Amal.   According to the security source, ``a few days after theconfrontation'' his captors took Higgins to a base on the slopesaround Louwaizeh village, near the western flank of Israel'ssecurity zone.   ``Higgins was held in Louwaizeh for about 40 days ... within afive-minute drive of the security zone,'' the source said. ``Earlylast April, Higgins was moved in a car fitted with diplomaticlicense plates from Louwaizeh to south Beirut and he's been heldthere ever since.''   Hezbollah controls nearly all the Shiite slums of south Beirutand most of the foreign captives are believed to be held there.</TEXT></DOC>
