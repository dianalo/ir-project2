The Miami maker and distributor of electronic goods said the offer was &quot;inadequate&quot; given the company's book value of $4.83 a share, its higher stock prices earlier this year and its outlook for 1988 and beyond. When Bastian made the offer, valued at $22.8 million, it held a 5% stake in Cosmo.    A spokesman for Bastian, New York, an investment-holding company controlled by Benson A. Selzer, declined comment.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cosmo closed at $3.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
