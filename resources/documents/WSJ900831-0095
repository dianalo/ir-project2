And depending on theeffects of the Mideast crisis, the central bank may have toboost the rate again.   In what the bank said was a pre-emptive strike againstinflation, the Bank of Japan on Thursday increased thediscount rate to 6% from 5.25%. The rise was the fifthincrease in the rate, which the central bank charges on loansto financial institutions, since May 1989. The rate is now atits highest level since Dec. 11, 1981. Financial markets,nervous for several days because of rumors of an imminentrate rise, were unscathed by the announcement itself.</LP><TEXT>   By raising the discount rate in the midst of the PersianGulf crisis, the central bank has left open the possibilitythat it may have to act again. Even before the Bank of Japanannounced the move, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was saying that anyrate increase announced now would probably have to berepeated to temper inflationary pressures in Japan.   &quot;They spent some precious ammunition&quot; in raising thediscount rate now, said a foreign-exchange dealer at a U.S.bank in Tokyo. &quot;Next time, they'll be playing a higher-stakesgame.&quot; He said he fears that tighter credit in Japan couldhave a ripple effect, prompting rate increases in othercountries.   Economists said the threat won't diminish as long as theconfrontation between U.S.-led forces in the Gulf and Iraqcontinues and the price of oil, on which Japan depends formost of its energy, stays high. The economists said asustained increase in oil prices or a disruption in supplycould cause an inflationary spike in Japan that would have tobe met with still higher rates.   Higher interest rates naturally tend to damp spending andslow economic growth. The Bank of Japan, in fact, said itsmain goal in raising the discount rate was to temper demandand thus discourage higher prices in the world's secondlargest economy.   The big concern among economists is that monetaryauthorities -- in Japan and then elsewhere -- may have totighten credit further. For Japan, where the economy isgrowing at an annual pace of nearly 5%, that isn't a hugeworry. But for the U.S., where the annual rate of growth isonly slightly more than 1%, higher interest rates could spellrecession.   &quot;Higher rates would be very counterproductive from aninternational point of view,&quot; said Keikichi Honda, Bank ofTokyo Ltd.'s director of research.   Chris Tanner, an economist at Barclays de Zoete WeddSecurities Ltd., said, &quot;We have very serious worries aboutwhat would happen if they continued to raise rates.&quot;   Some analysts said a global rate-increase spiral doesn'tappear imminent. They said the Bank of Japan seems simply tohave realigned official rates with expectations and withalready high market interest rates -- a motive the Bank ofJapan governor, Yasushi Mieno, mentioned at a newsconference.   Financial markets appeared almost relieved by the ratechange. The dollar rebounded against the yen, climbing to144.10 yen in Tokyo trading from 143.60 yen late Wednesday inNew York. In theory, higher Japanese interest rates shouldattract money to the yen and cause the Japanese currency tostrengthen, but currency dealers said the rate change alreadyhad been taken into account before the announcement.   The dollar's resilience should come as a relief to theBank of Japan, analysts said. Had the dollar weakened sharplyagainst the yen, the U.S. Federal Reserve might have feltobliged to raise its interest rates. &quot;If this decision hadbeen postponed for another month or more, there would havebeen a greater possibility of a precipitous fall in thedollar&quot; as investors continued to buy yen in anticipation ofa rate rise, said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist at LongTermCredit Bank of Japan Ltd. &quot;That could {have led} to a greatchange in the world economy.&quot;   Stock and bond markets also took the discount-rateincrease in stride. The Nikkei index soared 775.17 points, or3.1%, to 25669.96 after falling 815.97 points Wednesday. Thebellwether 10-year govenment bond surged 0.83 point to 82.97,to yield 8.115%.</TEXT></DOC>
