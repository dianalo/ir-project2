The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which hadgained 271.36 points on Monday, shed 863.38 points, or 3.80percent, closing at 21,862.61.   Volume on the first section was unchanged from Monday's 250million shares.   Traders said there were few buyers because the marketanticipated heavy selling by investors who bought stock on creditand need funds to repay the loans this month.   They said margin calls in December will total about 1.5 trillionyen ($11.2 billion), with about 300 billion yen ($2.24 billion)slated for this week.   Investors also were discouraged by the declining yen andprospects of further arbitrage selling, in which investors seek toprofit from price gaps between the spot and futures markets,traders added.   The dollar closed at 134.35 yen, up 1.35 yen from Monday's closeof 133.00 yen. It opened at 134.33 yen, and ranged between 133.50yen and 134.55 yen.   The dollar now has gained 5.45 yen in the past four tradingdays.   Some $12.73 billion changed hands in spot trading, compared with$11.44 billion on Monday.   Atsushi Komatsu, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the day'sdollar-buying was mainly for technical reasons.   But he said the U.S. currency was in demand because ofdollar-denominated interest rates staying high in connection withthe Persian Gulf crisis.   The yen also weakened against the German mark because ofrelatively higher German interest rates, Komatsu said.   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-yearJapanese government bonds fell to 86.65 from Monday's finish of86.81. Their yield rose to 7.350 percent from 7.315 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
