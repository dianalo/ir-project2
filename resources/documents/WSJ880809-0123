Bartley's advice to the Republican Party on how to win the 1988 election (&quot;Democrats: The New Me-Too Party,&quot; editorial page, July 27): Not to worry. As co-chairman of the Republican Platform Committee, my marching orders have been to smoke the Democrats out from behind their bland facade of bogus consensus. From day one, our platform process has sought to draw bright-line policy differences between Democrats and Republicans -- and I think our platform in its final form will succeed in doing this.    The basic problem for Gov. Michael Dukakis is that his strategy of creating a Potemkin village of American consensus can succeed only with the active complicity of the Republican Party. Republicans have to force Mr. Dukakis to explain, issue by issue, why he disagreed with all the specific Republican policies that combined to build today's American peace and prosperity.    We cannot allow Mr. Dukakis to assume job creation and low inflation and verifiable nuclear-arms agreements as a given of the political process. Each of these Republican achievements involved tough choices, decisions Mr. Dukakis could not or would not have made himself.    Mr. Dukakis praises the INF treaty and the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations, but opposed the military rebuilding and strong foreign policy that made these advances in global security possible. He accepts the five-and-a-half years of economic growth as a springboard for the future, but opposed the supply-side tax cuts that made the recovery possible.    Mr. Dukakis wants to take America's prosperous present for granted, and build a liberal future on it. George Bush knows how tough it was to create America's present -- with people like Mr. Dukakis kicking and screaming every step of the way -- and realizes that the only way to make America better is to build on the same policies that have made it as good as it is.    The chief task of the Republican Party between now and November is to draw causal connections in the mind of the electorate between Republican policies and the American achievement of the 1980s. If we can make voters see the link, we will have given them a clear choice -- and as good as elected George Bush.    Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr.    (R., Wis.)    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
