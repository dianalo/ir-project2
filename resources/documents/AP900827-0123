Ten passengers suffered minor injuries slidingdown the plane's emergency chutes.   ``It was pretty scary,'' said Joy Wahab, 20, of San Diego. ``Wecircled and the pilot tried to put the landing gear down. It didn'twork. He said, `Well, we're going to come down one way or theother.' ''   The Boeing 747 skidded to a stop at Los Angeles InternationalAirport with its nose landing gear stuck in a retracted position.The 323 passengers and 20 crew members left the plane via emergencychutes, said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for Chicago-based UnitedAirlines.   Flight 816 originated in Sydney, Australia.   Ten passengers were treated for minor injuries, said FireDepartment spokesman Greg Acevedo. Most complained of chute burnsand back pain, he said.   ``It was frightening not knowing what they were going to do,''said Cassandra Edwards of Berkeley, who sat in the first-classsection above the nose gear. ``There was a point when I heard thenose scrape on the bottom. That sound is very unnerving, knowingthat the nose is sliding, knowing that at any moment it couldexplode.''   Damage to the aircraft was slight and there were no sparks orflames upon landing, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesmanFred O'Donnell. Several passengers said the landing was smooth.</TEXT></DOC>
