The Commerce Department said Friday it won't adjust U.S. decennial population totals to account for people who are missed by census enumerators, even though birth certificates and other public records indicate they exist.    Democrats and big-city politicians criticized the decision, since the undercount mostly hits blacks and inner-city minorities who tend to vote Democratic. Because census figures are used to reapportion congressional districts, inaccurate population totals work against the &quot;one-man, one-vote&quot; principle. Also, billions of dollars in federal aid are handed out on the basis of population.    In 1980, the Census Bureau estimates it missed about 5.6% of the black population, perhaps the same number of Hispanics, and about 0.5% of whites.    Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said the statistical method of adding people who don't return census forms or aren't physically counted is &quot;controversial,&quot; and would &quot;raise suspicions in the public mind about the reliablity and integrity of the census.&quot;    But the U.S. Conference of Mayors called it &quot;a bad decision made for the wrong reasons.&quot; Julie Anbender, a Democratic Party spokeswoman, said adjusting census totals &quot;would have ensured that minority and rural populations were fairly represented by the U.S. government.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
