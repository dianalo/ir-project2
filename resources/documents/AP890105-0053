An investigation by the U.S. attorney's office found no evidencelinking the arms transactions charged in the indictment with theso-called Iran-Contra affair, court papers said.   However, the defendants argued they had reason to believe theiractivities had or would receive U.S. government approval, acontention that gained credence after the Iran-Contra arms scandalcame to light.   The defendants said they believed their plan to sell fighterplanes, missiles, tanks and spare parts to Iran was officiallysanctioned by the U.S. government, according to papers filed in U.S.District Court.   Prosecutors could not produce witnesses to contradict thedefendants' claim so the conspiracy case was dropped Wednesday.   Gen. Avraham Bar-Am, who left the Israeli army in 1984 and laterserved as an arms consultant for Israel, and Samuel Evans, anAmerican lawyer based in London, were among the 11 people and fourcorporations named in the papers. They were indicted between May andOctober 1986.   Evans also was the lawyer for Adnan Khashoggi, a multibillionaireSaudi arms dealer who was said to have been involved in some of theIran-Contra weapons deals.   The U.S. Customs Service had set up an elaborate ``sting'' usinga fraudulent bank account in late 1985, about the time Reaganadministration officials were secretly selling arms to Iran andusing the proceeds to finance the Contras fighting to overthrow theleftist Nicaraguan government.   The defendants charged that Cyrus Hashemi, an Iranian oilmanidentified as the U.S. government's chief operative in the sting,was at the same time involved in shipping covert arms to Iran forthe administration.   Prosecutors said that Hashemi would have contradicted thedefendants' claim that they had the government's blessing. However,Hashemi died in 1986, and the government could not ``procure theattendance at trial of any (other) such witness,'' court papers said.   In September and October 1986, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani'soffice was told by the Department of Defense and the CentralIntelligence Agency that there were no documents to supportallegations that the United States sanctioned the delivery of armsto Iran by the defendants.   But it was publicly revealed in November 1986 that members of theNational Security Council had secretly engaged in the sale of armsto Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
