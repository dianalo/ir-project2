Analysts believe fixed-rate mortgage loans will soon dip below 10percent and other consumer loans will drop by one-half percentagepoint before the summer is over as the central bank struggles tokeep the aging economic recovery alive.   ``The Fed has a plate full of statistics suggesting that a wiseinsurance policy against a recession would be to make another easingmove,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co.of Chicago.   The forecasts of a looser credit policy came as Fed officialsgathered for the start today of two important days of closed-doormeetings to map monetary strategy for the rest of the year.   Decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, composed ofmembers of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the12 regional Fed bank presidents, will not be revealed until July 20when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan delivers the centralbank's midyear policy update to Congress.   The Fed in March 1988 launched a credit-tightening effort whichdrove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points in an effort todampen growing inflationary pressures by reducing borrowing demands.   But last month, in a major policy shift, the central bank sent akey interest rate, the federal funds rate, down by 0.25 percentagepoint to around 9.50 percent. The funds rate is the interest thatbanks charge each other for overnight loans.   Many private economists believe the Fed will decide to lower thefunds rate by another 0.25 percentage point in July. Similar smalldeclines would be likely in the following months if the economicstatistics show that the early-year spurt in inflation is moderatingand the economy is remaining sluggish, the economists say.   The central bank has been struggling to engineer a ``softlanding'' where growth slows enough to dampen inflation but withoutcausing a recession.   Last week's big drop in the stock market was blamed on growingfears that the country is headed for a downturn later this year,based on statistics showing weak consumer spending and a big slumpin factory orders.   ``The economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underliesthe need for the Fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy,'' saidJerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association ofManufacturers. ``Failure to act soon may turn the soft landing intoa recession.''   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group, aneconomic consulting firm, said, ``The Fed cannot ignore the varioussigns showing we have a very sluggish economy.''   ``Clearly, the risk of a recession is higher but my guess is thatthe Fed believes we can get by without one'' through gradual movesto lower rates, Chimerine said.   Mortgage rates are already falling. Fixed-rate mortgages, whichpeaked at 11.24 percent in late March, dropped to a nationwideaverage of 10.07 percent last week, according to a survey by theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, anotherforecasting firm, predicted that 30-year mortgages will soon fallbelow 10 percent and decline to around 9.5 percent by September.   Other economists forecast a further one-half percentage pointdrop in banks' prime lending rate which was cut to 11 percent inearly June, its first reduction in more than a year.   The prime rate is traditionally considered a benchmark forbusiness loans, but it now influences a variety of consumer loans,including home equity loans.   Various economists said while they are looking for further signsof easing credit from the Fed, they do not expect anything asdramatic as a cut in the Fed's discount rate, the interest itcharges to make direct loans to financial institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
