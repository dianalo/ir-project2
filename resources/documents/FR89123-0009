Those wishingto receive an advance copy of the text changes or to be added to this mailinglist should write to the Federal Highway Administration, Office of TrafficOperations, HTO-21, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Requests </ITAG>These amendments are being processed in accordance with the rulemakingprocedure of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and the Departmentof Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. Each request is assigned an identification number which indicates, by Romannumeral, the primary organizational part of the MUTCD affected and, byArabic numeral, the order in which the request was received. The FHWA has reviewed the comments received in response to the noticesand the other information relating to the MUTCD and these proposals. TheFHWA is acting on the following requests for change to the MUTCD. Eachaction and its basis is summarized below: (1) Request I-8(C)_Responsibility for Maintaining Traffic Control DevicesThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated an accidentwhere traffic control devices had been removed by an agent of a highwayagency. The missing traffic control devices may have had a direct bearingon the cause of the accident and on the severity of the accident. The NTSBhas requested that responsibility for maintaining traffic control devicesbe clarified in the MUTCD. The FHWA proposed to amend the first sentence of Section 1A-3 to read.``The responsibility for the installation, operation and effective maintenanceof traffic control devices rests with the governmental body or officialhaving jurisdiction.'' There were 28 commenters that had reviewed the FHWA's proposal. FifteenState DOT's, one county, one city, and 5 others favored some improvementof the wording in Section 1A-3. Several of the commenters felt that itwas not necessary to insert the words ``installation, operation and effectivemaintenance'', as this is repetitive of requirements found in Section 1A-2.The FHWA has determined that the final text will read: ``The responsibilityfor the design, placement, operation and maintenance of traffic controldevices rests with the governmental body or official having jurisdiction.''The amendment imposes no additional costs on highway agencies; therefore,no implementation period is proposed. (2) Request II-119(C)_Standard Sign to Implement Mandatory Seat Belt LawsThe National Association of Governor's Highway Safety Representatives hasrequested that a standard sign be developed and adopted for use by Stateshaving mandatory safety seat belt laws. Because of the variations thatexist among the seat belt laws of the several States, it is not possibleto adopt a standard sign. However, it does appear to be practical to developand adopt a standard symbol that can be used on regulatory signs that notifyvehicle occupants of mandatory seat belt laws. The FHWA has reviewed and evaluated many existing and proposed symbol designs.The FHWA proposed to amend the MUTCD to require that the standard symbolbe used, if a State determines that a seat belt symbol is to be shown onthe regulatory signs that implement its safety seat belt laws. The FHWAalso solicited comments on both the concept of using a standard symbolfor this purpose and on the details of the proposed symbol. The FHWA usedthe comments received regarding the details of the proposed symbol to guideits final design. Thirty-three commenters addressed the docket, including the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Thirty of the commenters favoredadoption of a standard symbol, however four of these did not feel thatthe symbol should be mandatory. The NHTSA submitted three shoulder/lap combination symbols and requestedthat they be tested, along with other designs. The symbol preferred byNHTSA is the seat belt warning symbol required by NHTSA Federal Motor VehicleSafety Standard No. 101 (49 CFR 571.101). Manufacturers are required touse this symbol; consequently, it appears on motor vehicle instrument panelsevery time the ignition is switched on and should already be familiar tomany motorists. The symbol shown below was tested with three others for driver's reactiontime to the symbols, meaning and action responses to the signs, and preferenceamong the signs. Data were collected in Alabama and Washington, DC. Thesymbol was found to perform satisfactorily. The FHWA has selected thissymbol. The symbol must be used, if a State determines that a seat beltsymbol is to be shown on the regulatory signs used to implement its mandatorysafety seat belt laws. <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus 775a </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG>This amendment may have some financial impact in those States that havealready installed signs for mandatory safety seat belt laws. To offsetthese costs, a compliance date of December 31, 1995 is established. (3) Request II-161(C)_LOGO Signing_Number of LOGO's on Sign Panels The rules and regulations for Specific Service (LOGO) Signing were transferredfrom 23 CFR Part 655, Subpart C and incorporated into the MUTCD by FinalRule, FHWA Docket No. 83-26 (50 FR 10001, March 13, 1985). There are nowover 30 States using LOGO signs on some or all of their rural freeway systems.Since the initial installations of LOGO signs in 1968, the number of LOGOson a sign panel has been limited to six for GAS and four each for FOOD,LODGING, and CAMPING. More than 30 States now have experience with LOGOsand LOGO programs. With regard to the number of logos allowed per panel,the FHWA proposed to change the ``shall'' conditions to ``should'' conditions.In addition, this amendment would allow the background of the LOGO to beother than blue, at each State's discretion; the paragraph discussing LOGOsigning on ramps would be clarified; and several minor editorial changeswould be made. Of the 33 commenters that reviewed this amendment, 18 States, the NationalCommittee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD), and 6 others opposedits adoption. Of the 18 States who opposed: 8 indicated that they preferor would support a mandatory limit of six LOGO's for all services, and10 States indicated that they want to keep the current mandatory limitof six LOGOs for GAS and four LOGOs each for FOOD, LODGING, AND CAMPING.The NCUTCD also supports the latter position. Those commenters that opposed the amendment had specific, well foundedreasons for not changing the standard. The FHWA strongly believes that the number of LOGOs should be limited tosix LOGOs for GAS and four LOGOs each for FOOD, LODGING, AND CAMPING. TheFHWA also recognizes that the individual States are directly responsiblefor the operation and safety of their transportation facilities, and forthe control of outdoor advertising. Each State is also responsible forits own economic development. The flexibility afforded by the revised standardwill allow the individual States to manage the implementation of thesediverse programs. Because changes to existing or future LOGO signing with regard to the numberof LOGOs that will be used on each panel will be at each State's discretion,no implementation period is necessary. (4) Request III-35(C)_Warrants for Center Line Pavement Markings The FHWA had been petitioned to initiate rulemaking to establish warrantsfor center line pavement markings. The FHWA proposed to amend the fifth paragraph of Section 3B-1 to readas follows: ``Center lines shall be placed on all paved roadway surface that will retainpavement markings under the following conditions: 1. In rural districts on all two-way roadways 18 feet or more in widthwhen the prevailing off-peak 85 percentile speed or posted speed limit,whichever, is higher, is 35 MPH or greater. 2. In residence or business districts on all through highways with an ADTof 50 or greater, and on other streets where the ADT is 500 or greater''The FHWA received about 200 comments concerning this proposal. The majorityof the comments were from cities and counties. The commenters expressedconcern about one or more of the following: a. Markings would be required on many, if not all, highways and streets;b. Pavement edge damage would increase significantly on narrow pavementsbecause drivers of heavy vehicles would drive closer to the edge of pavementsto avoid straddling or driving on the center line; c. The incidence of sideswipe accidents and other accidents with parkedvehicles would increase because the drivers of the moving vehicles woulddrive closer to the parked vehicles to keep to the right of the centerline; d. For the most part, the Pavement Marking Demonstration program involvedrural highway projects; therefore, the results and conclusions reachedfrom the analysis of the program may not be transferable to urban streetsand highways; e. The installation and maintenance of center line pavement markings wouldbe a major expense;f. National criteria and engineering judgment, as currently provided forin the MUTCD, are the best standards to assure that markings are installedand maintained in a cost-effective manner.Because of the legitimate concerns raised by a multitude of commenters,the FHWA finds that it is not appropriate to set national standards forcenter line markings at this time. In denying this request it must be understoodthat the FHWA firmly believes that some minimum standards for center linesshould be established. Therefore, the FHWA will consider alternative actionswhich may be necessary to better determine standards that are responsiveto the motorists' needs and to the concerns expressed in the docket comments.(5) Request III-48(C)_Lane Lines in Cloverleaf InterchangesA private citizen has pointed out a need to illustrate the desirable pavementmarking pattern to be used to separate the mainline from a cloverleaf'scombined acceleration/deceleration lane. The FHWA proposed the additionof a figure to Section 3B-11 that will show the typical installation ofthese pavement markings.There are many tasks to be accomplished by the drivers in the weaving sectionbetween cloverleaf ramps. Defining the lane line throughout the entirelength of the combined acceleration/deceleration lane, with standard skipstripe markings, is desirable so that drivers can better determine theirlateral position.It is possible to design a more complex set of coded pavement markingsto inform the drivers of their longitudinal position within the weavingarea. Because of the high degree of pavement marking wear that occurs inweaving areas, the FHWA finds that it is not practical to attempt to maintainsuch a system in the field.Of the 28 commenters who reviewed this amendment, all but 4 concurred withthe FHWA. Those opposed and several who concurred felt that there willbe cases, unusually long combination lanes, when the marked line shouldbe terminated with a dotted line. The FHWA acknowledges that these specialsituations will occur. The addition of a figure showing the typical pavementmarking treatment will not preclude the use of other pavement markingsfor special situations.This amendment adds a figure that clarifies an existing provision of theMUTCD. No implementation period is needed.(6) Request IV-85(C)_Revision to Warrant 7, Systems WarrantThe Systems Warrant (existing Warrant 7) is intended to provide for signalizationalong collector and arterial routes in order to establish traffic platoonsand to encourage the traffic platoons to flow in progression. Typically,the warrant is applicable in outlying, developing areas of nonuniform density;where the distance between major signalized intersections is so great thatthe platoons break up into low-density streams. Through the applicationof this warrant, the total number of signals can sometimes be reduced andthe traffic progression significantly improved within the highway (street)system.The NCUTCD reviewed the warrant and recommended the following revisionsto remedy minor deficiencies and to make the warrant more representativeof current traffic characteristics:1. Increase the required volume of existing or immediately projected trafficentering the intersection to 1,000 vehicles (now 800) during the peak hourof a typical weekday or for each of any 5 hours of a Saturday and/or Sunday.2. For the peak hour criteria (5 year projected traffic volumes based onan engineering study) one or more of the volume based warrants would bemet.3. The existing version of the warrant lists five characteristics of amajor route and stipulates that a route, to be considered major in applyingthe warrant, must have one or more of these characteristics. It was recommendedthat characteristic (2) (Connects areas of principal traffic generation)be deleted as it is subject to varying definitions and it is already coveredin the other characteristics. It was also recommended that characteristic(4) (Surface street freeway or expressway ramp terminals) be deleted asit is covered in the other characteristics.Of the 32 responses that were received, 18 concurred with comments, 12concurred with no comment, and 2 did not concur.The State of Florida stated that a traffic signal installation should notbe warranted on future (projected) traffic volumes and that traffic signalsshould not be installed until they can be justified on the basis of theexisting conditions. The State of Oregon disagreed with the proposed 1,000vehicles during the peak hour on a typical day as the proper threshold.They believe that 800 vehicles per hour is the proper volume to warranta traffic signal.The FHWA finds that because the System Warrant primarily addresses developingareas, and traffic volumes typically take some time to develop after thecompletion of a project, basing the need on a 5-year projection is appropriate.Further, the intent of the MUTCD is clear throughout, that finding a signalthat is ``warranted'' is not in itself justification for a signal, seeIV-66(C). Funding and other priority considerations would also impact whena signal is to be installed.The FHWA amends Section 4C-9 (Warrant 7, Systems Warrant) to provide forthese changes. The amendment provides a more realistic warrant and doesnot impose additional costs on State and local highway agencies. No compliancedate is needed to implement this change.(7) Request VI-56(C)_Work Zone Land Shift TapersThe NCUTCD requested that Part VI of the MUTCD be amended by adding lengthstandards for work zone lane shift tapers. Most manuals and other publicationsdo not differentiate between the length of taper required for differenttaper applications. Often the same taper length is recommended for a mergeapplication and for a lane shift application. The NCUTCD also found thatthere is no standard use of terms for describing the various taper applications.The FHWA proposed to adopt the recommendations of the NCUTCD. Section 6C-2would be separated into two separate sections. The first would addressthe length of tapers and would include the following table. The secondsection would include the channelization issues that are currently presentedin Section 6C-2. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,xs66</C><T4>Table VI-2._Taper Length Criteria for Work Zones</T4><H1>Type of taper</H1><H1>Taper length</H1>Upstream tapers:<ITAG tagnum="2">Merging taper<D>L minimum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Shifting taper <D>\1/2\ L minimum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Shoulder taper <D>\1/3\ L minimum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Two-way traffic taper<D>100 feet maximum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Downstream tapers (use is optional)<D>100 feet/lane </D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Formulas for L<R/></ITAG>Speed Limit<D/>Formula<ITAG tagnum="1">40 MPH or less <D>L=WxS\2\</D>andmin16;60</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45 MPH or greater <D>L=WxS</D><F>L=Taper length in feet.</F><F>W=Width of offset in feet.</F><F>S=Posted speed or off-peak 85 percentile speed in MPH.</F></ITAG></ITAG>In addition, Figures 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7 would be revised to reflect theabove changes.All but two of the 27 commenters agreed with the proposal. Several suggestionswere received for improving or clarifying some provisions of the proposal.These suggestions will be accommodated in the final text to the extentpossible. This amendment will impose some additional costs on State and local highwayagencies; therefore, a compliance date of January 23, 1989 is establishedfor this amendment.(8) Request VI-57(C)_Temporary Pavement Markings in Construction and MaintenanceAreasRequest VI-3 as published in the MUTCD implemented requirements for minimumpavement marking treatments for traffic control in work zones. That revisionprovided for minimum stripe-to-gap ratios, allowed raised pavement markers,and other changes.Change VI-57 would further amend Section 6D to clarify and provide furtherguidance. Section 6D-1 would be revised to provide further guidance forthe use of permanent pavement markings in accordance with Sections 3B,7C, 8B-4, and 9C on any permanent pavement surfaces and final lifts aswell as on temporary pavements, detours, runarounds, or interim lifts opento traffic and when the project work is suspended for the winter of otherextended periods of time.Section 6D-3, Exception Number 1 would be revised to further describe temporarylanes and center lines. Also, the provisions for the use of signs ratherthan pavement markings in short-term operations would be extended to applyto low-volume roadways.Section 6D-3 would be further revised to include a recommendation thateach highway agency should have a policy that will, within the scope ofthis section, provide more detailed criteria and describe the conditionswhere temporary pavement markings will be used. This policy would include,but not be limited to, criteria, definitions of extended periods of timeand a traffic volume threshold for low-volume roads. The changes were proposed to clarify the amendments made by the final ruleon March 9, 1987, at 52 FR 7126, provide more guidance for pavement markingson permanent pavement surfaces and interim or temporary pavements opento traffic for extended periods of time, and allow flexibility for theuse of signs rather than pavement markings for low-volume roads.The proposal also stated that it is the policy of the FHWA that full standardsfor pavement markings are desirable for all pavements and the minimumsshould be used only when full standards are not practical or possible.The FHWA received 29 comments concerning this proposal. Twelve States,the NCUTCD, and six other concurred that improvements were desirable. Themost prominent suggestion was to replace the term ``temporary pavementmarkings'' with ``short-term pavement marking'' and to define ``short-term''as a time period not to exceed two weeks.Most of the commenters who opposed the proposal and several of those whoconcurred that improvements were desirable objected to the pavement markingstripe and gap length standards that were adopted in the final rule onMarch 9, 1987. These commenters requested that research be conducted todetermine the standards for pavement marking stripe and gap lengths.Most of the concerns expressed by the NCUTCD have been accommodated inthe amendment or will be considered for further research; however, at thistime the FHWA does not agree that the detail of requested research is desirableand feasible.The final rule of March 9, 1987, at 52 FR 7126, has a compliance date ofDecember 31, 1988. This amendment adds some flexibility to the provisionsadopted in that final rule. Therefore, the same compliance date of December31, 1988 is established for this amendment.(9) Request VI-59(C)_Section 6G-6, Control of TrafficThe NCUTCD requested that the sentence, ``The use of traffic control signsshould be discouraged.'' be deleted from the first paragraph of MUTCD Section6G-6. The NCUTCD requested this change because the sentence is potentiallymisleading. While the objective on freeways is to keep traffic in a free-flowingcondition as much as possible, this sentence, taken out of context, couldbe easily misinterpreted and is misleading to those responsible for trafficcontrol on freeways. The statement has little value in this section.All of the 24 commenters indicated that Section 6G-6 needed clarification.Two commenters offered suggestions for additional text. The other commentersagreed that the deletion was sufficient.This amendment, to delete the sentence, will impose no additional costson highway agencies; therefore, it is proposed that the change would becomeeffective upon the issuance of a final rule. No implementation period isrequired.(10) Request VI-60(C)_Color and Design of Work Zone VestsSection 6F-3 of MUTCD includes the following provision: ``The use of orangeclothing such as a vest, shirt, or jacket shall be required for flaggers.For nighttime conditions, similar outside garments shall be reflectorized.''The MUTCD does not include provisions that would describe or provide detailson the color, design, or extent of the retroreflection. The FHWA has interpretedSection 6F-3 to mean that only orange colored retroreflective materialwill satisfy the standard. In practice, vests have had a variety of designs,patterns, and colors for the retroreflective portion of the vests. Accordingly,it was proposed to amend Section 6F-3 by adding two sentences to the endof the second paragraph to read as follows: ``The retroreflective materialshall be either orange, white, or yellow. The design of the retroreflectiveportions including stripe width, extent, design and type of material shallbe determined by the contracting agency, or purchaser of the vest.''The term ``reflection'' as used throughout Section 6F-3 would be changedto ``retroreflection.''Of the 26 who commented on this proposal, only four opposed adding standardsfor the color of vest retroreflective materials to the MUTCD at this time.Many commenters suggested that silver be included. Several others requestedthat lime-yellow, bright yellow green, and fluorescent colors be allowed.The MUTCD recognizes silver as a white material, and recognizes fluorescentred-orange and yellow-orange as acceptable substitutes for orange. Thefinal text will include silver and the two fluorescent oranges. As proposed,the design of the retroreflective portions of the flagger vest will bedetermined by the contracting agency or purchaser of the vest.This amendment will have little or no financial impact on State and localagencies. No implementation period is needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Editorial Changes</ITAG>In accordance with the procedures published in FHWA Docket 83-18 (48 FR30145, June 30, 1983), the FHWA invites comments to FHWA Docket 88-16 onthe following editorial change (Request IV-92(C)_Provisions for Pedestrians):The FHWA is making the following editorial change to the MUTCD. The changeand its basis are summarized below.This editorial revision to the MUTCD imposes no additional costs on Stateand local highway agencies; therefore, no compliance dates are needed forits implementation.(11) Request IV-92(C)_Provisions for PedestriansMinimum traffic signal requirements for pedestrians are presently includedin provisions found in Section 4C-12, 4D-6, and 4D-7 of the MUTCD. Minimumtraffic signal requirements for pedestrians are also discussed in IV-69(Intr.)_TrafficSignals at T-Intersections. These various requirements are applicable toall traffic signals, not just pedestrian signals. These minimum trafficsignal requirements for pedestrians do not always receive proper attentionby practitioners because of the fragmented manner in which the provisionsare provided.This revision provides coverage of the provisions in two sections (4B-28and 4B-29) and eliminates certain redundancies. This change will facilitatethe understanding of, and attention to, provisions for pedestrians at trafficsignals.A new Section 4B_28, Provisions for Pedestrians is added that reflectsIV-69(Intr.)_Traffic Signals at T-Intersections; Section 4C-12 and thefirst paragraph of Section 4D-7 (as revised by IV-59). The new Section4B-28 reads:<ITAG tagnum="81">4B-28 Provisions for Pedestrians</ITAG>The design and operation of traffic control signals must take into considerationthe needs of pedestrians as well as vehicular traffic. Where minimum numbersof pedestrian movements regularly occur:1. Signal indications must be visible to pedestrians.This can be accomplished for a given pedestrian movement by:a. Provision of pedestrian signal indications, orb. A R.Y.G. signal face for an adjacent vehicular movement visible to pedestrians,orc. Vehicular indications for conflicting movements that can be convenientlyviewed by pedestrians, and from which pedestrians can readily and accuratelydeduce when they have the right-of-way.2. There must be an opportunity to cross without excessive delay. Pedestrianactuation shall be installed at traffic control signals where the signaloperation does not otherwise provide this opportunity.3. Pedestrians should be provided with sufficient time to cross the roadway.This may be accomplished by adjusting the signal operation and timing toautomatically provide this assurance or via pedestrian actuation.Where it is desired to prohibit certain pedestrian movements at a trafficcontrol signal, a sign NO PEDESTRIAN CROSSING (2B-36) may be used. Other changes are: 1. Delete Section 4C-12. 2. Add a new Section 4B-29, Pedestrian Detectors, and move the text ofpresent Section 4D-6 to the new Section 4B-29. 3. Replace the present text of 4D-6, Detectors with ``See Section 4B-29,Pedestrian Detectors''. 4. Add to Item 3 of the ``SHALL'' warrants for pedestrian signals in Section4D-3 ``(See Section 4B-28)''. 5. Delete the first paragraph of Section 4D-7 (as revised by IV-59). Appropriate changes will be made to Part VII of the MUTCD to reflect theserevisions. In consideration of the foregoing and under the authority of 23 U.S.C.109(d), 315, and 402(a), and the delegation of authority in 49 CFR 1.48(b),the Federal Highway Administration hereby adopts the Manual on UniformTraffic Control Devices as amended herein. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has determined that this documentcontains neither a major rule under Executive Order 12291 nor a significantregulation under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Departmentof Transportation. As stated herein, the economic impact of these amendmentsis so minimal as not to require preparation of a full regulatory evaluation.For the same reasons and under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the editorial amendment contained in this document is technical innature, the FHWA finds good cause to make the editorial amendment finalwithout the opportunity for comment under the Administrative ProcedureAct. However, interested parties may comment on the editorial amendmentby December 19, 1988, and such comments will be placed in FHWA Docket 88-16and considered. For the same reasons, opportunity for prior comment isnot required under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Departmentof Transportation. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thefinal rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Incorporation by Reference </ITAG>The MUTCD has been incorporated by reference in 23 CFR Part 655 under theprovisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51 and approved by the Directorof the Federal Register as of April 1, 1988. The MUTCD was last revisedon March 16, 1988 (53 FR 8620). The MUTCD citation included in 23 CFR 655.601(a)is amended to reflect the amendments contained in this document. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear.
