AD 85-02-04 R1 states that the AD does not apply whenthe MBB stick position augmentation system (SPAS) is installed in accordancewith MBB Helicopter Service Bulletin No. SB-MBB-BK 117-40-7, dated April14, 1986. After issuing AD 85-02-04 R1, the FAA received Alert ServiceBulletin ASB-MBB-BK 117-70-101, dated April 11, 1988, which requires thereplacement of the V<T2>NE</T2> schedule placard on all MBB BK-117 A-1, A-3, and A-4 serieshelicopters, regardless of whether the SPAS is installed or not. Therefore,the FAA is superseding AD 85-02-04 as amended by AD 85-02-04 R1 by requiringreplacement of the existing V<T2>NE</T2> schedule placard on all MBB Model BK-117 A-1, A-3, and A-4series helicopters.Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable andgood cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe states, on the relationship between the national government and thestates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalismimplications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Executive Order 12291 with respectto the rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this actioninvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysis is not required).
