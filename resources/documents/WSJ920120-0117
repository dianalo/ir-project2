Like many of Philip Morris's mainstay brands, Merit hascome under pressure in recent years as smokers increasinglydefect to discount cigarettes from full-priced brands. PhilipMorris itself has accelerated that trend by pushing its ownbudget brands. Last year, in fact, the company rolled outultra-light versions of its Cambridge and Bristol budgetsmokes.</LP><TEXT>   In the 12 months ended in October, Merit's share of theU.S. cigarette market had slipped to 3.2% from 3.6%,according to Marc Cohen, a tobacco analyst at Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co. Philip Morris, the nation's leading tobaccocompany, introduced the low-tar Merit line in 1976.   Philip Morris officials said the new cigarette is intendedto steal smokers from Carlton and Now, low-tar brands made,respectively, by rivals American Brands Inc. and R.J.Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc. &quot;Merit haslost smokers over the years to both brands, and this newproduct is a way to plug that hole,&quot; said David Dangoor,senior vice president, marketing, at Philip Morris USA, thecompany's U.S. tobacco division.   Mr. Dangoor said his company is counting on an improvedfilter design to make Merit Ultima easier to puff and moreflavorful -- two problem areas consumers often cite with verylight cigarettes. Ads for the new brand, created by theChicago-based Leo Burnett U.S.A. agency, stress the brand'simproved flavor at &quot;the lowest levels of tar and nicotine.&quot;   In fact, Merit Ultima will contain one milligram of tarand 0.1 milligrams of nicotine-levels comparable to thosealready found in Carlton and Now cigarettes. The lightest Nowcigarette currently available, for example, contains 0.5milligrams of tar and 0.05 milligrams of nicotine. MeritUltra Lights, by comparison, contain five milligrams of tarand 0.5 milligrams of nicotine.   The roll-out of the new Merit spinoff appears to signalthat Philip Morris has backed off its efforts to launchcigarettes using its much ballyhooed &quot;de-nicotined&quot;technology. In 1989, Philip Morris unveiled a cigarettecalled Next with the words &quot;De-Nic&quot; beneath the logo, whichit positioned much like decaf coffee. But Next, with 0.1milligrams of nicotine but significantly higher levels oftar, floundered in test market.   Industry executives said Merit Ultima also reflects aneffort on the part of Philip Morris to shift its competitors'focus back to the full-priced segment. American Brands inparticular has aggressively pushed its budget smokes inrecent years, including its Montclair and Misty brands.</TEXT></DOC>
