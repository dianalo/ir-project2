To prove his point, he produced a newly printed price list -- and the client succumbed.    Such is life today in Brazil. Prices increase in unpredictable leaps that are a big incentive for buying today rather than tomorrow. Stores change their prices daily, and supermarkets are full of uniformed employees putting new price stickers on products. &quot;For most Brazilians they're a symbol of the return of inflation,&quot; comments secretary Claudia DiNepi.    Inflation's return, after a yearlong price freeze under the Cruzado Economic Plan, has been abrupt and violent. A recent visitor to Rio's Caesar Park hotel saw the price of his room double -- moving to 2,200 and then 3,200 cruzados from 1,600 -- during a three-week stay. In the past two months, fruit juices at Rio bars have jumped to between 10 and 12 cruzados from five. A coffee has gone up 50%; a McDonald's hamburger to 11 cruzados from five. Few prices remain stable even for a week.    This surge has led to widespread disillusionment and strikes. It has undermined the government to the point where even last month's moratorium on debt to foreign banks did little for its popularity. Just last year, President Jose Sarney was talking of a new &quot;era of zero inflation,&quot; and Finance Minister Dilson Funaro of &quot;Swiss inflation with Japanese growth.&quot; They were heroes then. Now, for most Brazilians, high inflation has again become a symbol of vacuous government promises.    It has also focused attention on the fact that, while everybody notes that inflation is very high, nobody knows exactly how high it is. Government figures are widely scoffed at.    Officially, inflation is about 14% a month, or nearly 400% a year. But, for Ana Maria Chindler, who owns a small retail business, &quot;the official figure is nonsense. I don't think many people believe it, and I'm working without any real parameters on how much my costs will go up.&quot;    Such skepticism is rooted in the fact that the &quot;official&quot; measurement of inflation has changed four times in the past year as the government effectively sought to engineer lower figures. &quot;There's a long tradition of political interference in the calculation of inflation,&quot; comments Marcos Ferreira de Souza, head of the economic statistics department at the Getulio Vargas Sociology Institute.    Mr. de Souza should know. For the 41 years prior to November 1985, his institute calculated Brazil's official inflation figures. Then, with the monthly rate set to hit 15%, he received a telephone call from Mr. Funaro. &quot;Marcos, what's going on,&quot; he recalls the minister saying. &quot;Inflation is going up,&quot; Mr. de Souza replied. &quot;No, Marcos, I think there is an error,&quot; said Mr. Funaro.    The next day, several members of the minister's staff arrived at the Rio institute. They argued that Mr. de Souza's calculation of car and corn price rises was wrong. After a fruitless argument, the officials left. A few hours later, Mr. Funaro announced that inflation would henceforth be calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, known by the acronym IBGE. Its figure for November 1985 happened to be lower.    Mr. Funaro was acting in a grand tradition. Antonio Delfim Netto, who ruled over Brazilian economic policy for a decade under the country's military rulers, was an adept manipulator of inflation figures. It was he who, in the early 1980s, came up with the idea of a &quot;purged&quot; inflation index. This controversial scheme involved removing &quot;accidental&quot; price rises from the calculation of inflation.    Thus, if a freeze killed oranges in Florida and pushed up the price of Brazilian oranges, this wasn't included in inflation. There was a fierce row with Getulio Vargas statisticians, who only agreed to publish the &quot;purged&quot; index if its normal index was published too.    This intense government concern with inflation reflects the fact that, in Brazil, everything from workers' pay to interest rates is indexed to inflation. A sharp rise in inflation aggravates the federal deficit by increasing the interest that has to be paid on debt. &quot;Because they never succeed in de-indexing the economy, ministers tend to resort to trying to tamper with the figures,&quot; says former IBGE director Edmar Bacha.    Mr. Bacha fought with Mr. Funaro last year, before resigning in disgust in November. For Minister Funaro, dropping Getulio Vargas in favor of the IBGE proved no panacea. Since November 1985, Getulio Vargas inflation figures have generally been lower than the IBGE's. &quot;Mr. Funaro never seems to win,&quot; says Mr. de Souza.    Meanwhile, a bewildering array of inflation numbers continue to be published, all fiercely defended by their promulgators and mistrusted by most of the population. In Janaury, for example, the IBGE's restricted figure was 16.8%, the Getulio Vargas's figure 12%, the Labor Union statistics office's 13.1%, and the Sao Paulo Economics Institute's 13.7%.    These units all use different products and areas as the basis for their calculations. They are professional studies. But perhaps one way to settle the dispute would be to take the widely used Rio-Sao Paulo air shuttle as the national barometer of inflation.    This cost 456 cruzados in February, went up to 618 cruzados last month, and now costs 850 cruzados. That's 86.4% in two months -- in line with most people's basic impression that inflation is soaring. The figure also has the advantage that nobody can argue or tamper with it, or with the fact that this is neither &quot;zero&quot; nor &quot;Swiss&quot; inflation -- but distinctly Brazilian. </TEXT></DOC>
