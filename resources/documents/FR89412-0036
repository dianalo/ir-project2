L. 100-407). The Act is based upon the findingthat advances in modern technology can enable some persons with disabilitiesto have greater control over their lives, to enhance their participationin education, employment, family, and community activities, and to otherwisebenefit from opportunities that are commonly available to individuals whodo not have disabilities. Title I of the Act, the subject of this Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), authorizes financial assistance to Statesto help each State develop a consumer-responsive, statewide program oftechnology-related assistance for individuals with disabilities.The proposed regulations incorporate the seven statutory purposes of theprogram and provide that a State must address each of these purposes inits consumer-responsive, comprehensive statewide program. This notice ofproposed rulemaking (NPRM) further provides that, in accordance with thestatutory requirements, the Governor must designate a single responsibleentity to apply for a grant and administer the activities under the grant,and must designate a public agency to receive and disburse the funds andmaintain fiscal controls.From time to time, the Secretary will publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> requesting applications for development grants.In an application for a development grant, a State must provide, amongother things, a preliminary assessment of its need for technology-relatedassistance and a description of its existing efforts to establish a consumer-responsive,comprehensive statewide system for the delivery of technology-related assistance.Each State must also state the goals and objectives of its proposed programunder the development grant. A development grant will be awarded for athree-year period.The Secretary will refer complete applications to one or more groups ofexpert peer reviewers, which will evaluate the applications according tothe selection criteria in andSection; 345.31. The Secretary will appointas members of the peer review groups individuals who have expertise, byreason of training or experience, in such areas as the provision of technology-relatedservices or assistive devices; public administration; development and implementationof public systems; evaluation of service delivery programs; education,training, and public information; development and maintenance of informationsystems; provision of services to individuals with disabilities and theirfamilies; health care and benefits administration; personal use of assistivetechnology; and other relevant and appropriate areas.The proposed selection criteria for applications for development grants,which are detailed in this NPRM at andSection; 345.31, include the extentto which a State: demonstrate a comprehensive assessment of the need fora statewide, consumer-responsive program; presents measurable goals andobjectives that address the stated needs; present a plan of activitiesthat is likely to accomplish the goals and objectives; presents an adequatemanagement plan, including staffing, resource deployment, and coordination;presents an adequate plan of evaluation; describes substantive roles forindividuals with disabilities or their families representatives in thedevelopment and implementation of the State's program under the grant;and describes extensive coordination among appropriate State, public, andprivate agencies in all phases of the project.In the third year of its development grant, a State may apply for an extensiongrant. In its application for an extension grant, a State must includea followup needs assessment and a description of the activities and accomplishmentsunder the development grant. States are required to collect data and documentthe extent to which they have made progress toward the goals specifiedin the application for the development grant. An application for an extensiongrant also must include an assessment of the degree of satisfaction ofindividuals with disabilities, their families or representatives, publicand private service providers, employers, and other appropriate individualswith the activities under the development grant and with their involvementin the development and implementation of the statewide program of technology-relatedassistance under the grant.The Secretary may award extension grants to States that have made significantprogress under the development grant. Applications for extension grantswill be evaluated based on the application that is submitted and the Secretary'sassessment of the extent to which the State made significant progress towardachieving the goals and objectives under its development grant. The proposedregulations provide that the Secretary will base the assessment of progresson the results of a site visit to the State's program and the documentationof progress the State has presented in its extension grant application.The proposed rules clarify the obligations of a grantee with respect tofiscal accountability, reporting, and cooperation with the Secretary inthe discharge of the Secretary's responsibilities under this program.Finally, the proposed rules outline the penalties to which a State maybe subject if it violates the requirements of this part. There are no program-specificappeals procedures in this part because general Department of Educationprocedures governing the withholding and recovery of funds apply to anyState that is found to be in noncompliance with the requirements of thisprogram as a result of an onsite visit or failure to supply relevant informationthat the Secretary requires.The Department of Education's responsibilities under this Act will be administeredby the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR),created under Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended byPublic Laws 95-602, 98-221, and 99-506. The administration of the programwill be governed generally by the Education Department General AdministrativeRegulations (EDGAR), with certain specific exceptions. In specifying theregulations that apply to this program, the Secretary proposes to exclude34 CFR 80.32(a) and 34 CFR 80.33(a) because the statute specifically encouragestransfer of title to equipment and supplies, and andSection; 75.618 becausethe statute authorizes grantees to lease equipment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.
