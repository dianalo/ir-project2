<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0679 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lead salt diode lasers are used in conjuction with a Q-switched CO{sub2} laser to measure collisional energy transfer from the 2{nu}{sub 2}level of NH{sub 3}. The (V--T,R) relaxation rate from the 2{nu}{sub 2}level is found to be approximately an order of magnitude faster thanthe comparable relaxation rate from the {nu}{sub 2} level. (V--V) transferfrom the {nu}{sub 2} to the 2{nu}{sub 2} levels plays an insignificantrole in the dynamics of energy transfer in the {nu}{sub 2} mode of NH{sub3}.</TEXT></DOC>
