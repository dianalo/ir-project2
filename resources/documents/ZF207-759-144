(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Li, Chang-Jin.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A simple, systematic, purely numerical, and computationallyefficient method is developed for linearizing dynamic models ofthe nominal trajectories of robot manipulators.andP;  Such linearizedmodels are useful because they facilitate the design of feedbackor optimal controllers through the use of the perturbation method,study of robot manipulators' kinematics and dynamics for thecomputation of joint characteristics, and solution of optimalrobot manipulator control problems.andP;  The new method is based on atechnique for deriving inverse dynamic models for robotmanipulators through the use of 'straightforward' Lagrangianequations.andP;  The model enables the implementation of feedback andfeedforward control of manipulators.andP;  The computational efficiencyof the method allows its real-time use on mini- or microcomputers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     LinearizationDynamic ControlRobot ArmsManipulatorsMathematics of ComputingControl TheoryMethods.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   The number of computations for algorithm 1.
