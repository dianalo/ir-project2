While more than enough oil is available now, shortagescould develop by the last half of the fourth quarter, JohnEaston Jr., an assistant energy secretary, told a Housecommittee yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Whether oil supplies become that tight or not, the mereprospect of such a development is keeping prices firm.Petroleum prices rose again yesterday, though tradersattributed the increases more to tough talk by PresidentGeorge Bush and Iraq's Saddam Hussein than to fundamentalsupply and demand factors.   North Sea crudes increased between 65 and 95 cents abarrel. U.S. refiners raised field postings for West TexasIntermediate, the American benchmark crude, 75 cents to$28.25 a barrel. In U.S. futures trading, the price of asimilar crude for October delivery was up 65 cents to settleat $29.77 a barrel. Though the futures price of Octobergasoline fell 2.25 cents a gallon to 92.27 cents, traders hadexpected a correction in the wake of Tuesday's big run-up ofmore than eight cents a gallon.   Above-ground stores of crude oil and petroleum products --enough to be considered a surplus before Iraq's Aug. 2invasion of Kuwait -- still are relatively high. They haveprovided a comfortable cushion for the world's fuel users,despite the loss to oil markets of 4.3 million barrels a daythat Iraq and Kuwait had exported before the global embargo.   But they aren't expected to remain at such levels muchlonger. Inventories are coming down, oil analysts say,because petroleum demand has risen beyond seasonalexpectations on war fears, and because of the time it istaking for promised supply increases to reach the market.Several producers with idle capacity, including leadingmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,are increasing output sufficiently to replace the bulk of themissing Iraqi oil. But production technicalities and shippingdelays will delay the effect on oil markets by several weeks.   As a result, &quot;We are beginning to see the initial evidenceof some drawdowns&quot; in oil inventories, said John Redpath, ananalyst with Energy Security Analysis, which tracks world oilsupplies.   Though petroleum products generally had been considered tobe in balance before the Iraqis occupied Kuwait, there was asurplus of crude oil. The crude &quot;overhang,&quot; as the glut wasknown in the industry, was estimated to be 100 million to 300million barrels.   Washington-based Energy Security Analysis set the crudesurplus at the lower end of the range. In late July,according to its estimates, crude oil accounted for 1.56billion barrels of the total petroleum inventories of 2.8billion barrels.   &quot;Since then, it's very conceivable we have used 60 millionbarrels of the overhang&quot; of 100 million barrels, Mr. Redpath,the analyst, said.   The International Energy Agency estimates that inventorieshave been drawn down steadily since the Middle East crisisdeveloped but at rates averaging only about 300,000 barrels aday. However, the Paris-based agency reported yesterday thatit expects a &quot;large&quot; drawdown in commercial inventories thismonth, before the effect of the OPEC output increases becomessignificant. Some International Energy Agency officials haveestimated that this month's withdrawals could exceed onemillion barrels a day.   The U.S. had been expected to be relatively immune to theinventory reductions for a while, because it had beenreceiving only modest amounts of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Butyesterday, signs emerged that the U.S. already is affected.According to the American Petroleum Institute's weeklyreport, U.S. crude oil inventories dropped 4.4 millionbarrels last week to 372.2 million.   Because oil companies have the inventories from which theycan draw supplies as needed, the world oil market &quot;isgenerally well supplied,&quot; according to the InternationalEnergy Agency's monthly oil report yesterday. But theInternational Energy Agency forecasts that supplies willbecome &quot;increasingly tighter&quot; during the peak-demand wintermonths.   In testimony before the House Government OperationsCommittee yesterday, Mr. Easton, the Energy Departmentofficial, agreed. He said that while the current oil supplyis more than adequate, shortages could develop before yearend. He said the Energy Department is &quot;readying&quot; the 590million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve for use &quot;when theconditions of the statute and public policy require it.&quot;   So far, the Bush administration has refrained from drawingon the reserve the government has built up to protect thecountry from an oil emergency. But Mr. Easton insisted thatthe government stands ready to tap into it. &quot;We are preparedto use it in concert with our allies at the time we seesignificant supply interruption,&quot; he told the Housecommittee.   Mr. Easton also predicted that by December, throughheightened U.S. production efforts, &quot;We will have been ableto secure out of Alaska alone an additional 250,000 barrels{of oil} a day.&quot;   ---   Hilary Stout contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
