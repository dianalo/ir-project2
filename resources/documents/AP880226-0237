GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gasoline retailer Getty Petroleum Corp., cousinof a Texaco Inc. takeover four years ago that later would bringTexaco to its knees, has now joined the contest for buying chunksof the troubled oil giant.   Getty announced Thursday that it has bought $14 million worth ofTexaco shares and is seeking government permission to acquire more.   The Jericho, N.Y.-based company, born of Texaco's 1984 takeoverof Getty Oil Co., said it would ask the Federal Trade Commission tolet it buy more than $15 million of Texaco's stock, in accordancewith government regulations.   Getty is the third party holding _ or in the process of liningup _ a large block of Texaco stock. But analysts said Getty was notlarge enough to harbor any notions of swallowing Texaco.   Rosario Ilacqua, an industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co.International Inc., said ``$15 million is peanuts'' when it takes$42 million to buy roughtly 1 million of Texaco's 243 millionshares.   He suggested Getty might be hoping to make money on its stock,or perhaps negotiate its holding into some Texaco assets in thefuture _ either with the company or some other party or parties.   George Friesen, who watches oil companies for the Dean WitterReynolds Inc. securities firm, also held that view.   ``I suspect we'll have a number of smaller predators circlingthe prey and relying on the bigger predators to do the job forthem,'' he said. ``I can't imagine Getty becoming a big player.''   Last Friday, T. Boone Pickens, a takeover strategist whocontrols Mesa Limited Partnership, an oil and gas concern, alsoexpressed interest in buying Texaco shares. He joined fellow raiderCarl C. Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder.   Getty spokesman Stephen Salzman said that his company had notbeen in contact with either Icahn or Pickens and was unwilling tosay if it would join Icahn's effort to gain a greater voice inrunning Texaco.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Texacostock stood at at $42.87{ per share, up 62{ cents.   ``We believe that Texaco is an excellent company which issubstantially undervalued,'' Leo Leibowitz, Getty's president, saidin a statement. ``We are purchasing shares of Texaco for investmentpurchases at this time.''   Getty is one of the nation's largest independent marketers ofgasoline and refined products, doing business in 11 states in theNortheast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Getty was known as Power TestCorp. until January 1985, when it acquired Getty Oil's retailoperation and the Getty name.   Getty's interest in Texaco coincides with Texaco's effort toexit the refuge of federal bankruptcy court, sought nearly a yearago because of a $10.53 billion judgment held against it byPennzoil Co.   The judgment stemmed from a Houston jury's ruling that Texacohad illegally interfered with move by Pennzoil to acquire Getty Oiland bought Getty itself.   In December, Texaco agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion in cash tosettle the dispute as part of an overall plan to reorganize andemerge from bankruptcy.   Shareholders are voting whether to approve that plan, with theresults due to be announced at a March 22 hearing in U.S.Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., Texaco's corporate home.</TEXT></DOC>
