The expected transfer of a naval logistics command fromthe Philippines represents the first example of the Bushadministration's efforts to forge new security arrangementsfor the Pacific in the wake of the collapse of the SovietUnion and the expiration of the U.S.'s long-standing baseagreement with the Philippines.</LP><TEXT>   While the number of personnel to be based here will besmall, the agreement also foreshadows an effort to negotiatesimilar &quot;access agreements&quot; with Malaysia and Thailand aspart of a regional security network including Guam, Japan,South Korea, Alaska and Hawaii.   The announcement came over the weekend during the secondleg of President Bush's 12-day, four-country Asia-Pacifictour, where the administration has sounded a dual theme ofensuring the U.S.'s continuing commitment to regionalsecurity while advancing U.S. trade interests. FromSingapore, Mr. Bush went to South Korea for a short visit andwill complete his tour with a three-day stop in Japan.   In Seoul Monday, President Bush reassured a group ofKorean businessmen that the U.S. would not resort toprotectionism. &quot;I'm determined . . . to fight the waves ofprotectionism that are almost inevitable when one's owneconomy is not doing well,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not be tryingto acquiesce in dividing up the world into trading blocs.&quot; Helistened to complaints of U.S. businessmen, but he did notchastise Korea for its trade protectionism or restrictivetrade practices. Most of the U.S. complaints were aboutKorea's semiclosed financial markets.   Mr. Bush also met with South Korean President Roh Tae Wooto discuss security issues, U.S. support for South Koreanpeace initiatives with North Korea and world trade issues.   In a speech before the South Korean National Assembly, Mr.Bush called on North Korea to allow international inspectionof its nuclear facilities. The U.S. and South Korea suspectNorth Korea is building a nuclear bomb in those facilities.He also reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to defend SouthKorea with U.S. troops.   The president also called on South Korea to joininternational efforts to conclude a multilateral trade treatyin Geneva. South Korea is one of a number of countries thatis resisting the pact because it would mean opening itsclosed agricultural and services markets. &quot;Korea has theopportunity to help fight the forces of protectionism,&quot; hesaid.   At a press conference following a meeting with the SouthKorean president, Mr. Bush said that if North Korea agrees toallow inspections of its nuclear facilities, the U.S. andSouth Korea will cancel the annual joint military exercisesknown as Team Spirit. North Korea has been clamoring for thecancellation of the exercises.   President Bush said U.S. troops will remain in South Koreaas &quot;long as there is a need and as long as they are welcome.&quot;   He also said the U.S. would be &quot;openminded&quot; about changingthe United Nations charter to allow Japan a seat on theSecurity Council.   In keeping with the themes of his trip, Mr. Bush alsoannounced tentative agreement on a bilateral investmenttreaty with Singapore and the lifting of a trade embargoagainst Cambodia and said U.S. ambassadors to the six membersof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will make anunprecedented tour of six U.S. cities to encourage U.S.companies to consider investment in Southeast Asia.   The U.S. already had a basing rights agreement withSingapore that allowed the rotation of naval vessels and sixF-16 fighters, with about 75 personnel attached to theoperation. Under the new agreement, still describedofficially as an &quot;agreement in principle,&quot; the U.S. SeventhFleet's Command Task Force 73 will be transferred here fromSubic Bay in the Philippines, involving a move of about 100to 200 personnel and dependents.   More ships and personnel could receive access toSingapore's military facilities, although the numbers remainunder negotiation. One important feature of the agreement isthat the U.S. won't pay Singapore directly for the use of itsfacilities but will be expected to increase training programsfor Singapore's own military.   For the U.S., which considers Singapore's modern airfieldand extensive ship-repair facilities as the best alternativeto Subic Bay, the weekend's announcement was the culminationof years of diplomacy and planning. The Navy's fleet ofland-based patrol planes will now have a new base to keeptrack of ships in the eastern Indian Ocean. Singapore alsoprovides much-needed facilities to handle spare parts, storeother materials and support Air Force fighters and cargoplanes.   Mr. Bush said that the U.S. &quot;does not maintain oursecurity presence as some act of charity&quot; and that the islandnation's &quot;security and your prosperity serve our interestsbecause you can better help build a more stable, moreprosperous world.&quot; At the same time, the agreement reinforcedan increasing desire by the U.S. to spread the cost ofdefense more broadly among nations that benefit from it.   On the economic issues that Mr. Bush made a centerpiece ofhis trip, the president again urged full cooperation inachieving agreement on the latest round of talks under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and he laudedSingapore's strong economic growth. He announced a frameworkagreement on investment that would grant U.S. companiescertain &quot;basic&quot; investment rights -- as yet undefined -- thatare equal to those enjoyed by Singapore companies in the U.S.He also announced an effort with Singapore to offer U.S.technical assistance and funding from international aidorganizations in solving regional environmental problems.   There was also the surprising announcement that U.S.ambassadors to Southeast Asian capitals will visit U.S.cities in March to urge local companies to make moreaggressive export and investment initiatives to the countriesin which they serve: Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. (The U.S. citiesweren't identified, except that Detroit will be one.) Themission, which apparently originated in conversations betweenseveral of the ambassadors and the Commerce Department, makesan unusually direct link between diplomacy and commerce, andit is rare for U.S. representatives to try to &quot;sell&quot; thecountries in which they serve to a domestic audience.   Human rights issues weren't mentioned during the briefvisit here, the first by a sitting U.S. president, althoughhuman rights organizations and the U.S. State Department havecriticized restrictions on the press and opposition figuresimposed by the government of former Prime Minister Lee KuanYew.</TEXT></DOC>
