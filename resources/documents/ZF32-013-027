Sanyo MBC-18NBandM;by Michael CohnandM;My Sanyo MBC-18NB survived cross-country airline flights and cross-townsubway trips with hardly a murmur.andP;  The 7-pound 16-MHz 386SX notebookcomputer with monochrome VGA screen delivered good performance over threemonths of almost daily use of word pro-cessing and communications programs.andM;In our standard configuration, with 3MB of RAM (you have to add memory in 2MBincrements), a 20MB hard disk, extra battery, carrying case, and 2,400-bpsinternal modem, the system costs $3,834.andM;In its most basic configuration, with 1MB RAM and 20MB hard disk, it listsfor $3,499, although Sanyo says the street price typically drops to around$2,000.andP;  Sanyo, however, plans to discontinue producing the model with a 20MBhard disk and sell it instead with a 60MB hard disk, renamed MBC-18NB6H.andO;With the 60MB hard disk, the basic system costs $3,749.andM;Despite its light weight, the MBC-18NB's solidly built case withstood bumps,jostles, and even a fall: The carrying case once slipped off my shoulder as Ihurried into an airport, where it plunged about 2 feet to the floor.andP;  When Ilooked inside the case, only the battery and a removable back panel appearedto have come off, and I was able to snap them back into place in a second.andM;The MBC-18NB's power-saving features proved useful.andP;  By setting times forsystem powerdown and hard disk sleep mode, slowing the CPU to 8 MHz, andhalving the LCD screen's backlighting, I was able to run the MBC-18NB on asingle battery charge for 3 and a half hours.andP;  Sleep mode also works withinWindows 3.0.andM;The 82-key keyboard felt comfortable, but I found it too easy to hit theCapsLock or NumLock keys accidently.andP;  Most annoying was the lack of dedicatedPgUp, PgDn, Home, and End keys.andP;  Since my primary application is wordprocessing, I had to hold down a Fn key while tapping one of the fourcursor-control keys to enable these functions an annoyance because these keysare so frequently used.andM;I telephoned Sanyo technical support to find out what keyboard macroutilities would be useful.andP;  The lines in the support department were all busyon the first call, but I tried again half an hour later and got throughquickly.andP;  The support person was polite but had few suggestions.andM;The MBC-18NB's screen usually appeared highly readable, even when I had thebacklighting turned down to conserve power.andP;  Although the VGA screen ismonochrome, even Windows applications looked legible.andP;  The gray scalingobscured some of XyWrite's highlighted words when the battery was low,however.andM;Sanyo's MBC-NBMDM5 internal modem is easy to install: It slides into acompartment on the side of the case.andP;  It lacks a hardware power switch, butyou can turn it on or off fairly simply through software.andM;Sanyo's documentation is clear and well illustrated, although the DOS manualcould benefit from more information about batch file commands.andP;  In general, Iliked the Sanyo MBC-18NB.andP;  Its speed beat my old laptop, a Toshiba T1000, bya mile, and its screen was much more readable than the reflective LCD I'mused to.andP;  The price isn't bad either, especially when discounted to around$2,000.andM;Sanyo MBC-18NBandM;Sanyo Business Systems Corp., 51 Joseph St., Moonachie, NJ 07074;800-524-0047; fax: 201-440-1755.andP;  List Price: With 3MB RAM, 21MB Conner harddisk, 1.44MB floppy disk drive, DOS 4.01, $3,834.andP;  Options: 2MB upgrade,$335; 4MB upgrade, $670; 2,400-bps modem with MNP 5, $390; extra battery,$155; AC power adapter, $199; numeric keypad, $155; standard carrying case,$70; leather carrying case, $125.andM;CIRCLE 618 ON READER SERVICE CARDandM;Last Reviewed: August 1991.andM;Positive Findings: Decent battery life; readable screen; clear documentation;sleep mode works under Windows.andM;Negative Findings: Unhelpful (though polite) technical support.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
