Barrett</HL><DATE>01/30/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   The Geneva Conventions are much on President Bush's mindas he does battle with Saddam Hussein.   The 1949 agreements, signed by 164 nations, including theU.S. and Iraq, establish rules on how to wage war in a humanefashion. As contradictory as that notion may seem, the fourconventions &quot;have been respected in many instances by manycountries,&quot; says Ralph Steinhardt, an international lawprofessor at George Washington University.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush has declared that his Iraqi adversary hascommitted &quot;a direct violation&quot; of the Geneva Conventions byhis &quot;brutal parading&quot; on television of captured, apparentlybeaten pilots and by his threat to use prisoners as humanshields at potential U.S. bombing targets. Yesterday, Iraqsaid some allied prisoners were injured and at least one waskilled during air raids on a Baghdad government building.   &quot;Remember when Hitler's war ended, there were theNuremberg trials,&quot; Mr. Bush said last fall.   U.S. government lawyers already are preparing for apossible war-crimes trial of Saddam Hussein. One of Iraq'sfour remaining diplomats in the U.S. has been summonedrepeatedly to the State Department to receive warnings ofU.S. intention to prosecute. The International Committee ofthe Red Cross, which monitors compliance with the GenevaConventions, has said it is &quot;making representations&quot; toBaghdad over its alleged violations.   The problem with the conventions is that there isn't apractical way to enforce them. The International Court ofJustice in the Netherlands handles only disputes betweennations. War-related prosecutions historically have takenplace under the national laws of one nation or, as occurredat Nuremberg, under special procedures crafted by an ad hoctribunal. In fact, the Geneva Conventions never have beenenforced against an individual.   Still, the conventions could provide the basic principlesfor any trials after the war, according to Mr. Steinhardt.The conventions cover many topics, including the treatment ofshipwrecked sailors and the protection of civilians.   Here are some of the prisoner-of-war provisions that theU.S. accuses Iraq of violating:   -- POWs must be treated &quot;humanely&quot; and in particular beprotected from ridicule, intimidation or torture.   -- POWs, when questioned, are obliged to disclose onlytheir name, rank, date of birth and military identificationnumber.   -- Captors must evacuate prisoners from battle areas andkeep them out of combat zones.</TEXT></DOC>
