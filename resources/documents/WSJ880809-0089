Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson directed the interest-rate boost, the seventh such increase since early June. British base rates now stand at their highest level since March 1987.    The rise in base rates, effective today, helped sterling recover ground lost against the dollar last week. In late New York trading, the pound rose to $1.7012 from $1.6895 Friday. The base-rate increase also knocked London shares off their midday peaks yesterday.    Economists and dealers had predicted rates would rise to 11% in the fall. But yesterday's boost caught market participants off guard, as many had expected that the pound's recent strength against the Deutsche mark would delay the increase.    The move indicated anew the government's urgent desire to stifle inflation, which Mr. Lawson last month predicted would continue to edge up next year before it falls. Inflation in Britain is running at a 4.6% annual rate.    The government directed a base-rate rise &quot;based on the idea that the cautious approach is justified,&quot; said Peter Fellner, a London-based economist at the brokerage firm of James Capel andamp; Co. With base rates at 11%, officials have &quot;the extra cushion which would enable them at some later stage to bring rates down without triggering a cut in mortgage rates&quot; that in turn could stoke inflation, he added.    British monetary officials said yesterday's move continues the tightening begun two months ago. Analysts predicted base rates would remain steady for several weeks, but probably climb to 12% this fall. They said the upward move seems likely despite the concerns of many British industrialists that higher interest rates and stronger sterling hamper exports.    Earlier this year, Mr. Lawson stressed the importance of a steady pound for British business and foreign-exchange stability. But now, &quot;it really does look as though the chancellor has changed his tune on the exchange rate,&quot; said David Owen, an economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, a London brokerage firm. &quot;He's happy to let {the pound} appreciate to keep inflationery costs under control.&quot;    Some analysts suggested Britain directed a base-rate rise partly to counter the surging U.S. dollar. They said bullish forecasts for the U.S. economy presage higher interest rates there, which other countries might match in an effort to fight inflation.    &quot;In the U.S., we're now getting a steady succession of figures probably more uptempo than even the most optimistic forecasts,&quot; said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities, a London securities firm. &quot;Central banks world-wide are on inflation alert.&quot;    Yesterday's base-rate rise also prompted market speculation that statistics to be released next week will show a massive, and possibly inflationary, surge in United Kingdom bank lending during July. Economists agreed that bank lending probably soared last month. But they said the government probably won't worry much about those particular figures, as British tax law changes prompted a temporary scramble for home mortgages. </TEXT></DOC>
