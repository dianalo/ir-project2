<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-1070 </DOCNO><TEXT>Electricity is one of the most favoured final energies. The share of primaryenergy used for electricity generation has grown from some 20% in 1960to nearly 35% in 1985 in the world, in the USA and the FR of Germanyas well. The main sources will be coal and nuclear energy. Electricitygeneration has arrived at a high technical standard, and as far as coalis concerned, at block units of 800 MW. The next phase, to end in 1993,is the installation of SO{sub 2} and NO/sub x/ removal equipment dueto the severe environmental regulations in Germany. The subject of thefurther development also already begun is the realization of atmosphericfluidized bed combustion and combined cycles with integrated coal gasificationand in the longer term pressurized FBC. The long term development beyondthe turn of the century aims at the combination of high temperature nuclearreactors and coal conversion for the production of process heat, electricity,gaseous fuels and chemical constituents. 65 refs., 20 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
