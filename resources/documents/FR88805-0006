Extended NCUA's power to suspend or prohibit a person temporarily priorto an administrative hearing [12 U.S.C. 1786(g)(4)] to employees and agents;and 4. Added a new section 206(g)(7) [12 U.S.C.

S.Rep. No. 19, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 24-25, reprinted in [1987] U.S. CodeCong. andamp; Ad. News 487, 514-15. Congress added Section 206(g)(7) to ``eliminatethe need for the OCC, FDIC, FSLIC, Federal Reserve or the Farm Credit Administrationto take separate enforcement action * * *.'' <T3>Id. </T3>Sections 747.501-747.503, and 747.505 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations havenow been amended to reflect the clarification that the section 206(g) authorityreaches an FCU's ``employees'' and ``agents.'' A new provision [designatedandSection; 747.506; old andSection; 747.506 becomes andSection; 747.507] hasbeen added to reflect the extended effect of an NCUA removal, prohibition,or suspension order to include prohibition on participation in the conductof the affairs of other financial institutions. Since this amendment simply conforms NCUA's regulations to changes Congressmade to the FCUA, the Board has found that the notice and public commentprocedures of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary and not in the public interest.The Board has also found that the requirement for a 30-day delayed effectivedate under by 5 U.S.C. 553(d) is not applicable in this case; this amendmentonly restates provisions of the FCUA that federally-insured credit unionsare now subject to. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility Act The NCUA Board hereby certifies that this final amendment will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small credit unions.
