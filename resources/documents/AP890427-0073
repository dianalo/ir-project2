About 10,000 striking workers from 12 factories clashed withriot police in Changwon for a fourth straight day to demand therelease of jailed strike leaders, police said.   Workers swarmed into the streets, hurling firebombs and rocks atpolice, who fired volleys of tear gas and made shield charges.   Another 3,000 strikers clashed with riot police in the nearbyport of Masan after marching through the city. Protesters burneddown an office of the governing Democratic Justice Party, accordingto Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Police officials, who declined to be named, said two riottroopers were seriously injured in Changwon, but they had nofurther details on injuries.   Radical students also clashed with riot police in Seoul and thesouthern city of Kwangju. About 1,000 students battled police atKwangju's Chonam University after burning effigies of President RohTae-woo and President Bush.   The clashes came as dissidents vowed to proceed with plans forprotests this weekend despite government warnings that police wouldblock any protest.   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissidentalliance, said the government had no right to ban a major laborrally scheduled for Sunday in Seoul. Alliance leaders said policewould be responsible for any violence.   ``We are ready to break down any police blockade if police useillegal means to block our peaceful rally,'' the alliance said in astatement.   About 30 labor leaders were arrested today in police raids inSeoul as the government moved against radical labor groups, policesaid. Those arrested faced charges of staging illegal strikes, theysaid.   Radical student groups, which have said they will support thelabor rally, said they would go ahead with a march Friday fromSeoul to the North Korean border for talks with communist studentson reuniting the Korean peninsula and taking part in aninternational youth festival in Pyongyang in July.   Police have banned the student march. Several attempts last yearby radical students to march to the border triggered rioting inSeoul and other cities.   The radical students have been staging almost daily violentcampus protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the Rohgovernment. The radicals and allied dissident groups lack popularsupport because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat tothe Roh government.   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrestand a wave of increasinlgy violent strikes for better pay andimproved working conditions. Student and dissident groups areattempting to unite with workers to build an anti-governmentalliance.   Top opposition leaders warned Wednesday that continued unrestcould undermine democratic development in South Korea.   Dissident leaders claim Roh is a front for military rule anddemand the former general step down. Roh won elections in December,1987 after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.</TEXT></DOC>
