<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0999 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using the examples of USSR, FRG, USA, UK, Japan and France explains thatthe operational indicators for the efficiency of thermal power plantsand large condenser power blocks are being adversely affected by a numberof factors such as the worsening quality of coal (in USSR average combustionheat has fallen over the past 30 years from 23.0 to 19.3 MJ/kg), theincreased proportion of solid fuel in the fuel balance (at the expenseof oil fuel) and aging equipment. Methods of improving efficiency includemodernizing the turbine flow passage, optimizing the thermal circuit,deep cooling of the gases in low-sulfur coal boilers, introducing automaticdiagnosis systems (automatic control systems), and improving maneuverability,but at present these are being used on too small a scale. The USSR hasdeveloped a scientific and technical plan for improving power unit efficiencybased on creating a 500-800 MW coal dust power unit with improved supercriticalsteam parameters. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
