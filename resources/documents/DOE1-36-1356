The obtained results are significantly differentfrom those by using a conventional two-dimensional model. Interestingly,the nonuniform descending behavior in the upper furnace, which is affectedby deflection in the tuyere airflow balance, and formation of the furnacewall deposits, is perfectly contradictionary to that observed in theplace where the factors of the behavior are circumferential balance controlof a blast furnace. This study deals with qualitative understanding ofthe phenomenon, which will be revealed from the quantitative and theoreticalviewpoint. (14 figs, 1 tab, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
