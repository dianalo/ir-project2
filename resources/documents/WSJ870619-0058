A Canada Post spokesman said the new offer &quot;minimizes the impact of the changes we were seeking on the workers,&quot; but he declined to elaborate.    A union official said the new offer represented &quot;very little movement&quot; from Canada Post's previous position.    Unresolved issues in the negotiations include job security, work rules and the company's two-tier wage proposal, with lower salaries for newly hired workers. The contract between the union's 20,000 members and Canada Post expired Dec. 31.    Meanwhile, the union's rotating strikes spread to at least six new cities as letter carriers in Montreal and Calgary, Alberta -- the first two cities affected -- returned to work. </TEXT></DOC>
