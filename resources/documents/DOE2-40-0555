An analysis basedon the use of the extremes of the fringes in the transparent region isapplied in order to determine the real and imaginary parts of the refractiveindex, as well as the thickness of the specimens. The equation 2nd =m{lambda}, helps to estimate n in the region of strong absorption sothat the optical constants are finally determined in the spectral region450 to 700 nm. Ellipsometric measurements are used to cross-check theresults at {lambda} = 632.8 nm.</TEXT></DOC>
