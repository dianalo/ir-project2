MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It has produced cut-rate airline tickets,higher interest rates for savers and lower long-distance costs _but the deregulation of American enterprise carries a price tag,too.   For openers, there's the $50 billion now, plus perhaps $100billion later, to bail out the savings and loan industry, introuble before deregulation and in worsening straits afterward.With the bailout came, belatedly, a stringent system of regulationto oversee every facet of the industry.   The low-cost air service that is said to be saving travelers andshippers more than $14 billion a year doesn't reach everywhere;fares into smaller, non-competitive cities are as steep or steeperthan before.   Deregulation in telecommunications is still contentious, in thecourts and in Congress. Long-distance costs less, some localservices more. There are a dozen bills seeking some measure ofre-regulation of cable television.   In other deregulated industries, some prices are higher, someservices lacking, and surveys indicate that wages are generallylower than would be the case had regulation remained.   Overall, though, the consensus among economic analysts is thatthe United States is better off with deregulation than without it.Among economists, that judgment spans the political spectrum,conservative to liberal. There's less unanimity among politicians,some of whom pick targets and threaten regulatory moves to get atthem.   There's been congressional talk, for example, of regulation tomake sure that television viewers don't someday have to pay to seethe pro football Super Bowl.   Deregulation has been a selective process. New Deal-eraregulation of industry and transportation has been phased out,while regulation involving the environment, health and safety hasbeen increasing.   While there may be a backlash on some issues, nobody expects areversal of the trend toward deregulation.   ``Unless you repeal technology, I don't think you'll ever beable to go back to the old, regulated system,'' said James L.Gattuso, regulatory affairs analyst at the conservative HeritageFoundation.   A bill making its way through Congress would have the governmentintervene against airline takeovers on safety or competitivegrounds, a measure opposed by the administration as creepingre-regulation.   A more drastic measure proposed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,D-Ohio, with two Republican co-sponsors, would have the governmentreinstate regulation of fares, routes and service. While that isnot likely to pass, it reflects discontent with some of the falloutof deregulation.   ``Congress is going to do a little tinkering, to show thatthey're doing something,'' said Clifford Winston, a BrookingsInstitution specialist on deregulation in the transportationindustry.   Ronald Reagan was president during much of the deregulationdecade, and his administration boasted of easing or undoingshackles on business. But little was accomplished after his firstterm.   Major regulatory overhauls of the past decade were shaped beforeReagan's presidency, some by Democrats. Indeed, Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., was an early advocate of airline deregulation,which began while Jimmy Carter was president.   Economist William A. Niskanen, a former Reagan economic adviser,flunked the last Republican administration on regulatory relief andreform. ``Although this program started with a bang, it ended witha whimper,'' he wrote.   Near the end of Reagan's first term, ``attempts to rein in theregulatory establishment virtually ceased,'' according to a studyby Melinda Warren and Kenneth Chilton at the Center for the Studyof American Business in St. Louis.   Warren and Chilton found that regulatory agencies grew duringhis administration, with two notable exceptions. The CivilAeronautics Board, which used to regulate airline routes and fares,was shut down, and the Interstate Commerce Commission cut itsspending by nearly two-thirds.   The Environmental Protection Agency grew the most, with spendingup 70 percent during the two Reagan terms. The government spendsmore than four times as much on social regulation to protecthealth, safety and the environment as it spends on economicregulation.   Among the landmarks of deregulation in the 1980s:   _AIRLINES. Route and rate decontrol began in 1978. The CivilAeronautics Board was shut down in 1982. The Federal AviationAdministration regulates the airlines on safety matters. Estimatesof the economic benefits of an expanding airline industry range upto about $15 billion a year. Fares are about 29 percent lower thanthey would have been without deregulation, according to a Brookingsanalysis.   But there also have been bankruptcies and more than a dozenmajor takeovers, prompting the proposals for revived regulation.And the growth in air travel also has led to airport congestion anddelays.   _BROADCASTING. Most programming requirements and limits oncommercials were dropped by the Federal Communications Commission;first for radio, then, in 1984, for television. Station licenserenewals were simplified as programming checks were dropped. Alottery system supplanted fitness exams as the basis for choosingamong competitors for new licenses in such fields as cellulartelephone service, low-power and pay television systems.   The Reagan FCC dropped the fairness doctrine, which had requiredbalance in broadcast coverage of controversial issues. TheDemocratic-controlled Congress is trying to reinstate it.   The deregulation trend dates from the Carter administration,when the FCC eased cable television restrictions and began theprocess for broadcasters.   _TELEPHONE SERVICE. The breakup of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. completed what had begun nearly 20 years before whenDemocrat Lyndon B. Johnson was president. The 1982 settlement,effective in 1984, split telephone operating companies away fromATandamp;T and set rules fostering competition in long-distance service.That eased regulation but didn't undo it on long-distance rates,which still are subject to the FCC and state regulators.   _BANKING. The thrifts were already in trouble before Congressvoted to ease regulation of the investments they could make and theamount of interest they could offer depositors. Shaky savings andloans could, and did, make high-risk investments to try to pulleven. Speculators had an easy time attracting money because thegovernment insured deposits.   The danger of default was not so clear in the early 1980s. TheReagan administration unsuccessfully sought broader deregulation,on the theory that banks and savings and loans could then competemore effectively in a changing financial world. President Bushconfronted a worsening Sandamp;L crisis when he took office, and answeredwith the bailout bill he signed last summer.   _TRUCKING, RAILROAD FREIGHT. They were partly deregulated underlegislation passed in 1980, before Reagan. Surveys point to lowershipping costs. Winston, at the Brookings Institution, is about topublish a study that will indicate savings and benefits in surfacetransportation of more than $14 billion.   One analyst, reviewing the decade in 1988, said economicderegulation reduced prices and costs in every industry in which itwas tried. Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist, said thebenefit didn't show everywhere because in some places, especiallyrural America, regulators had set prices below costs, and offsetthem by charging more elsewhere.   Noll said deregulation increased employment in the industriesinvolved, but at generally lower wages, savings that represent asubstantial share of the reduction in prices and costs.   For all of that, as he noted in a study published by theAmerican Enterprise Institute, the regulatory structure that was inplace 20 years ago is almost intact.   No major overhaul is in prospect. The Bush administration iscommitted to deregulation; as vice president, George Bush headed atask force on regulatory reform. But regulatory change is not highon the administration's priority list.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
