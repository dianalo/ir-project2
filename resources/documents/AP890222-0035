KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says thepeace plan drafted by Central American presidents is a goodbeginning but lacks deadlines or any means of enforcing complianceif Nicaragua reneges.   But a key Democratic senator says the plan issued last week bythe presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras andNicaragua stands on its own merits and will proceed with or withoutthe United States.   Baker told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday thepeace plan is flawed because it fails to account for what he said isNicaragua's record of broken promises, specifically pledges topermit free elections and a free press and to liberate politicalprisoners.   He said any participation by the Sandinista government in a newpeace agreement should be monitored ``with the best verification wecan get, because the promises have been made more than once andbroken more than once.''   A ``carrot-and-stick'' approach _ with the imposition of specificdeadlines _ is needed to spur the Sandinistas to keep their word,Baker said.   ``What is lacking is a mechanism for enforcement to translatethese principles into reality,'' he said. ``We need to establishtimelines for performance. And we have to develop incentives anddisincentives to improve the prospects for such compliance in thefirst place.''   Baker called again for the end to partisan battling in Congressover Central American policy and aid to anti-Sandinista Contraforces, now located in camps along Honduras' border with Nicaragua.   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the SenateForeign Relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere, said Bakerappeared to be treating the five-nation accord ``in a backhandedfashion.''   ``When I hear statements that this is not a satisfactory plan, Iget the feeling we think the plan doesn't go into effect unless wesay it's OK,'' he said. ``This plan is not contingent on anything.This plan goes forward whether we like it or not.''   Dodd said, however, that if Nicaragua makes substantial progresstoward meeting its promises of democratization in the coming weeks,Congress will convert future aid for the Contra rebels intorelocation assistance, rather than humanitarian supplies to maintainthem as a military force in their border camps.   Baker said the decision by the Central American presidents toaddress the future of the Contras and their Honduran campsthemselves and to make a specific proposal within 90 days leaves thesituation vague.   The proposal cannot be judged ``until you know what the planis,'' he said.   ``But we will not abandon the democratic resistance as we givediplomacy a chance,'' Baker said.   Turning to El Salvador, Baker said he believes the United Stateslacks ``the luxury not to recognize any government that emerges''from upcoming elections there, even if those elections are won bythe rightist Arena party.   He also said while there has been significant improvement inrespect for civil rights in El Salvador over the last eight years,``there has been some recent regression,'' including murderspossibly committed by uniformed members of the armed forces</TEXT></DOC>
