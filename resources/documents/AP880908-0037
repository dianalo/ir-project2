The change is being made two months before a presidentialelection in which Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis has repeatedlyattacked soaring trade deficits, calling them examples of failedReagan administration economic policies.   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner defended the change at abriefing Wednesday, telling reporters it was not an effort tomanipulate government statistics for political purposes.   ``It doesn't change the basic story,'' he said. ``Either way thetrade deficit is still large, but it is now improvingsubstantially.''   The monthly merchandise trade report due out next week will bethe first to reflect the new accounting procedure.   It will show that the United States is importing about $1.5billion less each month even though the total amount of colortelevisions, cars and other foreign products purchased by Americanswill not have changed at all.   Since the official import figure will be on average $1.5 billionlower, the closely watched monthly trade deficit, the differencebetween imports and exports, also will be $1.5 billion lower.   Since 1979, the government has included the costs paid toforeigners to ship and insure their products as part of thecountry's total import bill.   Before then, the monthly merchandise trade figures did notinclude shipping and insurance costs for imports. These paymentswere classified as a service and were added to a quarterly tradereport known as the current account, which reflects U.S.transactions in both goods and services.   Former Sen. Russell Long, D-La., sponsored an amendment in 1979that changed the merchandise trade report to include the insuranceand shipping costs, arguing that without these costs, the monthlytrade report did not properly reflect U.S. obligations toforeigners.   The Long amendment prohibited the Commerce Department fromreleasing any trade figures stripped of insurance and shippingcosts until 48 hours after release of the initial trade report.   The government continued to release the lower import figures,but they received little notice compared to the initial tradereport, with its larger deficit.   The administration has now changed that process by gettingCongress to approve an amendment removing the 48-hour delayrequirement. The change, which attracted little notice, was part ofthe 1,000-page omnibus trade bill.   Beginning with next Wednesday's release of the July merchandisetrade report, the government will release both sets of importstatistics. Beginning next year, only the trade data minus shippingcosts will be released, Ortner said.   He said the other figure will still be compiled and will beavailable to those who request it.   Ortner said the new accounting process would put servicepayments for shipping and insurance where they belong in theservices category of the current account, the broadest measure ofU.S. trade.   ``This will give a slightly rosier tint to the numbers, but froman economists' point of view it makes sense to have exports andimports on the same basis. I don't object to the method at all,''said Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm.   But Evans said political motivations almost certainly played arole in the action.   ``There were politics involved on both sides. Russell Longwanted to embarrass the administration with higher trade deficitsand this move is political as well,'' he said. ``If politics didn'tenter in, then they would have waited until next year to introducethe new system.''   However, Ortner said that by publishing both import figures, itwould be up to the news media to decide which one to emphasize.   The merchandise trade deficit for 1987 under the old system was$170.3 billion. With shipping removed, the deficit would have beena lower $152.1 billion.   But that would still be a record, up 10 percent from a $138.3billion 1986 deficit as calculated with the revised accountingprocedure.</TEXT></DOC>
