As we end 1989 and finish the 80s, we'll look at someof the new software and hardware that caught our fancy this fall.andM;SoftwareandM;Software applications lead our parade of products.andM;Personal Information Management (PIM) software made a big splash in 1988 and1989 with the introduction of Lotus Agenda in 1988 and IBM Current inNovember 1989.andM;Personal Information Management software should be able to compete with a penand pencil to make it as easy for a user to put information into a computeras it is to scribble it on a scrap of paper on his or her desk.andP;  That's thebottom line for PIMs.andM;Instant RecallandM;A candidate for &quot;leading edge market leader&quot; in the PIM category is InstantRecall ($99) from Chronologic Corp. (5151 N. Oracle, Suite 210, Tucson, AZ85704, 602-293-3100).andM;Instant Recall is a memory-resident PIM for IBM PCs and compatibles that runsin only 32k of RAM in DOS.andP;  Instant Recall will run on PCs and compatibleswith 512 RAM, DOS 2.1 or higher (DOS 3.0 or higher for memory residentoperation) and at least 720K of floppy disk or hard disk capacity.andM;The attractive thing about Instant Recall is that -- contrary to most PIMconventions -- it permits users to enter and access information in theapplication without having to exit other software applications.andP;  When it iscalled up on-screen, Instant Recall borrows additional memory as needed,swapping either to disk or expanded memory.andP;  The temporary memory usage meansthat it has no long term effect on memory needed for other programs.andM;In effect, a user could be in a word processing system and get a schedule orarchived information residing in Instant Recall without having to close oneapplication and open another.andP;  Conversely, information could be entered intoInstant Recall from any application.andM;&quot;It's the first full-featured PIM which gives users instant access to theirinformation without interfering with their normal work flow,&quot; stated RobertWeed, President of Chronologic.andM;Instant Recall succeeds at being an intuitive application with a fairly easyuser interface as well as context-sensitive help screens.andM;In addition, any feature on any of its menus can be accessed with the firstletter of the task on the menu.andM;Instant Recall stores information in four categories: Notes, for ideas,memos, lists or reports; Tasks, for tracking and delegating people andprojects; Schedule, for time, activities, and events; and People, for datastorage.andP;  Any information item can incorporate up to 65,000 characters (morethan 30 pages of text) and any database can hold up to 100 million characters(more than 60,000 pages of text).andM;The program also gives users an integrated viewing option to pull togetherdifferent types of information from the Nots, Tasks, Schedule, and Peoplesections to a single screen to let users access information by topic, person,date, category, priority, or embedded text.andP;  Information access methods canbe used alone or in combination.andP;  Text search in the program uses Boolean'and, or, and not' operators.andP;  The program also uses a &quot;quick timer&quot; featurethat measures time allocated to activities or projects.andM;Other features we liked included the ability to manage tasks and schedulesfor up to 64 people and 16 groups, a clipboard for moving text betweenInstant Recall and other programs and files, optional password protection, amailing label function, a telephone dialer, a follow-up date and advancenotice scheduler, pop-up alarms, a pop-up calendar and automatic conflictchecking for schedule entry.andM;Instant Recall is currently a single-user product.andP;  However, Chronologicofficials said a networked version of Instant Recall, using the same userinterface, is currently being developed.andM;Gray F/XandM;Xerox Imaging Systems (535 Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale, CA 94086,408-522-3800) recently introduced Gray F/X ($495), an advanced eight-bit(256-level grayscale) image processing software for PC/ATs and compatibles.andM;The new software, Gray F/X, permits comprehensive editing of black and whiteimages and provides up to 256 levels of grayscale, depending on theresolution of the scanner used to capture the image.andP;  It also permits editingof multiple images concurrently in a windowing environment.andM;Gray F/X's image processing capabilities are combined with bit-mappedgraphics paint features and specialized tools to allow a user to outline,high-light, fill, distort, cut and paste, rotate, add text or otherwise editgrayscale images on a PC.andM;Scanned images can be edited by altering the contrast, lightness or darkness,or by applying a variety of special effects such as replace, blur andcharcoal effects.andP;  All the editing, effects are designed to be applied eitherto the whole image or to selected areas of the image.andM;Other features in Gray F/X also include halftoning, filtering, posterizationand histogram analysis.andP;  By using a histogram (a numerical representation ofan image's contrast and brightness) a user can determine the most appropriateediting choices.andM;Gray F/X images may be saved as TIFF, TIFF-LZW, HALO CUT, IMG, PCX and EPSfile formats, or imported directly into the two leading desktop publishingapplication packages, Xerox Ventura Publisher and Aldus PageMaker.andM;The program's file import feature also allows desktop publishers to createcomposite documents containing eight-bit images.andP;  The images can then beviewed in the context of the entire document and then obtain high resolution,printable, halftone images, all through a totally digital process.andM;For users of computerized publishing systems, Gray F/X removes one of thelast barriers to totally automated production of documents containingblack-and-white photographs, said Chip Maloney, Vice President of marketingfor Xerox Imaging Systems.andP;  &quot;It eliminates the cost and inconvenience ofhaving to product halftones separately and then integrating them beforeprinting.&quot;andM;TypeStylerandM;Often mistakenly overlooked by business end-users, Broderbund Software, Inc.andO;(17 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903-2101, 415-495-3200) continues to bringinnovative desktop productivity software into the business computer market.andM;Broderbund's most recent entry is TypeStyler ($199.95), a Macintosh softwareprogram that allows users to customize, manipulate and create special effectswith display type.andM;Users can bend, twist, squeeze and shape PostScript's hundreds of typefacesfrom different font manufacturers' font libraries.andP;  Text also can be styledby adding perspective, sunbursts, shadows, shades, inlines and outlines,patterns and colors.andM;The program was developed for graphic designers, desktop publishers andgeneral business Macintosh users to let them quickly design, layout and printheadline text and logos as well as signage, design, advertising graphics,newsletters, package art presentations and manuals.andM;&quot;Accepted as a product for design professionals,&quot; said Harry Walker,Executive Publisher of Broderbund's Productivity Group.andP;  &quot;TypeStyler's easeof use and price make it within reach of just about anyone involved indesktop publishing.andP;  As a result, it will help to broaden the market forhigh-end graphics applications.&quot;andM;Ten AGFA Compugraphic typefaces, which have been converted into TypeStylerSmoothfonts, are included with the program.andP;  End-users also can use literallythousands of third-party Type 3 PostScript fonts from Bitstream Inc., Casadyandamp; Greene, DUBL-CLiCK, The Font Company, Monotype, MacTography and fontscreated by Altysis Corporation's Fontographer.andP;  TypeStyler works with Type 3(unencrypted, unhinted) PostScript fonts.andM;TypeStyler output can be directed to both QuickDraw and PostScript printers.andO;In addition, TypeStyler creates PostScript effects on non-PostScriptprinters, so that on an ImageWriter, for example, the output is so smooththat it rivals a laser printer.andM;StrategiesandM;As computers proliferate in the business and home marketplace, users need toknow that money can be saved by purchasing less well-known brands that havethe same functions and components of some of the major brands (IBM, COMPAQ,AST).andM;Computer hardware works essentially the same way depending on the category ofthe machine.andP;  However, that statement requires a huge caveat.andP;  Someunscrupulous vendors (and they are in the minority) will sell machines withdefective chips and/or peripheral equipment (See Andrew Seybold's Outlookeditorial November 1989, Volume 8, Number 4).andM;What we've outlined below are the names of some vendors whose products havecaught our eye.andP;  These vendors will be around to stand by their products andare worth your buying consideration.andM;Premier Innovations Inc. (10310 Harwin Drive, Houston, TX 77036, 713-995-4433or 1-800-347-1777) recently introduced a Model 8000, a 25MHz, zero-wait-state386 computer for under $5,000.andP;  In its barest configuration, the Model 8000comes with 1MB of RAM, a 64K of cache memory, a 1.2MB, 5-1/4-inch floppy diskdrive, shadow RAM control, and a dual ESDI hard drive/dual floppy controller.andO;The 8000 can also be outfitted with 4MB of RAM ($5,995) and is expandable upto 16MB RAM.andP;  Users can choose among 156MB, 335MB or 650MB Hard drives and aVGA video adapter card.andM;The 8000 comes with a 200 watt power supply, parallel and serial ports, amath co-processor chip socket, a 101-keyboard, keyboard-selectible 8 to 25MHzclock speeds and a BIOS with built-in setup and diagnostics.andP;  The Premier8000 has eight expansion slots (six 16-bit, one 8-bit, and one 32-bit).andP;  Inaddition, it has three half height exposed drive bays and two half-heightinternal drive bays.andM;Premier also introduced the Premier 9000, a 33MHz zero wait- state 386computer.andP;  Outfitted with 1MB of RAM, the 9000 sells for $6,395.andP;  With 4MB ofRAM (expandable to 16MB), the 9000 is $7,349.andM;Packard BellandM;Packard Bell (9425 Canoga Avenue, Chatsworth, CA 91311, 818- 773-4400)entered the 386 computer derby with two computers designed forperformance-oriented end-users looking for reasonably priced 386 machines.andM;By selling to government and institutional accounts, computer specialtystores and through mass merchandise outlets (public warehouse distributorssuch as Costco or the Price Club in California), Packard Bell has quietlybecome the sixth-largest seller of computers in the United States.andP;  Usershave found a stable, dependable product they can purchase inexpensively.andP;  Asusers' tastes become more sophisticated, Packard Bell has responded to thedemand with higher-end computers -- in this case 386s for the masses -- andthey did their homework.andM;The Force 386/25andM;Their high-end product, the Force 386/25 computer ($5,595), features an Intel80386 CPU operating at 25 MHz with 2MB of RAM on the motherboard and 64K ofcache memory, to increase theandM;execution speed of software applications.andP;   EquippedandM;with a 60MB hard disk, the system is priced at $6,395.andP;  In addition, theForce 386/25 is able to provide hardware support for the OS/2 operatingsystem when it becomes available.andM;Memory may be expanded to 8MB on the motherboard using SIMM (Standard In-lineMemory Modules) with a total system capacity of 16MB of RAM available.andP;  Thecomputer has eight expansion slots (two 32-bit, one 8-bit, and five 16-bitslots) with seven open slots available.andP;  In addition, the Force 386/25 hasfour open half-height drive bays for additional mass storage.andP;  The Force386/25 also has a 5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive and one parallel and twoserial interface ports.andM;The Force 386/SXandM;For end-users whose needs are sophisticated, but who are price conscious,Packard Bell offers an inexpensive Force product, the Force 386/SX.andP;  Pricedat $2,795, the Force 386/SX includes an 80386SX CPU chip operating at 16MHz.,andO;with 1MB of RAM, two floppy drives (a 5-1/4-inch and a 3-1/2-inch) and a 16bit VGA controller on the motherboard.andP;  The Force 386/SX equipped with a 40MBhard drive, is priced at $3,595.andM;Packard Bell officials said the Force 386/SX is seen as an entry-level 386machine which can support a number of operating environments and applicationsincluding networking, multi-tasking, desktop publishing and ComputerAidedDesign, as well as standard office applications.andM;Designed to accommodate future growth, the Force 386/SX can expand to 4MB onthe motherboard using SIMM modules.andP;  A total of 16MB of RAM can be managed bythe system.andM;The computer has five expansion slots (four 16-bit and one 8-bit) and twoopen drive cavities for mass storage devices (hard drives).andP;  Standardinterfaces on the Force 386/SX include: a parallel port, two serial ports, amouse port, a VGA graphics port, and a PS/2-compatible keyboard connector.andM;Dennis Cox, Packard Bell marketing director, said the aim of Packard Bell'sintroduction of the Force 386 family of products is to give users featuresand performance combined with highly competitive prices.andM;&quot;Both the SX and the 25MHz models can fully suport contemporary operatingenvironments, including multi-tasking (Unix and Xenix) and networking, plusthe demands of the newest level of application software,&quot; Cox said.andM;In addition, both computers are covered by a one-year limited warranty andqualify for a four-month on-site service program.andM;Bondwell's SuperSlimandM;Joining the &quot;lite&quot; laptop brigade is the 310 SuperSlim, an 8.5 lb laptop,which measures 13-inches by 12.2-inches by 2.2-inches, introduced by BondwellIndustries (47485 Seabridge Drive, Fremont, CA 94583, 415-490-4300).andM;The B310 SuperSlim ($3,695) which runs a 12 MHz 80C286 CPU at zerowait-states, also has a Connor 40MB hard disk with an access time of 25milliseconds and a 1:1 interleave factor.andM;Richard Cook, vice president of sales for Bondwell's Office AutomationDivision, said the B310 laptop effectively matches the performance of a 16MHzIBM PC/AT.andM;Cook said, &quot;Until now, used had to trade either power, speed or storage spacein order to get a lightweight, easy-to-carry laptop.andP;  The B310 delivers muchmore power and performance than other 286-based laptops at half the weightand at a considerably lower price.&quot;andM;The Bondwell B310 SuperSlim has a high contrast, non-glare, supertwist LCDscreen, 1MB of RAM (expandable to 2MB), a 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy drive and aremovable/rechargeable battery pack.andP;  The B310 also has one parallel and twoRS-232 serial interface ports, an AC power adapter and a real-time clock.andO;Software bundled with the B310 includes MS-DOS 3.3 and GW BASIC 3.22.andO;Optional accessories include a second rechargeable battery pack and a softcarrying case.andM;Getting a HeadStart onandM;TechnologyandM;One of the more interesting surprises at Fall Comdex was the introduction byHeadStart Technologies (a division of North American Philips Corp.) of thefirst computer with a built- in CD-ROM drive.andM;If you're a habitue of computer magazines, HeadStart was formerly Vendex, thecompany that had wrestler King Kong Bundy doing its ads.andP;  Well, to say theleast, Bundy is now gone and Vendex has changed its name to HeadStart and isa North American Philips division.andM;Together with all the changes, are HeadStart's two new computer accompaniedwith enough software to wow any PC home/office neophyte.andM;The two new computers, the HeadStart LX-CD and the HeadStart III-CDS comewith built-in CD-ROM disk drives and a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive.andP;  Inaddition, HeadStart offers a wide array of CD software for each of the twomachines.andM;Software on compact disks included with the HeadStart computers includes:Microsoft Bookshelf (which includes the American Heritage Dictionary, TheWorld Almanac and Book of Facts, the U.S.andP;  Zip Code Directory, Bartlett'sFamiliar Quotations, The Chicago Manual of Style, Roget's II ElectronicThesaurus, the Houghton-Mifflin Usage Alert for forms and letters, The NewGrolier Electronic Encyclopedia (all 21 volumes on a single disk), PC Globe,30 games, a CD guide to all audio CDs released to date (including reviews,critiques and audio samples and a CD audio music disk sampler (ademonstration disk of CD audio music from CBS records).andP;  Also included isHotline Two, a national directory of 100,000 business addresses, phonenumbers and fax numbers.andM;The HeadStart LX-CD is priced under $2,000 and comes with a standard5-1/4-inch 680MB CD-ROM drive with stereio sound, a 40MB hard disk drive, a1.44MB/720K 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, a VGA graphics card, stereoheadphones and a mouse pointing device.andM;The LX-CD is powered by an 8088 CPU chip with switchable speeds of 4.77 and10 MHz.andP;  The LX-CD uses 768K of RAM.andP;  The LX-CD has five expansion slots,256K of video RAM and a 101 PS/2-style keyboard.andP;  Interface connectionsinclude a serial port, a parallel port, a bus mouse connector, stereo RCAjacks for CD audio output and stereo mini-headphone jacks for CD audio.andM;The higher powered computer offering from HeadStart is HeadStart III-CD.andO;HeadStart III ($2,995) comes similarly outfitted with a 40MB hard disk drivewith an access time of 28 milliseconds and 1:1 interleave.andP;  Powered by an90286 microprocessor, with switchable speeds of between 8 and 12 MHz, theIII-CD comes with 1MB of RAM and may be expanded to 3MB.andM;In addition to the CD software supplied with the LX-CD, the III-CD comes withthe Microsoft Small Business Consultant (all the information one needs tostart and run a small business including a library of more than 220publications from the U.S.andP;  Small Business Administration, other governmentagencies and a Big 8 Accounting firm.)andM;Also included with the III-CD are Microsoft's Stat PAck (which allows you tofind statistical information quickly), Bookmark Plus (which saves filesautomatically, so information isn't lost due to power failure, Above Disc, anEMS emulator, Framework II, an integrated world processing, spreadsheetdatabase management, graphics and telecommunications program, and Perspective3-D, a presentation graphics program.andM;Something new fromandM;DaVinciandM;DaVinci Graphics recently introduced a new color penless plotter for theCDA/CAM market, the RasterPro 720.andM;The $3,495 plotter uses a raster-based image processing technology to producefull color plots in a fraction of the time required by a conventional penplotter.andM;The RasterPro 720 takes HPGL (H-P Graphics Language) vector-basedspecifications and converts them to high performance raster format with speedand increased image resolution.andM;&quot;As long as pens are used to plot data, there will be inherent limitations inthe performance of plotters,&quot; stated Rick Warp, founder and President ofDaVinci.andM;&quot;Users will continually be faced with problems of drying, clogging, andskipping pens.andP;  Consequently, productivity and throughput will always behindered and operator attendance will always be a requirement.&quot;andM;Because the RasterPro is a penless plotter, it can be operated withoutconcern for pen failure and therefore, without operator attendance.andP;  Inaddition, Warp said, with the printer's optional sheet feeder, the unit canbe independently operated.andM;With the RasterPro, the more complex the plot, the greater speed advantage.andO;Company officials say benchmark tests show that the RasterPro 720 works up to10 times faster in producing high resolution output.andM;&quot;The more complex the plot, the greater speed advantage offered by DaVinci,&quot;Warp said.andM;The RasterPro 720 has a 24-pin color printhead designed to produce a-sized(8.5-inch-by-11-inch) or B-sized (11-inch-by-17-inch) images, with aresolution of 720 dots per inch (higher than any commercial plotter or dotmatrix printer) in a palatte of 15 colors.andM;A standard fabric ribbon used on the RasterPro that works with ordinarycopier paper, in order to reduce cost on printer consumables (materials).andM;One of the advantages of the higher resolution of the RasterPro, is theabsence of &quot;jaggies or ink spreads associated with the present set of penplotters on the market.andM;With an optional 2.5MB internal buffer to permit operation in a sharedperipheral or network environment, the RasterPro costs $3,995.andM;News from AppleandM;An end of the year communique from Apple to developers anticipates therelease of Apple System 7.0 by the summer of 1990.andM;System 7.0 will include Finder 7.0, outline fonts, InterapplicationCommunications Architecture, A Database Access Manager, Virtual Memory and32-bit addressing.andM;An Apple spokesman also said a new core technology, Macintosh FileShare, willbe delivered in System 7.0 as an extension of the Finder.andP;  The new technologyis a further step in Apple's quest to integrate networking with the MacintoshOperating Systems.andP;  Using Macintosh FileShare permits users to share theirlocal files--without having to use a file server -- with any other computerrunning AppleShare client software.andM;The Mac Communications Toolbox and 32-bit QuickDraw (now available in System6.03) will be incorporated into System 7.0.andM;Other new features in System 7.0 includes a HelpManager, enchancements toSoundManager, a file system, Text Edit, Script Manaer and Time Manager.andP;  Newprint drivers and Apple Outline Fonts for all Apple compatible printers,including PostScript devices, will also be offered.andM;Apple officials emphasized that System 7.0 is slated to operated on ALLMacintosh computers with 2MB of RAM (from the Macintosh 128 -- upgraded to aMac Plus--to the newly introduced Macintosh II ci.andM;Macintosh Computers which have the Motorola 68030 processor (or the PMMUoption with the Macintosh II) will also have the benefit of virtual memory.andM;PostScript for the IIPandM;Pacific Data Products (6404 Nancy Ridge Drive, San Diego, CA 92121,619-552-0880, FAX 619-552-0889), is providing the missing link for HewlettPackard LaserJet IIP owners -- PostScript.andM;The Southern California laser printer enhancement company recently announcedthe PacificPage-IIP.andM;The PacificPage-IIP cartridge contains a PostScript interpreter emulationdeveloped by Phoenix Technologies Ltd., called PhoenixPage, whichincorporates Bitstream's new Quality Enhancement Module (QEM).andP;  The cartridgeis also compatible with all major applications programs that supportPostScript output.andM;Because of the more efficient controller design of the Hewlett-Packard IIPprinter, the PacificPage-IIP offers nearly twice the performance of theseries II version of PacificPage running on the H-P LaserJet Series II.andM;When used with text-intensive applications, the PacificPage-IIP generatesprint speeds of approximately 4-pages-per-minute (the IIP's standard printspeed), significantly faster than the Apple LaserWriter IINT.andP;  An H-P IIPwith a PacificPage-IIP cartridge roughly matches the performance of the AppleLaserWriter IINT with graphics intensive applications.andM;The PacificPage-IIP is the first cartridge to deliver PostScriptcompatibility to the LaserJet IIP.andP;  However, for those of you who can wait,Hewlett Packard is scheduled to release a PostScript emulation cartridgedeveloped cooperatively with Adobe in January or February.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
