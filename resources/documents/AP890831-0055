(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A carpenter said he is bitter after spending18 months in jail for having oral sex with his wife and maintainedhis five-year sentence for violating Georgia's sodomy law was anunfair result of a domestic dispute.   James D. Moseley, 35, left the Metro Correctional Institution onWednesday afternoon after DeKalb County Superior Court Judge RobertCastellani granted a motion to free him on his own recognizancepending appeal or dismissal of the charges.   Sodomy, even between consenting married adults, is a felony inGeorgia under a 156-year-old law recently upheld by the U.S. SupremeCourt.   ``Sure, I'm bitter,'' Moseley said after being released.   He said faith in humankind kept his spirits up, adding, ``I knewsomeone would see this thing as it really was.''   He said he will contact the carpenters' union about a job as soonas possible.   The state, he said, gave him $25, ``I guess to start my lifeover.''   The case against Moseley began when Bette Roberts, his common-lawwife of four years, complained to authorities in February 1988 thathe had raped and forcibly sodomized her. The couple has sincedivorced.   Moseley denied ever using force to have sex, saying, ``I only didwhat she wanted me to do and then she used it against me to getcustody of the kids.'' He said he was granted no rights to visit hissons.   Moseley was acquitted of rape and forcible sodomy. But intestifying in his own defense, he admitted on the stand that he hadhad oral sex with Ms. Roberts. The jury found him guilty of sodomywithout aggravation, a lesser charge that means oral or anal sexwith consent.   Some jurors later expressed shock when Moseley was sentenced tofive years in prison. He is believed to be the first personconvicted under the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners.   Clive Stafford Smith, an attorney with the American CivilLiberties Union, argued that the Georgia law violates constitutionalrights to privacy. He accused prosecutors of hypocrisy for ignoringhis request that they disqualify themselves if they ever had engagedin oral sex.   Mary Beth Westmoreland, a senior assistant attorney generalrepresenting the state, argued that privacy was not the issuebecause the wife made the criminal complaint.   ``It's not a matter of police peeking in windows. That's not whatis before this court,'' she argued.</TEXT></DOC>
