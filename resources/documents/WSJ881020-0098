The 48-year-old Mr. Friedley, named Tektronix's president and chief executive officer only a year ago, had already received a barrage of unexpected blows from employee fraud, back taxes and write-offs, resulting in Tektronix's first annual loss in more than a decade.    But the wind shifted. Flames destroyed smaller buildings, but skirted the central facilities of Tektronix's big broadcast-equipment unit.    &quot;Maybe it's an omen that things can go right for a change,&quot; says Mr. Friedley.    They had better. Mr. Friedley's first year as chief of Tektronix, a giant maker of electronic equipment and Oregon's largest private employer, ushered in new, bolder management, but no better financial results. The company had a $16.7 million loss in fiscal 1988, ended May 28, compared with a 1987 profit of $51.2 million, or $1.33 a share. The 1988 loss was as much the responsibility of Mr. Friedley's predecessor, Earl Wantland, 57, who left last October after 13 years in the job, as it was Mr. Friedley's.    But now, such inability to grow is Mr. Friedley's responsibility alone. Tektronix's biggest problem is that its main market, served by its huge test and measurement division accounting for about 60% of the company's revenue, isn't growing much. To revive Tektronix's double-digit growth in the 1960s and 1970s, the company must expand sales of such other products as computer workstations, printers and TV-production equipment.    &quot;To get double-digit growth companywide,&quot; says Mr. Friedley, &quot;our other units are going to have to grow three times as fast as test and measurement. It takes plain aggressiveness.&quot;    Aggressiveness is why Mr. Friedley is where he is. Last year, Tektronix's board surprisingly bypassed several rumored heirs apparent to choose Mr. Friedley, then vice president of the company's obscure but highly profitable communications group. The board, with the Friedley choice, signaled that it wanted a break from the plodding, paternalistic style associated with the company's late co-founder and chairman, Howard Vollum, say Tektronix executives.    &quot;For one reason or another, Tektronix has generally been a very gentlemanly competitor,&quot; says Mr. Friedley, who recently wore army fatigues to launch a sales drive -- Operation Snakekiller. &quot;We just haven't had the fire in our belly.&quot;    Mr. Friedley struck quickly. He promoted the general managers of the company's three most successful business units to vice presidents in charge of some of its main divisions. He shunted aside their predecessors, notably demoting former Executive Vice President Willem Velsink to vice president in charge of a new unit.    The shake-up shocked the company, where for years most senior jobs were filled by lifetime loyalists who may or may not have been the most qualified. &quot;Track record is very important to Dave, which is the antithesis of how things used to be,&quot; says Lawrence Kaplan, 37, new vice president of the computer products group.    Adds Mr. Friedley: &quot;I don't particularly care for process, bureaucracy or hierarchy. I like results.&quot;    Tektronix turned a $7.4 million profit, or 26 cents a share, in its first quarter ended August 20 -- more than triple its net income of a year earlier. (Profit was enhanced significantly by the layoff of 1,000 workers, or about 6% of the work force, in March.)    But the company's $301 million of revenue in the period was basically flat compared with a year earlier -- at about its lowest quarterly sales level since 1983. Stagnation resulted from an 11% drop in revenue from the test and measurement unit, overshadowing gains at its computer-products and broadcast-gear units.    For fiscal 1989, analysts expect Tektronix to earn roughly $40 million, or $1.47 per share. Revenue is expected to grow about 3% to roughly $1.46 billion.    To boost growth, Mr. Friedley is targeting the burgeoning computer workstation market, where Tektronix already flopped once. In the early 1980s, the company introduced a machine incompatible with industry standards and without clear-cut advantages over rival computers. This time, Mr. Kaplan -- who laid off 300 engineers after taking over the unit -- is marshaling a more limited effort to sell to high-end users who need leading-edge color graphics, a Tektronix specialty.    &quot;We need to learn how to take smaller risks -- not to swing for the fence every time,&quot; says Mr. Friedley, who is also eyeing so-called vertical markets that cater to particular industries. For example, Tektronix has more than 80% of the global market for TV switching equipment, the consoles that mix images of TV shows.    &quot;Tek always was a great inventor but a poor executor,&quot; says Thomas Bruggere, chairman and chief executive of Mentor Graphics Inc. and a former Tektronix engineer. (In March, Mentor, also based here, bought a software company from Tektronix for $5 million that Tektronix paid $75 million to acquire in 1985.)    &quot;Dave brings a newness and a freshness to the company, and hopefully, a willingness to make the tough decisions to solve their problems,&quot; he adds. </TEXT></DOC>
