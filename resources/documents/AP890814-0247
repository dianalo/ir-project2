Breeden, an attorney and banking specialist, to bechairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Breeden, 39, has served in a variety of capacities under Bush,most recently as White House point man on the savings-and-loanrestructuring legislation.   The SEC post requires Senate confirmation.   Breeden would succeed David S. Ruder, who has headed theregulatory body since two months before the October 1987 stockmarket crash. Ruder announced in May that he was stepping down toaccept a position at Northwestern Law School.   Bush announced he technically would nominate Breeden to be thenumerical replacement for SEC member Charles C. Cox, whose four-yearterm had expired. However, the White House said in a statement that,upon Senate confirmation of Breeden as Cox's replacement, Bush wouldimmediately designate Breeden the new chairman.   Ruder has indicated he will resign his regular SEC seat onceBreeden was confirmed, so Bush then would have to fill that vacancy,too.   According to the White House announcement, Breeden's experiencecovers ``a wide range of securities, banking and other financialtransactions and matters, both in the United States andinternationally.''   He is a 1972 graduate of Stanford University and a 1975 graduateof the Harvard Law School. From 1981 to 1982, Breeden was anexecutive assistant to the under secretary of labor.   In advance of the formal announcement, White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater called Breeden ``an outstandingcandidate.''   Breeden helped draft the administration's initial plan forbailing out the nation's ailing savings and loan industry, submittedin February. He also represented the White House in dealings withCongress as that legislation progressed.   The final plan, a sweeping rewriting of banking laws and thelargest single-industry government bailout ever, was signed into lawby Bush last week at a Rose Garden ceremony attended by Breeden.   Breeden, whose current job as presidential assistant for issuesanalysis made him something of a White House troubleshooter, alsohelped fashion administration policy for dealing with the Alaska oilspill.   From 1982 to 1985 Breeden was deputy counsel to then-VicePresident Bush.   He was a banking specialist with a New York law firm before that,and between government assignments worked in the Washington officeof a Houston law firm.   He was also the director of a task force on deregulation headedby Bush as vice president, and wrote the panel's report on thederegulation of financial services.   The SEC is a five-member board that oversees securities markets,regulates the sale of stocks, bonds and stock options and enforcessecurities laws.   Ruder, an appointee of former President Reagan, has been chairmansince Aug. 7, 1987.   He announced last May that he wanted to return to Northwestern,where he once taught, but would stay on until a successor wasselected.   Breeden's nomination was not expected to run into anydifficulties in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
