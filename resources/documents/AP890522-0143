The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition oftheir victory in the May 7 general election, shook hands and passedout leaflets welcoming a delegation from the Organization ofAmerican States due Tuesday.   ``The OAS will not solve all our problems, but it will createthe environment. They have come to investigate,'' said presidentialcandidate Guillermo Endara. Workers greeted him at factories inPanama City with chants of ``Endara is my president!'' and``Justice! Justice!''   International observers say the opposition won the elections bya 3-1 margin. The government and its de facto ruler, Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, nullified the vote after it was apparent theircandidates were losing.   Monday was the third straight day that Endara and his two vicepresidential candidates, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford,defied the ban on demonstrations that will last until the OASdelegation files its report June 5.   The delegation is made up of the foreign ministers of Ecuador,Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, and OAS Secretary-General JoaoBaena Soares.   A pro-government party Monday criticized the OAS for adopting aresolution condemning Noriega and said its delegation could notmediate among Panamanians.   ``We call on the OAS to adopt a virile attitude towardaggression against our people by the United States,'' said astatement issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party, the largestpro-government group.   After touring factories Monday, Endara said, ``We want atransfer of power from the Defense Forces to a civiliangovernment.''   Noriega holds power because he commands the Defense Forces. Hehas been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the UnitedStates but says the charges are part of a U.S. plot to retaincontrol of the Panama Canal, due to be turned over to Panama at theend of 1999.   U.S. troops sent to augment security at U.S. canal installationscontinued exercises Monday, including special jungle training andlive firing.   On Monday the opposition candidates, pursued by a caravan ofjournalists, left party headquarters without revealing their exactdestination.   Ford said the opposition is not calling for large, announceddemonstrations in order to avoid ``butchery.''   ``We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one byone,'' Ford said after sharing a cup of coffee with a few workers.   Panama has a population of about 2.5 million.   On May 10, paramilitary Noriega supporters attacked oppositioncandidates, leaving a bodyguard dead and Endara and Ford bloodied.   Crowds were small but enthusiastic Monday. At a Panama Beerbrewery, workers came running from the far ends of the plant.   At one stop the candidates put on work gloves and gatheredaround a grinding machine that Endara, an enthusiastic campaigner,adjusted without being entirely certain of the results.   By the end of the trip to a dozen factories, including suchU.S.-associated plants as Coca-Cola, General Mills andColgate-Palmolive, Endara's collar was covered with lipstick.   Only a few police officers were visible as the caravan woundthrough a Panama City industrial park. Most officers were directingtraffic.   Since the May 10 attack the government has sharply reducedpolice presence, emboldening opponents despite a general strikethat fizzled last week.   At a Kraft cheese plant, one worker snatched a leaflet fromanother and said, ``That's not for toads to read.''   Members of the government's extensive network of informers arecalled ``toads.'' The man who had been called a toad retreated.</TEXT></DOC>
