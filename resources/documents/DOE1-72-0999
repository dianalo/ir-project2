Many-bodyenhancement was incorporated in the calculations with a self-consistent,multi-band formalism that included a local exchange-correlation potentialcorrection to the random-phase approximation. The unenhanced susceptibilitygives agreement with inelastic neutron-scattering measurements of thespin-density wave in pure chromium and its alloys, and the enhancementcalculation provides a better understanding of these materials. Enhancementfactors for the uniform (q =O) susceptibilities agree with previous variationalestimates while a pole at finite q of x(q) in chromium and fcc Mn andits absence in the other metals is explained in terms of exchange-correlationintegrals, variation of the Fermi energy and matrix element effects.While V and Mo are found to be paramagnetic, fcc Mn is predicted to beferrmagnetic and fcc Mn is predicted to be antiferromagnetic. The enhancedsusceptibility x(q) was found to provide a reliable predictor of antiferromagneticmetals just as x(O) was found to give reliable predictions for ferromagneticmetals. The alloying is modeled by rigid-band approximations. The calculateddependence of spin-density wavevectors with vanadium and manganese-impurityconcentration follows experimental variations closely.</TEXT></DOC>
