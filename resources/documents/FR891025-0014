All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-203-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthinessauthority of France, in accordance with existing provisions of a bilateralairworthiness agreement, has notified the FAA of an unsafe condition whichmay exist on Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes. The manufacturerreported that, during full-scale fatigue tests, cracks developed in thefoot run-outs of several frames between Frame 41 and Frame 54, and betweenStringer 26 and Stringer 27. These cracks originated from the radius andfitting attachment points. This condition, if not corrected, could leadto reduced structural capability of the fuselage.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-238, dated April 10,1989, which describes procedures for repetitive visual or high frequencyeddy current inspection of the frame foot run-outs between Frame 41 andFrame 54, and between Stringer 26 and Stringer 27. The DGAC has classifiedthis service bulletin as mandatory, and has issued Airworthiness Directive89-109-097(B) addressing this subject.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require repetitive visual or high frequency eddy current inspectionfor cracks in the frame foot run-outs between Frame 41 and Frame 54, andbetween Stringer 26 and Stringer 27, on the left- and right-hand sides,and repair, if necessary, in accordance with the service bulletin previouslydescribed.It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 20 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.operators is estimated to be $52,800.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
