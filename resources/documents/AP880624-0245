The 16-member drafting committee finished work without resolvingthe differences that still divide the Michael Dukakis and JesseJackson campaigns.   But the campaign staffs said they would keep negotiating throughthe night before the full 186-member Platform Committee begins workSaturday on the document, which was shaping up as the Democrats'shortest platform in half a century.   Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, heading the draftingeffort, said, ``I think we have a document that is succinct, thatis clear and a document that will be readable.'' He predicted ``thesame spirit of collegiality and cooperation'' would prevail in thePlatform Committee.   Before adjourning, the panel agreed to a motion by Dukakisrepresentative Michael Barnes to strike a vaguely worded paragraphthat said, ``We believe that executive-legislative cooperationinstead of confrontation can halt the debacle of deficit and debt... (and) more nearly match our revenue base'' with urgent nationalneeds.   Barnes said he hoped to offer more substantive language on thedeficit Saturday.   ``We're going to be working hard through the night on a numberof issues,'' Barnes told reporters, but he said it was likely someissues would not be resolved.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said, ``Whilewe haven't erased the differences ... we have come closertogether.''   Gray's panel began the day with a 3,500-word draft based onagreements reached on a host of issues two weeks ago in Michigan.It made numerous revisions, which were being incorporated in thedocument overnight.   The panel added a provision sought by Rep. Charles Rangel,D-N.Y., opposing legalization of illicit drugs.   The document also endorses giving pension funds financialincentives to invest in housing construction _ a variant of aJackson campaign proposal.   Jackson, still in the running although Dukakis is virtuallycertain to become the presidential nominee, has said previously hemay take his fight over such issues as higher taxes on the rich anda Pentagon freeze to the floor of next month's Democraticconvention in Atlanta.   But Norton said, ``There are no non-negotiable demands from theJackson campaign.''   Dukakis has not ruled out the possibility of higher taxes if heis elected, but he has refused to allow any discussion of highertaxes in the platform.   Dukakis has also rejected any mention of a Palestinian homeland.   ``The fact that we may not get the words `Palestinian state'does not mean that there are not ways to show greater recognitionof the rights of Palestinians,'' Norton said.   The full Platform Committee will try to put the document infinal form by Sunday.   The preliminary draft incorporated language on a dozen issuesthat Dukakis and Jackson representatives agreed to two weeks ago onMackinac Island, Mich.   But in every significant area of dispute, Dukakis' preferences,not Jackson's, were embodied in the preliminary draft.   Ted Sorensen, a John F. Kennedy speechwriter who penned anearlier platform ``discussion paper'' for Democratic Party chairmanPaul G. Kirk Jr., said in an interview Friday, ``I am the drafterof the present draft as well.''   ``It's fairly clear now this will be the shortest platform inover a hundred years,'' said Sorensen. ``It will be a thematic,readable platform. It will not have the traditional, negative cast.Reagan, Republican, Bush _ those words aren't even mentioned,''said Sorensen.   Sorensen apparently overstated the case. The shortest platformin recent history was Franklin D. Roosevelt's platform in 1932,which was under 2,000 words.   In contrast, the 1984 platform ran to 58 pages and more than40,000 words.   The draft is headed ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope.''It pledges party leaders and elected officials ``to restorecompetence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executivebranch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''   It calls for ``more stable defense budgets,'' appointment of adrug czar and ``maintaining the special relationship with Israel''while pursuing peace in the Middle East along the lines laid out inthe Camp David accords.   It endorses ``freedom of reproductive choice'' withoutmentioning abortion. It calls for an Equal Rights Amendment,advance notice of plant closings and voluntary national publicservice.   Kirk has instructed the platform committee and its chair,Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, to produce a short, visionarydocument, not one weighted down with special interest planks.   The preliminary draft also denounces South Africa as ``aterrorist state,'' as Jackson wanted. Although it does not mentionReagan or Bush by name, it derides ``voodoo economics'' andpromises the Democrats will ``promote peace and prevent war,'' but``not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending braveAmericans to undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... (and)not by toasting a tyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy.''</TEXT></DOC>
