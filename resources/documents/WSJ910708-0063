Some 24% of respondents to a survey conducted by theYomiuri newspaper named the U.S. as the top threat to Japan,compared with 11% in a poll taken two years ago. The SovietUnion was cited by 22% of the 3,000 respondents, as opposedto 33% two years ago.   Younger respondents were more wary of the U.S. than theirelders, with 33% of those in their 20s citing the U.S. asJapan's No. 1 threat. Some 27% in their 30s cited the U.S.,while 24% of those in their 40s and 19% of those in their 50smade the same observation.   Analysts theorized that the erosion of bilateral relationsbecause of trade frictions, and U.S. discontent with Japan'srole in the Gulf War has made the U.S. more threatening,while the end of the Cold War has diminished the danger posedby the Soviet Union.                                                                                                          DEUTSCHE BANK TRADER FIRED                                                                                                          Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank, confirmed onFriday that it dismissed options trader Manfred Mertens, whowas suspended with pay earlier in the week. The incident isrekindling calls for tighter regulations on insider trading,even though the bank says the 30-year-old Mr. Mertensviolated undisclosed &quot;internal rules not relating to tradingand sales.&quot; Mr. Mertens is one of three Deutsche Bankofficials under investigation by German federal prosecutorsfor possible tax evasion linked to alleged insider trading.Germany doesn't have a law against insider trading or anational regulatory agency to monitor markets.                                                                                                          GATT PRAISES CHILE'S POLICIES                                                                                                          Chile's market-oriented economic policy was cited in areport by the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade as a model for spurring growth and trade expansion.The report said the Chilean experience suggests that rapidtrade reforms combined with the right mix and timing ofstabilization measures &quot;are a sustainable recipe forimproving economic performance.&quot; Average annual economicgrowth of more than 6% since 1985 contributed to halvingunemployment to 6% while real wages rose to one of thehighest levels in Latin America.                                                                                                          NICARAGUA CONQUERS INFLATION                                                                                                          Nicaragua says a tough new policy has conquered inflation,which ran at more than 13,000% last year and ravaged theeconomy. The minister of the presidency, Antonio Lacayo, saidthat with an economic stabilization plan launched March 3,&quot;we have managed to escape the scourge of inflation.&quot; Thatplan sharply devalued the new gold cordoba and eliminated useof the old cordoba. Mr. Lacayo said that for the second monthin a row, Nicaragua had no inflation and, in fact, had aslight deflation of the currency.                                                                                                          CLOSER WATCH ON MONEY IN ITALY                                                                                                          Italy will restrict cash movements of more than $18,000starting today in a bid to stop crime syndicates launderingmoney through the relatively secretive banking system, theTreasury Ministry said. All transactions over that amountwill have to be made through recognized intermediaries, aministry spokesman said. But a proposal to establish a datacenter to keep track of large or suspicious cash movements isstill bogged down in parliament, where opponents say it wouldinfringe on personal liberties.                                                                                                          EC COMMISSION URGES REFORMS                                                                                                          Greece, Italy and Portugal must make major economicadjustments if they are to fully participate in the EuropeanCommunity's push for monetary union, according to the EC'sExecutive Commission. In a report prepared for EC economicand finance ministers meeting today, the Commission also saysGermany, the U.K., the Netherlands and Belgium must makeadjustments to bring their economies into line with others inthe EC. The report underlines three areas where EC nationsmust become closer: inflation, public finances and externalaccounts.                                                                                                          SOVIETS PASS INVESTMENT LAW                                                                                                          As expected, the Soviet legislature passed a law onforeign investment Friday, strengthening legal guarantees andoffering concessions in an effort to attract capital fromabroad.   The Supreme Soviet approved the law by a vote of 340-11with 11 abstentions, providing the legal groundwork forPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to revamp the economywith Western aid, investment and management know-how.   The law gives foreign investors equal legal rights withSoviet citizens and allows the creation of new businesseswith 100% foreign ownership. The legislation also will exemptenterprises with substantial foreign investments from importduties and export taxes.   In addition, Soviet businesses with a minimum of 15%foreign ownership will have the right to engage inimport-export operations without licenses, which have beentime-consuming to obtain.
