That's when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration came into being. A drumbeat of recent criticism has charged that workers' safety has been getting worse, though occupational-safety statistics of the past 15 years don't bear this out. The number of work-related injuries or illnesses has actually declined since 1972, to roughly 8 per 100 workers, from 10 per 100.    These numbers certainly don't suggest that work has become risk-free, but they hardly represent a regression. That's why it is difficult to see immediately why attacks on OSHA Administrator John Pendergrass and his agency have suddenly begun to appear. The stream of criticism is all the more puzzling in light of recent OSHA enforcement actions one might have expected to please the agency's detractors. OSHA has slapped fines of $500,000 or more on such major corporations as General Dynamics, Chrysler and IBP Inc. (a meatpacker). These actions suggest that OSHA is getting tougher, not more lenient, on health and safety violations.    We suspect the real reason for the heightened criticism of OSHA is to build support for a particularly wrong-headed piece of legislation requiring &quot;high-risk occupational disease notification.&quot; The bill, sponsored by Howard Metzenbaum, was approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee shortly before the summer recess. A similar measure was approved by the House Education and Labor Committee in May. If sponsors of the bills find convenient vehicles to attach them to, one of them just might come up for a floor vote shortly after Congress returns from recess.    Both bills would create a federal program to identify and notify workers determined to be at risk of a job-induced disease. Even if a person was &quot;at risk&quot; as far back as 30 years ago, he or she would have to be notified. Moreover, the burden of notifying the targeted population would fall to employers, which would also be required to provide testing, evaluation and medical monitoring of past and present workers who are deemed at risk.    The House bill goes further. Health centers, devoted exclusively to occupational disease, would be established around the country and federally certified. Taxpayers would absorb this cost, as well as the cost of expanded federal research into occupational diseases, and the education and training of health professionals to recognize and treat job-induced ailments.    Bills such as this are of course one reason the Constitution contains a presidential veto. Still, it's hard sometimes to figure whether members of Congress push such loopy legislation as a sop to their campaign contributors or because they are genuinely oblivious of its implications.    Creating such a vast federal involvement would severely distort employer-employee relations. It would surely raise employers' labor costs considerably by necessitating extensive record keeping, by requiring substantial outlays for medical monitoring, and by ultimately forcing employers to pay more for health, disability and workers' compensation insurance. The answer to higher employee costs is often fewer employees. The program would also set off a tidal wave of employee-damage litigation, with lawyers trolling plant parking lots for customers.    There is already a plethora of laws and rules covering occupational health and safety. Those rules require that employers inform workers of potential job-hazards, including exposure to certain chemicals and substances. When employers clearly skirt health and safety laws, then they face stiff penalties from OSHA. In especially egregious cases employees may seek redress from the courts. The risk-notification bill would only add a superfluous, costly layer of bureaucracy to a system that has slowly but steadily improved over the past 15 years. </TEXT></DOC>
