<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0485 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new technique has been developed to measure the spacing of atomic massdoublets of radioactive isotopes directly with an on-line isotope separator.It relies not on ion detection but on observation of the specific radioactivesignature of the isotopes under study. Consequently, line shapes andcentroids can be determined, free of interference and with great accuracy,even if the corresponding beams strongly overlap or if they are contaminatedby unwanted isobars or isomers. In particular, it is of no consequenceif one or both members of the doublet are masked by stable backgroundpeaks. Doublets are peak matched as in a conventional mass spectrometer.The technique has been evaluated with beams of radioactive nuclides whosemasses are known independently. Based on careful calibrations, two newmass values have been obtained: /sup 72/Br, 71936340 +- 430 {mu}u and/sup 63/Ga, 62939570 +- 150 {mu}u.</TEXT></DOC>
