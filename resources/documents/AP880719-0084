They aredivided and different, but they must fight together to defeat theRepublicans and (George) Bush for the run to the White House.''   Corriere della Sera of Milan (conservative): ``Behind Jackson'sintemperances, and behind his rhetorical speeches there was acalculation: power for himself and for the blacks that in thisconvention are represented by a fourth of the delegates.   ``Not all the blacks are supporting Jackson, but they are alllooking for the confirmation of a national political power thatthey should get through their influence, though this power does notexist yet.''   Il Messaggero of Rome:   ``Dukakis and Jackson recognized that they need reciprocalsupport, but they did not announce the stipulation of a solidagreement.   ``Dukakis does not like the Jackson-style, which fascinatescrowds and which is more similar to a demagogue than to aprofessional of politics; and Jackson does not like the coldheartedDukakis, who seems more a manager than a leader.'''</TEXT><HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD><TEXT>   The Herald (government)   ``Mr. Dukakis' problems with Rev. Jesse Jackson's camp werebeing sorted out last night. The leader of the rainbow coalitionhad every reason to feel angry with Mr. Dukakis for not personallyinforming him, in advance of the press, of his choice of LloydBentsen as running mate.   ``Mr. Jackson has a large share of democratic voters behind him,some 20 percent of them. Their voters may make or break thedemocratic candidate. However, in agreeing to make up, Mr. Jackson,shrewd as he is, is likely to exact a price from Mr. Dukakis forhis endorsement.   ``The prize could be a package part of which may have to do withpunitive sanctions against the racist South African regime. The twoDemocrats are both agreed anyway that more should be done byAmerica to bring about an end to apartheid. Their differences maybe in how to go about it. Mr. Jackson's recipes can only bedescribed as radical.   ``By the same token, Mr. Dukakis' promise not only to intiateAmerican sanctions upon his election but also to drag Mrs. MargaretThatcher into doing the same is certainly sending alarming signalsto the British conservatives.   ``Britain cannot afford to stand up to America on sanctionsagainst South Africa.   ``It is for that reason that Mrs. Thatcher should be workinghard to modify her stance on sanctions. She can be counted upon todo something dramatic to pull the carpet from under Mr. Dukakis'feet.   ``The most likely action she could take is to start a SouthAfrican initiative of her own.''</TEXT><HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD><TEXT>   French newspapers reported prominently today on the agreementbetween Dukakis and Jackson to work together in this fall's U.S.presidential campaign.   In a sidebar headlined, ``A High Mass Tailored for the SmallScreen,'' the leftist morning daily Liberation explained theextensive efforts being made to accommodate television coverage inthe scheduling of events and the color scheme of the conventionhall in Atlanta.   The newspaper's correspondent also noted the provisions made forthe press covering the events, including aspirin tablets andassurances that the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Presswould help any journalists arrested while covering demonstrations.</TEXT></DOC>
