Consumer prices rose 0.4% in July, a month in which energyprices were falling, the Labor Department said. Over thefirst seven months of the year, the department said, consumerprices have been rising at a 5.8% annual rate.</LP><TEXT>   With the inflation rate already approaching 6% this year,some analysts believe the oil-price jump in the aftermath ofIraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month could push ittoward 7%. And even if a weak economy keeps price rises moremoderate than that, 1990 now seems certain to produce thehighest inflation rate in nine years.   Also during July, housing starts fell for the sixthstraight month, dropping 2.6% to an annual rate of 1.14million, their lowest level since September 1982, during thelast recession, the Commerce Department reported.   The new reports underscore the extreme difficulty of thedilemma that will face the Federal Reserve's policy committeeat its meeting next week. The central bank is under pressurefrom the Bush administration to cushion the economy bylowering interest rates. But the new figures suggest thatwhile the economy seems weak enough to need a jump-start,inflation pressures persist even apart from the oil jolt.   &quot;They are faced with an impossible and some senseparalyzing set of factors,&quot; said Neal Soss, chief economistat First Boston Corp. in New York.   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 oil prices shot up, andeconomists and government officials worried that the shockcould plunge the already lethargic U.S. economy into arecession.   For the past five quarters the economy has grown at anannual rate of less than 2%, due largely to the FederalReserve's efforts to curb inflation by keeping interest rateshigh.   A report last week that producer prices fell in Julyhelped bolster the view that Fed policy makers would feelcomfortable allowing interest rates to fall, given evidencethat inflation, apart from energy prices, was under control.   But yesterday's consumer price report said that energyprices dropped 0.7% in July and that, excluding them,consumer prices rose 0.5%. Excluding both energy and food --which economists often do because of frequent price swings inthose categories -- consumer prices rose 0.6% last month. InJune, prices rose 0.6% excluding energy and 0.4% excludingenergy and food.   The numbers unnerved some traders in the financialmarkets, helping to push the Dow Jones Industrial Averagedown 66.83 yesterday.   Joel Popkin, an inflation expert who heads an economicforecasting firm in Washington, said the latest reading ofthe consumer price index, the most widely watched gauge ofinflation, shows that the Fed's policy of fighting inflationby keeping economic activity slow but growing hasn't worked.   But he also warned that the consequences of a recessioncould be very grave.   &quot;If we were to enter a recession right now, the economy ismore vulnerable than at any time I can remember in the 35years I've been watching the U.S. economy,&quot; he said, citingthe country's huge budget and trade deficits, the cost ofbailing out the Sandamp;L industry and the high debt levels of manyAmerican corporations.   &quot;My view is if we entered a recession, there is no basisthat economists have to predict how long or how deep thatrecession would be.&quot;   Whether the economy sinks into recession could depend notonly on the Fed but also on whether consumers and businessesreact to higher oil prices by curbing spending in otherareas.   Mr. Popkin estimates that &quot;every $1 increase in a barrelof oil drains $6.2 billion at an annual rate from thepurchasing power of people who buy energy.&quot; And, he adds,&quot;half of that leaves the country, if our oil is imported.&quot;   Though energy prices are sure to boost the next round ofinflation figures, there has been little evidence so far thatbusinesses are planning to pass increases in their energycosts through to their customers.   &quot;We are going to see large energy-price increases nextmonth,&quot; said Sally Kleinman, an economist at ManufacturersHanover Securities Corp. &quot;Then, depending how long that levelis sustained, that will start to feed through into othergoods -- plastics, all things that use petrochemicals.&quot;   Rises in the prices of tobacco and a category that mostlyincludes hotel and motel bills accounted for a considerableportion of the overall rise in the July consumer price index.Medical costs continued to soar, jumping 0.9% after a 0.7%rise in June. Entertainment costs climbed 0.6% followingJune's 0.2% rise. Food prices grew 0.4% after a 0.7% increasein June. Housing costs, a category that includes energy,maintenance and other renters' and homeowners' costs, rose0.5% on top of a 0.6% increase in June.   The Commerce Department said every region of the countrybut the West saw a decline in new housing construction inJuly. Overall, work began on single-family homes, the core ofthe housing market, at an annual rate of 873,000, down 1.4%from June. The number of building permits issued during themonth dropped 2.6%, to a 1.07 million annual rate.   In a separate report, the Labor Department said that theaverage weekly earnings of American workers grew 0.3% in Julyafter taking inflation into account. In June they rose 0.2%.   The figures in all the reports were adjusted for seasonalvariations.   ---                      CONSUMER PRICES                                                                                                          Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the com-ponents of the Labor Department's consumer price index forJuly.                                                                                                                                                    % change from                                             June     July                                             1990     1989                                                                                                          All items ...............................  0.4      4.8    Minus food andamp; energy ....................  0.6      5.0   Food and beverage .......................  0.4      5.6   Housing .................................  0.5      4.3   Apparel ................................. -0.2      5.0   Transportation ..........................  0.3      2.6   Medical care ............................  0.9      9.2   Entertainment ...........................  0.6      4.6   Other ...................................  1.1      8.1                                                                                                          July consumer price indexes (1982-1984 equals 100),unadjusted for seasonal variation, together with thepercentage increases from July 1989 were:                                                                                                          All urban consumers .................... 130.4      4.8   Urban wage earners andamp; clerical .......... 128.7      4.5   Chicago ................................ 132.0      4.4   Los Angeles ............................ 135.6      5.1   New York ............................... 138.4      6.0   Philadelphia ........................... 136.3      5.4   San Francisco .......................... 132.3      3.8   Baltimore .............................. 130.2      4.2   Boston ................................. 138.0      5.9   Cleveland .............................. 128.8      3.5   Miami .................................. 128.7      5.8   St. Louis .............................. 128.0      4.0   Washington, D.C. ....................... 135.7      6.2</TEXT></DOC>
