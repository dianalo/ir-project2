(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers union andChrysler Corp. reached a tentative settlement Wednesday on atwo-year national labor contract, following about 40 hours ofnon-stop bargaining.   ``We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve,and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today atGM and Ford,'' the union said in a statement attributed to UAWPresident Owen Bieber and Vice President Marc Stepp.   Chrysler and the UAW began negotiating April 18 on a contract toreplace a three-year pact covering 66,000 UAW workers in 15 states,which expires in September.   The proposed national labor pact _ which includes a $1,000 aworker signing bonus _ will be presented Friday to the UAW's140-member national Chrysler council for approval. It will besubmitted to the rank-and-file for a ratification vote sometimenext week.   Anthony St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer, called thetentative agreement ``affordable and equitable'' and said thesigning bonus was ``in recognition of the UAW's contribution toChrysler's productivity and profits during the past few years.''   UAW President Owen Bieber told a news conference that the $1,000signing bonus, when added to a $500 bonus Chrysler workers receivedin March, would equal the amount workers would have received inprofit-sharing payments if the profit-sharing formula in the newcontract had been in effect last year.   Negotiators adapted to Chrysler an industry-pattern contractestablished last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.   The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies tokeep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for anyreason except slow sales _ until funding for the program runs out.It also requires hiring of one worker for every two who leave thecompany.   Chrysler will fund its program with $230 million.   The pattern also provides lump sum payments of 3 percent in thenext two years and includes the profit-sharing formula that haspaid thousands of dollars to Ford workers over the past few years.   The pattern also forbids plant closings over the life of thecontract except for those closings announced before negotiationsbegan.   Unlike the GM or Ford contract, the Chrysler contract includesthe company's commitment that executives will receive neither cashnor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula producesno payout for workers.   St. John said that did not prevent executives from exercisingstock options granted in previous years.   The contract also includes the union leadership's commitment toencourage its local unions to consider accepting so-called ModernOperating Agreements _ Japanese-style agreements in which workersare organized into teams.   The new contract will expire Sept. 14, 1990, meaning Chryslerwill negotiate its next new contract at the same time as Ford andGM for the first time in a decade.   Chrysler and the UAW agreed to early talks in March in an effortto ease growing labor-management friction.   Problems stemmed partly from Chrysler's January announcementthat it would close a 5,500-worker former American Motors Corp.assembly plant _ a sudden reversal of promises that the plant wouldrun five more years _ and Chrysler's aborted attempt to sell its28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.   Chrysler backed down from the Acustar sale, but the earlynegotiations were threatened by outrage among the rank and fileover the April 19 disclosure of 1987 Chrysler executive wages,including Chairman Lee Iacocca's $17.9 million.   That was followed by confirmation a few days later of thecompany's plans to shift K-car production to Mexico from the UnitedStates in July.   Uproar over the those developments, plus Chrysler's attempts torestrict when workers could retire with full benefits, almostprompted the UAW to break off negotiations until August. Butfollowing a brief UAW boycott of the talks, the company backed offon those issues.   The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separatebut related contracts covering about 7,000 former AMC workers inWisconsin, clearing the way for settlement of the national Chryslercontract.   The Wisconsin issues had to be settled before the nationalcontract in part because the national pact will cover workers lefton the job after the Kenosha plant closes.</TEXT></DOC>
