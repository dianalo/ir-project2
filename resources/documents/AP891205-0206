Danny Wall responded with typical bravado andoptimism.   ``I will suffer the slings and arrows, but I will be damned if Iwill violate my public trust,'' the nation's top savings and loanregulator said, predicting that time would prove the wisdom of hisactions.   But Monday, even the ever-optimistic Wall conceded he had runout of time. He resigned as director of the Office of ThriftSupervision, the agency created as part of the Sandamp;L bailout packagepassed by Congress this year.   Wall, 50, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Jake Garn ofUtah, won the job as top cop of the troubled thrift industry 2{years ago because of his political skills and backing.   He blamed his downfall on politics as well, particularly thoseof the House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.   ``The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder theblame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join inthe hue and cry raised by the House Banking Committee chairman formy departure from office,'' Wall said in his resignation letter toPresident Bush.   Many had wondered why M. Danny Wall _ the M. stands for Melvin _wanted the job in the first place. It was no easy assignment,regulating 3,100 savings and loans at a time when bad investmentshad left many institutions broke and more at the brink ofinsolvency.   ``I like a challenge,'' was the stock response from Wall, abalding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a penchant forthree-piece suits.   Those who knew him said Wall sought the job because he wanted toleave the shadows of Capitol Hill for a command of his own.   ``The trouble is it's difficult to come out smelling well whenyou command a garbage scow,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vicepresident of the Independent Bankers Association of America.   Wall's career in public service dates back 27 years, to Fargo,N.D., where in 1962 he managed two Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment projects. He went on to a HUD-related post in Salt LakeCity, where he met Garn, soon to be the city's mayor.   Garn came to the Senate in 1975. Wall came with him and rose tobe his top aide. When Republicans took control of the Senate in1981, Garn became Banking Committee chairman; Wall its staffdirector. In 1982, they pushed through Congress legislationderegulating savings institutions.   When the Democrats regained control of the Senate after the 1986elections, Wall began lobbying to replace Edwin Gray as head of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, the forerunner of the Office ofThrift Supervision.   The White House was looking for someone with the politicalskills to deal with Congress as evidence of massive financialproblems in the savings and loan industry grew.   Wall, with Garn's backing, got the nomination and won easybipartisan support.   Initial reaction was favorable; Wall won plaudits for beingaccessible, a style symbolized by his decision to leave open theheavy glass door to his office.   ``If somebody wants to talk to me, I'm going to listen tothem,'' he said recently. ``You can't close your door to yourconstituents.''   But the honeymoon was short.   As the industry's problems mounted, time and time again Wall wasforced to increase his estimate of the scope of the debacle,damaging his credibility in Congress.   Critics said Wall's strengths on Capitol Hill, where compromiseis the norm, were weaknesses at the bank board.   ``You have to be a really tough person and you have to bewilling to sit down with a guy eyeball to eyeball and say, `I'mgoing to take your business away from you,''' said Bert Ely, abanking analyst who repeatedly has criticized Wall. ``I don't thinkDanny had that in him.''   Still others said his ties to the Senate left him vulnerable topolitical pressure, particularly in the case of Lincoln, whoseowner, Charles Keating, enlisted a handful of senators to help himlobby regulators.   Wall denied those allegations to the end, telling Bush that``neither political influence nor Lincoln's Charles Keatingaffected my decision on Lincoln. Nor for that matter have I evermade decisions for political reasons.''   But he said the congressional scrutiny of his actions wasdistracting his staff from their mission _ ``revitalizing thethrift industry.''   As a child, M. Danny Wall said he was raised not to run from afight. But he decided it was time to walk away, telling Bush:   ``I am not willing to stand and fight at the expense of thegoals of your administration. ... I am not going to be a party tosuch a handicap.''</TEXT></DOC>
