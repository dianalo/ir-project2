Energy market analysts said traders doubted that the 13 membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would abide bytheir promises and keep oil output to 22 million barrels a day inthe first half of next year.   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, slid 38 cents to close at $19.25 per42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts fordelivery in February through April posted similar declines.   The January crude contract ended with a 19-cent loss on Monday.   Refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc alsoended lower, in part due to the developments at OPEC's regularwinter conference. Heavy wholesale gasoline stocks in the Northeastand technical selling also weighed down gas futures.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery dropped 1.36cents to settle at 49.53 cents a gallon, adding to Monday's loss of0.74 cent. Contracts for later delivery also finished sharply lower.   No. 2 heating oil for December delivery shed 0.61 cent to 60.31cents a gallon after falling 0.49 cent in the previous session. TheJanuary through March contracts finished with larger declines.   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker at E.D.andamp;F. Man InternationalFutures Inc., said: ``I think that the market lost ground today onskepticism regarding the recently concluded OPEC agreement.''   OPEC's 13 ministers, meeting in Vienna, Austria, signed aproduction-limiting deal intended to raise the price of their crudeoil to at least $18 a barrel and curb cheating on individual outputquotas in the first half of 1990.   The ministers agreed to raise the cartel's self-imposed dailyproduction limit to 22 million barrels from the current 20.5million barrels. OPEC also changed its ``target price'' of $18 abarrel to a ``minimum reference price.''   A basket of OPEC crudes monitored by the cartel stands at $17.74a barrel.   Apart from the possibility that OPEC members, Kuwait inparticular, might overproduce, Lebow said there is speculation thecartel has been overly optimistic in its demand projections fornext year. This means that even if OPEC stays within its limits, itwould still have excess crude.   Meanwhile, he said gasoline futures prices have been depressedby industry statistics showing abundant supplies on the East Coast.Weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute, due to bereleased after the market closed, were expected to confirm anotherbuildup in gas stocks.</TEXT></DOC>
