Why would I want it to happen anyway? What are the key issuesthat will have to be addressed if it is to happen? Who will be the keyplayers that will transform this vision into a reality?andM;In this report, we will examine these questions, focusing on the major issuesthat vendors, developers, and leading-edge users are facing today.andP;  The wayin which these issues are resolved will determine whether multimedia willdeliver on its promise for the majority of us, or is it destined to be, atbest, a niche technology for education, training, and presentations, or, atworst, the hyped term of the early '90s, following the examples of AI,Top-Down Programming, or eight-track tape?andM;The Promise of MultimediaandM;We are firmly convinced that the integration of new types of informationpresentation, particularly audio and video, into our day-to-day businessactivities is likely to happen, and that, when it does, it will significantlyenhance our ability to receive, process, and act on information.andP;  We see theaddition of audio and video having much the same effect as the addition ofgraphs and charts to a 1-2-3 spreadsheet.andP;  Only more so.andM;Not only do audio and video explain certain concepts better than simple textor graphics do, but they also reach right to the gut-playing on your emotionsand allowing you to understand by &quot;experience&quot; as well as by logic.andP;  Themessage that can appeal to all of the senses, both analytical andkinesthetic, is going to be most successful.andM;We expect users to very be active in the creation of multimedia information,and we expect this information to enhance the individual's and organization'sability to deal with the necessity of obtaining and understanding informationin a timely manner.andM;A couple of examples:andM;A manager of a cereal product receives a mail message from one of his fieldsalespeople who has just spied a competitor's newly designed box on theshelves in a local supermarket.andP;  The message includes a videotape that thesalesman has made of the new box, along with his comments on how it lookswhen put high on the shelves.andP;  The video also includes a couple of quickinterviews with passing customers on their reactions to the competitor's newpackaging.andP;  The manager voice-annotates a recommendation to the companypresident, who is about to go into a board meeting.andP;  The president and theboard are able to deal quickly with the new information.andM;I am interested in a particular topic, let's say CD-ROM.andP;  I search my companyknowledge base and find a trip report made by a colleague who attended thelast CD-ROM conference.andP;  It contains a written report about the significanceof the conference, an audio summary of the report, and video footage taken ofdemonstrations of the new products introduced at the conference, any of whichI can view as I choose.andP;  (The report, in all probability, also contains theattendee's expense reports-with voice annotations, but I am not authorized toview this part.)andM;These scenarios assume certain conditions:andM;1.andP;  Almost universal ability to create and view voice and video objects.andM;2.andP;  An infrastructure to support delivery and exchange of multimedia objects.andM;3.andP;  Widespread agreement that the value gained by the ability to deal withinformation in multiple forms far outweighs the cost of implementingassumptions 1 and 2.andM;The validity of these assumptions will be determined by how we deal with thekey issues that dominate the current multimedia scene.andP;  These issues are:andM;What are the key markets for multimedia applications?andM;What are the platforms that will be targeted by multimedia developers?andM;How will interconnectivity of multimedia systems be achieved, and what willbe the prevailing standards?andM;What do we need for developer and user tools? Markets and Applications Whenwe first look at the market for multimedia applications, it is tempting tosegment its component parts into such areas as training, education, businesspresentation, productivity, and entertainment.andP;  While segmentation would notbe an outright error, it misses the larger picture, i.e., theinterrelationship of the markets.andM;We become particularly myopic if we simply make a division that says Philipsand Sony are looking at the consumer electronics market, while IBM is afterthe business market.andP;  It is clear that, given the size and potential of theconsumer market, the home is the goal of virtually all of the players, IBM,Microsoft, and Intel included.andM;A better way is to view the market as a continuum of possibilities, and thenlook at vendors' multimedia strategies and the points on the continuum thatwill give each the best foothold.andM;The largest bone of contention is whether to attack the consumer marketsooner rather than later.andP;  Philips and Sony, looking at the success of audioCDs, believe that the consumer market is ahead of the business market andwill be ripe for the picking in 1991.andP;  IBM, Microsoft, and Intel look more atthe model of the VCR, which, before coming to the home, was, for a longwhile, a shared industrial, business, and educational tool.andP;  Apple appears tobe somewhere in the middle.andM;The real division between the camps-and here Apple is clearly on the &quot;IBM etal.&quot; side-is whether the consumer market can ignore (or will completelydominate) the standards being set in business.andP;  In other words, can we havehome systems that are different from our business systems? Philips and Sonysay we can; the more traditional computer vendors hope they are wrong.andP;  Thereis one specific market that does not fit directly into this continuum: theemerging desktop video market.andP;  Here, machines such as PCs, Macs, and Amigasare playing a greater and greater role in the production of video forbroadcast or resale.andP;  We expect this market to explode in the next year orso, but to eventually blend into the continuum of business activity, much asdesktop publishing is becoming less distinct and moving back into wordprocessing.andM;THE BUSINESS MARKET.andP;  There are certain specific business applications thatwe anticipate will be early leveragers of multimedia technologies.andP;  Certainlytraining-moving over from the video disk side, and presentations-asextensions of desktop publishing, will be in the forefront.andP;  We also expectto see audio and video incorporated into current productivityapplications-word processors, spreadsheets, etc.-initially as tutorials andonline help systems.andM;From this base, we are likely to see the proliferation of multimediaannotation systems, where voice or video can be used to communicate ideaseither via electronic mail or within a shared application.andP;  We will also seethe ability to store and retrieve multiple types of media within our standarddatabases, providing in-house repositories of a wide range of information.andM;About this time, we should see more &quot;meetings&quot; taking place, either asdesktop video conferences or on a completely extemporaneous basis.andM;The last step, at least as far as our crystal ball currently shows us, is tohave the objects that we now call multimedia (i.e., animation, audio, andvideo) fully integrated into both our computer systems and the way in whichwe deal with information.andP;  At this point, we expect the term multimedia todisappear.andM;THE QUALITY DEBATE.andP;  An area of hot, and we think rather fruitless, debate isthe users' expectations in terms of quality.andP;  One side, generally coming froma professional video background, points out that people have been raised onmovies, television, and glossy magazines, and will not accept anything lessthan full-color, 30 frames per second, stereo audio and video.andP;  The otherside, generally the &quot;everyman an author&quot; camp, argues that when compared withour current text and limited graphics world, any addition of sound and video,whether of professional quality or not, will be gratefully received.andM;We find this debate rather pointless, as is the debate over whether audio orvideo is more important.andP;  It is clear that, for certain objectives,professional quality audio and video will be required and that, for others,average-user efforts will be entirely acceptable.andP;  The division should beless over philosophy than over an understanding of why a specific media formis being used and for what purpose.andP;  If a presentation is meant to convinceme to invest in a company, it should have a different quality and evoke adifferent response than if it is showing me how my colleague changed hisspreadsheet macros to more easily do the monthly reconciliation.andM;Platforms for MultimediaandM;There are three areas of discussion in the platform issue:andM;What is the base platform for multimedia?andM;How is multimedia integrated into the operating system?andM;What is the necessary infrastructure?andM;BASE PLATFORMS.andP;  In order for developers and users to plan multimediaapplications, it is important to determine the base multimedia platform totarget.andP;  The base platform question revolves around two issues: What is theminimum requirement for a system to support audio and, eventually, video, andwhat should the balance be between authoring systems and viewing systems?andM;There are a number of approaches to the base system question, ranging fromthe HeadStart low-end system (about $ 1,000), which includes a built-inCD-ROM drive, to the high-end systems envisioned by Fluent Machines.andP;  Themain debate, however, is between the Apple and IBM camps, with Apple arguingthat the standard desktop device should be equally an authoring and readingstation, and IBM looking at a more scalable approach, from minimal multimediasupport to DVI.andM;Recognizing that the debate is holding things back, Microsoft founder BillGates has been doing a lot of proselytizing, essentially supporting thescalable approach, but very specifically delineating what a minimum systemshould include.andM;Gates's base multimedia PC is defined as follows, with &quot;supported&quot; meaningnot necessary, but strongly desirable:andM;CPU              286 processor (at least 10Mhz) or betterandM;Memory           At least 2MBandM;Video            VGA (8-bit VGA supported)andM;Audio            8-bit Digital Analog Converter (DAC)andM;Multivoice synthesisandM;Redbook CD-Digital Audio (CD-DA)andM;XA ADPCM supportedandM;Analog-mixingandM;Storage          CD-ROM (one-second seek time or faster)andM;Hard disk (at least 30ME)andM;Floppy diskandM;I/O              Keyboard, mouse, MIDI, joystick supportedandM;Analog Device Control supportedandM;System           DOS, Windows, multimedia extensionsandM;According to Gates, over five million PCs exist that could be easily upgradedto this configuration for under $1,000, including the addition of a CD-ROMdrive.andM;Gates also has set out to define the future growth path for the base PC,adding higher quality images and audio by 1991/92, and full-motion digitalvideo (DVI or MPEG) by the 1992/93 time frame.andP;  This fits in with Intel'splan to have DVI chips available on the motherboard at a premium of about$500 in two to three years.andM;AUTHORING VS.andP;  READING.andP;  In order to pursue the scalable approach, theIBM/Microsoft/Intel camp has had to compromise on the authoring/readingbalance.andP;  This fits well into Intel's view that much of the multimediaresource, particularly video, will be professionally produced, but it alsomakes it easier for Apple, NeXT, and Sun to take the conceptual high ground.andM;The Amiga, of course, is the embodiment of the desktop authoring machine.andO;Though there has been little attempt to balance it with a reader station, theAmiga line provides nice scalability of authoring stations.andP;  The output fromthe Amiga is more likely to be seen on a TV or projection screen, or heard onan audio CD or tape, than to be displayed on a desktop computer.andM;INTEGRATION WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM.andP;  Everyone seems to agree thateventually multimedia support should be built into the operating system.andP;  ButApple's demonstration at the recent CD-ROM Conference of how close it is toactually integrating video into the Macintosh operating system surprised alot of people, including experts at IBM and Microsoft.andP;  These two companieswere quick to agree with Apple that this is the way multimedia should beviewed by the user-as simply another data type supported by the operatingsystem (though they did have some critical comments on the specifics ofApple's implementation).andM;Microsoft, as noted above, has announced that the next versions of Windowsand OS/2 will have extensions to support multimedia, most likely in the formof output to analog devices, such as VCRs and, perhaps, support for theCD-ROM XA interleaved audio standard.andM;Support for multimedia win go even further as IBM and Microsoft move to anobject-oriented OS/2, in which the objects (video, audio, etc.) would knowhow to display themselves, or, even better, a single object or informationsource could use a range of presentation objects to display itself to theuser in the most appropriate or specified manner.andM;The major challenge for implementing multimedia on Unix workstations is thelack of real-time features in the current standard Unix implementations.andP;  Anumber of groups are working on realtime extensions to Unix specifically fordelivering multimedia to the desktop.andM;INFRASTRUCTURE.andP;  The infrastructure issue has two parts: storage and deliveryvehicles, and integration of multimedia objects into database and objectmanagement systems.andM;Storage and delivery of multimedia objects is currently focused on opticaltechnologies: laser disks for industrial use, and CD-ROM for desktop and homeuse.andP;  The initial appeal of DVI and CD-I is the ability to get digitizedaudio and video onto the convenient format of the compact disk.andM;Ultimately, the delivery issue will move away from storage to the movement ofmultimedia objects across local and wide area networks.andP;  Here, the questionof how much bandwidth will be required predominates.andP;  While much technicalwork still has to be done, we believe the movement towards high-speednetworks and standards for video and audio compression will render much ofthis issue moot.andP;  For example, IBM is already demonstrating the ability toaccess video on a server on a 4Mbps Token-Ring network.andP;  And, according toMIT Media Lab director Nicholas Negroponte, compression algorithms, coupledwith gigabit networks, will soon let us deliver one hour of full-motion videoin five seconds, or five weeks of the Wall Street Journal in one second.andO;Burst transmission and local storage should provide at least the illusion ofreal-time to the user.andM;The Regional Bell Operating Companies  (RBOCS) are taking particular interestin how to deliver multimedia across MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks) andWANs (Wide Area Networks) and are working on a service definition which willprovide switched 45 Mbps service at an affordable price.andP;  For more on theswitched 45 Mbps service and networking multimedia in general, see theNetwork Monitor, May, 1990.)andM;Work is just beginning in the database and object management areas.andP;  Realproducts have yet to be delivered.andP;  Interconnectivity and StandardsandM;There has been a lot of debate on standards for multimedia, particularlycompressed audio and video.andP;  Getting the infrastructure to move multimediaobjects around the network in place will be of little use if the only systemthat can view a multimedia object is the one that created it.andM;Recent activity has focused on three types of compression standards formultimedia transmission and display: still images, moving images (video), andinterleaved audio.andP;  STILL IMAGES.andP;  The most progress has been made on astandard for high-resolution, color images.andP;  The International StandardsOrganization's (ISO's) Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) has issued adraft standard that has received virtually universal support.andP;  One vendor,C-Qube, has released a compression/decompression chip based on the draftstandard.andP;  JPEG and Motion Picture Experts Group  (MPEG) can be seen as theequivalent of Group V and Group VI fax, permiting the interchange ofphotographic objects as easily as we currently exchange faxes.andP;  MOVINGIMAGES.andP;  While JPEG deals strictly with the compression of single images,other standards are emerging that compress both individual images and theflow of images-in other words, video.andP;  The video standards movement has itsorigins in two distinct industries: video-conferencing and digital storage ofvideo for later playback.andP;  While the two have a lot in common (we believethat they will eventually merge), they have different requirements.andO;Video-conferencing, by its nature, requires real-time compression anddecompression, while digital storage can be done in a non-realtime mode.andM;The CCITT has taken the lead in the video-conferencing area, and a finaldraft of the Px64 standard is expected this year.andP;  Px64 allows thetransmission of real-time images to be scaled in increments of 64 kbps,depending on the available bandwidth.andP;  Most, if not all of the players in thevideo-conferencing business are migrating their products to Px64 compliance.andM;On the desktop (i.e., digital storage and exchange of video), two standardsare emerging.andP;  DVI, though proprietary, is considered the de facto standard,because it is the only one available today that permits the storage ofsignificant amounts of full-motion video on a CD-ROM (at 1.2 Mbps).andP;  Most ofthe industry, however, is looking towards ISO's MPEG to define an &quot;open&quot;standard for digital video compression (at 1.2 to 8 Mbps).andM;MPEG has wide support, including Apple, IBM, Sun, and, indeed, Intel.andP;  We areless certain about the recently announced video compression being added toCD-I.andP;  Philips has &quot;committed&quot; to MPEG, but its commitment extends only tosubmitting its implementation for MPEG's consideration.andP;  There is nocommitment from Philips to follow the final MPEG standard.andM;However, MPEG poses two distinct problems.andP;  First, the draft standard is notdue until the end of this year.andP;  For anyone who wants to be a player in themultimedia game, the better part of another year is too long to wait beforebeginning work in digital video.andP;  IBM, by pushing forward with DVI, certainlyisn't waiLing, and Sun Microsystems has given indications that it isunwilling to wait for MPEG before beginning development of digital videotechnologies for its Unix workstations.andM;This is compounded by a second problem: it is highly unlikely that MPEG willbe able to keep to its schedule.andP;  We expect the next couple of meetings tobecome explosive, with some of the basic premises of MPEG being challenged.andO;Specifically, the MPEG discussions to date have centered on an approachsimilar to Px64.andP;  Proponents of MPEG will try to build on their success topush a MPEG-based approach.andP;  Briefly put, the difference between theapproaches is that Px64, being real-time, can only compress the video bylooking at the frame itself and the previous frames, sending only the changesbetween frames.andP;  MPEG, it is argued, does not have to be real-time, and thuscan do better compression by looking at the frame itself, the precedingframes, and the following frames, thus optimizing how much of the frame hasto be stored.andM;Supporters of the Px64-type approach include ATandamp;T, Bellcore, IBM, and othercommunications and computer companies.andP;  The JPEG-like approach will probablybe supported by the consumer electronics vendors, led by Sony and JVC.andP;  It isimportant to note that these standards are aimed both at the business andconsumer markets.andP;  They will eventually be incorporated in camcorders and TVsas well as PCs.andM;However the debate is resolved, it will probably delay the draft and finalstandards, a delay that those relying on MPEG for their video strategy maynot be able to afford.andP;  AUDIO.andP;  Interleaved audio is the ability tosynchronize images and CD-quality audio.andP;  Sony, by taking the audio part ofCD-! and freeing it from the proprietary CD-I environment, has created a defacto standard that everyone loves: CD-ROM XA ADPCM (Adaptive Delta PulseCode Modulation).andP;  The strongest supporters of XA include Sony, Philips, andMicrosoft, though nearly every company interested in multimedia has hopped onthe bandwagon.andM;However, all is not as calm in audio land as it may seem.andP;  Those working onPx64 and MPEG are trying to deal with audio in their bailiwicks, thus farwith little success.andP;  It is not yet clear whether the audio situation willresolve itself or become still another battleground.andM;ANIMATION.andP;  So far, no real movement has been made towards standards foranimation formats, though, by running on its Director authoring system boththe Mac and the PC, MacroMind is putting itself in position to become a defacto standard.andM;COMPOUND DOCUMENTS.andP;  Another type of standard deals with how multimediaobjects will interact with other objects.andP;  The two leaders in definingarchitectures to support mixed data types are IBM (in MO:DCA, its MixedObject Document Content Architecture) and Digital Equipment Corporation (inCDA, its Compound Document Architecture).andP;  Each plans to include audio andvideo objects in its architecture, enabling the transmission and exchange ofcomplex, multiple-media objects across a network via the mail system.andM;Microsoft agrees that we need a way to exchange presentation objects andrevisable objects.andP;  The company plans to eventually move this capabilityright into the operating system.andP;  Developer and User Tools Perhaps the mostimportant and least understood area is developer and user tools.andP;  Thefollowing is a list of tools that Intel considers necessary for a fullmultimedia development environment:andM;Video editor                  File conversionandM;Audio editor                  Clip artandM;Graphics library              General authoringandM;Paint package                 Hypermedia authoringandM;Fonts                         Business presentation productandM;Animator package              I/O device driversandM;Database                      NetworkingandM;Intel claims that while no system currently provides all of these, the onethat can most quickly provide the whole set will become the developmentplatform of choice.andM;Currently, DVI developers may indeed have the broadest set of tools, as, byextension, do developers on the whole IBM platform from AVC through M-Motionto DVI.andP;  However, individually, the most interesting tools seem to be on theMac.andM;Three companies in particular are currently providing leading-edge multimediatools on the Mac: MacroMind-animation and multimedia presentations;Farallon-voice annotation and multimedia authoring; and Avid-desktop videoediting.andM;However, the Mac may be losing this advantage, as both MacroMind and Farallonhave recently announced their first products for the PC (though MacroMindDirector will initially run as a play-only application-having no authoringcapabilities in the first release-under Windows).andM;Other important players include Owl (which has just announced an interestingjoint-development agreement with VideoLogic) with its multimedia, hypermediaauthoring system; AutoDesk with Animator and its new thrust from CAD tosimulation; Authology, the first independent authoring system for DVI; andAuthorWare, a CBT authoring system aimed at both Macs and PCs.andM;We expect that, over the next year, the greatest innovations will come fromthe authoring systems and tools providers.andP;  These systems have just begun toscratch the surface in terms of power and ease of use.andP;  Who Is Winning? Weare not nearly ready to proclaim a winner in the multimedia wars.andP;  However,it is clear that by controlling the lion's share of the desktops, IBM (andother PC vendors) and Apple win be the platforms of choice for developmentand implementation of multimedia applications in the business environment.andM;This is not to say that there won't be some inroads made, possibly at thehigh end, by the current set of Unix workstations or Fluent Machines, or,more likely, in the specialized production environments by the high-endworkstation vendors as wen as Commodore.andP;  And we can't downplay the enormityand power of the consumer electronic market being initially attacked byPhilips and Sony.andM;What we are saying is that, for business users, the act of consuming,manipulating, and producing information is a group activity, and it must bedone within the group's standard working environment.andP;  Multimedia will notchange this.andP;  APPLE VS.andP;  IBM.andP;  The questions are: Will one of these companiesdominate in the multimedia world? Is multimedia the issue that will alter thecurrent balance (perhaps 8 to 1) of PC to Mac? Or will interoperability andadherence to standards make this a non-issue?andM;The approaches taken by IBM and Apple each has its strengths and limitations.andO;IBM can tell a good story when it comes to scalability from high-qualityimages to analog video to digital video with DVI.andP;  However, each of theserequires additions to the base system, a condition which IBM does not intendto change in the very near future.andM;Apple, on the other hand, is planning to bring many of these capabilities toits base offering, including integrating them into the operating system.andO;However, the Mac is lacking in high-end video capabilities, particularly indigital compression, storage, and retrieval.andP;  Apple's strategy of waiting forthe standards and relying on third parties may not cut it with users who arewilling to pay a premium to start experimenting with the technology today.andM;When it comes to tools, the Mac still holds a certain advantage, particularlywith audio, graphics, and animation.andP;  However, this lead is rapidlydisappearing, with new tools such as RenderMan (Pixar) and Animator(AutoDesk) appearing on the PC.andP;  In addition, Mac stalwarts-MacroMind,Farallon, Adobe-are moving their products to the PC in addition to the Mac,(though we are also seeing the reverse trend, with Pixar announcing a Macproduct).andM;Apple's greatest advantages are the common perception that the Mac is aheadin multimedia and the fact that those who would be early adopters ofmultimedia are currently Mac users, both by application  businesspresentations, etc.) and by temperament.andP;  Even though the PC may become,overall, a better platform for multimedia development and implementation,these early adopters are unlikely to move off the Mac en masse.andO;(Realistically, they are more likely to go to a NEXT or an Amiga than to aPS/2.)andM;What emerges is a world similar to today's desktop publishing: Much, but notall of the &quot;creative&quot; publishing is usually done first on the Mac bymore-or-less specialists; the day-to-day work, with authoring as necessary,will be done on the PC.andM;Conclusion: What's Wrong with This Picture?andM;The picture we have painted is rosy.andP;  We believe that, in the '90s, what wetoday call multimedia will provide one of the opportunities to help us bettercomprehend the vast amounts and complexity of the information that we mustdeal with if we are to compete.andP;  By putting information in its mostappropriate form-be it image, voice, or video-we are, in fact, greatlyincreasing the human &quot;bandwidth&quot; available to receive it.andM;However, we are concerned that the quality of the content of the informationwill not keep up with the ability to deliver it.andP;  Our early experience withdesktop publishing is not encouraging-dozens of fonts and sizes on a singlepage make for very ugly documents, defeating the original purpose ofdelivering information to the reader.andP;  Thus far, other than in the K-12arena, we have seen little in the message that is as compelling as themedium.andM;What we need are compelling examples of how multimedia enhances ourinformation flow in day-to-day use-such as the example of the cereal salesmanager's ability to better comprehend the situation and more quicklyrespond.andM;If, however, all we do is make pretty pictures, we might as well sit back andwatch reruns of &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;andM;A Prototypical Multimedia WorkstationandM;MULTIMEDIA MAY be the AI of the '90s&quot; Steve Jobs.andP;  In spite of the extremenegativity of this statement, which, for the most part, refers to video onthe desktop, multimedia is a very important part of the NEXT strategy.andP;  Withits built-in Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to handle graphics and sound,object-oriented interface, and easy-to-use user tools (including voice andmusic integration tools), the NEXT workstation is the prototypical multimediaworkstation.andM;The NEXT workstation is targeted as a delivery medium for high-endinformation workers.andP;  NEXT is very cognizant of the new types of informationand has, with the exception of full-motion video, attempted to seamlesslyincorporate, them into the base system.andP;  Thus, the standard mail systemcontains voice annotation and voice attachments.andP;  In addition, NEXT includesan end-user voice-editing tool.andM;NeXT seeks to maintain a balance, not only between authoring and reading-itfalls squarely into the &quot;everyman an authoe' camp-but also between glitzytechnologies and the environment and tools provided.andP;  Thus the skepticismabout video, since it is not yet close to being an everyman technology.andP;  Ifand when it becomes so, the object-oriented nature of the product shouldallow it to be easily incorporated.andM;Sun: Multimedia and Workgroup ComputingandM;THERE ARE two themes to Sun Microsystems' approach to multimedia: distributednetwork computing and graphics workstations.andP;  These come together in Sun'sview that information in multiple media types is essential for thedevelopment of the workgroup computing environment of the 1990s.andM;Sun's initial target is the business office, specifically leveraging speech,telephony, fax, and scanner technologies in distributed applications.andP;  Thecompany sees high-end audio and analog and digital video being further out,and feels that these technologies will come first to the education andtraining arenas.andM;By the mid-1990s, however, Sun expects real-time digital video to beavailable across the local and wide area networks, For WANS, Sun isparticularly interested in ISDN.andM;Sun generally considers itself a platform company and intends to leave muchof the multimedia development to third parties.andP;  Currently, analog video isavailable on Sun workstations through companies such as RasterOps andParallax Graphics.andP;  Sun itself does not rule out the possibility ofeventually providing certain sets of multimedia tools for developers andusers to make the best use of the technologies on its platform.andM;Sun is also working, along with the David Samoff Research Center and TexasInstruments, on a U.S.andP;  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA)-funded program to develop high-definition display workstations.andP;  Sucha workstation would have nearly double the resolution of today's displays,enabling multiple text, video, image, and graphics windows to be easilyviewed on a standard-size screen.andM;Overall, Sun does not consider multimedia as a separate area of endeavor.andO;Rather, the company sees that the new types of media must be integrated intotoday's tasks and facilities, and they must be able to be mixed and matchedin a heterogeneous network.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
