<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0037 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes two tasks of different nature. The first of thesetasks was the preparation of a data base for heat flow and associatedancillary information for the United States. This data base is beingused as the basis for preparation of the United States portion of a geothermalmap of North America. The ``Geothermal Map of North America'' will bepublished as part of the Decade of North American Geology (DNAG) seriesof the Geological Society of America. The second of these tasks was tomake a geothermal evaluation of holes drilled in the Cascade Range aspart of a Department of Energy (DOE)/Industry co-sponsored deep drillingproject. This second task involved field work, making temperature logsin the holes, and laboratory work, measuring thermal conductivity measurementson an extensive set of samples from these holes. The culmination of thistask was an interpretation of heat flow values in terms of the regionalthermal conditions; implications for geothermal systems in the CascadeRange; evaluation of the effect of groundwater flow on the depths thatneed to be drilled for successful measurements in the Cascade Range;and investigation of the nature of the surface groundwater effects onthe temperature-depth curves. 40 refs., 7 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
