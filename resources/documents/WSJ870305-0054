The split requires shareholder approval at the annual meeting May 6 of an increase in authorized shares to 150 million from 60 million. There are currently 26.7 million shares outstanding.    A spokesman said the company hopes the split will &quot;make the stock more attractive to the individual investor and bring about a broader base of stock ownership.&quot;    William R. Laidig, chairman of the forest products concern, said that if the split is approved, he will recommend increasing the dividend to 23 cents a share on the split stock, the equivalent of 46 cents on the current stock. The company previously paid 43 cents quarterly. Nekoosa last split its stock, 3 for 2, in December 1983.    Nekoosa common closed at $87 a share, up $2.75, in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
