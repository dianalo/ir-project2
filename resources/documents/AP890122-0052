The red wolf, smaller and more elusive than its gray cousin, onceroamed the bottomlands of the South from the Carolinas to Texas.About 100 survive in captivity; the last few wild, purebred redwolves were captured by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in thelate 1970s for captive breeding at the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma,Wash.   A few days ago, a pair was released at Horn Island, a wildernessarea off the coast of Mississippi. The male was from Audubon and thefemale of the pair was raised at Point Defiance.   Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves raised at Tacoma havebeen released in the Alligator River Refuge in coastal NorthCarolina. At least two cubs were spotted last summer.   A second group of red wolves was reintroduced to the wild onBulls Island, S.C., officials said.   In addition to wolves raised at Tacoma, the Audubon Zoo has addednine pups to the population and a female and four cubs were sent tothe Tacoma program over the weekend.   Wildlife officials hope the pair on Horn Island _ now becomingacclimated in a sprawling penned area _ will breed in February orearly March and produce a litter in April.   ``The hope is to release them and let them raise the pups as freefrom human contact as possible,'' Lewis Greene, the Audubon Zoo'sassistant curator of the red wolf exhibit said. ``Our wolves haveretained some hunting instincts, they'll go after squirrels or birdsthat go in their pen, but for the wolves to live in the wild theyhave to be total hunters.''   Horn Island was selected as the breeding site because it providesplenty of prey.   ``It's wonderful to have them in exhibits but to maintain thespecies the way it should be there has to be natural selection. Theyhave to live in the wild,'' Robinette said.</TEXT></DOC>
