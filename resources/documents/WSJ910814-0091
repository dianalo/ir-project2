But Londonequities rose to finish at intraday peaks, and Frankfurtshares rallied to their highest close since July 12.   In Tokyo, stock prices gave up midday gains as themarket's wait-and-see mood deepened on news of yet anotherfinancial fraud, this time involving Toyo Shinkin Bank, atiny credit union based in Osaka. The Nikkei 225-stock index,which skidded 448.95 points Monday, fell 113.67 to 22872.00.</LP><TEXT>   In trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei rose 238.21points to close the morning session at 23110.21.   In Tuesday's session, the Tokyo Stock Price Index, orTopix, of all first section issues, which lost 28.64 pointsMonday, was down 9.32 at 1766.85. First section volume wasestimated at 180 million shares, compared with 187.6 millionshares a day earlier. Decliners outnumbered gainers, 680200.   Expectations for the Tokyo market to rise were shatteredon the disclosure by financial authorities that a formerbranch manager of Toyo Shinkin and an alleged accomplice hadbeen arrested Tuesday in connection with a 342 billion-yen($2.6 billion) bogus loan scheme, which could be the biggestinstance of loan fraud in Japan's history. The news added toJapan's string of financial frauds, includingloss-compensation scandals by brokerage houses, as well asbanking forgeries similar to that reported at Toyo Shinkin.   London's climb was driven by robust advances for some bluechips and by Wall Street's strong early showing. TheFinancial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 15.5points to 2584.9, the day's best level. The FT 30-stock indexgained 14.8 points to 2022.3. Volume was 474.4 millionshares, compared with 280.7 million shares a day earlier.   In Frankfurt, stocks closed at or near their highs. TheDAX index gained 18.66 points, or 1.1%, to 1644.72, just shyof the intraday peak of 1645.48, as turnover pulled out ofthe doldrums. Surprisingly, the gains were fueled byexpectations that the German Bundesbank will raise itsbenchmark lending rates tomorrow, an action that normallywould depress stock prices. But two months of speculationabout interest rates haven't managed to push the DAX underthe 1600-point support level, so dealers have concludedstocks probably will climb after the central bank's decisionon rates is announced. Investors also were encouraged that arate boost could be the last one for a long time. Foreignerswere active buyers in Tuesday's rally.   The London and Frankfurt gains buoyed other big Europeanbourses, which either registered gains or closed mixed aheadof a Thursday holiday for several markets. Paris stocks werepushed up by German stock values and encouraging U.S.economic data, and posted the biggest volume in weeks as theFrench index topped the 1800 level for the first time sinceJune 21. Among the big Asian markets, trading overall wascautious and moderate, and only Seoul logged a rise, albeitnarrow as losers outnumbered gainers, following two sessionsof sharp declines.   Among corporate developments, in London, Hanson rose 1.50pence to 217.50 pence ($3.69). The industrial conglomerate isexpected to show steady earnings when it reports today itsresults for the third quarter ended June 30. Market forecastsof pretax profit range from #340 million to #380 million($577.5 million to $645.4 million), compared with #369million a year earlier.   General Accident Fire andamp; Life Assurance added 4 to 555. TheScottish composite insurer's first-half pretax loss widenedto #101.5 million from #66.6 million a year earlier. Thelatest deficit was slightly bigger than some London analystshad expected but within the range of expectations. GeneralAccident cited an increase in underwriting losses. But thecompany plans to maintain its interim dividend at 9.7 pence ashare. And the stock rose on General Accident's statementthat previous action to restrain costs and increase rates isbeginning to prove effective.   Sears fell 1.50 to 79.50. The retailing group, which isn'trelated to a similarly named U.S. company, said it sold itsunprofitable Horne Brothers menswear retail business for anominal sum to a company that included the unit's management.The move marks a further step in Sears's program to improveits competitive position, which has included withdrawing fromhome building and jewelry activities. Losses on the sale ofHorne, with 45 outlets, and on the closure of some of thosebranches that aren't included in the deal total about #19million, which will be written off as an exceptional item.   In Frankfurt, Karstadt jumped 10 marks, or 1.7%, to 601marks ($348.52). The big retailer's first-half sales rose 18%to about 8.4 billion marks ($4.87 billion). It didn't specifyprofit, but it did project a slowing economic environment inthe second half.   In Sydney, News Corp. dropped 16 Australian cents, or1.7%, to 9.20 Australian dollars (US$7.21). The AustralianStock Exchange made an official inquiry into the rapid pricerise in the shares of Rupert Murdoch's media company toA$9.36 on Monday from A$8.14 on Aug. 6. A News Corp. officialsaid the company doesn't know why the increase has occurred.Brokers said the stock, which traded at A$5.10 at the startof the year and which has risen from a 1991 low of A$3.19,gained recently on strong buying support from U.S. investorsand on the belief News Corp.'s debt-reduction program issucceeding.   Petersville Sleigh added 1 cent to A$1.14, and PacificDunlop eased 4 cents to A$5.06. The three independentdirectors of Petersville, a food and forestry concern,advised shareholders to reject a takeover offer of A$1.15 ashare, or A$374 million, by Pacific Dunlop. The remainingfour Petersville directors, who are associated with AdelaideSteamship, which controls 62.9% of the food company, haven'tmade a recommendation. Schroders Australia Ltd., aninvestment bank that is advising Petersville, said the offeris insufficient.   In Amsterdam, Fokker closed at 34.40 guilders ($17.69), up0.30 guilder. The aerospace group's first-half profit edgedup 0.7% to 42.2 million guilders ($21.7 million).   In Zurich, Adia fell 6 Swiss francs to 869 francs($576.06). The services concern's first-half consolidatedgroup revenue declined 7.8% to 1.91 billion francs ($1.26billion). Adia, following the practice of most Swiss firms,didn't disclose profit. It attributed the revenue declinepartly to the recession in markets where Adia offers itsservices, as well as to negative foreign exchange-ratefactors and divestitures.
