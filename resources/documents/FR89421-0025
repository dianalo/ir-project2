OSHA received two requests for an informal publichearing_one on behalf of Texstar Construction Corporation and ContinentalLift Slab Corporation (Ex. 38-15) and the other from Mr. Mario Suarez ofSchupack Suarez Engineers, Inc. (Ex. 38-21). OSHA observes that Mr. MarioSuzrez is also listed as one of the witnesses to be presented by Texstar/Continental.Accordingly, pursuant to section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act, OSHA has scheduledan informal public hearing to begin on June 29, 1989, to receive testimonyand other information pertinent to the issues raised in the hearing requestsand at OSHA's initiative.Texstar Construction Corporation and Continental Lift Slab Construction(Ex. 38-15) in their hearing request noted their objections to five provisionson which they requested a hearing. Those provisions include the following:(1) <T3>Section 1926.705(a) </T3>which requires lift-slab operations to bedesigned and planned by a qualified lift-slab designer and which requiresthe employer to implement the plans and designs.Texstar/Continental believes that the provision should be modified to requirelift-slab details to be reviewed and approved by the architect/engineerof record and incorporated into the structural drawings and that the drawingsshall include details of erection and instruction regarding the prescribedlifting sequence. Texstar/Continental stated that their revised languagewill insure an adequate check and balance system between the contractor/employerand the design architect/engineer so as to insure a safe workplace forthe employee.(2) <T3>Section 1926.705(d) </T3>which prohibits overloading jacking equipmentand which requires that threaded rods and other members which transmitloads to the jacks be capable of supporting at least two and one-half timesthe load to be applied.Texstar/Continental object to ``The unwarranted inclusion of shearheads,columns and footings in the 2.5 safety factor for the lifting equipment.''They also requested a clarification of some of the lifting components identifiedby OSHA and requested that the term ``lifting angle'' be changed to ``liftingattachment.''(3) <T3>Section 1926.705(j) </T3>which limits the number of manually conrolledjacks on one slab to a number that will permit the operator to maintainthe slab level within specified tolerances.Texstar/Continental suggests the provision be revised to read: ``The maximumnumber of manually controlled jacks on one slab shall be limited to 14jacks per console. If more than 14 jacks are used they should be dividedas equally as possible among the two consoles. The consoles shall be attendedby competent operators experience in this type of operation.'' Texstar/Continentalnoted that is was their opinion that it is necessary to limit the numberof jacks to insure proper monitoring of the lifting rate and that ``Exceedingthe maximum of 14 jacks per console limits the ability of the operatorsto visually and physically control the console and the lifting process.''(4) <T3>Section 1926.705(k) </T3>which prohibits nonessential employees frombeing in buildings while jacking operations are in progress. Jacking operationsbegin when a slab or group of slabs is lifted and ends when such slabsare secured.Texstar/Continental suggests the provision be amended to allow work totake place under slabs that have been secured even though jacking operationsare in progress elsewhere in the structure. Specifically, they suggestedthe provision read as follows: ``No work or personnel shall be permitted<T3>directly underneath </T3>[emphasis added] a slab during the time itis being lifted except for the placing of temporary or permanent connections.''They also listed three tasks to be performed by essential personnel <T3>while the slab is being lifted. </T3>Texstar/Continental noted thatprior to the L'Ambiance collapse, it was industry practice in the U.S.to work under slabs that had been secured even though other slabs werebeing lifted. They also noted that the economics of not allowing workersin the building during lifting would eliminate lift slab as a viable competitivesystem.(5) <T3>Section 1926.705(l) </T3>requires that when making temporary connectionsto support slabs, wedges shall be secured by tack welding or an equivalentmethod of securing <T3>before </T3>the load is released from the lifting unit.Texstar/Continental suggested the provision be changed to require tackwelding <T3>after </T3>the load has been released from the lifting unit. Texstar/Continentalnoted that tack welding must be done after the load is released onto thewedges to insure the tack weld will not break due to the application ofthe load onto the wedge and to provide proper seating of the bearing surface.Schupack Suarez Engineers, Inc. did not identify the provisions to whichthey objected.In addition to the concerns raised above, OSHA solicits testimony, withsupporting information, on the issues presented below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;1: Post-tensioning of Slabs</ITAG>OSHA received a comment from a professional engineer, (Ex. 38-13A), whocommented, ``When constructing with the ``lift-slab'' method, the primarymethod of reinforcing concrete slabs <T3>shall not be</T3> by the use of <T3>un-bonded</T3> post-tensioning elements.'' The commenter suggestedthat OSHA Include the following provision in the final rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">If a <T3>bonded</T3> post-tensioning process is used, the post-tensioned elementsshall all be fully bonded within the concrete slabs prior to lifting.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits information and evidence relative to the language proposedby the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;2: Economic Effect</ITAG>OSHA Has received comments from Texstar/Continental, the Associated GeneralContractors, and others that indicate a potential severe economic impacton at least one firm of the three firms engaged in lift-slab constructionas a result of the proposed regulations. In order to make a determinationon this question, more information is needed on the cost differential betweenlift-slab construction and the degree to which this would shift under theproposed regulations. OSHA also requests additional data showing the comparativeaccident and injury rates for the same groups of workers for lift slaband other construction methods.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>Notice of Intention to AppearPersons desiring to participate at the hearing must submit a notice ofintention to appear, postmarked no later than May 22, 1989.
