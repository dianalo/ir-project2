The World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group and China's mainforeign partner in panda research, recently turned to the U.S.courts to determine if Chinese panda loans to American zoos areexploitative, as it says, or educational, as China says.   Some Chinese and Western experts say China should do more tobreed captive pandas, while others say the only solution is to movehumans from panda reserves.   Even the size of the panda population is under debate. The WorldWildlife Fund is preparing to release survey results that put thenumber of pandas in the wild at 1,100 to 1,500, startlingly higherthan previous estimates.   A 1977 Chinese survey put the figure at 1,000, and thepopulation is known to have dropped since then due to poaching anda shortage of the panda's favorite food, bamboo.   Ken Johnson, a University of Tennessee zoologist who led thesurvey, says the earlier count was sloppy and too conservative.   But Zhou Shoude, the deputy director of China's largest pandareserve, the 800-square-mile Wolong Nature Reserve near Chengdu inSouthwestern China, discounted Johnson's figures, which were basedlargely on a count of panda nesting areas and droppings.   The experts agree, however, that the panda is steadilydecreasing in number and that five years after an internationalalert went out to save it, the outlook is grim.   ``There are more pandas than we expected,'' Johnson says, ``butthey are more critically endangered than we expected.''   Pandas, black-and-white bear-like animals that some say arerelated to the bear and some say to the raccoon, are native only toChina. Experts believe their ancestors lived 20 million years ago,contemporaries of the mastodon and other extinct species.   A few hundred years ago, pandas still roamed the lowlands. Buthumans gradually pushed them into the mountains of western China'sSichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, the only places they now livein the wild.   World attention was drawn to their plight in 1983 when theirdietary staple, arrow bamboo, flowered and died as it does every 40or more years. The World Wildlife Fund collected more than $4.1million toward saving the animal, and the Chinese government andcitizens contributed millions more.   More than 62 animals starved before the bamboo began growingagain a few years later.   That crisis over, experts are looking more critically at China'sconservation program. They acknowledge China's limited resources,praise its good intentions and press for more action _ withoutagreeing on the best course.   ``Except for the pandas, there's not a lot that's black andwhite about it,'' Ken Cook, a spokesman for the World WildlifeFund, said in a telephone interview from Washington.   China is dealing sternly with one obvious problem _ poaching.Its highest court last year ordered panda killers be given longprison terms or even the death sentence.   China has been less decisive, however, in dealing with anotherhuman problem _ ordinary peasants. Their encroachment on the rareanimal's turf, including inside China's 12 panda reserves, advancessteadily.   More than 4,000 peasants live in Wolong, which became a showcasefor panda conservation in 1980 when the World Wildlife Fund helpedbuild a breeding center there. The peasants' terraced corn andpotato crops climb high up the slopes of mountains roamed by pandas.   Johnson believes the peasants must be moved _ if not fromWolong, then from other reserves.   ``They've already destroyed Wolong, essentially,'' he says.Human settlements have marooned the pandas in small groups onmountain tops, preventing them from mingling in the mating seasonand creating the danger of localized inbreeding, he says.   Johnson's solution is to move humans from critical areas andplant corridors of trees and bamboo between panda habitats so theycan roam freely and mate naturally _ something he said pandas haveno trouble doing in the wild.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
