The meritsof the various methods for determining caloric availability were reviewed.Balance and growth curve methods are inaccurate and inappropriate fordetermination of the caloric availability of these substances when presentin diets at low concentrations, whereas the radiolabel disposition methodis a direct and precise measure of utilization. Accordingly, the authorsadministered uniformly {sup 14}C-labeled material to rats and collectedexcreta and expired air. The appearance of about half of the label inCO{sub 2} indicated that, by comparison with labeled glucose, about 80%of the orally administered sorbitol and isomalt was calorically availableto the rat. The high caloric availabilities of these materials were confirmedby the appearance in feces of only 14 and 12% of the administered labelfrom sorbitol and isomalt, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
