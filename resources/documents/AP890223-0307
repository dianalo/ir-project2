LANE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government witness list has 500 names.A moving van had to be hired to carry the 4,000 documents to beentered as evidence.   One of the most far-reaching thrift fraud cases went to trialthis past week in a Texas federal court, where attorneys beganpresenting their accounts of flamboyant developer D.L. ``Danny''Faulkner and six other defendants accused of bilking Sandamp;Ls byinflating the values of a condominium empire.   If convicted, the defendants face a total of 1,696 years inprison and fines of almost $1.5 million.   It's a case that has resulted in dozens of indictments in relatedscams and reflects what many thrift experts call the financialtreachery partly responsible for the Sandamp;L crisis nationwide.   Five government attorneys, six FBI agents and severalsecretaries, along with the defendants and their 12 attorneys, havebivouacked in Lubbock for the fraud, conspiracy and racketeeringtrial, expected to last six months.   As presented by prosecutors during opening statements, Faulknerand his codefendants saw their condo kingdom crumble with thecollapse of the Empire Savings and Loan Association, plundered bythem to finance swank lifestyles that included Rolls-Royces,designer wardrobes and posh parties.   They're accused of conspiring to reap profits from an estimated$500 million in loans, primarily for condo developments alongInterstate 30 in the Dallas suburb of Garland. The case has becomeknown as the I-30 Condo trial.   The 85-page, 88-count indictment issued by a federal grand juryin October 1987 said Faulkner and codefendants ``recruited andcorruptly rewarded'' heads of lending institutions and real estateappraisers for their participation.   According to the indictment, the scheme worked like this: Tractsof land along I-30, used as collateral for the loans, were inflatedin value through a series of sales known as ``land flips.'' Oneparcel of land was sold among Faulkner and codefendants as many assix times a day. Each time its value was inflated, sometimes as muchas fourfold.   Then the land was sold in smaller sections to a pre-arrangedbuyer. The buyer was paid money up front to sign for a loan that hadalready been arranged by the defendants.   The alleged conspirators got rich illegally, prosecutors say,from the loan proceeds and from the profits they made selling wildlyinflated property to unsuspecting buyers.   The indictment describes one land deal where an 82-acre tract waspurchased for 52 cents per square foot by Empire's real estatesubsidiary. When an 18.6-acre tract eventually was sold to a groupof borrowers, the land was assigned values ranging from $8.50-$12per square foot.   Faulkner's attorney contends her client was no more than a landsalesman.   ``Quite simply, Danny Faulkner was the individual who begancondominium development out in Garland and sold the land to otherdevelopers,'' said attorney Cheryl Wattley. ``That was it.''   Numerous participants in I-30 land deals are expected to testifyin exchange for lighter sentences.   While the government touts its paper trail, Ms. Wattley said thatwon't corroborate the testimony of people ``who have essentiallysold their souls to the government in order to try to get lightersentences and compensate for what they have done.''   Faulkner, 55, is the former owner of a paint contracting company.He began developing condos along I-30 and investing in savings andloan associations in the late 1970s.   In 1979 he was part of a group that bought Empire. Prosecutorsallege he pocketed at least $40 million in loan proceeds, which heused to bankroll a life of luxury. He owned a Bell Jet Rangerhelicopter and a box at Texas Stadium, but also was known as amagnanimous giver.   ``God has blessed me and I like helping people,'' he once said.``Money isn't important. People are important.''   The criminal trial was assigned to U.S. District Judge SamCummings in Lubbock after the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals orderedJudge Joe Fish in Dallas to step down. Fish was related to someonemarginally involved in the case. The defense previously had askedfor a change of location for the trial.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Feb. 26</NOTE></DOC>
