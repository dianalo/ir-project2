Michael Dukakis capturedthe top delegate state in the Super Tuesday presidential primaries,while Vice President George Bush shut out Republican rivals to graball 111 Texas GOP delegates.   ``It has exceeded my fondest expectations,'' Bush told severalhundred supporters crowding a ballroom at at Houston hotel soonafter polls closed on Super Tuesday.   With 6,079 of 6,933 precincts or 88 percent reporting, Dukakishad 497,592 votes or 33 percent; Jesse Jackson had 364,242 votes or24 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 313,026 votes or 20percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 212,972 votes or 14percent; former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 77,184 votes or 5percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 29,038 votes or 2 percent.   In the Republican race, with 4,687 of 5,616 precincts or 83percent reporting, Bush had 542,206 votes or 65 percent; PatRobertson had 125,164 votes or 15 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had115,119 votes or 14 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 40,468votes or 5 percent.

Lloyd Bentsen easily wonrenomination in his bid for a fourth term. Top Republicanchallengers Beau Boulter, who gave up his congressional seat forthe Senate race, and Wes Gilbreath, a Houston investor making hisfirst race for a political office, will meet in a runoff. Thewinner squares off against Bentsen in November.   Dukakis, in a televised interview Tuesday from Chicago, said,``I feel very good about the South. I feel good about tonight,obviously.''   Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, rents a motel inHouston so he can vote in the state. He led in polls throughout thecampaign.   At the victory party Tuesday night, Tom Loeffler, the formerTexas congressman who is co-chairman of Bush's Texas campaign, gavethe vice president a T-shirt emblazoned with ``Bush in '88 _ TexasVictory _ Super Tuesday,'' while the crowd cheered and waved U.S.flags.   ``It's a wonderful evening, I'll tell you,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
