The department, acting on a petition from Lasko MetalProducts Inc., will try to determine whether the Chinesecompanies shipping these fans are unfairly subsidized throughreduced taxes and fees, priority access to bank credits andutility services, and favorable exchange rates.</LP><TEXT>   It will be the first such investigation the department hasinitiated since 1986, when the federal appeals court upheldan earlier ruling that such investigations are meaningless in&quot;non-market economies&quot; where state subsidies can't be easilyidentified or estimated. By launching its investigation, thedepartment signaled its recognition of China as a country intransition to a more open economy and thus subject toaccountability for unfair subsidies.   The department's action reflects the Bush administration'sgrowing sensitivity to the potential damage that trade fromnon-market economies could wreak on certain U.S. industries.If the commerce department rules in favor of the petitioner,the department would be required to impose countervailingduties against the products involved.   Separately, the International Trade Commission reportedthat the U.S. trade deficit with China grew to $4.6 billionin the first six months of 1991 from $4 billion in the sameperiod last year.   The electric-fan case could encourage other U.S.manufacturers to file similar complaints. Robert Hume, thelawyer for a Los Angeles auto accessory manufacturer, saidhis client plans to petition the department, charging thatcompeting Chinese imports are unfairly aided by subsidizedChinese steel and chemical raw materials.   The likeliest targets for further investigations areexport-oriented factories and special economic zones inChina's southern provinces. The Chinese producers beinginvestigated in the fan case are located in that region. Thedepartment said it is considering the petitioner's claimsthat six of the 14 known fan producers are wholly or partlyowned by non-Chinese parties.   Current trade laws free Lasko, a West Chester, Pa.,manufacturer, from having to prove to the International TradeCommission that it is injured by these imports. China isn't asignatory to an international subsidies code and, thus, isn'tentitled to such an injury test, the department said.   Mr. Hume said that the injury-test waiver is a boon forpetitioners because it can &quot;cut their costs by half.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
