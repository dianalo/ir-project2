Whoever wins, it'll be the first steptoward introducing such heretofore alien free-market conceptsas efficiency to the command-and-control world ofenvironmentalism.   The Chicago Board of Trade was the first to propose such atrading vehicle, which the New York Mercantile Exchange alsowants to pursue. This is such a good idea that it mightrescue the Clean Air Act from the ignominy it has sodeservedly received.</LP><TEXT>   The Chicago exchange also offers what it calls Clean AirAllowance Futures, but this seems destined to be called SmogFutures by the folks in the trading pit. The contract unit oftrading is defined as &quot;25 one-ton sulfur dioxide emissionallowances.&quot; If this sounds like something out ofFutureworld, we guess maybe it is.   These allowances, which were established in last year'sversion of the Clean Air Act, would be an importantapplication of the ideas of Ronald Coase, the University ofChicago law professor who won this year's Nobel Prize ineconomics for his work on the importance of establishingclear property rights.   The EPA and more moderate groups such as the EnvironmentalDefense Fund calculated that clean-air rules are all aboutwhat economists call externalities, with one person'spollution causing problems for others. It would be fairer ifwe could force polluters to pay the full costs of theirpollution, and in a way that would also result in lesspollution.   Starting in 1995, there will be allowances for how muchsulfur individual electric-power plants can emit. Theseplants can then decide how they will meet the increasinglytough pollution standards. Some plants will decide to investin cleaner equipment. This will entitle them to sell theirextra pollution allowances to plants whose costs of complyingwith the new directives are higher than the market cost ofbuying the necessary allowances.   The Cantor Fitzgerald brokerage firm has offered to runthe auctions for pollution permits. This should avoid theabsurd situation, common to many environmental programs, thatcrudely mandates enormous expenditures and produces minimalimprovements. Superfund and asbestos cleanups are primeexamples.   The futures market in pollution permits will be open toall -- not just to the utilities themselves but also to whatwe'll call pollution arbitragers. If a dirt arb thinks thecost of complying with environmental regulations will go up(depending, perhaps, on whether the regulate-'til-they-screamfaction prevails at EPA), he'll buy more permits now to selllater. All this activity would hasten new information intothe market, create more accurate pricing signals and helputilities decide how and when to reduce their sulfuremissions.   There is a rub, though. Sulfur emissions are involved withwhat is called acid rain. What we don't know about thisphenomenon would fill the deepest acidic lake. Themuch-ignored but definitive study by the National AcidPrecipitation Assessment Program, known as NAPAP, found noconclusive reason to spend the $4 billion-plus it will costto reduce these emissions. The country's artificiallyacidified lakes, for example, could be limed at a fraction ofthe cost of adding scrubbers or closing down older plants.   But the smog trading system isn't designed to set morerealistic goals for anti-pollution investments. This taskremains with the politicians. Still, it must be counted asprogress if we are moving the system toward an efficientmethod for complying with even the least efficient laws.   Environmentalists have had a long run with ananti-rational philosophy that says, whatever it costs, it'sworth it. But in fact, the real costs often remain hiddenfrom the public that pays them. This makes it hard, sometimesimpossible, to have any kind of national debate on how muchwe're willing to pay for how much clean air or water.   The best news about the introduction of a market forrights to avoid compliance is that the public will finallyget a precise measure of the cost of environmental rules.Once that is known, voters can decide if the price is worththe result, or if the law should be changed to comply withwhat the public is willing to pay.</TEXT></DOC>
