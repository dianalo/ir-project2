WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The NATO dispute over deployment ofshort-range missiles has widened a split within the government, anewspaper reported Tuesday.   Transport Minister Friedrich Zimmermann was quoted by the Bildam Sonntag newspaper as accusing Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher of covering up his true disarmament aims.   ``If you look Genscher in the eyes, you know that he is lying,''the newspaper quoted Zimmermann of the Conservative Socialist Unionas saying during a May 8 meeting of his party leadership.   Zimmermann on Tuesday denied the report, but Bild am Sonntageditor Michael Spreng immediately issued a statement saying thenewspaper stood by its article and that it was based on first-handreports.   West Germany's wavering on the issue has triggered a crisiswithin the Bonn leadership as well as within NATO. Kohl's coalitiongovernment is composed of three divergent parties _ his ownChristian Democratic Union, the conservative Christian SocialistUnion of Bavaria and the liberal Free Democratic Party.   Genscher has been at the forefront of West German resistance toNATO's plan to upgrade short-range missiles deployed in WestGermany, urging the superpowers to try to negotiate down theirweapons stockpiles.   He has denied he wants the complete elimination of short-rangerockets. But he is a member of the liberal Free Democratic Partyand a vocal supporter of improving relations with Eastern Europe,and some Bonn officials charge Genscher is aiming for anuclear-free Europe.   A May 29-30 NATO summit will examine the question of replacingthe Lance rockets, which have a range of about 75 miles, withmissiles of a range nearing 300 miles. The United States andBritain want the rockets upgraded.   Bonn has insisted that the decision be put off for at least twoyears, partly to avoid angering voters before the next federalelections in December 1990.   Opinion polls show West Germans are against renewing themissiles and Kohl's party has suffered serious defeats in recentlocal elections, as well as a nationwide tumble in public opinionpolls.</TEXT></DOC>
