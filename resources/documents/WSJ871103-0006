The court's decision to refuse Texaco's appeal stunned nearly everyone connected with the two-year-old case. Even some Pennzoil officials and supporters had privately conceded that the justices might very well review the history-making judgment, which already has thrown Texaco into bankruptcy-law proceedings.    But without issuing an opinion, the state's nine-member Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts of Texas had committed no reversible errors in entering and upholding the largest judgment ever awarded.    &quot;I'm absolutely flabbergasted,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, a partner in the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, who was closely involved with the case on Texaco's side.    In an uncharacteristically understated comment, J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman, announced he was &quot;gratified&quot; at the decision.    Texaco, calling the decision &quot;inexplicable,&quot; announced it would immediately seek a U.S. Supreme Court review of the case, a step it has 90 days to take. In order to hurry up the federal appeal, Texaco may bypass the customary step of asking the Texas Supreme Court to reconsider its decision, a source close to the company said.    The court's decision was made after the stock market closed yesterday. And recent gyrations in the market made it impossible to predict how the companies' shares would react this morning, analysts said. But Pennzoil could well be a big winner, said Bernard Picchi, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. After the market crash, &quot;Pennzoil was at a price where it clearly wasn't benefiting from the litigation,&quot; he said. And if Pennzoil soars, he added, &quot;Texaco won't be unscathed.&quot; Others, however, said that both stocks already reflect the chance of a significant settlement payment to Pennzoil.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco closed at $34.25, up $1.625, and Pennzoil finished at $54.875, up $3. A trader at Jefferies andamp; Co., a Los Angeles-based brokerage that trades in stocks after regular markets close, reported no activity in the shares late yesterday.    The decision shifts the balance of settlement power clearly to Houston-based Pennzoil, which has demanded $4.1 billion to settle and has promised to increase the amount with each passing court victory. &quot;If they don't rush to the table with a $4 billion check -- assuming Pennzoil will take that -- they'd be absolutely foolish,&quot; said Gary E. Hindes, a longstanding Pennzoil partisan who is chairman of Delaware Bay Co., New York.    But even Pennzoil's chief trial-court lawyer, Joe Jamail, questioned whether Texaco would soften its position. &quot;If they had the collective IQ of the speed limit, they would have been trying to settle this thing for the last year or two,&quot; he said.    Indeed, Texaco advisers asserted that the White Plains, N.Y.-based company wouldn't let Pennzoil seize the moment in any out-of-court discussions. &quot;Yes, we're now down to one court,&quot; said one. &quot;But on the other hand, we're finally down to the court everyone thinks we can win in -- and we're in there sooner than we thought.&quot;    Pennzoil won the judgment in 1985 after a 4 1/2-month trial in which it convinced a jury in Houston that Pennzoil had secured a binding contract to buy an interest in Getty Oil Co., and that Texaco, by purchasing all of Getty for itself, had interfered with that contract. A trial court judge and a three-member appeals court affirmed the judgment before it went to the state's high court, which traditionally has accepted only 20% of all appeals for review.    The source close to Texaco asserted that the court's unwillingness to write an opinion in the case, in which Texaco had alleged some 130 lower-court errors, made it more likely the U.S. Supreme Court would hear the appeal. &quot;For the highest court in the state not to write a piddle or jot about this thing is unbelievable -- but it helps our case&quot; in the U.S. Supreme Court, he said.    Getting to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, is hardly a certainty, some lawyers said. &quot;The size of the dollar amount doesn't guarantee that the U.S. Supreme Court will hear it,&quot; said Frank W. Morgan, a partner in the Houston law firm of Wildman, Harrold, Allen, Dixon andamp; Morgan.    And although texaco lawyers and others have cited at least a half-dozen potential grounds for federal jurisdiction, stephen susman, a prominent houston trial lawyer, insisted that the texas supreme court &quot;was their last realistic hope.&quot;    If texaco obtains the four votes necessary to obtain a u.s. Supreme court hearing, the case probably wouldn't be heard until the next court term, beginning in october 1988, and wouldn't be finally decided until early 1989. A texaco lawyer, however, said &quot;we already have our papers in the can,&quot; and insisted that it's possible the court could render a decision as soon as the spring of 1988.    It also wasn't immediately clear whether the decision would renew misgivings among texaco creditors and business partners. Uncertainty has erupted around texaco in each of the prior court decisions affirming the judgment. In a statement, the company said that &quot;texaco's business will proceed in its normal course,&quot; adding that it will remain current on all of its trade debt.    Texaco also pointed out that it continues to have the protection from pennzoil and other creditors that it obtained by filing under chapter 11. It sought federal bankruptcy code protection last april, when pennzoil was in line to file liens on texaco assets to secure its judgment, as texas law provides.    Although the nation's high court remains the last forum to reverse the judgment, texaco believes it may not be the last to reduce it. Texaco is known to be planning a possible bankruptcy-reorganization plan that would vastly reduce any payments to pennzoil while assuring all other creditors of payment in full -- a plan, known as a &quot;cram down,&quot; in which it would seek to unite all creditors against pennzoil. If the cram down plan succeeded, however, pennzoil could appeal it to a u.s. District court in new york and perhaps to the u.s. Supreme court.    Yesterday's state-court decision will again call attention to questions about the impartiality of the texas judiciary, one of the few in the nation that maintains a partisan election system. Texaco has argued on appeal -- and doubtless will before the u.s. court -- that it was denied a fair trial partly because of a $10,000 campaign contribution to the trial judge in the case by mr. Jamail, the pennzoil lawyer. That allegation has been repeatedly rejected by the texas appeals courts.    Both companies' lawyers have also been heavy contributors to the election campaigns of the supreme court justices themselves -- although pennzoil's by a far wider margin. Several lawyers warned that texaco's strong attacks on certain texas judges in the case could poison the well in the state's high court.    A texaco employee last night variously described the mood of company officials as &quot;concerned&quot; and &quot;giddy,&quot; adding: &quot;there is relief that we finally are headed to the u.s. Supreme court.&quot; and despite the naysayers' opinions, james kinnear, texaco's president and chief executive officer, asserted in a statement that &quot;based on the issues, we are confident the u.s. Supreme court will grant this request.&quot;    Among federal issues, texaco has argued that the judgment violates the commerce clause of the u.s. Constitution by impeding interstate commerce, and the full faith and credit clause by ignoring the laws of other states -- such as the contract law of new york -- which were applied during the trial.    Texaco and others were particularly shocked that the texas court was unswayed by the entry of the securities and exchange commission into the case. In a recent friend-of-the-court brief, the agency argued that pennzoil's contract to buy an interest in getty oil had violated federal securities laws. Pennzoil, the sec said, had privately arranged to purchase getty oil shares held by the j. Paul getty museum while pennzoil also had a tender offer outstanding -- a violation of sec rule 10b-13.    &quot;it's the major issue,&quot; said mr. Schwartz, the new york lawyer, who represents the j. Paul getty museum.    At the same time, after so many lower court losses, texaco now faces a &quot;sobering reality,&quot; said mr. Morgan, the houston lawyer, adding, &quot;you can argue only for so long that everybody's out of step but you.&quot;    ---   Stephen Wermiel and Elliott D.
