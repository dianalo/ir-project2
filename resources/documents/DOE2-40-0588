The emphasis was on developing quantitative proceduresfor efficient weekly quality control procedures. The investigation wasconducted in three phases. In the first phase, scintillation camera performanceparameters were surveyed to identify and select the most important parametersfor performance evaluation. The selection of the parameters were basedon the theory of the operation of scintillation cameras. The parametersselected were classified into four preliminary performance evaluationprotocols. In the second phase, the following performance parameterswere investigated: intrinsic energy and spatial resolution, intrinsiccount rate characteristics, intrinsic uniformity and linearity, systemspatial resolution, system sensitivity, system uniformity, multiple windowspatial registration and parameters for the evaluation of a whole-bodyscanning option. The standardisation process included establishing thedegree to which each parameter was being influenced by the relevant factorsfrom the following list: input energy spectrum changes, acquisition countrate increases, the presence or absence of scatter medium, energy windowwidth and position, source-detector geometry, count density, computermagnification and the activation of a high count rate mo de switch. Inthe third phase standardised parameters were implemented in the suggestedperformance evaluation protocols and the results evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
