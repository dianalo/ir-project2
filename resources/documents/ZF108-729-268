(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cavanagh, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Installing a local area network (LAN) without carefully checkingon the memory utilization of the microcomputers included in it canlead to the problem of RAM cram, which occurs when a computerusing the DOS operating system has allotted all of its 640Kbytesof random access memory for application programs.andP;  Thememory-intensive software popular today, like Lotus 1-2-3, makesthis situation all the more likely to happen, since aligningmicrocomputers in a LAN also requires memory space.andP;  One wayaround the problem is to try and access the portion of RAM between640Kbytes and 1,024 Kbytes, which is reserved for use by devicesbut can also take some software applications if they are copiedinto it by special utility programs.andP;  Terminate-and-stay programsare the sort that can be copied into the reserve memory byutilities such as Valinor Inc's HighStepper.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Valinor Inc.
