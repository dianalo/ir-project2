A literature review was also conducted. The study has permittedthe identification of the breadth and complexity of the commercial sector,identified the limits to the creation of a useful survey tool on themethodological level, identified the institutional obstacles particularto this sector as well as promising future areas of research, and hasdetermined the attitudes of the sector on energy conservation and consumption.The heterogeneity of the sector has made the determination of significantoverall conclusions difficult. It was noted that energy use is not necessarilyconnected with the kind of economic activity. Natural gas occupies amost important place in energy use, and it is estimated that the foodwholesalers studied use 80% of their energy for refrigeration, whileretail stores, offices, and theaters use around 60% of their energy forheating and cooling. 85% of energy used by laundries is used in theirprocess activities. With regard to energy conservation, the measuresgenerally implemented are often those that are simplest, easiest to applyand have the quickest results. The financial aspects of conservationare the most important; the greater the energy bill of a business, thegreater the user is preoccupied with conservation. Recommendations aremade as to governmental policies that could facilitate energy conservation.269 refs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
