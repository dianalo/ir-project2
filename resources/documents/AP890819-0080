(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker created the celebrity-filledworld he had always wanted at the PTL ministry, but lost it bysurrounding himself with advisers who fed his need to be the star ofthe show, a new book says.   Bakker, who was driven from the now-defunct PTL ministry morethan two years ago in the midst of a sex-and-money scandal, goes ontrial Monday on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Jury selectionbegins Monday; opening arguments are expected a week later.   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, another television evangelist, took overthe PTL ministry in March 1987 as a caretaker under an agreementwith Bakker. But Falwell put the ministry under bankruptcyprotection three months later after uncovering a spreading web ofalleged financial irregularities and millions of dollars in unpaidbills.   Bakker ``survived at PTL by creating a universe where right andwrong were relative; he wrote the rules, and if he needed to breakone, he found reason to rewrite or ignore it,'' Charles Shepard, aCharlotte Observer reporter, writes in his new book. ``Falwellbrought to PTL a set of absolute standards _ a crucible Bakker couldnot survive.''   Shepard's coverage of PTL from 1984 to 1987 led to Bakker'sresignation and a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper. His book,``Forgiven _ The Rise and Fall of Jim Bakker and The PTL Ministry,''is scheduled to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press inmid-September.   The book portrays Bakker as a boyish charmer whose classmates inhis hometown of Muskegon, Mich., believed was destined for a careerin show business.   He enrolled in Bible school in Minneapolis, but dropped out afterless than two years when he married his wife, Tammy, and decided tobecome a traveling evangelist.   A chance to do a Christian children's television show led theBakkers to Pat Robertson's fledgling Christian Broadcasting Networkand, eventually, to Charlotte in 1974, where Bakker used his giftfor fund-raising to turn a failing television station and astorefront studio into a satellite network and the Heritage USAtheme park in neary Fort Mill, S.C.   As PTL grew, Bakker surrounded himself with aides willing to tellhim what he wanted to hear, ministry insiders told Shepard.Executives who worried about Bakker's spontaneous on-cameradecisions to finance projects, or questioned the funding for giantbuilding projects at Heritage USA, suddenly found themselves out offavor, if not out of a job.   Contractors for the water park at Heritage USA ran into the PTLphilosophy when they asked why the ministry hadn't done a study todetermine what size the park should be and how much admission tocharge.   ``They were told not to press the subject; Bakker got hisinspiration from God, and that was sufficient cause for PTL to moveahead,'' Shephard wrote. ``PTL seemed confident that the audiencefor Bakker's TV program, the stream of visitors to Heritage USA, andthe lifetime partners would generate the necessary traffic.''   Lifetime partners were investors in the park.   Two of Bakker's former aides, brothers James and David Taggart,have been convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million in ministryfunds they diverted to their own uses, including Cartier jewelry,designer clothes and a Manhattan apartment. Scheduled for sentencingFriday, they each face maximum terms of 25 years in prison and $1million in fines.   Richard M. Dortch, Bakker's top assistant at PTL, pleaded guiltyearlier this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud. He hasagreed to testify against his former boss as part of a plea bargain,said Bill Diehl, Dortch's attorney.   The Taggarts will consider testifying against Bakker, said theirattorney, Ben Cotten.   The book details some of the transactions that form the basis ofthe charges, saying Bakker and Dortch arranged bonuses forthemselves to cover such personal expenses as the Bakkers' threehomes.   Prosecutors allege that Bakker pocketed some of the $158 millionthat poured into PTL from 1984 to 1987 under various ``lifetimepartnership'' programs. In eight of the 11 programs, contributorswere promised free lodging at Heritage USA in exchange for aone-time donation of $1,000 or more.   Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and otherfacilities at Heritage USA to serve the partners, the indictmentsaid, the PTL executives spent more than $4 million on themselvesand used some of it for operating expenses.   Jim and Tammy Bakker got nearly $3.5 million in bonuses from 1984through 1987 and Dortch got $550,000 in bonuses while withholdinginformaton about PTL's worsening financial problems from its boardof directors, the indictment charged. Mrs. Bakker was not charged.   Bakker, who was listed among those interviewed for the book, hasdenied the charges against him but has declined to speak furtherwith reporters.   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after being informed by TheCharlotte Observer that the newspaper was ready to publish a storyof a sexual liaison between former New York church secretary JessicaHahn and Bakker in Florida in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
