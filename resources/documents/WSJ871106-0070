Garcia</HL><DD> 11/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Moves to lower interest rates in the U.S. and abroad boosted stock prices in an active session yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.12 to 1985.41. The average rebounded yesterday after losing a total of nearly 69 points in the two prior sessions. The average is down about nine points from last Friday's close. After climbing over 2000 twice since its massive plunge to 1738.41 Oct. 19, the average is nearing the 2000 level once again.    Stocks rose pretty steadily throughout yesterday's session as U.S. institutional investors snatched up blue-chip issues as well as smaller-capitalization stocks such as those traded in the over-the-counter market and on the American Stock Exchange. A good amount of the buying on the New York Stock Exchange was focused on the stocks of multinational companies that benefit from a lower dollar. The U.S. currency sank to new lows against the Japanese yen before recovering somewhat in London and New York trading.    Several major U.S. banks dropped their prime rate to 8 3/4% from 9% and West Germany's Bundesbank lowered several pivotal interest rates in that country. The West German move followed similar action by the Bank of England earlier this week. Investors and analysts, encouraged by these actions, expect further rate cuts.    &quot;There is still hope that (the crash) will be something that won't snowball&quot; beyond the stock market, said Sid Dorr, a vice president in the block trading department of Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.    He and other market professionals referred to the growing belief in the financial community that the U.S. and its major trading partners will work to promote more accommodative monetary policies. It's hoped that such an effort would keep the global economy from falling into a recession as a result of last month's market crash, they said.    Treasury Secretary James Baker told this newspaper two days ago that he wants to &quot;make sure&quot; that the Federal Reserve keeps &quot;sufficient liquidity in the system.&quot; His top priority is to avoid a recession, even if the dollar must suffer.    Although there are long-term inflationary consequences to a weaker dollar, Ed Dunn, first vice president in charge of financial strategy at UBS Securities, said that for now the stock market is hoping the lower dollar will help improve the U.S. trade deficit.    The stocks of major exporters and multinational corporations posted big gains yesterday. Even Japanese investors concede that Caterpillar looks far more attractive in an weak-dollar environment than Komatsu, which also manufactures heavy machinery. Caterpillar rose 3 5/8 to 55 1/4 and Deere moved up 3 1/2 to 31 1/2.    Among other gainers were Coca-Cola Co., up 1 1/4 to 41 1/4; McDonald's, up 1 1/8 to 43; Procter andamp; Gamble, up 2 to 87; Merck, up 6 3/4 to 183, and Johnson andamp; Johnson, up 1 3/4 to 79 1/2.    The slide in the dollar has served up some meaty currency losses for foreign investors in the U.S. market. Traders said they have seen a moderate flow of sell orders from Europe and Japan this week. But these traders have been encouraged by the facts that they found ready buyers for the unwanted shares and that the U.S. market didn't suffer a massive setback because of this selling pressure.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.52 to 254.48 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 2.70 to 141.81. For nearly every three issues that advanced on the Big Board, there was one decliner.    Big Board volume rose to 226 million shares from 202.5 million Wednesday.    Retailing stocks, though no longer the darlings of the investment world, advanced as most major department stores and discount chains reported higher October sales. J.C. Penney rose 4 5/8 to 48 3/8; Sears Roebuck added 5/8 to 35 3/4; Wal-Mart gained 1 1/8 to 28 7/8; K mart moved up 1 7/8 to 29 1/2, and May Department Stores climbed 5/8 to 29 3/4.    Dayton Hudson fell 5/8 to 30 3/8. The Minneapolis-based retailer said it expects to post third-quarter earnings substantially below last year's net from continuing operations of 55 cents a share.    Most oil stocks were mixed although crude prices continued to weaken. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for December delivery closed down nine cents, to $18.98 a barrel, after trading as low as $18.75. Atlantic Richfield lost 1 7/8 to 75 1/4; Exxon eased 1/4 to 41 3/4; Amoco lost 1/2 to 68 3/4; but Royal Dutch gained 2 7/8 to 108 3/4; Shell Transport added 3/4 to 70, and Unocal rose 1/2 to 29 3/4.    Southland advanced 2 1/2 to 66 3/4 in active trading. The company adjourned a special shareholder meeting yesterday, scheduled to vote on its planned leveraged buy-out. The company said that its investment bankers need more time to sell the debt to complete the transaction.    Digital Equipment added 3 1/4 to 135 1/8. President Kenneth H. Olsen said at the annual meeting yesterday that &quot;demand is still growing&quot; for Digital's computers. He added that as world economies adapt to a lower dollar value, it &quot;may very well cause a recession.&quot; But he said that he wasn't predicting one.    Technology stocks were among the gainers in yesterday's market. International Business Machines gained 4 1/4 to 123 3/4; Apple Computer advanced 2 to 38; Motorola rose 1 1/2 to 46; Hewlett-Packard Co. increased 2 3/8 to 50 3/8, and Microsoft moved up 1 3/4 to 50 1/2.    The lack of concern about inflationary pressures for the time being is dragging down the price of gold and gold-related stocks. ASA Ltd. fell 3 3/8 to 41 3/4; Echo Bay Mines lost 1 5/8 to 17; Battle Mountain Gold dropped 1 7/8 to 13 1/4; Homestake Mining sank 2 1/4 to 27; Amax Gold declined 2 1/4 to 18 1/8, and Newmont Gold tumbled 3 3/8 to 29 5/8.    CBS closed up 1/2 at 172 after trading as high as 175 7/8. The broadcaster's chief financial officer said there's a 70% chance the CBS record unit can be sold to Sony Corp. for $2 billion. But a spokesman for Sony said one of the major issues still to be resolved with CBS is just how much of its record division the company is willing to sell.    Telex rose 3 to 56 1/2 on more than 1.3 million shares. The company said that it plans a recapitalization if a pending tender offer by an investor group led by Asher Edelman isn't completed promptly. Also yesterday, a U.S. district court in Tulsa, Okla., denied a request from Telex to block a $65-a-share offer from the Edelman group. </TEXT></DOC>
