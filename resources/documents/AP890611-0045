The two-day conference, which Vietnam has agreed to attend, willreview an orderly departure program worked out by Southeast Asiancountries in March.   The agreements call on Vietnam to take back people who are merelyeconomic refugees, but it has so far agreed to accept only those whovolunteer for repatriation.   The meeting, beginning Tuesday in Geneva, should help relievesome of Malaysia's problems with the flood of boat people, ForeignMinister Abu Hassan Omar was quoted as saying by the Bernama statenews agency.   He said specifically that Malaysia hopes to close down onetemporary camp with 15,000 refugees on Pulau island in the SouthChina Sea.   The March plan, which Vietnam approved, also urges other thirdcountries around the world to increase their intake of refugees. Itmust be approved in Geneva before it is put into effect.   About 20,000 Vietnamese refugees remain in Malaysia, down from apeak of 76,500 in 1979.   Under the March accords, Malaysia and other Southeast Asiancountries have begun separately sheltering people viewed as economicrefugees until they can be repatriated.   Despite the agreements, many refugees have still fled Vietnam forMalaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other SoutheastAsian countries.   In Cebu City, Philippines, 17 Vietnamese refugees arrived aboarda cargo ship Sunday.   Their leader, 41-year-old Nguyen Van Lam, said he was a formerlieutenant in the Vietnamese army.   He said the group left Vietnam on May 23, their sailboat sank 11days later, and a ship rescued them. He said they were transferredin China to the cargo vessel, which brought them to the Philippines.   ``We want a better life,'' said Lam.</TEXT></DOC>
