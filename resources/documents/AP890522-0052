In the occupied West Bank today, unidentified gunmen fired threeshots at police in the center of Bethlehem, police and armyofficials said. One shot hit a police car, but no one was injured.   Israel radio said soldiers at a hitch-hiking post in the Negevdesert reported gunmen in a passing car shot at them today. Theywere not hit.   The shootings and discovery of the weapons cache came amidmounting concern over Palestinian threats to step up violence andend a policy of not using guns in the 17-month-old uprising.   Col. Renaan Gissin, the deputy army spokesman, said thererecently has been an increase in Palestinians' use of firearms.   ``We see it as a grave development,'' he said in an interview.   Elsewhere today, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in aclash in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Dir El Balah. And six womenwere hurt by metal pellets fired by soldiers in the West Bank townof Tulkarem, Arab reports said.   In clashes on Sunday, soldiers shot and killed two Palestiniansand wounded at least 25, according to hospital reports. The deathsraised to 496 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprisingagainst Israeli rule of the occupied lands began in December 1987.Twenty-two Israelis have been slain.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of the army's central command,said the arrest operation in the Gaza Strip was a ``decisive blow''to Hamas, an organization of Moslem fundamentalists.   ``In the long term ... there will be a reduction of violence inthe area,'' Mordechai said in comments broadcast on Israel radio.   Hamas, which means ``zeal'' in Arabic, takes a harder line thanthe Palestine Liberation Organization in seeking an Islamic nationthat would exclude the existence of a Jewish state. Many of itsleaders oppose peace negotiations with Israel.   An army announcement said security forces confiscated 18weapons, including pistols, U.S.-made M-16 and Soviet Kalashnikovautomatic rifles, Israeli Uzi submachine guns and Swedish KarlGustav rifles.   The statement said Hamas members fired at an Israeli car and anIsraeli man digging a well in Gaza in March 1988. The group alsowas blamed for throwing an explosive device at Israeli soldiers.   According to the army, Hamas planned anti-Israelidemonstrations, firebombed shops of storekeepers who violatedstrike orders by the uprising leadership and killed Arabs suspectedof collaborating with Israel or those who were involved in drugsand prostitution.   About 45 suspected collaborators have been killed in theuprising.   Mordechai said that among those detained was Sheikh AhmedYassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas who was accused of orderingbeatings and shootings of suspected collaborators.   Yassin, who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, had beensentenced to 12 years in jail in 1984 after being convicted ofhaving knowledge of concealed weapons. He was released in aprisoner exchange in 1985.   The raids against Hamas were conducted during a six-day curfewin the Gaza Strip that confined some 700,000 people to their homes.   The army lifted the curfew on Sunday but few Gazans went totheir jobs in Israel because of a strike ordered by leaders of theuprising.   There was increased concern that Palestinians had escalatedtheir rebellion.   A leaflet published this week by pro-PLO activists called onPalestinians to kill an Israeli soldier or settler for everyPalestinian killed by Israeli soldiers.   Last week, three Palestinians fired on Israeli troops in a WestBank village, killing one soldier and wounding seven before theywere killed. It was the first gun battle of the uprising.   Mohammed Abbas, the chief of a radical PLO faction, also calledfor the use of firearms by Palestinians in an interview publishedin the Kuwaiti daily Al Watan on Sunday.   The United States has accused Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas,of involvement in the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise shipAchille Lauro in which an American, Leon Klinghoffer of New York,was killed.</TEXT></DOC>
