Nevertheless, the ministry has decided that neither the company, Recruit Cosmos Co., nor those individuals involved in the scandal can be prosecuted for their actions because the three-year statute of limitations in the case has expired.    Shares of Recruit Cosmos were sold at low prices in 1984 before they were offered widely to the public. The initial purchasers were then able to profit after the public offering.    The list of the 76 purchasers hasn't been officially released, but among those who have been implicated in the share purchases are aides to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and other senior politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In addition, officials of private companies and securities firms have been implicated.    The uproar over the scandal, which came to light early this summer, has stalled the Japanese parliament's deliberations over Mr. Takeshita's tax-reform program, his major legislative priority. One upshot may be the imposition of taxes on capital gains in stock transactions.    In testimony before a committee of the Diet, Japan's parliament, Masahiko Kadotani, director general of the securities bureau of the Finance Ministry, said the stock transactions violated the Securities Trading Law. Mr. Kadotani said Recruit Cosmos violated the law by failing to notify the ministry of an advance sale to more than 50 parties.    Recruit Cosmos had argued to the ministry that the sale actually took place in two rounds, with sales to 39 and 37 parties, respectively, Mr. Kadotani said. But the ministry determined that the arrangement, in which a total of 125,600 shares were sold for 1,200 yen ($8.78) each, for a total of more than 150 million yen ($1.1 million), in fact constituted one sale.    Mr. Kadotani said the ministry reached its decision because the sales took place over a short period of time in December 1984, the price of the shares was the same in both lots, and all sales had to be settled on the same date.    The Ministry of Finance has asked Recruit Cosmos to submit a report on the share sales, but the company so far has refused, a ministry spokesman said. He said Recruit Cosmos still asserts the sales didn't constitute a violation of the law.    In his Diet testimony, Mr. Kadotani said the ministry &quot;is considering punitive action&quot; against the company if it continues to refuse to submit its report. Japanese press reports said the government is considering issuing an &quot;administrative guidance&quot; to securities firms asking them not to underwrite public offers of securities by Recruit Cosmos for a period of three years. The ministry spokesman declined to confirm the reports.    Recruit Cosmos is a subsidiary of Recruit Co., a company that has built an empire out of publishing magazines devoted to classified advertisements. Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, resigned in early July after the scandal came to light. </TEXT></DOC>
