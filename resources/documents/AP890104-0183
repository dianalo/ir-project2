Official Visits South Texas To Observe Central American Influx</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A United Nations refugee expert visitingthe southern tip of Texas said Wednesday she has seen hundreds ofCentral American emigrants camping in makeshift tents and crowdedinto dilapidated motels.   ``Clearly these people are experiencing difficulty and hardship,and this is one thing I wanted to come down and see about,'' saidSusan Timberlake of the Washington, D.C., office of the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees.   Ms. Timberlake arrived in the lower Rio Grande Valley on Tuesdaynight and planned to stay until Thursday visiting immigrant sheltersand meeting with local officials and Immigration and NaturalizationService representatives.   Ms. Timberlake said as of Wednesday she had not observed anyapparent violations of international law.   Al De Leon, assistant INS district director for examinations inHarlingen, said no violations of U.N. protocol were relayed to himin his meeting with Ms. Timberlake.   ``Basically, she is down here to observe and learn about thesituation,'' he said.   More than 30,000 Central Americans have crossed the Rio Grandeillegally near Brownsville and sought political asylum since the endof May when the INS started keeping count of the growing flood of``other than Mexican'' newcomers.   The concentration of Central Americans in the valley hasincreased sharply since Dec. 16 when the INS started requiringasylum-seeking immigrants in the area to submit their applicationsat the INS' Harlingen office and to receive word of approval ordenial here.   The U.N. refugee office's interest in Cameron County, the state'ssouthernmost, was not a result of the new INS procedure, ``but bythe fact that there are large numbers of asylum-seekers here, andthat's what the UN is interested in,'' said Ms. Timberlake.   The office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, based inGeneva, was established to protect refugees' rights. More than 100countries have subscribed to a 1951 convention and-or a 1967protocol relating to the status of refugees. Each defines who is arefugee and outlines proper conditions for handling refugees.   Much of the U.N. language was incorporated into U.S. law with the1980 Refugee Act. Refugees are defined in part as people who areoutside their country because of well-founded fear of persecution.   ``When I go back, I'll discuss what I've seen with my office andwith my headquarters in Geneva, and we'll sit down with the (U.S)government and discuss it,'' Ms. Timberlake said.   A main concern of the U.N. body is whether refugees have adequateaccess to the asylum process, she said.   Asylum-seekers previously were allowed to travel to theirdestination cities, usually Miami or Los Angeles. A huge backlog ofasylum cases in those cities and a large number of unwarrantedasylum claims prompted the INS to adopt the new procedure, officialssaid.   INS officials have said most of the applicants are seekingeconomic betterment, not fleeing persecution, and therefore do notqualify for asylum. Those denied asylum will be asked to leave thecountry or face deportation, but may appeal their cases.   Because there is at least a 30-day wait for an answer from theINS, many of the immigrants with no money and no place to go havebegun camping out in the brush under discarded sheets of plastic.   A shanty town of plastic roofs continues to grow outside theCatholic Church-sponsored Casa Oscar Romero shelter for CentralAmericans southeast of Brownsville. Casa Romero is limited to acapacity of 200 by court order.   Ms. Timberlake said she had visited that camp site, dotted withhuman feces, where 250 people stayed Tuesday night, and the AmberMotel, a condemned structure in Brownsville that remains packed withCentral Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
