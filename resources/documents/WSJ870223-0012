They think the U.S. government's insider-trading probes could unleash a flood of litigation against securities firms.    The major worry is that the government might charge that questionable trading boosted profit at a publicly traded brokerage. If it were proven that any top officials were negligent, money managers say, the firm itself -- rather than just individuals -- might face fines and lawsuits that could dent its capital.    Recently, federal prosecutors alleged that General Electric's Kidder Peabody unit made &quot;millions of dollars in illegal profits&quot; as a result of an illegal trading scheme in which Kidder Peabody and Goldman Sachs employees swapped inside information about their investment banking transactions.    All but one of the men charged have denied wrongdoing. Martin Siegel, a Kidder Peabody dealmaker in the period in question, settled civil charges and pleaded guilty to felonies.    But the case has captured people's attention partly because of the potential for big fines and lawsuits against the brokerage. While investigators seem to be focusing on securities firms that aren't publicly traded, worries persist that publicly traded firms might become targets.    &quot;People become outraged and they want relief,&quot; says Melvyn Weiss, a New York stockholder lawyer at Milberg Weiss.    Grievances can't always be translated into good legal cases, Mr. Weiss says. But he predicts big suits -- some successful -- against brokerages before the book on the insider-trading investigations is closed.    Apparently nobody is dumping brokerage stocks wholesale. But since the Kidder Peabody scandal, shares of Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, First Boston and others have been sold intermittently even in robust markets, continuing a prolonged spell of weakness.    And Friday, Wall Street was swept by rumors of numerous arrests and indictments of arbitrage traders and merger specialists. The rumors weren't true, but the underlying fears remain.    &quot;It's a messy situation,&quot; says an analyst at a big mutual fund. &quot;I'm not sure where it comes out.&quot;    Don't buy brokerage stocks yet &quot;if you're concerned about indictments,&quot; says Brenda McCoy, a PaineWebber analyst.    Robert Salomon, a Salomon managing director, says concerns will linger until the probes are &quot;played out.&quot; Investigators haven't approached Salomon officials, except to seek information in a case related to the Drexel Burnham Lambert probe, Mr. Salomon says.    First Boston says it has &quot;no reason to believe&quot; its stockholders need to worry.    Some money managers are betting the scandal won't hurt publicly traded securities firms. Firms might even win business from troubled competitors, says Jay Pearlstein of Loomis Sayles, which holds Salomon and Morgan Stanley shares. Institutional brokerage stocks are cheap, Mr. Pearlstein says, even if 1987 earnings don't exceed 1986.    Despite above-average returns on equity, the stocks sell at roughly 10 times 1986 earnings, compared with 16 for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500, says Sam Liss, analyst at Salomon.    One hedge-fund manager says he is buying Salomon. First-quarter profit could be strong following a disappointing fourth quarter, he says, citing active equity and fixed-income markets.    Suits by companies involved with takeovers might succeed, lawyers say, if there is proof the firm being sued violated a fiduciary or contractual duty. If a company looking for an acquisition, for instance, hired a firm to land the quarry cheaply, the firm may have violated its duty if it drove up the stock of the target or aided somebody who did.    Indeed, several such lawsuits are pending against brokerages that aren't publicly traded. Last year, Shearson Lehman Brothers, a unit of American Express, was sued by Litton Industries, which said that a former Shearson employee drove up the stock of a company Litton bought. FMC Corp., alleging misuse of inside information that drove up its stock, sued Ivan Boesky and some brokerages. And Staley Continental last week sued Drexel because of alleged manipulation of Staley stock.    The brokerages say the respective suits have no merit. But if the suits are successful, they could involve large sums. Current laws allow plaintiffs to seek treble and punitive damages.    A publicly traded brokerage also might be vulnerable to suits if it were proven its profit was boosted as a result of illegal insider trading, Mr. Weiss says. If an investor bought the stock at 30 based on reported profit of $3 a share, some of which came from illegal trading, the investor could sue to recover the amount by which the overstatement inflated the shares.    Less threatening may be suits by thwarted takeover speculators. An investor who sells a stock without knowing the company will soon be acquired at a fat premium enters &quot;a gray area of law,&quot; Mr. Weiss says.    To obtain damages, the investor has to prove that somebody who owed a legal duty to the investor and possessed information about the pending takeover violated that duty by failing to inform the investor. So, Mr. Weiss says, an investor who simply sold the stock on the open market might find it difficult to prove such a violation. </TEXT></DOC>
