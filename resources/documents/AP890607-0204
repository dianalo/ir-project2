(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many Southern Baptists are expected toshun this year's denominational convention in Las Vegas, Nev.,because of the city's distance from Baptist enclaves and thereputation of the gamblers' paradise.   Some may also do so because they're tired of the prolongedpartisan strife in the 14.8 million-member denomination, thecountry's largest Protestant body.   Although its annual conventions in recent years have attractedlarge crowds, hitting a high mark of 45,000 in 1985, only 13,000 to15,000 are expected June 13-15 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.   Lee Porter, registration secretary, estimated the reducedattendance based on responses from congregations. Each may send amaximum number of delegates, called ``messengers,'' based onmembership and financial contributions.   For the last 10 years, huge turnouts have been spurred by theconflict going on between fundamentalist and moderate factions.Although the struggle continues, fatigue with it has become evident.   Porter said there are a lot of other reasons for lessenedattendance, the first being the ``extreme distance'' to Las Vegasfrom the area of Southern Baptist concentration, mostly in the South.   ``The second reason our crowd is going to be down is that some ofour churches and some of our leaders have a problem going to LasVegas because of the reputation of the city,'' he said.   Attendance typically is a family affair and many Baptists don'twant to bring their children to Las Vegas and expose them to thecity's seamier side.   While a previous convention approved meeting in Los Vegas thisyear, the choice had passed only by a narrow margin.   Perhaps an underlying factor in the expected lower attendance ismembers' boredom with bickering between fundamentalists andmoderates, who for 10 years have tried unsuccessfully to topplefundamentalist control.   The key battle has been over the denominational presidency, butmoderates, sometimes called centrists, so far have been unable towin it for a decade.   The president appoints key committees which determine thepersonnel and policies of Southern Baptist agencies andinstitutions. While many Baptists are tired of the struggle, itshows no signs of abating.   ``They don't want to go and spend a week arguing,'' Porter said.``That's not good Christianity or good religion. You just don'tenjoy that.''   If attendance does drop, as Porter predicts, it might helpmoderates elect their candidate, the Rev. Daniel Vestal, pastor ofDunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta.   He is pitted against the Rev. Jerry Vines, thefundamentalist-backed president. He was elected last year and isunlikely to be unseated, since no incumbent who has sought a secondterm in recent history has been defeated.   Vestal said he is is doubtful that a low turnout would help him.``The faction that is now in control has just done an incredible jobin getting the right types of messengers to the convention.''   Vestal describes himself as a political novice and said he simplyrepresents a broad middle ground of philosophy. He added:   ``There is not going to be unity until there is a kind ofinclusion of all people in the process. The philosophy of the last10 years basically says it's winner take all. There can be no unityin that type of attitude.   ``A winner shares with all is my philosophy. I would includethose in the present leadership and those who are not in theleadership. This is not between two individuals, but it is betweentwo philosophies.''   Despite the conflict, Porter said most rank-and-file Baptistsaren't interested.   He said the convention generally is ``devoid of issues'' thatattract attendance, adding that ``there is a lack of controversialissues and that produces a lack of interest.''   Vines said he questions whether boredom with the controversy hasdeterred attendance. He added in a telephone interview from hisFirst Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla.:   ``My perception is that the projection of lower attendance ismore due to distance and economic considerations.''   Perhaps the strongest religious draw to the meeting will be aplanned proselytism sweep of Las Vegas by about 2,000 Baptiststrying to recruit residents to attend church, Porter said. They hopeto visit 30,000 to 35,000 homes on the Saturday before theconvention begins.   ``They are not going into the casinos. They are going into thehomes where people live and try to give witness,'' Porter said.   No matter the turnout, Vestal said the centrist movement is notlikely to stall in Las Vegas.   Porter said the centrists probably would have a better chance atthe convention next year in New Orleans since it is closer to theirareas of strength such as in Virginia and North Carolina. He added:   ``Who wins the election depends on who comes and who is in thehall when the vote is taken.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs June 9</NOTE></DOC>
