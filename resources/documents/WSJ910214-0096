Now it is manufacturing. In 1979, theU.S. had a $15.6 billion surplus in manufactured goods. Ifdata the Commerce Department releases tomorrow bear outprojections, for 1990 we expect to show a $93 billiondeficit, about 70% of it with Japan.   What is to be done? The Bush administration calls forgeneral measures such as a cut in the capital-gains tax thatwill affect every business regardless of whether it producessteel or singing valentines. Under our current president,nothing can more quickly doom an economic proposal than itsassociation with what economists have called industrialpolicy -- the concerted use of governmental power to protectand subsidize industries deemed essential.</LP><TEXT>   Yet industrial policy remains an important and neglectedtool for reducing the country's balance-of-trade deficit inmanufacturing. It is applicable not only to &quot;old fashioned&quot;products but to preventing the virtual disappearance of suchkey 21st-century industries as robotics and semiconductors.The importance of industrial policy was confirmed by reportson economic performance the government is releasing thismonth.   Two highly touted documents -- one from the CommerceDepartment and another from the Bureau of Labor Statistics --chart the development of manufacturing over recent years.According to these reports, which use new methods ofstatistical calculation, some American manufacturingindustries began to score a comeback in the mid-1980s. Afterdropping to 20% in 1982 from 23% of GNP in 1977,manufacturing today again constitutes around 23%; andnumerous industries averaged higher increases in productivityfrom 1979 to 1989 than they had from 1973 to 1979.   Some of these industries owed their success entirely totechnical innovation and good management. But othersbenefited directly from government intervention. According tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, one of the twoindustries that showed the largest improvement from the1973-79 period to the 1979-1989 period was steel -- from aflat zero average in annual productivity to a 4.4% averageincrease. Yet few industries were more vigorously supervisedand protected from foreign imports than steel in those years.In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration affirmeddumping complaints against producers in Western Europe, Japanand Brazil. In late 1984, the administration institutedvoluntary restraint agreements -- a form of protection -- inexchange for industry commitment to reinvest its profits inhigher productivity.   The voluntary restraint agreements appear not only to havespurred modernization, but to have induced foreign companiesto invest in the U.S. In the past decade, foreign steelcompanies plowed $3.2 billion into the U.S. and established27 joint ventures. Many of these joint ventures, such as theUSS-Posco facility in Pittsburg, Calif., and theNational-Nippon plant in Ecorse, Mich., now feature thenewest and most productive steel-making technology. TheAmerican steel industry is still not healthy, but without theVRAs, it might not exist.   Other protected industries also surged during the 1980s.American textiles -- the beneficiary of the multifiberagreement that limits the growth of imports -- was one of thefew industries to expand its productivity during bothperiods, and parts of the textile industry enjoyed particularsuccess in the 1980s. Non-wool-yarn mills increased theirproductivity at an average 8% from 1979 to 1989, vs. anaverage 3.4% from 1973 to 1979.   Semiconductors was another success story. By themid-1980s, the industry, suffering from dumping by Japanesefirms and from a relatively closed Japanese market, was inruins, but after the Reagan administration stopped Japanesefirms from dumping their chips in the U.S. market and workedout an agreement to open the Japanese market to Americanproducers, the industry enjoyed a spurt of productivity. In1988 and 1989, industry productivity increases climbed to15.2% from 8%, and the U.S. actually increased its share ofthe world market for the first time since the industry beganlosing out to the Japanese in the late 1970s.   For these industries, government was not the problem, butthe solution. Protection of these industries did not lead tostagnation and decline, as conservative economists predicted,but to higher productivity within the industry and within theentire economy. Yet government now threatens to let thesemiconductor agreement expire in July and to phase out thesteel VRAs and the multifiber agreement.   If the administration neglects these industries they arelikely to go the way of U.S. robotics. In the 1980s, theReagan and Bush administrations ignored warnings that thisindustry was in trouble. Now, says one Commerce Departmentofficial, &quot;we no longer have a robot industry to speak of.&quot;As a Commerce Department report due out this month isexpected to show, the American robotics industry, once theworld leader, now lags Japan and Germany, and is barelyholding its own against Sweden and Switzerland.   According to Commerce Department calculations, imports nowaccount for 74.5% of the American market, and when foreigncontent is factored in, 81.3%. Japan, the world's largestproducer and consumer of robots, supplies 76% of the importsto the American market, while the U.S. supplies 0.2% of theJapanese.   During the 1980s, every major American robot maker leftthe business, including General Electric, IBM, Westinghouse(which bought industry pioneer Unimation) and CincinnatiMilacron. What's left is IBM's joint venture with theJapanese machine-tool giant, FANUC, and smaller specialtyfirms such as Adept. The only area of American strength is inspecialized military and satellite technology that has fewcommercial applications.   If each company is looked at in isolation, then theindustry's collapse has to be blamed on shortsightedmanagement decisions -- for instance, Westinghouse's failureto switch from hydraulic to electric robots until it was toolate. Yet management in the robotics industry was no moreshortsighted or inept than the management in thesemiconductor industry. In both industries, domestic firmscould not compete with foreign firms that benefited fromlong-term cheap credit and a largely protected home market.With government help, the American semiconductor industrysurvived. The robotics industry, forced to go it alone, didnot. The moral is clear.   To compete better, to reduce and even eliminate itsbalance of trade deficit in manufacturing, the U.S. needs todo a whole litany of things: lower its cost of capital,improve education and physical infrastructure, and financebasic scientific research. But this will not be enough. Ifthe U.S. wants to have steel, semiconductor and textileindustries, and if it wants to revive its robotics industry,government is going to have to step in directly. The U.S.will have to have an industrial policy.   ---   Mr. Judis is contributing editor of the New Republic andWashington correspondent for In These Times.</TEXT></DOC>
