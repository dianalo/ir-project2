Unimplanted specimens showbrittle fracture at 77 K but ductile fracture above 123 K. Specimensimplanted to a dose of 1x10/sup 21/ ions/m/sup 2/ show either brittlefracture without slip or the formation of extensively large cracks at123 K. The cracks are formed at 171 K also. The embrittlement is enhancedwith the increase of dose. Surface removal of specimens irradiated toa dose of 3x10/sup 21/ ions/m/sup 2/ brings about ductile failure at123 K. These results show that the surface damage introduced by low energyHe/sup +/ implantation is responsible for low temperature embrittlementof bcc metals and gives rise to the increase in DBTT.</TEXT></DOC>
