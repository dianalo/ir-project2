The new rate-setting method would allow industry leader ATandamp;T tooffer special rate plans to individual businesses that already havebeen offered discount pricing by competing long-distance carriers.   ``We need to be able to respond to these competitivesituations,'' Larry Garfinkel, ATandamp;T vice president for marketingservices, said Tuesday. ``Customers would be deprived of thebenefits of competition if all carriers cannot compete on an equalbasis.''   Under federal regulations, ATandamp;T's rates are generally availableto all customers. Other long-distance companies, whose prices arenot regulated, can tailor their prices for an individual company.   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission lateMonday, ATandamp;T said its new rate-setting proposal was prompted by MCICommunications Corp.'s discount offering to Holiday Corp. ofMemphis, Tenn., the nation's largest hotel chain with more than1,800 affiliate and franchise hotel properties.   ATandamp;T wants to offer pricing discounts to Holiday Corp.competitive with MCI's proposed plan.   Garfinkel said the ATandamp;T proposal is ``absolutely notderegulation,'' since the FCC will continue its oversight of ATandamp;T'srates and profits. He also said the company will not set prices forspecial packages below cost.   MCI said it will oppose ATandamp;T's proposal as ``unlawful.'' Thesecond-largest long-distance carrier said the plan would allow ATandamp;Tto ``ignore long-standing safeguards'' designed to protect thepublic from predatory pricing and discrimination by any companythat controls a large share of the market, as ATandamp;T does providingabout 72 percent of the country's long-distance service.   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the timing of the company'sproposal was coincidental to the FCC's preparations this week foranother step toward radically changing the way ATandamp;T is regulated.   The FCC on Thursday is expected to unveil a specific proposal toput in place a new system of regulating ATandamp;T by capping ratesrather than profits. ATandamp;T has been lobbying hard for the change.</TEXT></DOC>
