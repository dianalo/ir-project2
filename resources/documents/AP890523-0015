Greg Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service saidfigures for the fourth quarter of 1988 showed that cash receiptsfor sales of major commodities produced on the nation's farms``were stronger than forecast'' initially and that the momentumcontinued into the first quarter of 1989.   ``Our crop receipts are projected to set an all-time record in1989,'' Hanson said Monday in an interview. ``There has been pricestrength in both crops and livestock.''   The latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock ataround $81 billion, with sales of crops at $76 billion. Butexpenses are rising, too, as farmers put more cropland back intoproduction and direct federal payments to farmers decline.   Nationally, including all farm-related cash receipts, the grosscash income of farmers could be in the range of $168 billion to$173 billion, compared with about $170 billion in 1988. Expensesare forecast at $115 billion to $119 billion, compared with $113billion last year.   As a result, Hanson said, farmers this year could see net cashincome in the range of $50 billion to $55 billion. That would bedown from the 1988 record of $57.7 billion.   Just a month ago, the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at$48 billion to $52 billion.   Net cash income is the annual difference between gross cashincome and cash operating expenses. As defined by the agency, it isthe amount of money farmers have available to pay debts, makepurchases and pay for family living expenses.   Net cash income during a calendar year can include proceeds fromsales of crops produced in earlier years.   In another method of bookkeeping, the agency computes net farmincome as a measure of the net value of agricultural productionduring the calendar year, whether sold or stored on the farm.   Under this method, changes in inventory values are taken intoconsideration, along with values assigned to ``non-money'' incomesuch as an allowance for a farm family's dwelling and other factors.   According to USDA's latest projections for 1989, net farm incomecould rebound to record levels of $47 billion to $52 billion. Lastyear, when inventories were drawn down sharply, net farm income wasabout $41 billion, down from $46.3 billion in 1987.   Hanson's comments followed an outlook report Friday in whichanalysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are ``not muchchanged'' from earlier forecasts, except that the weather hasshifted the distributions.   ``Wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with largecarry-in stocks (inventories) will have higher incomes becauseprices are up,'' the report said. ``But wheat producers who werehit by the dry weather this winter and spring, and who lack stocksor crop insurance, will sustain losses.''   Some other observations in the report:   _Higher beef production and lower prices are expected throughJuly. Record numbers of cattle entered feedlots in the firstquarter of this year. Fewer replacement heifers may be held forherd expansion, reflecting dry pasture conditions, especially insome Great Plains states.   _The Federal Reserve's tightening of the U.S. money supply hascooled the underlying inflation rate, so further tightness seemsunlikely. This points to falling interest rates and a real economicgrowth rate in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year. Thisadds up to an economic environment that ``should mildly support''agriculture.   _An agency economic study suggests consumers would pay $3billion to $5 billion more annually in the short run for tomatoes,potatoes and tobacco if soil fumigants are banned, a possibilitybeing considered by the Environmental Protection Agency.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department is instituting newprocedures to tighten the testing and detention of ready-to-eatmeat and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by thebacteria, Listeria monocytogenes.   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety andInspection Service, said Monday the new policy will take effect assoon as the revised testing procedures are ready, in about sixweeks.   Crawford said that on April 14, the Centers for Disease Control``confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the UnitedStates caused by meat or poultry.'' The case involved a nationwiderecall of turkey franks made by Plantation Foods Inc., of Waco,Texas.   Under the Listeria monitoring program, the agency will increasethe number of samples tested each year. Other procedures are beingput into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reachconsumers until the problem has been corrected, he said.   The bacteria have the potential to cause serious illness,particularly among those with weakened immune systems such asinfants, pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill.   However, Crawford said, healthy persons are ``essentially atlittle risk'' from the disease, which can cause flu-like symptoms,including fever, chills, headache and sometimes abdominal pain anddiarrhea.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department gained two moresenior officials with the swearing-in Monday of Charles E.
