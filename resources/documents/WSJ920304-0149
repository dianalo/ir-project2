The top officials say they're betting that one of thecompany's newer businesses, providing long-distance telephoneservice to the independent republics of the former SovietUnion, will be an increasingly profitable one.</LP><TEXT>   Last September, the Culver City, Calif., company receivedclearance from the Federal Communications Commission to offerinternational phone service in several countries, includingthe Soviet republics. In January, IDB began providing Sprint,a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., access to IDB'stelecommunications satellites for a per-minute charge.   On Feb. 10, IDB announced that because of strong demand,it would be doubling its circuit capacity between the U.S.and the former Soviet Union. The big purchases by the twoexecutives started that same day, filings with the SEC show.The two also bought shares on Feb. 11.   Jeffrey Sudikoff, the company's chairman, and EdwardCheramy, its president, each purchased 73,625 shares at$14.50 a share, spending a total of $1.07 million each,according to the filings. The two split a block of stock thathad been put on the market by a director, Mr. Sudikoff saidyesterday. The insider purchases increased the president'stotal holdings by 22% and the chairman's by 5%, the SECfilings show.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, IDB sharesclosed at $13.75, up 25 cents.   Mr. Sudikoff said he and Mr. Cheramy expect&quot;disproportionate&quot; stock-price growth relative to theindustry when investors focus on IDB's new situation.   Wall Street still trades IDB Communications like a highlyleveraged broadcasting company, said Mr. Sudikoff, despiteits move into international phone service. Mr. Cheramy addedthat the company has cut its debt-to-equity ratio to 1-to-1from 6-to-1 in 1989. IDB plans to take a 17-cent-a-sharefourth-quarter charge to pay down debt, when earnings areannounced later this week, Mr. Sudikoff said.   Duff andamp; Phelps recently rated IDB's debt a triple-B-minus.   George Robertson, an analyst at Alex Brown andamp; Sons ofBaltimore, said that IDB Communications has &quot;taken anexpertise in international telecommunications and leveragedit into a business that could be very lucrative for them.&quot;For now, he rates the stock &quot;neutral.&quot;   REAL MONEY: Albert O. Nicholas, head of the managementfirm behind one of the mutual-fund industry's bestperformers, spent almost half a million dollars of his ownmoney to buy shares of a Milwaukee-based company of which heis a director.   In one of the largest purchases reported to the SEC lastweek, Mr. Nicholas spent $493,247 on the stock of ChristianaCos., SEC filings show.   The company was formerly a residential real-estate firm,but has been gradually moving out of that business, &quot;sellingour real estate holdings to acquire operating companies&quot; in avariety of different fields, a Christiana spokesman said.
