(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Collins On-line Electronic DictionaryandM;Collins, that well-known purveyor of dictionaries, has come up with thiselectronic version of its bilingual reference books.andM;Available in French, Spanish, Italian and German, to and from English, thedictionaries are being sold as an ideal tool for people who need a fast andaccurate translation facility at their fingertips.andM;I tried the English/French version.andP;  Like the others, it can be used with PCsand compatibles running DOS 2.1 or higher.andP;  However, be warned.andP;  The programtakes up a lot of space -- 2Mb for the first dictionary, 1.5Mb for subsequentdictionaries, and 160Kb of RAM.andP;  Remember, too, that each of thesedictionaries goes one way only -- so a French/English English/Frenchdictionary actually counts as two.andM;The version I tried came on five 5-1/4-inch floppy disks and took about 15minutes to install.andP;  The intructions in the glossy manual are concise andeasy to understand, although when you get further in, some of the pagesappear to have been wrongly indexed so they could cause confusion.andM;The program is loaded from the DOS prompt or automatically loaded from yourmodified AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  Once Collins On-line is loaded, you can go intoyour word processor and access the dictionary any time from there.andM;It works with most word processors, but users of Word and PC-Write shouldlook out for separate instructions in the manual.andM;Access to the dictionary is simple.andP;  There are three basic choices; Lookup,Paste and Menu, which you can reach via simple commands from the C prompt.andM;The first gives you a pop-up window covering about half the screen so you canstill see the text you're working on.andP;  Enter here the term that you wanttranslated, and it will pop up in French underneath -- along with its gender,part of speech and so on.andM;Other information on the screen will tell you if the next word in thedictionary is similar.andP;  You can view the next or previous entry using the PgUp and Pg Dn keys.andP;  Paste allows you to cut and paste a translation into thedocument you're working on.andM;The menu gives you 16 options, including lookup.andP;  Others include a colourchange and a window moving option and the facility to create your ownglossary, wherein lies the rub.andP;  Collins On-line claims 35,000 translationswhich is simply not enough.andP;  Everyday terms just aren't there.andM;For example, if you wanted to translate a sentence including the wordsmullet, hatstand, on-line and yuppy, you'd be stuck.andP;  Collins' pocket versionof its manual dictionary has double the references of the electronic one at atiny fraction of the cost.andM;The On-line Electronic Dictionary is quite good fun to play with, but itssize makes it useless for serious business use.andP;  Contenders in the 1992stakes would do better to fork out 4.95 pounds on the Collins PocketDictionary and put the 145.05 pounds they save towards a weekend in Paris, orRome, or Madrid...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
