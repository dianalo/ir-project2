In this paper, we present and approach forstudying this kind of field disturbance for modes in the frequency domainby using the three-dimensional code MAFIA. We demonstrate that by judiciouslychoosing the boundary conditions at the appropriate location along thewaveguide, one can model the cavity-waveguide system by a closed boundarysystem and reduce the computation time significantly. 5 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
