(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A day-long protest by StanfordUniversity students demanding action against campus racism endedwith the arrest of 55 students Monday, many of whom had barricadedthemselves inside the president's office.   The students were cited for misdemeanors that included unlawfulasssembly, trespassing and failure to disperse, said universityspokeswoman Eileen Walsh.   About 60 students who took part in the protest occupied orbarricaded the office of university president Donald Kennedy atabout 7:30 a.m. After negotiations between the students anduniversity officials failed, Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputiesbegan arresting protesters shortly before 4 p.m.   Participants, who were trying to call attention to their demandsfor more minority faculty members, ethnic centers and other effortscombating racism on campus, called a noon rally for Tuesday.   Twelve of those arrested were taken by deputies to the countyjail in San Jose, where they were booked for investigation ofmisdemeanor charges, Walsh said.   Another 40 were cited and released after a crowd of severalhundred cheering supporters prevented the sheriff's bus full ofarrestees from leaving by creating a blockade of bodies, cars andbicycles, Walsh said.   Three other participants were cited for resisting and delayingan officer, Walsh said. They were released.   The occupation of Kennedy's office began about 7:30 a.m. whenthe students pushed past a receptionist. The students asked otheremployees to leave, then blocked the doors.   The protest involved Asian-American, black, American Indian andHispanic groups, which sought a meeting with Kennedy to discusstheir demands.   Kennedy, who has promised to respond to a report by theUniversity Committee on Minority Issues at a meeting Thursday, wentdirectly from home to teach a 9 a.m. biology class. Later, he saidin a statement that the committee report ``must be dealt with in athoughtful and orderly fashion.''   ``Preemptive and unlawful actions like those taken this morningrepresent no substitute and should instead be treated for what theyare,'' he said. ``As is our practice, the university will notnegotiate on issues of substance in response to unlawful coercion.''   At Michigan State University in East Lansing, meanwhile, a blacksit-in at the administration building turned a week old with nosign of weakening.   The protesters are demanding more black faculty, punishment forracist acts on campus, more recruitment of black students, creationof a minority adviser to the provost, and the hiring of moreminorities for university jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
