(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon purchased the air-launchedcruise missile knowing it did not perform as intended, a formermilitary official said in an interview published today.   The weapon, billed as a low-flying, radar-evading missile, infact was not able to fly low enough to hide from enemy radar,retired Air Force Lt. Col. Ronald F. Deady told the Antelope ValleyPress.   Deady, who now lives in Lancaster, was a member of the JointStrategic Planning Staff at Strategic Air Command headquarters inOmaha, Neb., from 1974 to 1978 and was among the officials whomonitored the missile's testing.   ``The command approved it knowing that it did not fulfilloperational specifications,'' he said.   An Air Force spokesman denied the charges, saying the missile``met its stated purpose.''   The Carter administration had chosen the cruise missile programover the B-1 bomber to be one of the nation's main defense systems.The missile can be armed with nuclear warheads.   Deady, whose job at Edwards Air Force Base from 1978 to 1981 wasto ensure the missile was meeting military specifications, said hefound that tests were conducted in a way to make it appear themissile worked properly.   For instance, he said the missile was launched from B-52s flyingat altitudes that did not fit all operational profiles determined bythe Strategic Air Command.   In addition, the missile was usually tested when the weather wasconducive for successful flights, he said.   Deady said he complained to his superiors but got no response.Colleagues advised him against pursuing the matter, he said, and hetook their advice and wrote favorable reports thereafter for thesake of his career.   ``The normal methods of delivery did not perform up tooperational specifications,'' he said. ``But when we turned a reportin, we did not say that it does not meet specifications. We said itcould.''   However, Deady said he suspects the military in April 1983reduced its missile orders from more than 3,000 to 1,715 because theweapon could not adequately evade enemy defenses.   The military has since moved on to another missile system, theadvanced cruise missile. Military officials denied the decision tocancel orders was linked to the missile's performance.   ``The ALCM met its stated purpose,'' said Ron Fry, a spokesmanfor Air Force Logistics Command, which is responsible for approvingweapons systems before the service accepts them from contractors.``But because of the new and evolving threat, the program wasredirected in favor of a more advanced weapons system.''   Air-launched cruise missiles were delivered to the Air Force from1982 through 1986. Fry said the missile, now stationed at bases inseven states, is one of the most reliable weapons in the nation'snuclear arsenal.</TEXT></DOC>
