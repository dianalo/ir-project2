The deepest retailing recession in decades is claiming arecord number of bankruptcies -- 50 major retailersrepresenting $23.7 billion in annual sales last year. And aswift end isn't in sight. This year, such familiar names asCarter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., Hills Department Stores Inc.,Best Products Co. and Paul Harris Stores Inc. have soughtbankruptcy-court protection.</LP><TEXT>   The causes of today's troubles go beyond the fallout fromthe Mideast war and the consumer-spending slump. They alsoreflect the excesses of the 1980s, when chains overbuilt andoverborrowed, and a shift in consumer attitudes aboutshopping. Surveys suggest the motto &quot;shop till you drop&quot; isfading; a Maritz Marketing Research Inc. poll well before thestart of the current recession found nearly two of five womenvisiting malls less frequently than a year earlier.   &quot;The depth and breadth of today's bankruptcies show thatit's not just a problem with a couple of overleveragedcompanies,&quot; asserts Carl Steidtmann, chief economist atManagement Horizons, a retailing consultant.   If retailing is at a crossroads, as some industryexecutives contend, which retailers will take the path toprosperity -- and which face further roadblocks? Among theunlucky: debt-laden chains that have little cash to keeptheir stores and selections looking sharp, and bigbureaucratic department stores and catalog showrooms, whichlack pricing flexibility.   Here is a glimpse of individual retailers categorized byfuture prospects:                                                                                                          BEST BETS                                                                                                          Dayton Hudson Corp.                                                                                                          The Minneapolis-based retailer has relied mostly on itsTarget discount stores and Mervyn's low-end department storesfor growth. But last year's Marshall Field's acquisition gaveits traditional department-store business a boost: It nowdominates the markets in Chicago, Minneapolis and Michigan.   Target, its largest unit, sells higherquality and morepricey clothes than other discounters, and its stores usuallyare spiffier. It was the first major discount chain to widenaisles. While its prices are 5% to 10% higher than Wal-Mart'sand 3% to 6% higher than neighboring Kmarts in Atlanta andIndianapolis, according to recent Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.surveys, it is the market leader in many areas.   Mervyn's stores sell mostly clothing and compete mostdirectly with J.C. Penney. They have bounced back from adismal showing a few years ago that attracted an unsuccessfultakeover bid by the Haft family of Washington, D.C.                                                                                                          Dillard Department Stores Inc.                                                                                                          Its stores aren't flashy, but the growing company isringing up respectable profit gains in a difficultenvironment. Dillard tends to be first or second in marketshare in such small cities as Memphis and Tulsa and sellsmostly tried and true brands like Liz Claiborne in women'sclothes and Hickey Freeman in men's. Its stores run far fewersales than competitors in such areas as bedding, favoring aneveryday pricing strategy that bolsters customer loyalty.   While Christmas results fell short of its aggressive plan,the company fared better than most competitors. Based inLittle Rock, Ark., and controlled by the Dillard family, theretailer also excels at buying struggling chains cheaply andusing state-of-the-art information systems to make them moreefficient. Acquisition opportunities will continue to emergein today's tumultuous times. Dillard already is beingmentioned as a potential buyer for any units Carter HawleyHale may shed.                                                                                                          Gap Inc.                                                                                                          This casual-clothing chain has become hip as consumersreturn to a &quot;basics&quot; frame of mind. Its moderately pricedall-cotton turtlenecks, pocket T-shirts and jeans appeal to awide spectrum of shoppers -- from teen-agers to celebrities-- and are fueling the company's growth.   Based in San Francisco, Gap has prospered despite therecession by focusing on price. Popular pocket T-shirts sellfor only $10.50 -- about 15% less than most competitorscharge. Excluding Levi's jeans, Gap clothes for adults andchildren (through GapKids) are designed in house and carrythe Gap label -- now the nation's third largest, the companysays. Collections are kept fresh by changing colors every twomonths or so and periodically adding new styles. Among thenew additions: linen jackets and silk blouses.   Gap stores also do their part to reduce shopping hassles.Store decor is bright white -- the better to show offmerchandise piled neatly on tables and hung along the walls-- and sales help usually abounds.                                                                                                          Limited Inc.                                                                                                          Despite the recent poor performance of its flagshipLimited division, this women'sclothing trend-setter lookslike a long-term winner. Its Victoria's Secret lingeriecatalogs and stores are booming. It also operates Expressstores for young women, Lane Bryant shops for big women,Lerner New York shops for working women, Abercrombie andamp; Fitchstores offering a Ralph Lauren look and Henri Bendel shopsfor the affluent.   Reaching its goal of doubled sales and after-tax profitsof 10% by the mid-1990s will require the Columbus, Ohio,company to maintain its traditionally keen fashion sense andits highly efficient offshore manufacturing operation.Critics contend workaholic Chairman Leslie Wexner is tooobsessed with size -- and isn't invincible. They cite hislatest flop, the Paul et Duffier sportswear line introducedlast year at Limited stores.                                                                                                          May Department Stores Co.                                                                                                          The recession is squeezing the nation's largestdepartment-store company, which could alienate customers withits penchant for running frequent sales that require biggerinitial price markups. Declining samestore sales recentlysuggest May is losing market share.   But the St. Louis-based retailer stands to benefit fromthe current turmoil by finding attractive acquisitioncandidates. Last year, it snapped up the healthy Thalhimer'schain in the Southeast from Carter Hawley Hale, and it hasexpressed interest in buying some of the Campeau chains ifthey go on the block.   May's bland merchandising strategy (it favors moderatelypriced brands) has kept it reasonably healthy, as hasChairman David C. Farrell's refusal to load up on debt. Hispursuit of efficiency is May's secret weapon. Weekly reportsfrom headquarters dictate which items the stores and theirads must emphasize. When consumer spending went into a slumplast fall, May moved more swiftly than competitors to limitthe damage by paring merchandise buying and expense plans.                                                                                                          Nordstrom Inc.                                                                                                          Reflecting recessionary effects, this Seattle-baseddepartment-store chain trimmed personnel last fall when salesslowed -- including salespeople who provide its vauntedservice and pianists who serenade shoppers.   But the retailer, controlled and managed by the foundingNordstrom family, is still expected to benefit from theindustry's shakeout. Rather than buy chains from troubledcompetitors, it is opening new stores in the East andMidwest. When it enters a new region, it usually grabs marketshare by offering better service and a wider selection ofshoes, apparel and accessories. Nordstrom also employs moremerchandise buyers who select goods for a handful of stores,tailoring the mix specifically for each store's clientele.   Nordstrom's reputation has been tarnished over the pastyear by a union dispute and revelations that it doesn't fullycompensate its commission salespeople. But many customersremain loyal, enabling it to outpace rivals in a key measureof productivity: sales per square foot.                                                                                                          Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc.                                                                                                          Its warehouse-style stores, crammed with thousands oflow-priced items from dolls to diapers, help convinceshoppers that if they can't find it here, they can't find itanywhere. By selling some products at little or no profit, italso suggests that its prices are the lowest in town.   That strategy has worked like a charm since the companyemerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1978. It nowdominates the U.S. toy market with an incredible 22% shareand is seeking to wrest a bigger share with a new &quot;Check ItOut&quot; ad campaign hyping low prices on selected items. It isalso expanding internationally. A fierce price war, though,hurt the company late last year.   Its successful formula has spawned category killers inother product lines. Home Depot uses a similar strategy indo-it-yourself home improvement retailing, offering a wideselection, low prices and well-trained salespeople. And Toys&quot;R&quot; Us has branched out into the children's clothing arenawith Kids &quot;R&quot; Us stores.                                                                                                          Wal-Mart Stores Inc.                                                                                                          The discount chain Sam Walton started in 1962 with onestore in Rogers, Ark. -- and now the nation's largest andmost profitable retailer -- continues to expand rapidly,unlike stagnating chains like Sears. Its move into New Yorkstate and expansion in the Northeast could spell trouble forstruggling discounters Ames Department Stores and HillsDepartment Stores.   The reason: Wal-Mart grabs market share by keeping priceslow everyday, aided by the lowest cost structure inretailing's big leagues. With a fresh round of permanentprice cuts, Wal-Mart now appears to be targeting Kmart. Priceisn't its only strength. Wal-Mart faithful give the chainratings twice as high as those given by their Kmartcounterparts for ambience, selection and value, a recentSanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. survey suggests.   Wal-Mart's juggernaut should slow as expansionopportunities diminish. The company, based in Bentonville,Ark., currently operates discount stores in 35 states. Butthere is another plus: its Sam's Warehouse Club stores --no-frills operations that undercut discounters' prices -- arein one of the fastest-growing segments of the retailindustry.                                                                                                          Woolworth Corp.                                                                                                          In the past decade, it traded its dowdy variety-storechain image for that of a dynamic specialty-store operator.Woolworth stores still stock some items that founder Frank W.Woolworth sold a century ago, but specialty operations --including Foot Locker and Kinney shoe stores -- now generatemore than half of operating profit, up from 29% in 1979. Thecompany expects it to climb to 75% by 1993.   During the 1980s, the New York-based company closed itsunprofitable chain of 372 Woolco discount stores, revampedits Woolworth stores, began expanding the Foot Locker andKinney chains, and acquired Kids Mart and Champs Sportschains. Lady Foot Locker and Afterthoughts accessory storeswere developed internally.   Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive, is focusingon increasing productivity, expanding selectively andcontrolling costs. One target: Europe, where Woolworth hopesto open more than 1,000 Foot Locker stores in the next 15years; the company has 47 on the continent now.                                                                                                          PROSPECTS CLOUDY                                                                                                          Ames Department Stores Inc.                                                                                                          Also reorganizing under bankruptcy protection, the RockyHill, Conn.-based discount chain is a victim of its ill-fated1988 acquisition of the ailing Zayre operation. Itimmediately closed 74 Zayre stores and moved to revitalizethe others by switching to &quot;everyday low pricing&quot; policy andchanging their names to Ames.   But the moves alienated customers, particularly those inurban areas, leaving Ames awash in red ink. Since its Chapter11 filing last April, it has closed a third of its stores,mostly old Zayre locations. Stephen L. Pistner, a turnaroundartist hired as chief executive after the bankruptcy filing,insists Ames is making progress. But he faces an uphillbattle in the recession-scarred Northeast.                                                                                                          Best Products Co.                                                                                                          Unable to obtain critical financing as its sales slumped,the debt-laden chain of catalog showrooms limped through theChristmas season and sought bankruptcy court protection inJanuary. Best's troubles stem from debts related to a 1988leveraged buy-out led by Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New Yorkinvestment bank. The retailer, based in Richmond, Va., is nowcutting expenses, freezing salaries, and dismissingemployees.   Kurt Barnard, who publishes Retail Marketing Report, atrade newsletter, sees even deeper problems. Catalogshowrooms like Best, he maintains, &quot;have outlived theirusefulness.&quot; To check out the goods, shoppers stroll throughthe showroom aisles or flip through a catalog that comes outonce a year. Then they place orders at the front desk andwait for the merchandise to arrive. &quot;The catalog robs {theretailer} of flexibility,&quot; especially in pricing, hebelieves.                                                                                                          Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.                                                                                                          Troubles at the West's largest department-store chain,which sought bankruptcy protection in February when creditdried up, reflect more the costs of an anti-takeover strategyin the 1980s than simply depressed sales of late. In wardingoff Limited Inc.'s Leslie Wexner, it piled on debt and spunoff such crown jewels as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.   Chairman Philip Hawley had to skimp on store remodelings,further eroding the competitive position of his Broadway,Weinstocks and Emporium stores. Now he may be forced to sellone or more of the Los Angeles-based retailer's divisions toreduce debt. Last year, he sold the best performing unit, theThalhimer's chain.                                                                                                          Child World Inc.                                                                                                          The plight of the nation's second largest toy specialistillustrates how difficult it is to compete with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.Despite its 6% market share and similar strategy, Child Worldfell behind on loan payments late last year as its losseswidened. When a deal to sell itself collapsed, Child Worldlaunched a Christmas-season price war to raise cash.   The company, based in Avon, Mass., seems to have avoided abankruptcy filing -- at least for now. Its parent, CNCHolding Corp., agreed recently to sell its 82% stake in ChildWorld to a group led by two former Toys &quot;R&quot; Us executives.But the deal doesn't ensure Child World's success. W. JohnDevine, one of the prospective owners, said recently the dealgives the chain enough liquidity to go through &quot;at least thenext two Christmases, with trade support.&quot;                                                                                                          Federated/Allied                                                                                                          Under bankruptcy protection since last year, the CampeauCorp. units have lost ground to healthier competitors whohave the cash to redecorate stores and keep up with changingconsumer tastes. While the company plans to closeunproductive stores and possibly go public, some analystsbelieve it may have to sell entire units.   One operation that has lost luster is Bloomingdale's.Consumer psychology has shifted so much that Bloomingdale'sneeds a new identity, some retail experts contend.&quot;Bloomingdale's is a yuppie haven, and the yuppie hasexploded,&quot; asserts Retail Marketing Report's Mr. Barnard.                                                                                                          Hills Department Stores                                                                                                          Another bankruptcy casualty, this Canton, Mass., chain wasleft debt-ridden by a 1985 leveraged buy-out and theacquisition of 35 Gold Circle stores four years later. Itsgrowth strategy proved unsustainable in a slow salesenvironment, and there wasn't enough cash to upgrade olderstores or build new distribution centers.   The company is closing 60 of its 214 discount stores. Itsreorganization has been complicated by the recent resignationof its second president in four months.                                                                                                          Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Its finances remain strong, but its costs are too high andit continues to sell durable goods like appliances, furnitureand tools in malls that cater mostly to customers seekingapparel and accessories. One outcome: Sales stagnated in the1980s as its stores and catalogs lost ground to trendierspecialty stores and discounters.   A three-year-old drive to revive its retail operation bysetting more competitive prices and adding national brands toits mostly private-label lineup has failed. Last year,Chicago-based Sears slid to third in the rankings of thenation's largest retailers behind Wal-Mart and Kmart. Andearnings from the core U.S. stores and catalogs plunged to apaltry $37 million from a peak of $656 million in 1984.   The recession is hitting Sears's big-ticket businessesespecially hard so Chairman Edward A. Brennan isconcentrating on paring costs. By year end, he expects tohave eliminated 33,000 jobs, or roughly 8% of the Searsmerchandise group work force. Salaries for 20,000 managershave been frozen. But critics say Mr. Brennan, athird-generation Sears veteran, needs to perform radicalsurgery to save Sears. He admits he may have to ax thevenerable but unprofitable Sears catalog and the unprofitablefurniture business.                                                                                                          REVIEWS MIXED                                                                                                          Kmart Corp.                                                                                                          The first retailer to capitalize on the concept ofdiscount stores in the 1960s lost ground in the 1980s toupstarts Wal-Mart and Target because its image suddenlyseemed too cheap. Now Kmart is in the midst of a five-yearrenovation program aimed at enlarging and sprucing up its2,200 aging stores. It's trying harder to compete withWal-Mart on price, having trimmed prices on 8,000 frequentlypurchased items such as shampoo and household cleaners. Italso has updated its selection to include better-qualityclothes and goods for the home.   But the jury is still out. The new store format --featuring broader aisles, improved lighting and wider shelves-- is producing bigger sales gains than older stores. But thecompetition is getting tougher too. By one analyst'sestimate, Kmart will compete directly with Wal-Mart at about75% of its stores by 1995, compared with roughly 40% today.The Troy, Mich., retailer has high hopes and big expansionplans for its Pace warehouse-club unit acquired in late 1989,but its record with noncore businesses is mixed. ItsWaldenbooks chain hasn't produced profits as big as somethought it could. And Builders Square, its do-it-yourselfhome-improvement chain, lags behind Home Depot in mostmeasures of productivity.                                                                                                          R.H. Macy andamp; Co.                                                                                                          It may be famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, butMacy's has been attracting more attention lately because ofits heavy debt load, dating from a 1986 leveraged buy-out.That was led by Chairman Edward Finkelstein, a merchant whoturned Macy's into a fashion leader. At the time, consumerspending was strong, and Mr. Finkelstein predicted thepattern would continue.   It didn't, leaving Macy's with a hefty loss in fiscal 1990instead of a modest profit. Macy's isn't likely to go the wayof Gimbel's because the chain still commands the respect ofconsumers. And it is boosting its TV advertising budgetfivefold this year, adding a new campaign to woo wanderingdepartment-store customers. Yet debt limits its flexibilityand its finances remain precarious. To raise cash and reducedebt, the company is selling stock to a new investor andshedding its credit-card operation.                                                                                                          Montgomery Ward andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Bernard Brennan, younger brother of Sears Chairman EdwardBrennan, saved Sears's crosstown rival from extinction in themid-1980s. But questions persist about how the company cangrow. Chairman Brennan says he's interested in acquiringother retailers. Last year, he proposed merging the companywith Sears if he could run the show but was turned down.   He gets credit for shaking up Ward's stodgy culture, axingunprofitable operations and turning Montgomery Ward into achain of what he calls &quot;value-driven specialty stores&quot; --large departments stocked with house and national brands insuch key areas as appliances, home furnishings, apparel andauto parts. He also led a management buy-out of the companyin 1988, selling its credit-card operation immediately toreduce debt. The company has since improved its balancesheet, ending last year with 1.5 times as much debt as equitycompared with 10 times as much three years ago.   J.C. Penney Co.                                                                                                          It spent the past decade transforming itself from anall-purpose mass merchant into a fashionable andhigher-priced department store, a makeover that is stillincomplete. Penney is especially vulnerable to the currentslump in consumer spending; it has yet to replace thevalue-conscious shoppers it lost with wealthier shopperswilling to pay more. And it has failed to win the keyclothing labels and cosmetic brands such as Liz Claiborne,Evan Picone and Estee Lauder that give department storescredibility with shoppers, particularly women.   The Dallas-based company's continuing emphasis onprivate-label goods, which must be ordered months in advance,and fresh labels it doesn't want to lose leave it vulnerableto disasters like the recent Christmas period, when itdiscounted deeply to reduce heavy inventories. Penney'scatalog business -- a success story in the late 1980s -- isalso souring.   ---                  Looking to the Future                                                                                                                               BEST BETS                                                                                                        Dayton Hudson Dillard Department Stores Gap Limited May Department Stores Nordstrom Toys `R' Us Wal-Mart Stores Woolworth                                                                                                                           PROSPECTUS CLOUDY                                                                                                        Ames Department Stores Best Products Carter Hawley Hale Child World Federated/Allied Hills Department Stores Sears Roebuck                                                                                                                             REVIEWS MIXED                                                                                                        J.C.
