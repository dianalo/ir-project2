Instead of laying off employees and closing offices, thenation's largest discount broker is hiring more people andplans to open 15 new offices in the Midwest and East thisyear. Rather than cutting back on services, it is addingmore. Last year alone, it launched 11 new products, includingSecond Opinion, which faxes reports by other firms' stockanalysts to Schwab customers on request.</LP><TEXT>   The moves are a bold attempt to gain market share from thecompany's discount rivals while repositioning Schwab as amidsize competitor to the giant Wall Street brokers. &quot;As the1990s begin, we will make another advance in market sharebecause of the restructuring of Wall Street,&quot; says Charles R.Schwab, the firm's chairman and founder. &quot;Wall Street hasonce more taken a bite out of its own tail.&quot;   Most analysts applaud the strategy and the way Schwab isexecuting it. &quot;They are on the leading edge of what theretail brokerage business will be in the 1990s,&quot; says RichardRoss, a financial services marketing executive at Elrick andamp;Lavidge, a Chicago market-research firm. &quot;If left alone, theywill own it.&quot;   But a number of Schwab's competitors portray the firm'sexpansive game plan as a high-risk gamble during a time whenmany individual investors are still shunning the stockmarket. &quot;It's dangerous to expand the number of offices to125 at a time like this,&quot; says Jack White, president of JackWhite andamp; Co., a San Diego discount broker.   With all its new products and services, Schwab isn'ttrying to compete as the lowest price discount broker.Indeed, according to Mercer Inc., a New York firm that tracksdiscount commissions, Schwab's average commissions areslightly higher than those charged by Fidelity Investments'discount brokerage unit and Quick andamp; Reilly Inc. And they arealmost twice as high as some of the &quot;deep discount&quot; firms.   Still, Schwab's brokerage commissions are less than halfthose at full-service brokers, says Mercer president MarkColer. Full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. andShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. provide customers with a varietyof services, including stock-market research and a broker whooffers investment advice.   By offering almost as many services as the full-line firmsbut at a cheaper price, Schwab is betting that it can notonly increase the amount of business it does with existingdiscount-broker customers, but also snare customers fed upwith the big Wall Street houses.   &quot;Wall Street sold the public all that garbage,&quot; says Mr.Schwab, referring to junk bonds, no-load mutual funds, unittrusts and limited partnerships. &quot;They lost sight of the factthat individuals get angry and won't forget.&quot;   So far, Schwab's blueprint is working. Earnings doubled in1989, although they slipped 7.5% in the 1990 first quarter.Contrasted with a collection of weak and battered brokeragehouse stocks, Schwab surged to $15 from a low of $6.75 lastyear. The stock closed yesterday at $15.75, down 12.5 centsin New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   In addition Schwab has strong free cash flow for itsambitious expansion efforts. Schwab's reported earningsunderstate the amount of cash it has available to expand. Mr.Schwab bought back his company from BankAmerica Corp. in 1987in a $280 million leveraged buy-out, and the company haslarge depreciation and amortization that depress its reportedearnings but don't affect its cash.   One of Schwab's new growth areas is handling trades forfinancial advisers, who now have $3 billion of theircustomers' money with Schwab, up from nothing two and a halfyears ago. Schwab also is gaining a toehold in the corporatefinancial services market by providing 401(k) plans,stock-option financing and dividend-reinvestment plans foremployees.   Still, says Mr. Schwab, &quot;The base of the company is theindividual investor.&quot;   The firm offers two different trading systems forcustomers with personal computers. Now it is rolling outnationally its new TeleBroker trading service, which allowscustomers to trade and receive stock quotes and accountinformation with a Touch-Tone phone. Competitors FidelityInvestments and Quick andamp; Reilly also have computerizedtrading, but their systems are less elaborate and they don'tyet offer Touch-Tone trading.   Schwab also has been building up its assets undermanagement by selling services such as its Schwab One cashmanagement accounts, which combine a brokerage account with amoney market account with check-writing privileges and acredit card.   Schwab One balances have soared to a record $3 billion.The firm makes about seven-tenths of a cent on every dollar.&quot;It's not a big deal individually, but $50 to $100 for eachcustomer ends up as millions of dollars for the firm,&quot; saysMr. Schwab.   Schwab's Mutual Fund Marketplace allows customers toinvest in more than 400 no-load and low-load mutual funds,for a fee. It is becoming a significant revenue contributor,with $2.1 billion in assets. Of course, that pales besidesFidelity's huge mutual fund family. Fidelity also offers tobuy other mutual funds for customers, and Jack White also hasa mutual fund trading system.   Some competitors say all these extras could turn out aburden if the retail brokerage business constricts evenfurther. Tom Quick, president of Quick andamp; Reilly, says Schwab&quot;is involved in building market share at the expense ofprofits.&quot;   Doyle Lyons, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says thatSchwab's stock &quot;could be more vulnerable&quot; than otherbrokerage stocks in a downturn because of its increasedexpenses from new products and facilities.   Schwab executives counter such criticism. &quot;We have ourfoot on the gas pedal now,&quot; says Hugo Quackenbush, seniorvice president, &quot;but we can take it off at any time.&quot; In1988, he says Schwab cut costs drastically reducing itsbreak-even point from 16,000 trades a day to 8,000 trades.   Moreover, Schwab is betting that the 1990s won't be a10-year down cycle for the stock market. Demographics aremoving to favor the investment business and his firm, Mr.Schwab says. &quot;There'll be an increasingly older populationwith more money to invest, and there's a trend toward moreintelligent consumerism.&quot;   ---                 Comparing Commissions                                                                                                          Average commissions at discount and full-service brokeragefirms on 20 trades averaging $8,975 each                                                                                                                                                  AVERAGE TYPE OF BROKER                   COMMISSION PRICE                                                                                                        Deep Discounters                             $ 54 Average Discounters                            73 Banks                                          88 Big 3 -- (Schwab, Fidelity Quick andamp; Reilly)                                92 Full Service Brokers                          206                                                                                                          Source: Mercer Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
