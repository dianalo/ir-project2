This action is takenin response to amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA), enacted in the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984.Today's notice promulgates specific treatment standards and effective datesfor certain so-called ``First Third'' wastes. In addition, the Agency ispromulgating regulations implementing the land disposal restrictions forthose First Third wastes for which EPA is not establishing a treatmentstandard. Furthermore, today's rule establishes regulations that do not specificallyinvolve First Third wastes (or do not apply exclusively to such wastes).These actions include modifications to the existing requirements for the``no migration'' petition process and the rescission of the nationwidecapacity variance for hazardous wastes (other than contaminated soils)containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) granted by the Agency inthe July 8, 1987 rulemaking. The Agency is also amending the treatmentstandard applicable to certain California list HOC wastes to allow burningin industrial boilers and furnaces, and revising the treatment standardfor methylene chloride in spent solvent wastewaters from the pharmaceuticalindustry. EPA also is amending 40 CFR 266.20 to require that most hazardouswastes used in a manner constituting disposal meet the applicable treatmentstandards for the prohibited hazardous waste that they contain as a conditionof remaining exempt from other RCRA standards. Additionally, today's rulemodifies portions of the land disposal restrictions framework.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This final rule is effective August 8, 1988, exceptfor the modification to 40 CFR 268.5(h)(2), which becomes effective November8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>The official record for this rulemaking is identifiedas Docket Number F-88-LDR9-FFFFF and is located in the EPA RCRA Docket(located in the sub-basement) 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Summary of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and theLand Disposal Restrictions Framework <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Requirements </ITAG>The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), enacted on November 8,1984, prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes. Specifically, theamendments specify dates when particular groups of hazardous wastes areprohibited from land disposal unless ``it has been demonstrated to theAdministrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will beno migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous'' (RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1),(e)(1), (g)(5), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1), (e)(1), (g)(5)). Congress establisheda separate schedule for restricting the disposal by underground injectionof solvent- and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes, wastes referred tocollectively as California list hazardous wastes (RCRA section 3004(f)(2),42 U.S.C. 6924(f)(2)), and soil and debris resulting from CERCLA section104 and 106 response actions and RCRA corrective actions when the soiland debris contains listed spent solvent and dioxin hazardous wastes. The amendments also require the Agency to set ``levels or methods of treatment,if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantiallyreduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the wasteso that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environmentare minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Wastesthat meet treatment standards established by EPA are not prohibited andmay be land disposed. (The Agency can also grant a variance from a treatmentstandard by establishing a new treatability group and corresponding treatmentstandard for a specific waste following a successful petition demonstration).In addition, a hazardous waste that does not meet the treatment standardmay be land disposed provided the ``no migration'' demonstration specifiedin sections 3004 (d)(1), (e)(1) and (g)(5) is made. For the purposes of the restrictions, HSWA defines land disposal ``to include,but not be limited to, any placement of * * * hazardous waste in a landfill,surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatment facility,salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mine or cave''(RCRA section 3004(k), 42 U.S.C. 6924(k)). Although HSWA defines land disposal to include injection wells, disposalof solvents, dioxins, and California list wastes in injection wells iscovered on a separate schedule. The disposal of such wastes in deep wellsis subject to the land disposal restrictions by August 8, 1988. The land disposal restrictions are effective when promulgated unless theAdministrator grants a national variance from the statutory date and establishesa different date (not to exceed two years beyond the statutory deadline)based on ``the earliest date on which adequate alternative treatment, recovery,or disposal capacity which protects human health and the environment willbe available'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(2)). The Administratormay also grant a case-by-case extension of the statutory deadline for upto one year, renewable once for up to one additional year, when an applicant``demonstrates that there is a binding contractual commitment to constructor otherwise provide such alternative capacity but due to circumstancesbeyond the control of such applicant such alternative capacity cannot reasonablybe made available by such effective date'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(3), 42U.S.C. 6924(h)(3)). A case-by-case extension can be granted whether ornot a national capacity variance has been granted. The statute also allows treatment of hazardous wastes in surface impoundmentsthat meet certain minimum technological requirements (or certain exceptionsthereto). Treatment in surface impoundments is permissible provided thetreatment residues that do not meet the treatment standard(s), or applicablestatutory prohibition levels where no treatment standards have been established,are ``removed for subsequent management within one year of the entry ofthe waste into the surface impoundment'' (RCRA section 3005(j)(11)(B),42 U.S.C. 6925(j)(11)(B)). In addition to prohibiting the land disposal of hazardous wastes, Congressalso prohibited the storage of any waste which is prohibited from landdisposal unless ``such storage is solely for the purpose of the accumulationof such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate properrecovery, treatment or disposal'' (RCRA section 3004(j), 42 U.S.C. 6924(j)). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Solvents and Dioxins </ITAG>Effective November 8, 1986, HSWA prohibited land disposal (except by undergroundinjection into deep wells) of dioxin-containing hazardous wastes numberedF020, F021, F022, and F023 \1\<NOTE/> and solvent-containing hazardous wastes numbered F001, F002,F003, F004, and F005 listed in 40 CFR 261.31 (RCRA sections 3004 (e)(1),(e)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (e)(1), (e)(2)). Effective August 8, 1988, the disposalof these wastes into deep injection wells is prohibited (RCRA section 3004(f)(2), (f)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (f)(2), (f)(3)). During the period endingNovember 8, 1988, this prohibition does not apply to disposal of solventand dioxin contaminated soil or debris resulting from a response actiontaken under section 104 or 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or a corrective actiontaken under Subtitle C of RCRA (RCRA section 3004(e)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924(e)(3)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The final dioxin rulemaking (50 FR 1978, January 14, 1985)contains three waste codes, F026, F027, and F028, not specified in thestatute. The additional waste codes are a result of reorganizations anddo not represent a substantive departure from the waste codes enumeratedin section 3004(e)(1). On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated a final rule (51 FR 40572) implementingRCRA section 3004(e). This rule not only established the general frameworkfor the land disposal restrictions program, but also established treatmentstandards for the F001-F005 solvent wastes and F020-F023 and F026-F028dioxin-containing wastes. For a more detailed summary of the land disposalrestrictions framework, including those regulations promulgated in theNovember 7, 1986 final rule, refer to the April 8, 1988 proposal (53 FR11742). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. California List Wastes </ITAG>Effective July 8, 1987, the statute prohibited further land disposal (exceptby deep well injection) of the following wastes listed or identified undersection 3001 of RCRA.<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated withany solid or sludge, containing free cyanides at concentrations greaterthan or equal to 1,000 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated withany solid or sludge, containing the following metals (or elements) or compoundsof these metals (or elements) at concentrations greater than or equal tothose specified below: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) arsenic and/or compounds (as As) 500 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) cadmium and/or compounds (as Cd) 100 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) chromium (VI and/or compounds (as Cr VI)) 500 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) lead and/or compounds (as Pb) 500 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) mercury and/or compounds (as Hg) 20 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) nickel and/or compounds (as Ni) 134 mg/l; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vii) selenium and/or compounds (as Se) 100 mg/l; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(viii) thallium and/or compounds (as Tl) 130 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Liquid hazardous waste having a pH less than or equal to two (2.0).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) Hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs)in total concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1), (d)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1), (d)(2)).Effective August 8, 1988, the underground injection into deep wells ofthese wastes is prohibited (RCRA section 3004 (f)(2), (f)(3), 42 U.S.C.6924 (f)(2), (f)(3)). During the period ending November 8, 1988, thereis no prohibition on the land disposal of California list wastes that arecontaminated soil or debris resulting from a response action taken undersection 104 or 106 of CERCLA or a corrective action taken under SubtitleC of RCRA (RCRA section 3004(e)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924(e)(3)). On July 8, 1987, EPA promulgated a final rule (52 FR 25760) implementingRCRA section 3004(d). This rule established treatment standards for Californialist wastes containing PCBs and certain HOCs, and codified the statutoryprohibition on liquid corrosive wastes. The statutory prohibition is ineffect for the California list wastes containing free cyanides, metals,and the California list dilute HOC wastewaters. For a more detailed summaryof the land disposal restrictions framework, including the regulationsand modifications promulgated in the July 8, 1987 rule, refer to the April8, 1988 proposal (53 FR 11742). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Scheduled Wastes</ITAG>The amendments required the Agency to prepare a schedule by November 8,1986 for restricting the land disposal of all hazardous wastes listed oridentified as of November 8, 1984 in 40 CFR Part 261, excluding solvent-and dioxin-containing wastes and California list wastes covered under theschedule set by Congress. The schedule, based on a ranking of the listedwastes that considers their intrinsic hazard and their volume, is to ensurethat prohibitions and treatment standards are promulgated first for highvolume hazardous wastes with high intrinsic hazard before standards areset for low volume wastes with low intrinsic hazard. The statute furtherrequires that these determinations be made by the following deadlines:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) At least one-third of all listed hazardous wastes by August 8,1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) At least two-thirds of all listed hazardous wastes by June 8,1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) All remaining listed hazardous wastes and all hazardous wastesidentified as of November 8, 1984, by one or more of the characteristicsdefined in 40 CFR Part 261 by May 8, 1990.</ITAG>If EPA fails to set a treatment standard by the statutory deadline forany hazardous waste in the first third or second third of the schedule,the waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment provided``such facility'' is in compliance with the minimum technological requirementsspecified in RCRA section 3004(o) (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)). [<T4>Note._</T4>In today's final rule, EPA is interpreting the term ``suchfacility'' in 3004(g)(6) to refer to the individual surface impoundmentor landfill unit]. In addition, prior to disposal, the generator must certifyto the Administrator that he has investigated the availability of treatmentcapacity and has determined that disposal in such landfill or surface impoundmentis the only practical alternative to treatment currently available to thegenerator. This restriction on the use of landfills and surface impoundmentsapplies until EPA sets a treatment standard for the waste or until May8, 1990, whichever is sooner. Other forms of land disposal are not similarlyrestricted and may continue to be used for disposal of untreated wastesuntil EPA promulgates a treatment standard or until May 8, 1990, whicheveris sooner. If the Agency fails to set a treatment standard for any scheduledhazardous waste by May 8, 1990, the waste is automatically prohibited fromall forms of land disposal after that time unless the waste is the subjectof a successful ``no migration'' demonstration (RCRA section 3004(g)(5),42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(5)). (Also, the May 8, 1990 effective date may be extendedunder RCRA section 3004(h)(2) for certain Second Third and Third Thirdwastes, and until August 8, 1990 for certain First Third wastes.) In aMay 28, 1986 final rule (51 FR 19300), EPA published the schedule for settingtreatment standards for the listed and identified hazardous wastes. Allwastes that are identified as hazardous by characteristic are scheduledin the Third Third, as required by RCRA. This schedule is incorporatedin 40 CFR 268.10, 268.11, and 268.12. Today's final rule promulgates the conditions under which wastes includedin the first one third of the schedule of restricted hazardous wastes listedin 40 CFR 268.10 (First Third) may continue to be land disposed. This rulefinalizes the April 8, 1988 (53 FR 17578) and May 17, 1988 (53 FR 15000)proposed rulemakings. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Newly Identified and Listed Wastes </ITAG>RCRA requires the Agency to make a land disposal prohibition determinationfor any hazardous waste that is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR Part261 after November 8, 1984 within six months of the date of identificationor listing (RCRA section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). However, thestatute does not provide for an automatic prohibition of the land disposalof such wastes if EPA fails to meet this deadline. B. Summary of the Proposed Rules <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Approach </ITAG>In the interest of allowing the regulated community the most time possiblefor notice and comment on the Agency's approach to implementing RCRA section3004(g), EPA believed it was prudent to propose today's rule in two separatenotices. The first proposal, April 8, 1988 (53 FR 11742), proposed treatmentstandards and effective dates for 24 listed hazardous wastes. This proposalalso presented and solicited comment on the Agency's approach to implementingthe ``soft hammer'' provisions pursuant to RCRA section 3004(g)(6), whichare applicable to First Third wastes for which EPA has not set treatmentstandards or effective dates. If EPA fails to set treatment standards forany Second Third wastes by June 8, 1989, the ``soft hammer'' provisionswill also be applicable. Amendments to the ``no migration'' petition processand to certain of the framework regulations, were also proposed in theApril 8 notice. The second proposal, May 17, 1988 (53 FR 17578), proposed treatment standardsand effective dates for 17 additional listed hazardous wastes. Also presentedin the second proposal were new capacity determinations based on the 1987National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal and RecyclingFacilities. These new capacity determinations revised the effective datesproposed in the April 8, 1988 proposal for several waste codes, and alsoproposed to rescind certain national variances granted in previous rulemakings(November 7, 1986, 51 FR 40572; July 8, 1987, 52 FR 25760). Today's rulemaking finalizes both the April 8 and May 17 proposals. Theland disposal restrictions effective dates for First Third wastes whichare disposed in deep injection wells are not addressed in this final rule,but rather, are being addressed in a separate rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Applicability </ITAG>In both the April 8, 1988 and May 17, 1988 proposals, EPA clarified theapplicability of treatment standards to wastes derived from the treatment,storage or disposal of listed wastes and to mixtures of prohibited hazardouswastes or nonwaste matrices (such as soil). The Agency emphasized the followingtwo points: 1. All of the residues resulting from treatment of the original listedwastes are likewise considered to be the listed waste by virtue of thederived-from rule contained in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2). Consequently, all ofthe residues generated in the course of treatment would be prohibited fromland disposal unless they satisfy the applicable treatment standard ormeet one of the exceptions to the prohibition. 2. In general, treatment standards contain concentration levels for wastewatersand concentration levels for nonwastewaters (i.e., wastewaters and nonwastewatersare identified as separate treatability groups). These treatment standardsapply to residuals resulting from treatment of the original prohibitedwaste. Thus, all solids resulting from treatment of a prohibited wastewould have to meet the treatment standard for nonwastewaters. Likewise,wastewaters resulting from treatment (e.g., scrubber waters from incineration)would have to meet the wastewater treatment standards. EPA wishes to makeclear that this approach is not meant to allow partial treatment only tochange the applicable treatment standard. In addition, the Agency clarified the applicability of the treatment standardsto residues resulting from types of management other than treatment. Examplesare contaminated soil or leachate derived from managing the waste. In thesecases, the mixture is deemed to be the listed waste, either because ofthe derived-from rule, the mixture rule (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)), or becausethe listed waste is contained in the matrix (see e.g., 40 CFR 261.3(d)(2),40 CFR 261.33(d), RCRA section 3004(e)(3)). Thus, the prohibition for theparticular listed waste applies to this type of waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT) </ITAG>In the April 8 and May 17 proposals, the Agency defined the waste treatabilitygroups by waste codes (generally separating the waste codes into ``wastewater''and ``nonwastewater'' treatability groups) and identified the Best DemonstratedAvailable Technologies (BDAT) for each treatability group. Treatment standardsapplicable to the specific waste codes (and treatability groups) are basedon the treatment performance levels achievable by the corresponding BDATidentified for each treatability group. Although treatment standards aregenerally expressed as concentration levels that represent the performanceof BDAT, EPA wishes to clarify that any technology not otherwise prohibited(i.e., impermissible dilution) may be used to meet the applicable treatmentstandards. Specifically, compliance with the land disposal restrictionstreatment standards is achieved by meeting the numerical performance standardsestablished for each constituent. The specific technology (BDAT) upon whichthe standards are based does not need to be used (except when technologiesare set as the standards, e.g. halogenated organic compounds (HOCs)). In the April 8, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 11742), incineration was proposedas BDAT for waste codes K015, K016, K018, K019, K020, K024, K030, K037,and K048-K052 (and the proposed treatment standards consequently were basedupon the performance of that technology). Chromium reduction, followedby chemical precipitation and vacuum filtration was proposed as BDAT forK062. Solvent extraction followed by incineration of the extract and bysteam stripping and activated carbon adsorption for the wastewater streamwas proposed as BDAT for K103 and K104. High temperature metals recoverywas proposed as BDAT for K061. For K071, acid leaching and chemical oxidationwas proposed as BDAT for nonwastewaters, and sulfide precipitation andfiltration was proposed as BDAT for wastewaters. Total recycle was proposedas BDAT for K069 wastes. EPA determined that the wastes K004, K008, K036,K073, and K100 are no longer being generated and disposed, and therefore,did not identify BDAT for these wastes. In the May 17, 1988 proposal (53 FR 17578), stabilization was proposedas BDAT for waste codes F006 and K046. For waste codes K001 and K086 (solventwashes and sludges subcategory), BDAT was proposed as incineration followedby stabilization of nonwastewater residuals and chromium reduction followedby chemical precipitation for wastewater residuals. The proposed BDAT fornonwastewater forms of K022 was proposed as fuel substitution followedby metals stabilization and metals precipitation of scrubber water. Fuelsubstitution or incineration was the proposed BDAT for K083. EPA proposedrotary kiln incineration as BDAT for K087 and solicited information tosupport a conclusion that total recycling could be accomplished for someK087 subcategories. BDAT for K099 was proposed as chemical oxidation withchlorine. Incineration followed by stabilization of ash residues to immobilizethe metals was the proposed BDAT for both K101 and K102. BDAT was proposedas thermal recovery for K106 nonwastewaters and sulfide precipitation followedby filtration for K106 wastewaters. The Agency determined that waste codesK021, K025, and K060, were no longer generated, and thus ``No Land Disposal''was the proposed BDAT treatment standard. Waste codes K044, K045, and K047also had ``No Land Disposal'' as the proposed treatment standard becauseopen burning/open detonation was identified as treatment for these reactivewastes. Because open burning and open detonation are not considered tobe land disposal provided that no reactive constituents remain after detonation(see 51 FR 40580), there would be no land disposal of a hazardous waste(see 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iii)). EPA also proposed to revise the treatment standard for methylene chloridein F001-F005 wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry to be based onthe performance of steam stripping. Furthermore, in the May 17, 1988 proposal,EPA solicited additional comment on an approach that would amend the andSection;268.42(c)(2) treatment standards to allow burning of California list HOCsin industrial boilers and furnaces (as well as incinerators) in accordancewith applicable regulatory requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Waste Analysis Requirements </ITAG>In the April 8, 1988 proposal, EPA presented its approach to waste analysis(see 53 FR 11764). Since treatment standards represent the performancelevel of BDAT applied to a particular waste, the Agency's approach wasto require waste analysis that best measures what the BDAT treatment technologyis intended to accomplish (even though use of the identified BDAT is notrequired). For example, if incineration (a destruction technology) is identifiedas BDAT, then the treatment standards are expressed as total constituentconcentration levels (i.e., waste analysis is a total composition analysis,rather than an extract analysis) to evaluate whether destruction occursoptimally. Similarly, if stabilization (an immobilization technology) isidentified as BDAT, then the treatment standards are expressed as constituentconcentration levels in a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)(see 40 CFR Part 268 Appendix I) extract to reflect whether immobilizationhas been optimized. The Agency also clarified that in cases where a combination of both a destructionor removal technology and a stabilization or fixation technology is identifiedas BDAT, then both analyses must be employed to monitor compliance withthe treatment standards. In such cases, neither test alone is designedto ensure that the technology-based treatment standards (which would beexpressed as both total composition and TCLP extract concentration levels)have been met. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Nationwide Variance from the Effective Date </ITAG>Due to the lack of sufficient alternative protective treatment or recoverycapacity to treat certain of the wastes to the applicable treatment standards,a national capacity variance was proposed for several of the waste codesaddressed in the April 8 and May 17 proposals. This determination was basedon a comparison of the volumes of wastes requiring treatment to the amountof treatment capacity available for such treatment. Although EPA usuallydoes not require that BDAT technologies be used to meet the applicabletreatment standards (unless the technology is specified as the treatmentstandard for the waste in andSection; 268.42), capacity figures are derivedbased on technologies identified as BDAT, to ensure that adequate treatmentis available to meet the treatment standards. In the April 8 notice, EPA proposed a two-year national variance from theeffective date for K016, K018, KO19, K020, K024, K030, K037, K048-K052,K061, K071, K103 and K104. However, the Agency also noted that new capacitydeterminations would be presented (and thus, these proposed variances wouldbe revisited) in a supplemental proposal (i.e., the May 17 proposal). In the May 17 notice, EPA proposed a two-year national variance from theeffective date for one additional waste code, K106, and for certain contaminatedsoils (First Third) that require solids incineration capacity. Also, theAgency revised the April 8 proposal, and proposed not to grant a variancefor K016, K018, K019, K020, K024, K030, K037, K103, and K104. Therefore,the First Third wastes for which a two-year national variance from theeffective date was proposed are K048, K049, K050, K051, K052, K061, K071and K106. In addition, the May 17 notice proposed a two-year capacity variancefor certain contaminated soils that require solids incineration capacity.The variance was proposed for soils contaminated with First Third wastes,and soils from RCRA and CERCLA response actions contaminated with solvents,dioxins and California list wastes. Additionally, the May 17 proposal revisited certain national variancesgranted by previous rulemakings (i.e., November 7, 1986, 51 FR 40572; andJuly 8, 1987, 52 FR 25760). In light of new capacity data indicating thatsufficient liquid incineration capacity exists to incinerate or thermallycombust certain wastes, EPA proposed to rescind the variances granted forthe following wastes: (a) Spent solvent wastes identified as EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F001-F005generated by small quantity generators producing from 100-1,000 kilogramsof hazardous waste per month; (b) Solvent waste generated from section 104 or 106 response actions underCERCLA or any RCRA corrective action, except where the waste is contaminatedsoil or debris; and (c) Hazardous wastes containing HOCs in concentrations greater than orequal to 1,000 mg/l, except for California list HOC contaminated soils.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. ``Soft Hammer'' Requirements </ITAG>In the April 8 proposal, the Agency presented its approach to implementingRCRA section 3004(g)(6), the so-called ``soft hammer'' provision. This``soft hammer'' provision applies to First Third (and Second Third) wastesfor which EPA fails to set treatment standards and effective dates by thestatutory deadlines (for First Third wastes, this deadline is August 8,1988), and applies until May 8, 1990 or until EPA promulgates treatmentstandards, whichever is sooner.EPA interpreted the statutory provision to apply only to such First Thirdwastes when they are disposed in landfill and surface impoundment units,and further interpreted the statutory language to require that such disposalunits must meet the minimum technological requirements of RCRA section3004(o) (double liner, leachate collection system, and ground water monitoring,or equivalent performance as provided in RCRA section 3004(o)(2)). TheAgency's approach to the ``soft hammer'' provisions required that the generator(or owner or operator) certify that there is no treatment practically availablethat meaningfully reduces toxicity or mobility of the waste and that, therefore,disposal of these wastes in a landfill or surface impoundment unit thatmeets the minimum technological requirements of section 3004(o) is theonly practical alternative. This certification would also apply to those``soft hammer'' wastes for which treatment was practically available andwhich have been treated to reduce toxicity or mobility and for which nofurther treatment is practically available; thus, disposal of the treatmentresiduals in a landfill or surface impoundment unit that meets the minimumtechnological requirements is the only alternative. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. ``No Migration'' Petition Requirements </ITAG>The April 8 proposal also included amendments to 40 CFR 268.6, the ``nomigration'' petition process. The Agency did not present its interpretationof the statutory ``no migration'' language of RCRA section 3004 (d), (e),and (g) for surface disposal units; this interpretation will be presentedin a separate rulemaking. The amendments presented in the April 8 noticedid, however, propose additional requirements relating to: (a) Documenting compliance with other applicable laws; (b) Submitting monitoring plans; (c) Procedures to be followed if there are changes in operating conditionsafter an exemption is granted; and (d) Procedures to follow upon detection of hazardous constituent migration.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Comparative Risk Assessment </ITAG>In both the April 8 and May 17 proposals, EPA presented a change in itsapproach to using comparative risk assessment as a decision tool in thedetermination of ``available'' treatment technologies. In the developmentof regulations restricting the land disposal of certain spent solvent anddioxin-containing wastes (November 7, 1986 final rule) and California listwastes (July 8, 1987 final rule), comparative risk assessments were conductedto ensure that technologies which presented greater risk than land disposalof untreated wastes were not considered in identifying BDAT. These analysesdid not affect the determinations of whether a treatment was considered``available''. Upon further consideration of the existing comparative risk analysis, EPAdecided not to utilize this assessment to determine ``available'' technologiesin the First Third proposals. EPA did, however, present the possibilityof conducting risk analyses in the future to distinguish between the overalldegree of risk posed by alternative treatment technologies and to makedeterminations concerning the ``best'' technology based on net risk posedby the alternative technologies. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Modifications to the Framework </ITAG>In both the April 8 and May 17 notices, the Agency proposed several modificationsto the existing framework for the land disposal restrictions found in 40CFR Part 268. EPA's implementation of the ``soft hammer'' provision, whichrestricts the disposal in landfills and surface impoundments of First Thirdwastes for which EPA has not set a treatment standard, was proposed in40 CFR 268.8. Additional regulatory amendments were proposed to accountfor the First Third wastes, and especially, ``soft hammer'' wastes. EPA also proposed to amend the recordkeeping requirements of andSection;268.7. The amendments would require storage facilities to be brought intothe recordkeeping system, and also require generators to keep copies ofthe notices, certifications, and waste analyses that are associated witheach shipment of restricted wastes. These changes help to ensure that arestricted waste can be tracked from the point of generation to its ultimatedestination. Additionally, the Agency proposed to set a five-year limitationon the time period that such records are required to be retained by thegenerator. In the April 8 proposal, EPA proposed changes to the regulatory languagein andSection; 268.6 concerning ``no migration'' petitions that reflect thenew requirements presented in the April 8 preamble. In the May 17 proposal,EPA proposed amendments (based on recent capacity data) to certain variancesgranted in previous rulemakings. The Agency also proposed certain otherrelatively minor changes to the framework provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Today's Final Rule </ITAG>A. Applicability Today the Agency is promulgating treatment standards and effective datesfor only certain First Third wastes (i.e., those hazardous wastes listedin 40 CFR 268.10, promulgated in May 28, 1986 (51 FR 19300) pursuant toRCRA section 3004(g)). For those wastes listed in andSection; 268.10 forwhich EPA does not establish treatment standards or effective dates, theAgency is promulgating regulations to allow for continued land disposalin andSection; 268.8. These so-called ``soft hammer'' provisions (discussedin detail in section III.C. of today's preamble) apply until May 8, 1990,or until treatment standards or extensions to the effective date are promulgated,whichever is sooner. On May 8, 1990, there is an automatic prohibitionon the land disposal of hazardous wastes listed or identified prior tothe enactment of HSWA. [<T4>Note._</T4>Today's rule does not establish treatment standards forany of the P- or U-list wastes in andSection; 268.10. However, certain ofthese wastes may be subject to the California list halogenated organiccompounds treatment standards, once the standards become effective.] Also, this rule clarifies the relationship of the California list finalrule (July 8, 1987, 52 FR 25760) to First Third wastes (see section III.E.). In addition, this rule clarifies the applicability of Part 268 SubpartD treatment standards to ``derived-from'' wastes and waste mixtures (seesection III. A. 4.). In addition, the Agency notes that the treatment standards it is promulgatingtoday are not applicable to First Third wastes that are disposed by deep-wellinjection. (See RCRA section 3004(g)(5) authorizing EPA to prohibit ``oneor more methods of land disposal'' of scheduled hazardous wastes; in thisrulemaking, EPA is prohibiting disposal in surface units of most of thewastes in the first third of the schedule; EPA will address disposal bydeep-well injection in a later rulemaking.) Wastes that are disposed bydeep-well injection are regulated under 40 CFR Part 148, and the applicabilityof today's 40 CFR Subpart D treatment standards to such wastes will beaddressed in a separate rulemaking. Until that time, First Third wastesdisposed by deep-well injection are subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisionsof andSection; 268.8. B. Waste Analysis and Recordkeeping Requirements The Agency is today promulgating the approach to waste analysis_what toanalyze to evaluate the performance of the treatment technology_was proposed.Basically, where BDAT is a destruction or removal technology, waste analysisthat is most appropriate for measuring such destruction or removal is required_i.e.,total waste analysis. Similarly, where BDAT is identified as an immobilizationtechnology (e.g., stabilization), waste analysis that most appropriatelymeasures mobilization is required_i.e., analysis of a waste extract. Incases where both technologies are identified as BDAT, both types of wasteanalyses are required. For a more detailed discussion, see section III.B. In addition, the Agency is today promulgating a 5-year record retentionrequirement, as proposed in the May 17, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. This discussion is also included in sectionIII. B. of today's preamble. C. Treatment Standards and Effective Dates Today's final rule establishes treatment standards and effective datesfor many First Third wastes. In section III. A., the Agency identifiesthe waste treatability groups by waste codes and identifies the Best DemonstratedAvailable Technology (BDAT) for each waste code. Treatment standards applicableto each treatability group are based on the performance levels achievableby the corresponding BDAT identified for each treatability group. The Agencystrongly reiterates that any technology not otherwise prohibited (i.e.,impermissible dilution) may be used to meet the concentration based treatmentstandards. Also, EPA is promulgating amendments to the existing treatment standardsfor wastewaters containing methylene chloride (as a spent solvent) generatedby the pharmaceutical industry, and for California list halogenated organiccompounds. See section III. A. for further discussions. Effective dates are established based on the Agency's determination ofwhether sufficient protective treatment (or recovery) capacity is availableto treat the restricted wastes. Although the regulated community is notrequired to treat restricted wastes with the technology identified as BDAT(where treatment standards are expressed as concentration levels), theAgency generally bases its capacity determination on the availability ofthis technology, thus helping to ensure that adequate treatment capacityis currently avaiIable to treat wastes in compliance with the applicabletreatment standard. For a detailed discussion of capacity, refer to sectionIII. H. D. ``Soft Hammer'' Requirements Section III. C. of today's preamble discusses the requirements applicableto those First Third wastes for which treatment standards or effectivedates have not been promulgated. Basically, the generator must demonstrateand certify that there is no practically available treatment that reducestoxicity or mobility of the waste and that disposal of these wastes ina landfill or surface impoundment unit that meets the minimum technologicalrequirements of RCRA section 3004(o) (double liner, leachate collectionsystem, and ground water monitoring) is the only practical alternative.If treatment is practically available, the generator must certify thathis waste is being treated by the best treatment (i.e., the treatment whichprovides the most environmental benefit) practically available, as indicatedin his demonstration. The residuals from treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastesremain ``soft hammer'' wastes, and if disposed in a landfill or surfaceimpoundment unit, must be placed in a unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of 3004(o) (including section 3004(o)(2) if an appropriatedemonstration can be made). E. Reinterpretation of RCRA Section 3004(h)(4) As discussed in section III. D., the Agency is promulgating its reinterpretationof RCRA section 3004(h)(4) as presented in the April 8, 1988, proposal.This interpretation effects the disposal of restricted wastes which havebeen granted an extension to the effective date (either a national capacityvariance or a case-by-case extension) in a landfill or surface impoundment.Under the interpretation promulgated today and effective on November 8,1988 (during the interim period, the original interpretation applies),if such restricted wastes are disposed in a landfill or surface impoundmentunit, the individual landfill or surface impoundment<T3> unit</T3> must meet the minimum technological requirements of RCRAsection 3004(o). F. ``No Migration'' Requirements As discussed in section III. F., the Agency is today promulgating amendmentsto 40 CFR 268.6, the ``no migration'' petition process. As proposed onApril 8, 1988, these amendments cover the demonstrations required in thepetition and certain other requirements on the owner or operator of a wastemanagement unit that is subject to a ``no migration'' variance. G. Nonrulemaking Procedures for Site-Specific Variances From the TreatmentStandard The Agency is promulgating amendments to the existing 40 CFR 268.44 tomodify the procedures for obtaining site-specific variances from the treatmentstandard. This action is taken in response to commenters' request for amore streamlined procedural mechanism for obtaining a variance from thetreatment standard. EPA believes that, in certain cases, informal rulemakingare neither required nor warranted, and that a more streamlined procedurefor obtaining a variance from the treatment standard is justified. Thisapproach is discussed in more detail in section III. K. of today's preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Detailed Discussion of Today's Final Rule </ITAG>A. Determination of Treatability Groups and Development of Treatment Standards<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Treatability Groups </ITAG>For the First Third wastes, EPA used the individual listed waste codesas the starting point for developing waste treatability groups. In caseswhere EPA believed that wastes represented by different codes could betreated to similar concentrations using identical technologies, the Agencycombined the codes into one treatability group. EPA based its initial treatabilitygroup decisions primarily on whether the waste codes were generated bythe same or by similar industries from similar processes. EPA believesthat such groupings can be made because of the high likelihood that thewaste characteristics which affect treatment performance will be similarfor these different waste codes. This conclusion is explained in more detailin the relevant background document for each particular waste code. The treatment standards in today's rule generally contain concentrationspresented constituent by constituent for ``wastewaters'' and for ``nonwastewaters''.The treatment standards apply to the wastes as generated as well as allof the residual wastes generated in treating the original prohibited waste.See RCRA section 3004(m)(2) indicating that treatment standards apply bothto wastes and to treatment residuals therefrom. Thus, for example, allK101 and K102 wastes (including the solid residuals generated from treatingK101 and K102) would have to meet the treatment standards for nonwastewatersand all wastewaters (including those generated from treating these wastes)would have to meet the treatment standards for wastewaters. For the purposeof defining the applicability of the treatment standard in this rule, theAgency defines wastewaters as wastes that contain less than 1% total organiccarbon (TOC) and less than 1% total suspended solids (i.e., total filterablesolids) except for those wastes identified as F001, F002, F003, F004, and/orF005 where the Agency indicated a different definition of the solvent wastewatertreatability group (see 51 FR 40579 for the definition of a solvent-watermixture). Those wastes that do not meet this definition are consideredto be nonwastewaters. A facility is not allowed to dilute or perform partialtreatment on a waste in order to switch the applicability of a nonwastewaterstandard to a wastewater standard or vice versa. However, EPA wishes to emphasize that where a waste that consists primarilyof water (such as a leachate) is classified as a nonwastewater solely byits filterable solids content (i.e., total suspended solids (TSS) levels),the waste can be subjected to dewatering techniques to remove the filterablesolids. Treatment standards for nonwastewaters are then applicable to thefiltered solids. The filtrate is then subject to the treatment standardsfor the wastewaters, assuming that the filterable solids content has beenreduced to less than one percent by weight. These standards are applicableif the wastes are to be placed in land disposal units, according to theappropriate provisions of today's rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Identification of BDAT </ITAG>A detailed discussion of the Agency's general methodology for establishingBDAT standards is provided in 51 FR 40572 (November 7, 1986). Section III.A. of today's preamble discusses the specific application of the methodologyto the First Third wastes, and provides a summary of some of the principalelements of the BDAT methodology. Consistent with the general methodology, EPA first determined which technologieswere ``demonstrated'' for a particular treatability group. EPA then screenedthe available treatment data for a particular treatability group with regardto the design and operation of the system, the quality assurance/qualitycontrol analyses of the data, and the analytical tests used to assess treatmentperformance. This screening step is consistent with EPA's promulgated approachin the November 7, 1986, rulemaking for solvent waste codes F001-F005.Also, this screening step recognizes the fact that different performancemeasures may be appropriate depending on the technology used (e.g., totalconstituent analysis for destruction of organics by incineration technologiesversus TCLP analysis for immobilization of metal constituents by stabilizationtechnologies). EPA was able to emphasize the design and operation of thetreatment system for the First Third wastes because its field tests havebeen modified to gather detailed data to support these analyses. After the initial screening test, EPA adjusted all treated data valuesbased on the analytical recovery obtained in order to take into accountanalytical interferences associated with the chemical makeup of the treatedsample. For example, a treated residual data point of 0.2 mg/kg with ananalytical recovery of 50 percent would be adjusted to 0.4 mg/kg. After adjusting the data, EPA then averaged the performance levels achievedfor the various treatment operations (for which the Agency had completedata) and compared the mean values using the analysis of variance test(ANOVA), as described in the November 7, 1986, preamble (see 51 FR 40591),to determine if one technology performed significantly better. In general,where one technology performed better, it was determined to be ``Best''.If this technology was also determined to be ``Available'' (i.e., it iscommercially available and provides substantial treatment), then the technologywas selected as the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT). In caseswhere EPA only has data on one technology, but is aware of other demonstratedtechnologies, EPA used its engineering judgment to determine that theseother technologies would not be expected to significantly improve the levelof performance. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Compliance with Performance Standards </ITAG>Treatment standards promulgated in today's rule are performance standardsreflecting the performance achieved by ``BDAT''. As such, compliance withthese standards requires only that the treatment level be achieved priorto land disposal. It does not require the use of any particular treatmenttechnology. While dilution of the waste as a means to comply with the standardis prohibited, wastes that are generated in such a way as to naturallymeet the standard can be land disposed without treatment. With the exceptionof treatment standards that prohibit land disposal, all treatment standardsproposed today are expressed as concentration levels either in the waste(andSection; 268.43) or in an extract of the waste (andSection; 268.41). It is important to note that several commenters misinterpreted EPA's positionon compliance with the performance standards and the identification ofa technology as the basis for BDAT. The specific technologies identifiedas the basis for BDAT for each waste code are simply those technologieswhich EPA utilized to develop the waste-specific performance standards.A comparable methodology exists under the Clean Water Act in establishingBPT, BAT, PSES, NSPS, and PSNS effluent limitation guidelines and standards.Any technology or combination of technologies not otherwise prohibited(i.e., impermissible dilution) can be used to achieve these standards.EPA has not, in this First Third final rule, prohibited the use of anyother applicable treatment or recycling technology unless that technologyis considered to be land disposal. In today's rulemaking, EPA has used both total constituent concentrationand TCLP analyses of the treated waste as measures of technology performance.For all organic and cyanide constituents, EPA is basing the treatment standardson the total constituent concentration found in the treated waste. EPAbased its decision on the fact that technologies exist to remove or destroythese constituents. Accordingly, the best measure of performance wouldbe the extent to which the various organic compounds have been removedor destroyed (as measured by the total amount of constituent remainingafter treatment). The legislative history emphasizes the desirability ofactually destroying organic hazardous constituents [Vol. 130, Cong. Rec.S9179 (daily ed. July 25, 1984)]. [Note._EPA's land disposal restrictionsfor solvent waste codes F001-F005 and dioxin waste codes F020-F023, F026-F028(51 FR 40572) use the TCLP value as a measure of performance. At the timethat EPA promulgated the treatment standards for the solvents and dioxins,useful data were not available on total constituent concentrations in treatedresiduals and, as a result, the TCLP data were considered to be the bestmeasure of performance.] Where the Agency has based treatment standardson removal/recovery or destruction, whether metals or organics, the treatmentstandards thus are based on total waste analysis. In cases where treatment standards for metals are based on stabilization,EPA is using the TCLP as the measure of the treatment technology's performance.The Agency's rationale is that stabilization is meant to chemically andphysically minimize the mobility of the metals in the waste and that theTCLP test is specifically designed to measure the mobility of the hazardousconstituents. For wastes where treatment standards are based on sequentialtreatment processes due to the presence of organics and metals, the wastemust meet both total constituent concentrations for organics and TCLP concentrationsfor metals prior to land disposal. In both the April 8, 1988 and the May 17, 1988 proposed rules for the FirstThird wastes, the proposed treatment standards were reported with a varyingnumber of significant figures. The final standards in today's rule havebeen adjusted and rounded off to a maximum of two significant figures (insome cases, a particular standard may have only one significant figure).EPA did not intend that any greater accuracy be achieved other than thatwhich is attainable through the standard analytical methods employed todevelop the treatment data.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Mixtures and Other ``Derived-From''Residues </ITAG>In a number of instances in today's rule, BDAT consists of an operationor series of treatment operations which generate additional waste residues.For example, BDAT for wastes K101 and K102 is based on incineration followedby metals (ash) stabilization. Incineration generates two residues requiringtreatment, namely the ash residues and the scrubber waters. Treatment ofthe scrubber waters (to remove metals) may generate further additionalinorganic residues which also may require stabilization. Ultimately, theseadditional wastes may require land disposal and must, therefore, meet thesame standards as the stabilized ash residues. With respect to these additionalwastes, the Agency wishes to emphasize that all of the residues from treatmentof the original listed wastes are considered to be the listed waste byvirtue of the derived-from rule contained in 40 CFR Part 261.3(c)(2). Consequently,all of the wastes generated in the course of treatment would be prohibitedfrom land disposal unless they satisfy the applicable treatment standardor meet one of the exceptions to the prohibition. The Agency has not performed tests in all cases on every waste that canresult from every part of the treatment train. However, the Agency's treatmentstandards are based on treatment of the most concentrated form of the waste.Consequently, the Agency believes that the less concentrated wastes generatedin the course of treatment can be treated to these standards. Today's treatment standards also apply to waste mixtures; i.e., mixturesof different waste streams. As the Agency has repeatedly stated in previouspreambles, the more stringent standard applies in cases where a waste mixturehas two or more applicable treatment standards. The Agency believes thatsuch wastes can be treated to the meet the treatment standards applicableto the underlying wastes for several reasons. Waste mixtures commonly resultin a waste in which individual constituents are less concentrated thanin the original wastes. Also, in establishing treatment standards, theAgency allows for a reasonable amount of variability in the generationand treatment of the waste. Finally, while EPA believes that waste mixturescan be treated to meet the treatment standards, the rules do contain aprocedure that allows a petitioner to gain a variance from the treatmentstandard by demonstrating that his waste cannot be treated to the levelspecified in the rule (see 40 CFR 268.44). To date, the Agency has notreceived a petition for such a variance, indicating that the treatmentstandards currently in effect are achievable. The Agency, however, has determined that one class of waste mixtures_mixedhazardous/radioactive wastes_should not be included in the First Thirdand is amending andSection; 268.12 (the Third Third) to move such wastesto the final third of the scheduled wastes. Therefore, these wastes willnot be prohibited from land disposal until May 8, 1990. The Agency is takingthis action based on the relatively small volumes of such wastes beinggenerated; while the individual hazardous wastes may be generated in largevolumes, the mixed hazardous/radioactive wastes are not. The Agency notesthat this action only affects First Third wastes; spent solvents, dioxinsand California list wastes that are mixed with radioactive wastes are subjectto the applicable treatment standards when the standards are effective.[<T4>Note</T4>._As discussed in section III. C. 3. a., the Agency believesthat the schedule is absolutely committed to its discretion, and that theschedule of prohibited wastes therefore can be amended without notice andcomment.] EPA discussed in detail in the May 17, 1988, preamble the principle thatresidues from managing listed wastes, or that contain listed wastes, arecovered by the prohibition for the listed waste (53 FR 17586). EPA madethe following points: (1) Hazardous waste listings are retroactive, so that once a particularwaste is listed, all wastes meeting that description are hazardous wastesno matter when disposed. (As discussed below, this does not mean that suchwastes are necessarily subject to Subtitle C regulation, only that theyare hazardous wastes.) For example, if on August 9, 1988, EPA were to listdistillation bottoms from production of X as a hazardous waste, all suchdistillation bottoms would be hazardous wastes, regardless of when theyare or were generated. They are the thing that is listed. (2) Residues derived from treating, storing, or disposing of these wastesare therefore also hazardous by virtue of the derived-from rule (andSection;261.3(c)(2)), the mixture rule, or in some cases, because the waste itselfis still found in the matrix (see andSection; 261.3(d)(2)). (3) Consequently, for purposes of the land disposal restrictions program,residues from managing First Third wastes, listed California list wastes,and spent solvent and dioxin wastes are all considered to be subject tothe prohibitions for the underlying listed hazardous wastes. Public comment centered on the implications of these principles with respectto management of leachate that derives from management of listed hazardouswastes. The Agency indicated that leachate could be affected by these principles:The derived from-rule explicitly mentions leachate as a type of derived-fromresidue that is covered by that rule, and since the statute includes ``leaking''within the definition of ``disposal'', leachate leaking from listed wastesis therefore derived from the disposal of these wastes. As explained morefully below, however, certain of the commenters' concerns regarding leachate(for example, implications for permitting of inactive or subtitle D disposalunits) appear to be misplaced. Commenters also argued that in many cases, leachate could not be treatedto the BDAT treatment levels because it is a different type of waste fromthe one on which the treatment standards were based. Commenters submittedcertain data to support these assertions. Commenters also made the pointthat since leachate can contain all or most of the listed waste codes,and the Agency has indicated that waste matrices containing a number ofprohibited wastes must be treated to meet the most stringent standard forevery waste contained in the matrix, it would be hard to design a treatmentsystem for leachate since it would not be clear what the ultimate treatmentstandard would be until EPA finishes developing treatment standards forall of the listed hazardous wastes. A variation of this comment was thattreatment standards for different wastes contributing to leachate couldbe incompatible, making it impossible to treat all constituents to theapplicable treatment standards. Commenters also stated that EPA had notaccounted for treatment of leachate in its capacity estimates. A numberof commenters made the further point that, especially with respect to subtitleD non-hazardous waste units, EPA's reading tended to penalize persons voluntarilycollecting and treating leachate who had kept accurate historic recordsof what wastes went into the disposal unit. Finally, several commenterssuggested that leachate should be viewed as a separate treatability groupand that the Agency should develop separate treatment standards for it.EPA first addresses those comments which disputed the Agency's interpretationof its own rules. The Agency will then address those comments questioningthe applicability to leachate and other derived-from wastes of treatmentstandards based upon treatment of the waste from which the waste is derived.a. <T3>Retroactivity of Waste Listings. </T3>A few commenters disputed theAgency's reading that hazardous waste listings are retroactive; that is,all wastes meeting the listing description are hazardous regardless ofwhen they were disposed. EPA believes this point to be nearly self-evident:a waste either does or does not match a listing description. The time atwhich a waste was disposed does not affect what that waste is. Spent solventstill bottoms disposed of in 1979 (before Agency action listing these wastesas hazardous) are as much spent solvent still bottoms as those disposedin 1981 (after the listing took effect). In addition, there are a whole series of statutory provisions that giveretroactive application to hazardous waste listings. Section 103(c) ofCERCLA, enacted in November 1980 and implemented by rule in April 1981,provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)ny person who owns or operates or who at the time of disposal ownedor operated * * * a facility at which [hazardous wastes identified or listedunder RCRA section 3001] are or have been stored, treated, or disposedof shall, unless such facility has a permit issued under subtitle C of[RCRA], notify the Administrator * * * of the existence of such facility.* * * 42 U.S.C. 9603(c).</ITAG>This language indicates that wastes that have been disposed in inactivefacilities are still RCRA hazardous wastes once they are identified orlisted, and that owners and operators of the facilities where the hazardouswastes had been disposed are required to notify the Agency of the wastes'existence. In fact, by the terms of the statute, the provision applies<T3>only</T3> to hazardous wastes at inactive facilities_facilities withthe waste which ceased managing the waste before it was identified or listed_becauseany facility with interim status or a permit is explicitly exempted fromthe CERCLA notification requirement. EPA's implementation of these rulesfollowed this literal statutory language and thus required all inactivefacilities still holding hazardous waste that the Agency had since identifiedor listed to notify EPA (46 FR 22146, 22149; April 25, 1981). Thus, EPAand Congress indicated that the Agency's listing regulations applied retroactivelyto hazardous wastes in inactive units, i.e., to units that ceased activemanagement before the effective date of the subtitle C regulations. EPA, in its May 17, 1988 notice, also cited RCRA sections 3004 (d)(3) and(e)(3) as further support for the proposition that hazardous waste listingsapply to wastes whose management ceased before the date of the listing.These provisions provide that contaminated soil and debris that containlisted spent solvent or dioxin-containing hazardous wastes (or certainother wastes mentioned in section 3004(d)(2)) generated by a response actionunder section 104 or 106 of CERCLA, or by corrective action required underRCRA section 3004(u), remain subject (on a slower timetable) to the landdisposal restrictions provisions. RCRA section 3020(b) is a similar provision.It provides that groundwater that is contaminated with hazardous wastegenerated by a CERCLA response or a RCRA corrective action is not subjectto an otherwise-applicable prohibition on disposal in certain types ofunderground injection wells (provided that the contaminated groundwateris managed in accordance with certain specified standards). Commenters argued that these provisions do not define what is a hazardouswaste and therefore do not show that listed wastes are necessarily affectedby these provisions. These provisions were added to the statute so as notto impede the pace of certain ongoing cleanup actions (See S. Rep. No.284, 98th Cong. 2d Sess. 21). Most of the wastes from these cleanup actionswere deposited at the sites before 1980. For example, all of the dioxin-containingwastes at the Missouri dioxin sites were deposited before 1980 (well beforethese wastes were listed in 1985). EPA believes that the obvious readingof these provisions is that Congress considered the wastes being removedfrom these actions to be listed wastes_the dioxin-containing wastes atthe Missouri sites are good examples_and therefore adjusted the land disposalrestrictions effective date for these wastes accordingly (or in the caseof section 3020(b), accommodated certain types of cleanups involving reinjectionof hazardous wastes). The Agency does not believe it makes sense to assume,as the commenters did, that these provisions apply only to the small percentageof CERCLA and corrective action response wastes that exhibit a RCRA characteristicor are listed by name (i.e., ``leachate from Missouri dioxin sites'').(One commenter stated mistakenly that EPA actually had listed dioxin-containingsoil and debris; the dioxin listings, F020-F023, F026-F028, apply onlyto process wastes and to ash from incinerating contaminated soil. EPA indicatedin the preamble to these listings that contaminated soil and other mixedand derived from residues would be affected by the listings (see 50 FR1994, Jan. 14, 1985). This is by virtue of the mixture and derived fromrules, or because the listed waste would be contained in a matrix likesoil.) EPA believes therefore that the hazardous waste listings can be retroactive.Thus, wastes derived from treating, storing, or disposing of these wasteslikewise are hazardous, as are mixtures of these wastes and other solidwastes. For land disposal restrictions purposes, this means that theseresidues could become subject to the land disposal restrictions for thelisted waste from which they derive if they are managed actively afterthe effective date of the land disposal prohibition for the underlyingwaste.b. <T3>Derived-From Wastes Have the Same Waste Code as the Waste From WhichThey are Derived. </T3>EPA disagrees with those commenters that said thatderived-from or mixed wastes do not have the same waste code as the wastefrom which they are derived, are mixed with, or that they contain. Thederived-from and mixture rules state, in essence, that listed wastes remainhazardous until delisted. What other hazardous wastes could these listedwastes be if not the waste from which they are derived or mixed? (Indeed,how were all of these wastes covered under the land disposal restrictionsschedules in andSection;andSection; 268.10-268.12 if not under the waste codes,since the schedule nowhere lists leachate or other derived-from residualsseparately.) (Cf. <T3>O'Leary </T3>v. <T3>Moyer's Landfill, Inc., </T3>523 F. Supp. 642, 656 (E.D. Pa. 1981)(``A hazardous waste does not lose that description because it is mixedwith some other waste, or is found in leachate, 40 CFR 261.3(a)[sic](2)(ii)* * *; indeed, leachate from hazardous waste is an important target ofRCRA.'')) The Agency's delisting regulations make this point by requiringpetitioners with mixed or derived-from wastes to make the same demonstrationthat a delisting petitioner would make for the underlying waste (40 CFR260.22(b)). The delisting petitioner also may prove that the waste as awhole is not hazardous, as can any delisting petitioner with respect toany hazardous waste. Indeed, there have been dozens of delisting petitionsfiled to delist residues derived from treating or disposing of multiplewastes, and it is clear from these petitions and Agency action that theseresidues are deemed to be listed wastes covered by the original waste codes(see, e.g. 51 FR 41324; November 14, 1986 (delisting Envirite treatmentresidues from treating multiple wastes, stating that the delisting is for``treatment residue (EPA hazardous waste numbers F006, F007, F008, F009,F011, F012, F019, K002, K003, K004, K005, K006, K007, K008, and K062)'').EPA also believes that section 3004(e)(3) confirms this position by statingthat soils and debris contaminated with the listed solvent and dioxin wastesbecome subject to the prohibitions for the listed wastes even though theyare not the waste itself, but rather a type of residue from managementof the waste. In this regard, EPA notes that other land disposal restrictionsprovisions likewise equate prohibited wastes and residues from their management.Section 3004(m)(2) thus states that when a prohibited waste has been treatedto the level or by the method specified by EPA (pursuant to section 3004(m)(1)),then ``such waste or residue thereof'' is no longer prohibited from landdisposal. One commenter also stated, incorrectly, that the Agency itself does notfollow this principle in its own CERCLA program. In fact, when EPA identifiesa waste at a CERCLA response site as deriving from management of a listedwaste, the residue <T3>is</T3> considered to be the listed waste. EPA in fact considered suchwastes in its capacity estimates for each of the waste prohibitions adoptedor proposed to date, surely an unnecessary action unless such residuesare prohibited by virtue of the prohibition for the listed waste (see,e.g. 51 FR 40611; November 7, 1986). The same commenter asserted erroneously that EPA had stated that solventmixtures were not covered by the section 3004(e) prohibition on listedsolvent wastes. EPA actually stated that certain solvent formulations containing10 percent or more solvent ingredients which were listed as hazardous forthe first time on December 31, 1985, were not covered by the prohibitionfor F001-F005 wastes (51 FR 40584; November 7, 1986). This statement hasnothing to do with mixtures of hazardous waste spent solvents and othersolid wastes, which are covered by the section 3004(e)(3) prohibition.(Indeed, when EPA initially proposed the solvent prohibition, many commenterscriticized the Agency's capacity estimates for not taking into accountmixture and derived-from rule residuals containing these listed wastes,all of which residues were covered by the prohibition and which thereforeneeded to be assessed (51 FR 40611; Nov. 7, 1986). EPA's final capacityestimates for the solvent prohibition rule therefore included all of theseresidues.) c. <T3>Consequences of EPA's Interpretation are Exaggerated. </T3>Commentersexpressed significant concerns that EPA's interpretation would lead toRCRA permitting of all inactive hazardous waste sites that collect leachate.They believed that if leaching is considered to be a form of disposal (whichit is, since leaking is occurring, see RCRA section 1004(3)), then unitsfrom which leachate is leaking are thereby subtitle C management unitssubject to all of the RCRA requirements. This reading is not correct. The permitting requirement under RCRA section3005(a) applies to new and existing disposal facilities. ``Disposal facility''is defined in the rules as ``a facility * * * at which hazardous wasteis intentionally placed into or on any land or water, and at which wastewill remain after closure'' (see andSection; 260.10). Section 3005(a) prohibitsthe operation of such facilities without a permit after the effective dateof the permitting regulations, November 19, 1980. Thus, only facilitieswhere hazardous waste is intentionally placed into land or water afterNovember 19, 1980 require a RCRA disposal permit. Collection of hazardousleachate at otherwise inactive units consequently does not activate theunit. A second concern dealt with subtitle D facilities that generate leachate.Commenters expressed concern that because these landfills all acceptedsmall quantity generator listed hazardous wastes, all leachate from thesefacilities was thereby hazardous by the derived from rule. EPA, however,does not read the derived from rule as applying to small quantity generatorhazardous wastes. Although the rules are not explicit on this point, theAgency views this exemption, like other comparable provisions such as thehousehold waste exclusion, as applying cradle-to-grave so that residuesfrom managing the waste retain the exemption or exclusion. In this regard,the rules are explicit that the mixture rule does not apply to mixturesof small quantity generator wastes and solid wastes (see andSection; 261.5(h)).EPA views the derived from rule as similarly inapplicable. d. <T3>EPA's Reading Creates Negative Environmental Incentives. </T3>EPA issensitive to the comment that its reading penalizes facilities that collecttheir leachate and have accurate, historic records of what wastes wereaccepted at the units. However, this assertion is not completely correct.Facilities collecting hazardous leachate can manage the leachate in sucha way as not to trigger subtitle C requirements (including the land disposalrestrictions) by managing the leachate in tanks at facilities subject toregulation under the Clean Water Act (see andSection; 264.1(g)(6)). Consequently,the reading most directly discourages subsequent management in surfaceimpoundments, a reasonable outcome given the statutory antipathy for thesedevices (see RCRA section 1002(b)(7)). Indeed, the statute even allowsotherwise prohibited hazardous wastes to be managed in particular typesof surface impoundments without first meeting pretreatment standards (althoughunlike treatment tanks, such impoundments are regulated units) (see RCRAsection 3005(j)(11)), so what the Agency's interpretation actually discouragesis management in surface impoundments that do not satisfy the section 3005(j)(11)standards. In addition, since the derived-from rule merely shifts the burdenof proving that a derived-from waste is not hazardous, truly non-hazardousleachate derived from listed wastes can be delisted. There have, in fact,been delisting applications filed to delist leachate derived from listedhazardous wastes that were disposed before 1980.Finally, EPA does not accept the argument that facilities are better offif they do not collect contaminated leachate, and so will discontinue voluntarycollection. Continued release of such leachate exposes the facility toCERCLA liability, common law tort liability, and possibly criminal liabilityunder intentional endangerment statutes. What EPA's reading does is toensure that once hazardous derived-from residues are collected, their subsequentmanagement will be controlled under the statute designed to control managementof hazardous waste. EPA has no other statutory tool for assuring prospectivelythat proper management will occur. In fact, in the end, what EPA findsmost troubling in the commenters' arguments is that hazardous residuesfrom inactive sites could be withdrawn and managed without regard for RCRArequirements. Thus, for example, under the commenters' position, leachatefrom sites where chlorophenoxy pesticide residues were disposed could becollected and taken to non-subtitle C units (unlined impoundments, forexample) because the leachate would not be considered to be a hazardouswaste. This is because the waste from which the leachate is derived wasdisposed before the effective date of the listing, and the leachate doesnot exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics. Indeed, under someof the commenters' arguments, collecting and managing the waste itselfat these sites (rather than the leachate derived from the waste's disposal)would not trigger subtitle C requirements. EPA does not find this resultto be in accord with statutory policies or the language of the regulations.e. <T3>Whether Leachate Can Meet the Treatment Standards for the Wastes FromWhich It Is Derived. </T3>Commenters also argued that landfill leachatecould not typically be treated to meet the treatment standards in the rule.They also maintained that leachate (or at least leachate from commercialwaste disposal facilities) should have its own treatability group reflectingits significant difference from the wastes from which it is derived. EPA stated at proposal that although it is correct that EPA's treatmentstandards are based on treating single wastes, leachate that is derivedfrom disposal of these wastes could be treated to meet the treatment standardsbecause leachate typically is more dilute than the waste from which itis derived. Thus, for example, if the original wastewater contains 200ppm of methylene chloride, while leachate from disposal of the waste contains5 ppm of methylene chloride, the leachate could be treated to meet a standardbased on treating the waste with 200 ppm methylene chloride. EPA also notedthat a treatability variance was available to accommodate those situationswhere leachate could not be treated to meet the treatment standards (53FR 17586; May 17, 1988). Commenters assert, however, that commercial leachate is not just from onewaste, but from many. Even so, EPA still believes that leachate, even frommultiple waste codes, can be treated to meet the underlying wastewatertreatment standards because it contains lower concentrations of the constituentsof concern than the wastes on which the treatment standards are based.Nor has the Agency seen evidence that leachate typically contains interferingagents, not found in the original wastes, that impede treatment performance.EPA has carefully examined the data submitted during the public commentperiod, and finds that it essentially confirms the Agency's statementsat proposal. That is, the leachate has comparable or lower levels (in somecases, orders of magnitude lower) than the wastes on which treatment standardsare based. None of the data suggest that leachate from commercial facilitiesis somehow so exceptional that it cannot be treated to meet the standards.(Indeed, of these data, many of the samples would meet the treatment standardsas generated and so would not require treatment at all.) The Agency expectsthat where groundwater contaminated with leachate is being treated in pump-andtreat operations, the standards can be met with existing technology. Thetreatability variance in section 268.44 also is available in those caseswhere leachate proves to be untreatable to the applicable standard forthe prohibited wastes that it contains. EPA also has carefully considered comments that leachate deriving frommultiple waste codes will be subject to conflicting, multiple treatmentstandards. Examples contained in the public comments were of leachate derivedfrom wastes whose treatment standards were based on both oxidation andreduction technologies. Another example was of leachate derived partiallyfrom wastes whose treatment standards require total constituent analysis(because treatment is based on destruction of organics), and partiallyderived from other wastes whose treatment standards require TCLP analysis(for fixation of inorganics). EPA does not find these examples persuasive.Waste constituents can be treated sequentially in treatment trains to avoidthe types of alleged incompatibilities. For example, if leachate containsboth cyanide and hexavalent chromium, cyanide can be oxidized in a tank,and hexavalent chromium can be reduced and precipitated afterwards in aseparate tank. Leachate containing both organics and inorganics can betreated in a treatment train with organics being stripped, followed bymetals being precipitated. Many of the treatment standards for First Thirdwastes are in fact based upon treatment trains of these types. Several commenters complained of the unfairness of planning to meet a ``movingtarget'' of treatment standards. That is, they maintained that becauseleachate contains (or potentially contains) many or even most of the listedwaste codes, they will not know until completion of the land disposal restrictionsin 1990 what ultimate treatment standards for leachate will be, given thatthe leachate will have to be treated to meet the most stringent level forthe constituents for which there are overlapping treatment standards. EPAbelieves, however, that ultimate treatment standards for wastewaters willnot differ to any great degree. Wastewater treatment technologies are relativelystandardized, and achieve performance results that are similar unless thematrices are exceptionally contaminated or contain high concentrationsof interfering agents. Based on the data presently available, EPA has notfound this to be the case with leachate, even leachate from commercialhazardous waste landfills. Thus, EPA believes that conventional wastewatertreatment technologies or treatment trains_for example, some type of strippingtechnology followed by a type of chemical precipitation_will generallybe able to achieve treatment standards for leachate. To the extent thisbecomes an issue as EPA proposes treatment standards for the remaininghazardous wastes, commenters can present data showing that conventionalwaste treatment systems for leachate are unable to achieve treatment standards.No such data were presented with regard to leachate containing solventsand First Third prohibited wastes, in the Agency's view. Since these wastestend to be the most contaminated (see the statutory prioritization of solventsand the Agency's prioritization of First Third wastes based on RCRA section3004(g)(5)), EPA believes it reasonable that subsequent treatment standardswill be comparable to those already adopted. Finally, regarding comments on the capacity to treat leachate, most collectedleachate is presently treated in a way that does not even implicate RCRA,and so does not create a demand on available capacity. Thus, as noted above,tanks that treat leachate (and any other wastewater) at facilities subjectto regulation under the Clean Water Act's NPDES or pretreatment programsare exempt from almost all RCRA regulation. Most leachate is treated intanks, according to comments and the Agency's own information, and so doesnot require additional treatment capacity. Commenters noted that some facilitieshave impoundments that are used to perform polishing type treatment ofleachate, but EPA believes, based on the information presented, that leachatecan be treated to meet treatment standards before being placed in impoundmentsso that impounded leachate need not create demands on existing treatmentcapacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Transfer of Treatment Standards </ITAG>In today's rule, some treatment standards are not based on testing of thetreatment technology on the specific waste subject to the treatment standard.Instead, the Agency determined that the constituents present in the wastecan be treated to the same performance levels as observed in other wastesfor which EPA has previously developed treatment data. EPA believes transferringtreatment performance from tested to untested wastes is valid technically.Transfer of treatment standards to wastes from similar processing stepsrequires little formal analysis because of the likelihood that similarproduction processes will produce a waste matrix with similar characteristics.However, in the case where the industries are similar, but other aspectsof production processes may be dissimilar, EPA more closely examines thewaste characteristics prior to concluding that the untested waste constituentscan be treated to levels associated with tested wastes. EPA undertakes a two-step analysis when determining whether wastes generatedby different processes can be treated to the same level of performance.First, EPA reviews the available waste characteristic data to identifythose parameters which are expected to affect treatment selection. EPAhas identified some of the most important constituents and other parametersneeded to select the treatment technology appropriate for a given waste.Second, when an individual analysis suggests that an untested waste canbe treated with the same technology as a waste for which treatment performancedata are already available, EPA then analyzes a more detailed list of constituentsthat represent some of the most important waste characteristics which theAgency believes will affect the performance of the technology. By examiningand comparing these characteristics, the Agency determines whether theuntested wastes will achieve the same level of treatment as the testedwaste. Where the Agency determines that the untested waste can be treatedas well as the tested waste, the treatment standards can be transferred.A detailed discussion of this transfer process for each waste and constituentcan be found in the BDAT background documents for each waste or waste treatabilitygroup. Several commenters stated that they do not believe that standards for certainconstituents could be transferred to certain waste codes. EPA's responseto these comments are addressed in the sections of today's preamble thatdiscuss that particular waste code or treatability group. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. No Land Disposal as the BDAT Treatment Standard </ITAG>EPA is establishing ``no land disposal'' as the treatment standard forseveral of the First Third wastes. This standard is analogous to the zerodischarge standard established as Best Available Technology (BAT) underthe Clean Water Act's effluent guideline program. It indicates that afterexamining available data, the Agency has identified that: (1) The wastecan be totally recycled without generating a prohibited residue; or (2)the waste is not currently being land disposed; or (3) the waste is nolonger being generated. Several commenters provided information that for certain wastes that oneor more of these premises is invalid. In those cases, the Agency will notfinalize the treatment standard of ``no land disposal'', and will not establisha treatment standard for that waste in today's rule. The soft hammer provisions,as discussed elsewhere in this preamble, will therefore apply for thosewastes or subcategories of wastes. EPA intends to develop treatment standardsfor these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. For those nonwastewaters for which no specific comments were received refutingthe validity of EPA's basis for ``no land disposal'', EPA has promulgatedthe standard as final. EPA has not promulgated a ``no land disposal'' standardas final for any wastewaters. Since First Third wastes have been historicallymanaged in land disposal units, EPA recognizes that the potential existsfor the generation of leachate from these land disposal units. Based onwaste characterization data submitted by several commenters, leachatesappear to meet EPA's definition of wastewaters. Therefore, EPA believesthat constituent standards must be established for wastewaters (i.e., leachates)and that a ``no land disposal'' is not justified based on the premise of``no generation''. It is important to point out that this standard is notintended to imply that the waste was so extremely hazardous that it couldnot be safely land disposed or handled, but rather that alternative formsof management exist for them. The Agency believes that where it has finalizeda treatment standard of ``no land disposal'', there should either be nogeneration of this type of waste or that such generated wastes can be handledin a manner that will not require land disposal. In cases where a wasteis generated and the basis for the ``no land disposal'' standard was thatthe waste was not being generated, or where a waste is significantly differentthan the waste examined by EPA (e.g., a specific spill residue), a personmay petition the Agency for a treatment standard applicable to their wasteusing the provisions of andSection; 268.44. Prior to May 8, 1990, the Agencycould also, through a rulemaking, make the ``soft hammer'' provisions ofandSection; 268.8 applicable in these situations.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Waste Specific Treatment Standards </ITAG>This section describes the development of BDAT treatment standards forall of the First Third wastes covered by today's rule. a. <T3>Revision of BDAT Treatment Standard for Methylene Chloride in Wastewatersfrom the Pharmaceutical Industry Listed as F001, F002, F003, F004 and/orF005. </T3>Today's rule promulgates the proposed revision to the treatmentstandard for methylene chloride in F001-F005 wastewaters from the pharmaceuticalindustry. Where EPA has set a treatment standard, it is not precluded fromrevising that standard after the statutory date provided that rulemakingprocedures are followed. RCRA section 3004(m)(1) states specifically thattreatment standards are to be revised as appropriate. EPA believes thatrevision of this standard at this time is appropriate and timely, sincethe effective date for compliance will occur on November 8, 1988. One commenter suggested that the Agency does not have adequate informationto justify using treatment data from an agricultural chemical facilityin determining the treatability of wastewaters from pharmaceutical facilities.In particular, the commenter believes that concentrations of methylenechloride, dissolved solids, methanol and the presence of other constituentsin the wastes from the pharmaceutical industry are significantly differentfrom those in the wastes that were studied by EPA and that these differenceswould affect the treatment performance for these wastes. Based on information provided in the background document for the proposedrule, data indicated that the wastewater from the agricultural facilitycontained methylene chloride concentrations ranging from 2,500 to 7,400ppm, while the wastewaters from the pharmaceutical plant contained concentrationsranging from 225 to 10,000 ppm. The Agency believes that this differencein methylene chloride concentrations is not significant and would not affectthe performance of the treatment system. In addition, the Agency believesthat a plant generating wastewaters with higher methylene chloride concentrationscould use a steam stripper treatment system of a larger design or one withan increased retention time in order to comply with these standards. Information provided in the background document for the proposed rule alsoshowed that the concentration of methanol in the pharmaceutical industrywastewaters ranged from 369 to 1,684 ppm while the concentration of methanolin the agricultural wastewaters ranged from 55 to 81 ppm. The Agency recognizesthat there is a difference in methanol concentrations; however, it believesthat the concentration of methanol would not affect the performance ofthe treatment system because methanol has a higher boiling point than methylenechloride and it does not form an azeotrope with methylene chloride. Infact, methanol forms a binary azeotrope with water at a specific temperatureand pressure. Commenters also cited the difference in dissolved solids levels betweenpharmaceutical wastewaters and agricultural wastewaters. Data show thatthe concentration of dissolved solids in the pharmaceutical wastewatersranged from 2,000 to 4,000 ppm, while the agricultural wastewaters rangedfrom 89,000 to 122,000 ppm. Although, the difference in concentration issignificant, the Agency believes that the agricultural wastewaters withhigher concentrations of total dissolved solids are more difficult to treat.Thus, EPA concludes that the wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industrywould be easier to steam strip due to the relatively lower dissolved solidscontent and therefore, should be able to meet the treatment standard. Therefore,EPA maintains that it does have adequate information to justify using treatmentdata from an agricultural chemical facility in determining the treatabilityof wastewaters from pharmaceutical facilities. Thus, the Agency is promulgatingthe standard for wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry based onthe transfer of treatment data for wastewaters from the agricultural industry.This treatment standard was established based on the performance of a steamstripping process. While the standard is based on data obtained from asteam stripping process, other treatment technologies that can achievethis standard are not precluded from use by this rule. The Agency feels that it is important to reiterate that none of the treatmentstandards for other hazardous constituents in F001-F005 wastewaters, orany hazardous constituents in F001-F005 nonwastewaters have been revised;these standards remain as promulgated on November 7, 1986 (51 FR 40572).Also, the Agency has not revised the standard for methylene chloride inF001-F005 wastewaters other than those from the pharmaceutical manufacturingindustry. The final revised BDAT treatment standard for methylene chloride in wastewatersidentified as F001, F002, F003, F004 and/or F005 from the pharmaceuticalsindustry is listed in the table following this section. (Note that thetreatment standard is reflected in the regulations by amending andSection;268.41 for wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry by removing methylenechloride and its corresponding concentration of 12.7 mg/l, and adding therevised treatment standard in andSection; 268.43). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,6,r44 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F001, F002, F003, F004, <T4>and </T4>F005 (<T4>Wastewaters</T4>) <ITAG tagnum="96">[Pharmaceuticals Industry Subcategory]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>0.44 </D><D>Not applicable.</D></ITAG></ITAG>  b. <T3>F006_Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating operations exceptfrom the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum;(2) tin plating on carbon steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) oncarbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel; (5)cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbonsteel; and (6) chemical etching and milling of aluminum. </T3>Today's rulepromulgates treatment standards for five constituents proposed for F006nonwastewaters. Individual standards based on the analysis of TCLP leachateshave been established for cadmium, total chromium, lead, nickel, and silverand are listed in the table at the end of this section. These treatment standards were established based on the performance ofa stabilization process using cement kiln dust as a binding agent. Otherstabilization binding agents and other treatment technologies that canachieve these standards are not precluded from use by this rule.At the time of this rule, the Agency had not completed its evaluation ofwaste characterization and treatment information for antimony, arsenic,barium, and selenium. The proposed rule contained the notation ``reserved''for these constituents, noting that EPA would be setting standards whenthe evaluation was completed. Several commenters suggested that a treatmentstandard of ``reserved'' was confusing to the regulated community and unnecessary.Since individual standards would still have to be proposed and promulgatedthrough the normal rulemaking procedures, no benefit is achieved by the``reserved'' notation for these constituents. Therefore, the Agency hasdropped it from the final rule for this waste code. Several commenters argued that EPA should not regulate copper or zinc,as EPA proposed to do, because they are not hazardous constituents specificallylisted on Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261. The Agency does not totallyagree, in that both zinc cyanide and copper cyanide are listed on AppendixVIII, and both are or may be components of electroplating wastes. Further,EPA has determined that both zinc and copper are aquatic toxins, and theAgency considered adding them to Appendix VIII for that reason. However,in this rulemaking the Agency is only regulating zinc and copper when theyare indicators of performance of treatment of other Appendix VIII hazardousconstituents. Further, the Agency believes that these metal constituentsare controlled by treatment of the metal constituents that are regulatedby today's rule and therefore, is not promulgating standards for copperor zinc as part of the treatment standards for F006 nonwastewaters. F006 wastewater treatment sludges may contain treatable levels of cyanides.EPA does not consider stabilization_BDAT for the metals in this waste_tobe a demonstrated technology for the treatment of cyanide. The Agency iscurrently investigating the use of technologies such as electrolytic oxidation,alkaline chlorination, wet air oxidation, ozonation, and other chemicaloxidation as applicable technologies for F006 wastes that contain treatablequantities of cyanide. EPA will determine which of these technologies shouldbe the basis of the BDAT standard when these data become available laterthis year. Since EPA has insufficient information to establish either aseparate treatability group for F006 nonwastewaters containing treatablelevels of cyanide or a treatment standard for the cyanide contained inthem, the Agency is identifying the treatment standard as ``reserved''until a standard can be proposed later this year. Because the Agency believesthat a standard will be proposed within six months, the use of ``reserved''is important in assuring that generators focus their attention on the treatmentof cyanide as well as the metal constituents regulated in today's rule.It is also important to note that, until a standard for cyanide in F006nonwastewaters is promulgated, those F006 nonwastewaters containing cyanidesmay be land disposed, as long as they do not exceed the statutory cyanideconcentration prohibited under the statutory ``California List'' restrictions_namelyliquid hazardous wastes containing free cyanides at concentrations of 1000ppm or greater. [RCRA 3004(d), 42 U.S.C. 6924(d); see also 52 FR 25760,July 8, 1987]. Several commenters argued that dewatering technologies such as vacuum filtration,plate and frame pressure filtration, and centrifugation should be allowedand should be the basis for BDAT. While these technologies do reduce thewater content in the waste and generally reduce the volume of solid residualsthat require disposal, the Agency maintains that these technologies aremerely simple physical treatment technologies and generally do not provideany significant treatment of the metals or cyanide contained in the sludge.In cases where dewatering alone produces a residual that can meet the treatmentstandards, the Agency believes that it is the treatment prior to the dewateringstep that has provided the most effective treatment of the metal constituents.Dewatering technologies are not precluded from use by this regulation andcan be considered applicable technologies when the residuals meet the promulgatedtreatment standards or when dewatering is incorporated into an additionaltreatment train that produces a residual that can achieve these levels.Such a treatment train may include treatment technologies such as chromiumreduction, cyanide destruction, metals precipitation, settling, filtration(or centrifugation), and solidification. One commenter identified cases where metal recovery processes have beenused for metal-bearing sludges. However, at this time, their applicabilityto F006 treatment sludges has not been examined in order to develop additionalstandards. The concentrations and identity of metals in F006 wastes varydepending on the specific metals used in the plating process. EPA has notbeen able to define any particular subcategories of F006 wastes that wouldbe amenable to a particular recovery process. Commenters also insisted that because metal recovery processes for electroplatingwastewaters exist and are being used, EPA should establish a treatmentstandard of ``no land disposal'' for F006 and thereby, force all electroplatingwastewaters to recovery. EPA does not believe this alternative to be viablebecause it is not clear that all electroplating wastewaters are amenableto recovery, and even if they were, the recovery processes themselves generatea sludge which would be F006, and thus require a treatment standard. Thus,the concentrations and identity of metals in these wastewaters can varydepending on the specific metals used in the plating process. In addition,other wastewaters are often generated at electroplating facilities fromsump collections of floor rinsings, from accidental spills and from generalmaintenance. While these wastewaters may be potentially recovered by mixingwith other process waters, there is a strong possibility that they couldfoul the recovery process due to nonhazardous contaminants from the floor.Recovery processes often include reverse osmosis and cation exchange techniques.These techniques often produce acidic or caustic backwashes which alsomust be treated. The sludge from these processes would also be classifiedas F006. At this time, EPA has not been able to define any particular subcategoryof electroplating wastewaters that would be amenable to a particular recoveryprocess. Thus, the Agency believes that it is unlikely that a standardof ``no land disposal'' would be justified for all F006 wastes. It is importantto point out that, where EPA has set a treatment standard, it is not precludedfrom revising that standard after the statutory date provided that rulemakingprocedures are followed. F006 waste is a sludge consisting of precipitated residues generated followingtreatment of wastewaters from electroplating operations. Several commentershave identified specific sources of wastewater forms of F006 such as thosebeing generated at a CERCLA site, during a corrective action at a RCRAfacility, and as a leachate from a landfill. Since generation of F006 wastewatersdoes occur, the premise of no generation as a basis for the treatment standardof ``no land disposal'' appears to be unjustified. (Please note as an interpretivematter, that supernatant from F006 generation is not considered to be F006,but simply wastewater from treatment of electroplating wastewaters. Filtratefrom F006 sludges could be hazardous under the derived-from rule, but ifit is similar in terms of identity and concentration of constituents inthe influent to the wastewater treatment process, it is not consideredto be derived-from F006. Rather, it is the original influent wastewater.)The Agency is, therefore, not able to promulgate the treatment standardfor F006 wastewaters in today's rule. EPA does intend to propose and promulgatenumerical treatment standards for F006 wastewaters prior to May 8, 1990.It is likely that these standards will be based upon information availablefrom EPA's NPDES discharge limitation program for electroplating facilities.Since no standard is promulgated in today's rule for F006 wastewaters,this subgroup of wastes is restricted from land disposal according to the``soft hammer'' provisions described in other sections of this preamble.[<T4>Note._</T4>As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amendingandSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derivedfrom the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' wastecontaminated groundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewatersinto the group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these typesof F006 wastewaters are not subject to the ``soft hammer'' prohibitionsin andSection; 268.33(f). This action will allow these wastewater residuesto be disposed in nonminimum technology units and such residues will notbe subject to the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8.]<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F006 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\)</D><D>.072 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>(\2\) </D><D>(\2\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F><F>\2\ Reserved.</F></ITAG></ITAG> c. <T3>K001_Bottom sediment sludge from the treatment of wastewaters fromwood preserving processes that use creosote and/or pentachlorophenol. </T3>Today'srule promulgates treatment standards for K001 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.BDAT treatment standards for the organic constituents in K001 wastewatersand nonwastewaters were established based on the performance of a rotarykiln incinerator and specifically on the concentrations found in the residuals.BDAT treatment standards for the metal constituents in K001 nonwastewaters(ash residues) were established based on the performance of a stabilizationtreatment process and those for the metal constituents in K001 wastewaterswere based on chemical precipitation. Other treatment technologies suchas biodegradation, solvent extraction, and/or stabilization that can achievethese standards are not precluded from use by this rule. For all wastes identified as K001, EPA is promulgating final treatmentstandards for six organic constituents. These are naphthalene, pentachlorophenol,phenanthrene, pyrene, toluene, and xylenes. EPA is also promulgating finaltreatment standards for lead. The final standard for pentachlorophenolis the result of a relatively high analytical quantitation limit observedfor this particular K001 waste. No data was received which allowed EPAto lower this standard based on lower quantitation limits for pentachlorophenolin other K001 wastes. Therefore, the promulgated standard for this constituentis as proposed. EPA considered the establishment of treatment standards for polychlorinateddibenzofurans and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. In the proposed rule,EPA had specifically requested comments on this issue. However, no additionaldata was submitted which could be evaluated to propose numerical treatmentstandards for these constituents. Some commenters stated that if EPA setstandards for these particular hazardous constituents, no commercial facilitywould accept these wastes for treatment. In this final rule, EPA is notsetting treatment standards for these constituents. However, it is importantto point out that, where EPA has set a treatment standard, it is not precludedfrom revising that standard after the statutory date provided that rulemakingprocedures are followed. This includes the addition of hazardous constituentssuch as the polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins.Several commenters argued that EPA should not regulate copper or zinc,as EPA proposed to do, because they are not hazardous constituents specificallylisted on Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261. The Agency does not totallyagree, as discussed earlier. However, in this rulemaking the Agency isonly regulating zinc and copper when they are indicators of performanceof treatment of other Appendix VIII hazardous constituents. Further, theAgency believes that these metal constituents are controlled by treatmentof the metal constituents that are regulated by today's rule and therefore,is not promulgating standards for copper or zinc as part of the treatmentstandards for K001 wastes. Several commenters suggested that land treatment also can be consideredto be BDAT for this waste. Land treatment is defined as a form of landdisposal under section 3004(k). Treatment standards are those that applybefore land disposal; wastes must meet these standards before they canbe land disposed. See section 3004(m); see also sections 3004 (d), (e),(f), and (g), all of which refer to the (m) standards as pretreatment standardswhich apply before land disposal. Moreover, where Congress wished to allowa form of land disposal for wastes not already meeting the treatment standard,it said so directly. See section 3005(j)(11). There is no such directivefor treatment in land treatment units of wastes not already meeting thetreatment standard (or subject to some type of exception from a prohibition).Consequently, EPA must reject these commenters' suggestions as a matterof law.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8.2,8.2 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F001 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>8.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>37 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>8.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pyrene <D>7.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>.14 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>.16 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.51 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F001 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>0.15 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>.88 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>.15 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pyrene <D>.14 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>.14 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>.16 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.037 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>d. <T3>K015_Still bottoms from the distillation of benzyl chloride. </T3>TheBDAT treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for K015 nonwastewaterswas proposed based on the performance of a liquid injection incineratorand the fact that the waste contained no measurable ash (the solid residuefrom incineration). The detection limit for the ash content of the K015nonwastewaters studied by EPA was 0.01% by weight. Since no comments werereceived indicating generation of K015 wastes with detectable levels ofash, EPA has decided that the premise of ``no ash'' as a basis for thetreatment standard of ``no land disposal'' appears to be justified. Therefore,today's rule promulgates the final treatment standard of ``no land disposal''for all K015. One commenter expressed concern that if K015 were mixed witha waste that did contain an ash, the resultant ash would be subject tothe ``no land disposal'' standard for K015. EPA agrees with the commenterthat the standard would be applicable, but believes that blending witha waste or fuel that contains no ash is an option that allows compliancewith the ``no land disposal'' standard for K015. At the same time, EPAalso recognizes that K015 may be generated with an ash content if K015were inadvertently spilled (such as on soil). However, EPA cannot anticipatethis type of nonroutine generation and therefore, has to disagree withthese commenters. The Agency also believes that for situations such asthis, the petition processes for obtaining a variance from the treatmentstandard provides potential generators with a viable procedure for managingthe waste. The use of other treatment technologies are not precluded by this rule.For example, while rotary kiln and fluidized bed incinerators are generallydesigned to handle solids and sludges, these units often are designed toincinerate liquids. In any case, where these or other treatment technologiescan treat K015 without generating an ash or other solid residual, theseunits may be used to achieve the ``no land disposal'' standard for theK015 nonwastewaters. Today's rule also promulgates final treatment standards for K015 wastewatersfor all constituents as proposed. The regulated constituents are anthracene,benzal chloride, benzo (b and/or k) fluoranthene, phenanthrene, toluene,total chromium and nickel. BDAT treatment standards for the organic constituentswere established based on the performance of a liquid injection incinerationand the concentrations found in the scrubber water. BDAT treatment standardsfor the metal constituents in wastewaters were based on chemical precipitation.Because no comments were received on the proposed regulation of any ofthe specific constituents for K015 wastewaters, EPA assumes that generatorsof K015 wastes agree with EPA's assessment of the treatability of thesewastes.

These fivelisted hazardous wastes are generated in the production of chlorinatedchemicals in the organic chemical industry. The Agency noted in the April8, 1988 proposal (53 FR 11755) that K019 was originally scheduled for Part268 regulation in the Second Third (effective June 8, 1989). However, dueto the similarity between K019 and the other wastes in this treatabilitygroup (K016, K018, K020 and K030), the Agency has chosen to acceleratethe schedule for K019. Several commenters opposed this accelerated schedule for K019, statingthat business operations had been planned based on K019 being regulatedin June of 1989. However, the statute does not preclude EPA from prohibitingthe land disposal of a given waste ahead of schedule (and the schedulein andSection;andSection; 268.10-268.12 itself says that wastes will be evaluatedby a given date, indicating that the specified date is the latest timeby which EPA will act), and in fact compels the Agency to prohibit theland disposal of hazardous wastes as soon as possible. Having identifiedBDAT and developed treatment standards for K019 wastes, the Agency believesthe most prudent approach is to promulgate the standards and effectivedate as proposed. BDAT treatment standards for the organic constituents in these wastes arebased on the performance of rotary kiln incineration and the concentrationsfound in the residuals. Other treatment technologies such as fluidizedbed incineration, biodegradation, and solvent extraction, that can achievethese standards are not precluded from use by this rule. As described fully in the background document for these wastes, individualconstituent standards from waste code K019 have been transferred to thoseof constituents in waste codes K016, K018, K020, and K030. The Agency basedthis transfer of standards primarily on the physical and chemical similarityof the individual organic constituents as well as the similarities in overallcharacteristics of the individual wastes. Because no comments were receivedon the proposed regulation of any of the specific constituents for K016,K018, K019, K020 and K030 wastes, EPA assumes that generators of thesewastes agree with EPA's assessment that these treatment standards can beachieved. The regulated constituents and BDAT treatment standards for thesewastes are listed in the tables at the end of this section.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K016 <ITAG

<T3>K022_Distillation bottom tars from the production of phenol/acetonefrom cumene. </T3>Today's rule promulgates final treatment standards forK022 nonwastewaters as proposed. Treatment standards for the organic constituentsin these wastes are based on the performance of a fuel substitution unitand the concentrations found in the ash residuals. Treatment standardsfor the metal constituents in nonwastewaters (ash residues) are based onthe performance of a stabilization treatment process. Other treatment technologiessuch as liquid injection incineration, rotary kiln incineration, and fluidizedbed incineration, that can achieve these standards are not precluded fromuse by this rule. The variety in types of alternative incineration units that are potentiallyapplicable and are believed able to achieve the treatment standards, isprimarily due to the physical form of the K022 nonwastewaters. As initiallygenerated, K022 wastes are still bottoms that are typically pumped directlyfrom the distillation unit as viscous organic liquids, while they remainhot. Upon cooling, the viscosity of the waste will increase and K022 canbecome tarry and viscous. It can be kept fluidized by mixing it with variouslight hydrocarbons, waste olefinic oils or solvents. If not fluidized orkept hot, the waste will eventually harden into an organic solid. One commentersuggested that these viscous or hardened solids should be able to be reheatedand thus, fluidized. While the Agency has not verified this, it believesthat the immediate onsite management of the waste is the determining factoron whether the waste can be handled as a liquid or as a solid. For wastes identified as K022 nonwastewaters, EPA is promulgating finaltreatment standards for seven constituents. These are toluene, acetophenone,phenol, diphenylamine, diphenylnitrosamine, nickel and total chromium.The standard for diphenylamine and diphenylnitrosamine is listed as thesum of these constituents. This is necessary because the two compoundscannot be distinguished using EPA's standard analytical testing procedure.At the time of this rule, the Agency had not completed its evaluation ofwaste characterization and treatment information for sulfide. The proposedrule contained the notation ``reserved'' for these constituents, notingthat EPA would be setting standards when the evaluation was completed.Several commenters suggested that a treatment standard of ``reserved''was confusing to the regulated community and unnecessary. Since individualstandards would still have to be proposed and promulgated through the normalrulemaking procedures, no benefit is achieved by the ``reserved'' notationfor these constituents. Therefore, the Agency has dropped it from the finalrule for this waste code.In the proposed rule EPA considered establishing treatment standards forpolychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins for ashresiduals from the burning or incineration of K022 nonwastewaters. A sampleof untreated ash from the burning of K022 as a fuel substitute was analyzedfor isomers of chlorinated dibenzofurans and chlorinated dibenzodioxins.A trace amount (parts per trillion) of tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDF)was detected in this sample. This amount was determined to be below thetypical BDAT quantitation level for these compounds. In the proposed rule,EPA had specifically requested comments on the issue of regulating thesecompounds. Also, the Agency had noted that it was reexamining the analyticalquantification procedures for the reported tetrachlorodibenzofurans. TheAgency has since discovered that the laboratory that performed the analysisfor isomers of chlorinated dibenzofurans and chlorinated dibenzodioxinshad failed to provide audit samples or fortified (spiked) samples. Thus,the accuracy of quantification below the typical BDAT quantitation levelsfor the reported tetrachlorodibenzofurans can not be determined. EPA hasconcluded that additional analysis reproducing these results, with theproper QA/QC performed, would be required before EPA can consider developmentof treatment standards for these compounds. No additional data were submittedfrom commenters that could be evaluated to propose treatment standardsfor these constituents. As described fully in the background document for this waste, individualstandards for total chromium and nickel for the K022 nonwastewaters havebeen transferred from the performance of solidification on F006 wastes.The Agency based this transfer of standards based primarily on the physicaland chemical similarity of the individual metal constituents as well asthe similarities in overall characteristics of the wastes. Because no commentswere received on the proposed regulation of any of the specific constituentsfor K022, EPA assumes that generators of these wastes agree with EPA'sassessment that these treatment standards can be achieved. The regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for these wastes are listed inthe tables at the end of this section. The BDAT treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for K022 wastewaterswas proposed based on the performance of a fuel substitution unit thatgenerated no scrubber water. This information was the basis of the ``noland disposal'' standard for K022 wastewaters. In the proposed rule, EPAspecifically requested comment on the premise of the ``no land disposal''.In response, one commenter stated that he does generate K022 wastewatersas a scrubber water. Other commenters have identified additional potentialsources of wastewater forms of K022 such as those being generated at aCERCLA site, during a corrective action at a RCRA facility, and as a leachatefrom a landfill where K022 nonwastewaters or K022 ash residues have beenpreviously disposed. Since generation of these wastewaters has been identified,the premise of ``no generation'' appears to be unjustified. As a result,the Agency has decided to not promulgate a final rule of ``no land disposal''K022 wastewaters. EPA does intend to propose and promulgate treatment standardsfor these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. Since no standard is promulgatedin today's rule for K022 wastewaters, these wastes are restricted fromland disposal according to the ``soft hammer'' provisions described inother sections of this preamble. [NOTE: As discussed in detail in sectionIII.C.3., EPA is amending section 268.12 to include wastewater residuesderived from the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes,as well as leachate derived from the management of ``soft hammer'' wastesand ``soft hammer'' waste contaminated groundwater; thereby moving theaforementioned types of wastewaters into the group of wastes identifiedas the Third Third. Thus, these types of K022 wastewaters are not subjectto the ``soft hammer'' prohibitions in andSection; 268.33(f). This actionwill allow these wastewater residues to be disposed in non-minimum technologyunits and such residues will not be subject to the certification requirementsof andSection; 268.8.]<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,8.2 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K022 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acetophenone <D>19 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sum of diphenylamine and diphenylnitrosamine <D>13 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol <D>12 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>.034 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>.32 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>g. <T3>K024_Distillation bottom tars from the production of phthalic anhydridefrom naphthalene. </T3>Today's rule promulgates final treatment standardsfor K024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.

Treatment standards are based on the performance of rotary kilnincineration and the concentrations found in the ash and scrubber waterresiduals. Other treatment technologies such as fluidized bed incinerationand fuel substitution that can achieve these standards are not precludedfrom use by this rule. EPA is regulating phthalic acid for both K024 wastewaters and K024 nonwastewaters.This constituent, although not listed as a hazardous constituent in Part261 Appendix VIII, is being regulated as a surrogate for phthalic anhydride.Phthalic anhydride is a hazardous constituent; however, it cannot be easilyanalyzed, in that the analytical method readily hydrolyzes the compoundto phthalic acid.

K047_Pink/red water from TNT operations. </T3>Today's rulepromulgates ``no land disposal'' as the final treatment standard for K044,K045 and K047 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. The treatment standard forthese wastes was established based on EPA's determination that open burningand open detonation of reactive (e.g., explosive) wastes is not consideredland disposal. So long as no reactive constituents remain after detonation,there would be no land disposal of a hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iii)).In order to provide clarification, EPA has modified the ``no land disposal''standard to read ``no land disposal based on reactivity''. Other technologies, such as incineration in specially designed explosionprotected units and chemical deactivation processes, that can render thesewastes nonreactive are not precluded from use by this rule based on a determinationthat residues from these technologies are no longer reactive (i.e., explosive).One commenter pointed out that there are no established and approved analyticalmethods to determine the reactivity characteristic for wastes. The commenternoted that approved methods would be useful in determining whether thetreatment of K044, K045, K046, and K047 was sufficient to render the wastenonreactive. The Agency agrees with the commenter to the fact that thereis no official OSW analytical method (i.e., according to SW-846, 3rd ed.)to test for reactivity. However, the Agency has recently reviewed a testingprotocol developed by the Department of Defense to measure the characteristicof reactivity for their hazardous wastes. While this protocol does notcontain official OSW methods, the Agency believes that it represents logicaland safe analytical procedures for determining the characteristic of reactivity(particularly for explosive wastes). Additional information on this protocolcan be found in the background document for K046.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K044, K045, <T4>and </T4>K047 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>  </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="28">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON REACTIVITY</ITAG></ITAG>j. <T3>K046_Wastewater treatment sludges from the manufacturing, formulation,and loading of lead based initiating compounds. </T3>Today's rule promulgatesa final treatment standard only for those K046 nonwastewaters that arenonreactive. A TCLP treatment standard for lead was established for thesewastes based on the performance of a stabilization process. The K046 thatwas specifically sampled and tested by the Agency was nonreactive (i.e.,nonexplosive) as originally generated. This standard does not apply toK046 nonwastewaters that are reactive (i.e., explosive) as originally generated.Residues from the open detonation, open burning, or incineration of K046nonwastewaters that are reactive as originally generated do not have tomeet these standards. Commenters to the proposed rule stated that the data used to set the treatmentstandard for nonreactive K046 nonwastewaters may not be representativeof their K046 wastes. Descriptions of their processes and their wastesindicated that they are generating reactive K046 wastes that they are subsequentlytreated by open detonation or open burning, thus creating nonreactive K046residuals. It was these wastes that they stated were different from thenonreactive K046 that EPA studied. The waste sampled and tested by the Agency consisted primarily of a leadcarbonate sludge generated from a chemical treatment process for wastewaterthat originally contained the explosive compound lead azide. This sludgecontained approximately 95% water and approximately 1,000 ppm total lead.In contrast, residues from one facility consist of solid ash from burningor detonating a K046 that includes lead-based initiating compounds andother explosives. The Agency recognizes that these wastes are inherentlydifferent and were not examined by EPA during the development of the K046treatment standards. The Agency intends to reexamine the data based onits testing of nonreactive K046 nonwastewaters and determine whether thedata can be extrapolated to reactive K046 wastes containing untreated leadazide or whether new data must be obtained to set treatment standards forthose residues from open detonation, open burning or specialized incinerationof K046 wastes that were originally reactive as generated. In today's rule, the Agency is taking this information into account andis setting treatment standards only for those K046 nonwastewaters thatare nonreactive (i.e., nonexplosive) when they are initially generated.Reactive K046 nonwastewaters that must be open detonated do not have tomeet the treatment standard promulgated as final in today's rule. No commentsor data were received that specifically indicated the existence of nonreactiveK046 (other than nonreactive residuals from open detonation or open burningof K046 that were originally explosive as generated) that could not meetthe proposed treatment standard for lead. Therefore, the Agency assumesthat generators of these nonreactive (as generated) K046 wastes agree withEPA's assessment that these treatment standards can be achieved. Some commenters indicated that they generate a mixture of K044 and K046and were concerned that the preamble is unclear as to whether reactiveK046 wastes can first be treated by open burning or open detonation toremove the reactivity hazard before stabilization. Stabilization of reactiveK046 or mixtures of nonreactive K046 with reactive K044, K045, K047 orother explosive wastes would require excessive handling in an essentiallyuntried manner. It would be dangerous and contrary to industry safety practicesto impose such requirement without adequate safety testing. The Agencyagrees with these commenters, in that EPA is uncertain of the risk associatedwith pretreating reactive (i.e., explosive) K046 wastes by open burningto eliminate the explosion hazard. Residues that do not meet the treatmentstandards can promptly be removed for treatment by stabilization at facilitiesequipped and authorized to carry out such activities. This scenario eliminatesthe safety hazards while addressing environmental concerns related to thetoxic constituents in the waste. However, the Agency prohibits the mixingof nonreactive K046 wastes (those that are nonreactive as initially generated)with explosive wastes such as K044, K045 or K047 in order to avoid theapplicability of the promulgated final treatment standard for nonreactiveK046 nonwastewaters. In the proposed rule, the Agency recognized the existence of the generationof reactive (i.e., explosive) K046 nonwastewaters and proposed a treatmentstandard of ``no land disposal'' for these wastes based on the same rationalethat the Agency used for K044, K045 and K047. However, the Agency now realizesthat this rationale is not applicable because the lead present in the wasteswould remain on the ground after open detonation. The Agency believes thatthese residues could be physically removed from the land and solidifiedto prevent leaching of the lead. However, the Agency has not investigatedthe concentration of lead in these residuals nor has it investigated theperformance of solidification for these. As a result, the Agency is, therefore,not able to promulgate the ``no land disposal'' treatment standard forthe explosive K046 nonwastewaters in today's rule. EPA does intend to proposeand promulgate treatment standards for these wastes prior to May 8, 1990.Since no standard is promulgated in today's rule for reactive K046 nonwastewaters,these wastes are restricted from land disposal according to the ``softhammer'' provisions described in other sections of this preamble. In the proposed rule, the Agency also proposed a treatment standard of``no land disposal'' for all K046 wastewaters, based on the premise thatthey would not be generated. Several commenters have identified specificsources of wastewater forms of K046 such as those being generated at aCERCLA site, during a corrective action at a RCRA facility, and as a leachatefrom a landfill. Since generation of K046 wastewaters does occur, the premiseof ``no generation'' as a basis for the treatment standard of ``no landdisposal'' appears to be unjustified. The Agency is, therefore, not ableto promulgate the treatment standard for K046 wastewaters in today's rule.EPA does intend to propose and promulgate numerical treatment standardsfor these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. Since no standard is promulgatedin today's rule for K046 wastewaters, this subgroup of wastes is restrictedfrom land disposal according to the ``soft hammer'' provisions describedin other sections of this preamble. [<T4>Note</T4>._As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amendingandSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derivedfrom the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' wastecontaminated groundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewatersinto the group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these typesof K046 wastewaters are not subject to the ``soft hammer'' prohibitionsin andSection; 268.33(f).

Further, the Agency believes thatthis testing protocol can be used as guidance in the determination of theapplicability of the treatment standards for K046 wastes (i.e., the determinationof whether the K046 waste is in the reactive or nonreactive subcategory).Additional information on this protocol can be found in the backgrounddocument for K046.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K046 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonreactive subcategory] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.18 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> k. <T3>K048_Dissolved air flotation (DAF) float from the petroleum refiningindustry.

These standardsare based on reanalysis of the original treatment data for incinerationand solvent extraction, as well as analysis of additional, recently submitteddata on solvent extraction. In the proposed rule and background documentfor these wastes, the Agency had indicated that there was a statisticaldifference between these technologies. Several commenters pointed out thatthis difference is for only a few constituents and that the two technologiescan achieve comparable performance for the majority of constituents. Theyalso believe that there is little environmental benefit achieved in usingthe incineration performance data as the sole basis for setting treatmentstandards versus the incorporation of the solvent extraction data intothe standard. They stated that both technologies could achieve concentrationsof hazardous constituents in the residuals that were below health basedlimits for those constituents. EPA's own statistical (ANOVA) comparison of the two technologies confirmsthat fluidized bed incineration provides significantly better treatmentthan solvent extraction for naphthalene and xylenes. However, for elevenother organic constituents there is no significant difference in achievableperformance. The proposed BDAT standards for K048-K052 nonwastewaters were based solelyon the results obtained from the analysis of residual samples from incinerationof K048 and K051 wastes at one refinery. Prior to the April 8, 1988 proposedregulation, industry had submitted treatment data for K048-K052 wastesusing solvent extraction technologies. These data were incomplete for incorporationinto the proposed standard, primarily because they did not include anytotal constituent concentrations in the wastes prior to treatment. Duringthe comment period, these additional data, as well as other industry data,were provided to EPA, allowing the Agency to complete its analysis of thetechnology. The solvent extraction process that was examined is designed to recoverand recycle petroleum products from the K048-K052 nonwastewaters. Use ofthe technology thus furthers the broad Congressional goal of resource recoveryas a preferred alternative to waste treatment alone (see, e.g. H.R. Rep.No. 198, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. at 31). Several commenters indicated thatit also may be easier to obtain treatment permits for solvent extractionunits than for incinerators due to less public concern over the presenceof these type of units in the community. EPA has considered all of these comments and has decided that the resourcerecovery achieved by solvent extraction justifies its inclusion in thedevelopment of BDAT treatment standards. Therefore, EPA has establishedsolvent extraction and incineration as BDAT for K048-K052 nonwastewatersand is promulgating revised numerical standards. EPA does not believe thatthis conflicts with the promulgated BDAT methodology. A few weeks before promulgation of the final regulation, EPA received datashowing performance of other types of solvent extraction systems on K048-K052.These data appear to indicate superior treatment of xylene and naphthalenethan the system on which EPA is basing its treatment standards. The Agencyhas not had the opportunity to fully evaluate these data, however, norhas any member of the petroleum industry had the opportunity to commenton them. EPA consequently does not feel justified in basing treatment standardson this information. However the Agency is continuing to study these dataand will propose to revise the treatment standards if such examinationshows that significantly lower levels are actually achievable. Such a proposalmay appear, for example, as part of the Second Third proposed rulemaking,expected a few months from now. However, as a result of these data, EPAbelieves it unwarranted to promulgate treatment standards for xylenes andnaphthalene at the present time, and accordingly is reserving treatmentstandards for these constituents. Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for all of the organic constituentsproposed for K048, K049, K050, K051 and K052 nonwastewaters. Additionally,several other organic constituents are being regulated that were identifiedin characterization data for these wastes. EPA's testing of fluidized bedincineration showed substantial treatment of these constituents. However,treatment standards were not originally proposed for them because the Agencybelieved that they would be controlled by incineration and regulation ofother organic constituents in the nonwastewater residuals from incineration.They are being regulated in today's rule because the additional data submittedby industry indicated that solvent extraction achieves substantial treatmentfor these constituents. However, the Agency does not have any data thatindicate that these constituents would be necessarily controlled by solventextraction if only the other organic constituents are regulated. The standardsfor the organic constituents are based on the results of the performanceachievable by solvent extraction and/or incineration. Standards for arsenic,total chromium, nickel, and selenium are established based on the performanceof a stabilization process. It is important to point out that while thestandards for organic constituents are based on data obtained from solventextraction and fluidized bed incineration, other treatment technologiessuch as rotary kiln incineration and biodegradation that can achieve thesestandards are not precluded from use by this rule. Several commenters argued that EPA should not regulate copper, vanadiumor zinc because they are not constituents specifically listed on AppendixVIII of 40 CFR part 261. The Agency does not totally agree, but is notadopting standards for these metals for reasons stated earlier in connectionwith F006 wastes. The final revised BDAT treatment standards for K048,K049, K050, K051 and K052 are listed in the tables at the end of this section.Several commenters stated that dewatering technologies such as vacuum filtration,plate and frame pressure filtration, and centrifugation, as well as thermaldrying, should be allowed and should be the basis of BDAT. They also providedleachability data on the residuals from these process. However, no totalconstituent concentration data were provided for comparison to the performanceof incineration and solvent extraction. While these technologies do reducethe water content in the waste and generally reduce the volume of solidresiduals that require disposal, they do not perform as well as incinerationand solvent extraction technologies that EPA has determined to be BDATfor these wastes. A detailed comparison of these technologies is providedin the BDAT background documents for these wastes, located in the docketfor this rule. At the same time, it is important to point out that thesedewatering technologies are not precluded from use by this regulation andcan be considered applicable technologies when used alone or when incorporatedinto an additional treatment train, provided that they produce a residualthat can achieve the constituent concentrations in the treatment standardsfor that particular waste.The proposed BDAT standards for organic constituents in K048-K052 wastewaterswere based on a transfer of performance data for the scrubber water residualfrom the incineration of a similar waste. The Agency has recently completedan analysis of scrubber waters from the incineration of a K048 waste (performedearlier this year). The results of this analysis are comparable to thetreatment performance data that were the basis for the proposed standards.The Agency has decided to promulgate the final treatment standards forK048-K052 wastewaters based on revised standards using the data from theincineration of the K048 waste. Several additional organic constituents are being regulated in the K048-K052wastewaters. These constituents were identified in characterization datafor untreated K048-K052 wastes. EPA's testing of fluidized bed incinerationshowed substantial treatment of these constituents. However, treatmentstandards were not proposed for them because the Agency believed that theywould be effectively controlled by incineration and regulation of otherorganic constituents (as indicators for these constituents) in the wastewaters.The Agency has chosen to regulate these additional organic constituentsbecause it does not have any data that indicate that these constituentswould be necessarily controlled by solvent extraction if only the otherorganic constituents are regulated. Because the Agency did not receiveany comments nor solvent extraction treatment data for the K048-K052 wastewaterresiduals (from solvent extraction), the promulgated standards for theorganic constituents in K048-K052 wastewaters are based on the resultsof the performance achievable by fluidized bed incineration. Today's rulealso promulgates final treatment standards for metal constituents in K048-K052wastewaters based on a transfer of treatment performance data (with theexception of arsenic values, which are based on treatment of wastewatersof these petroleum refining wastes) for wastewaters containing metals usingchromium reduction, lime and sulfide precipitation and vacuum filtration,as proposed. <ITAG

K061 nonwastewaters. The standards proposed on April 8, 1988,were based on the performance of a high temperature metals recovery (HMTR)unit. HMTR results in the formation of a residual slag which was analyzedto determine the performance of this technology. EPA received extensivecomments from industry opposing the applicability, demonstrability, andeconomics of HTMR for low zinc content K061. As initially proposed, treatmentstandards for K061 wastes with greater than 2.4% total zinc were basedon HTMR. However, the applicability of these standards was based on theconcentration of zinc in the residual slag from HTMR; EPA did not considerthe optimum operating feed concentrations for zinc. Several commentersspecifically stated that HMTR is not feasible at total zinc concentrationsin the feed material of below 5% by weight. Other commenters proposed minimumzinc concentrations of 20% zinc. The majority of the comments centeredon 15% zinc as a minimum. Review of the sampling data from EPA's testingof HTMR indicates that the minimum feed concentration of zinc was 12.9%and the mean value of the feed concentrations was 14.3%. Many commentersurged EPA to establish treatment standards based on the performance ofstabilization, with the concentration levels to be based on the data containedin EPA's background document for the proposed rule. Based on review of this data and in response to the comments on minimumfeed concentration of zinc, the Agency has decided to promulgate a finalrule with two subcategories of K061 nonwastewaters: a High Zinc Subcategory(greater than or equal to 15% total zinc) and a Low Zinc Subcategory (lessthan 15% total zinc). For the K061 High Zinc Subcategory, a final BDAT treatment standard of``no land disposal'' will become effective on August 8, 1990, based onHTMR. As described later in this preamble, EPA is deferring the effectivedate until August 8, 1990 because of inadequate HTMR capacity to meet thedemand that will be created by this rule. During the two year period untilAugust 8, 1990, interim treatment standards for the K061 High Zinc Subcategory,based on stabilization, are applicable. These interim standards are identicalto the final standards for the K061 Low Zinc Subcategory described in thissection. EPA sees no legal obstacle in adopting an interim treatment standard untilsuch time as the ``no land disposal'' standard takes effect. If there isinsufficient capacity presently available for the best treatment technology,EPA is not precluded from requiring that the next best treatment be utilizedin the interim. The alternative would be to allow disposal of untreatedhazardous wastes during the interim period. In addition, during the twoyear period, K061 wastes in the High Zinc Subcategory treated to meet theinterim standard based on stabilization may be disposed in landfills thatdo not meet the minimum technology requirements. Since many commenterscomplained that if K061 became subject to the soft hammer they would beunable to dispose of the waste in these types of units, an interim treatmentstandard affords these commenters a measure of relief. The treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for the High Zinc Subcategoryof K061 is based on the use of HTMR to recover zinc from K061 containingmore than 15% total zinc. Several classes of HTMR systems exist includingrotary kilns, flame reactors, electric furnaces, plasma arc furnaces, slagreactors, and rotary hearth kiln/electric furnace combinations. EPA isnot requiring or recommending any specific class of HTMR as BDAT. The Agencybelieves that establishing HTMR as BDAT for these wastes is consistentwith the national policy identified in HSWA to reduce the quantity of hazardousconstituents treated and disposed. EPA has data that indicate that approximately75% (by volume) of K061 wastes are classified as high zinc K061 wastesand contain zinc at concentrations equal to or greater than 15% by weight.At the same time, up to 60% of the total number of facilities generatingK061 generate low zinc K061 wastes representing only 25% of the volumeof K061. In considering the HTMR standard for K061 wastes in the High Zinc Subcategoryand specifically whether or not to express the standard as concentrationsin the residuals from HTMR, the Agency considered the position stated inthe proposed rule that if a secondary material being reclaimed in an industrialfurnace is ``indigenous'' to that furnace, it ceases being a waste whenit is reclaimed. The Agency has proposed to define ``indigenous'' to beany material generated by the same type of furnace in which it will bereclaimed. See proposed andSection; 266.30(a), 52 FR 17034, May 6, 1987.The Agency considered other possible alternatives in the May 6, 1987 proposal,and commenters suggested additional possible interpretations which theAgency is now considering. However, the type of processing used to recoverzinc from K061, plus the similarity of K061 to the raw materials smeltedin zinc furnaces, appears to qualify K061 as ``indigenous'' under any ofthe current options being considered. Therefore, the Agency is promulgatinga ``no land disposal'' standard for the High Zinc Subcategory in anticipationthat a final definition of ``indigenous'' wastes that would include HTMRof K061 will be promulgated prior to the August 8, 1990 effective dateof this standard. Also, the Agency is not precluded from revising the HTMRstandard of ``no land disposal'' if the definition of ``indigenous'' wasteis not made final or if it is altered in a way that might conceivably implicatethe slag.For the K061 Low Zinc Subcategory, final BDAT treatment standards, basedon stabilization, will become effective on August 8, 1988. The regulatedconstituents and BDAT treatment standards for the two subcategories ofK061 nonwastewaters are listed in the tables at the end of this section.The revised BDAT treatment standards based on stabilization were establishedusing performance data collected by EPA and previously referenced in theK061 and F006 background documents for the proposed rule. For lead andcadmium, the treatment standards for both subcategories are based on stabilizationof a waste in the K061 nonwastewater High Zinc Subcategory. For total chromium,the treatment standards are based on stabilization of F006 wastes containingchromium. EPA has decided to transfer the chromium standard from F006 nonwastewatersto K061 nonwastewaters as a result of comments from manufacturers of specialtyand stainless steel. These commenters pointed out that their K061 wastesrequired a separate treatment standard, due to high concentrations of chromiumcompared to the K061 from carbon steel manufacturers, which EPA tested.The Agency evaluated all available data characterizing K061 generated byspecialty steel, stainless steel, and carbon steel production. The Agencyagrees that there is a need to establish a treatment standard that accountsfor the higher concentrations of chromium present in K061 generated byspecialty and stainless steel production. Consequently, the Agency is promulgatingthe treatment standard for chromium based on stabilization of F006 electroplatingwastes, many of which contain concentrations of chromium similar to thosefound in K061 generated by specialty and stainless steel production. Nickel has been added to the list of regulated constituents since the timeof proposal for two reasons. First, the proposed treatment standard wasbased on a technology (HTMR) which concentrated nickel in the treatmentresidual, and therefore, was not proposed as a regulated constituent. Thefinal rule is based on a technology (stabilization) which shows significantreductions in the leachability of nickel. Since the final rule establishesmetal concentrations in the waste extract, the Agency is establishing treatmentstandards for all constituents which are present at significant concentrations.For further discussion of regulated constituents see the Background Documentfor K061. Second, several commenters presented data showing that K061 fromspecialty and stainless steel production contain higher concentrationsof chromium and nickel than the K061 from carbon steel which were previouslystabilized. The Agency agrees that nickel is present in these K061 wastesat significantly higher levels, and therefore, is promulgating a treatmentstandard for nickel. This standard is based on stabilization of electroplatingwastes (F006) containing concentrations of nickel similar to these K061wastes. For all K061 nonwastewaters, BDAT treatment standards are established basedon cadmium, total chromium, lead and nickel concentrations in the wasteextract using the TCLP. Several commenters questioned the Agency's decisionnot to use the data submitted as concentrations of constituents in thewaste extract from the Extraction Procedure (EP) test. Several commentersalso suggested that EP and TCLP test results were similar for K061. Datawas submitted comparing EP and TCLP results for stabilized K061 wastes.This data showed no statistical difference in the results for the regulatedconstituents; however, the EP data did not include important informationnecessary for complete evaluation. Information missing included waste characterizationof the untreated K061 wastes, design and operating data, mix ratios ofsolidification reagents, and laboratory quality assurance data. Consequently,the stabilization data provided which contained EP extract results werenot used in calculation of the treatment standards for K061 nonwastewaters.Several commenters stated that EPA should not regulate zinc because itis not a constituent specifically listed on Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part261. The Agency does not totally agree, in that zinc cyanide and zinc phosphideare listed on Appendix VIII. Further, zinc is an aquatic toxin, and theAgency considered adding it to Appendix VIII for that reason. However,in this rulemaking the Agency is only regulating zinc when it is an indicatorof performance of treatment for other Appendix VIII constituents. Further,the Agency believes that zinc is controlled by stabilization of the metalconstituents that are regulated by today's rule and is not promulgatingzinc standards for either of the subcategories of K061. However, the Agency is establishing the definitions of these subcategoriesbased on the total concentration of zinc. While a treatment standard isnot actually being set, it is necessary to determine the total zinc concentrationto determine applicability of the appropriate standard. (See EPA DocumentSW-846, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes'', Third Edition, forguidance on composite sampling to determine if the l5 percent limit ismet.) A facility is not allowed to dilute or perform partial treatmenton a K061 waste in order to switch the applicability of the standard forthe High Zinc Subcategory to the standard for the Low Zinc Subcategory.However, the Agency does recognize that K061 wastes in the Low Zinc Subcategoryare often blended with wastes in the High Zinc Subcategory in order toobtain an optimum feed concentration for zinc. The Agency does not intendto preclude this operation, and furthermore, believes that this shouldnot be a restricted practice, because the effective result of this practiceis the applicability of a standard that is more stringent i.e., from stabilizationto ``no land disposal'' (after August 8, 1990). Today's rule is not promulgating the proposed treatment standard of ``noland disposal'' for K061 wastewaters. The basis of the wastewater standardwas the premise that K061 was not anticipated to be generated. Severalcommenters provided information to the contrary indicating that K061 wastewatersare being generated and will continue to be generated. Several facilitiesindicated that their K061 nonwastewaters are generated as wet sludges ratherthan as dry baghouse dust. The water from treating and/or dewatering thesesludges are classified as K061 wastewaters. In addition, the majority ofthe volume of K061 nonwastewaters has been historically disposed in landfills.The aqueous leachate collected from these landfills are ``derived-from''K061 wastewaters. Commenters have also identified additional specific sourcesof wastewater forms of K061 such as those being generated at a CERCLA site,during a corrective action at a RCRA facility, as a leachate from a landfill,and as a residual from treatment processes such as dewatering. Since generationof K061 wastewaters does occur, the premise of no generation as a basisfor the treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' is invalid. Therefore,the Agency cannot promulgate the proposed standard of ``no land disposal''for K061 wastewaters as final. Since no standard is established for K061wastewaters, this subgroup of wastes is restricted from land disposal accordingto the ``soft hammer'' provisions. EPA intends to develop and propose numericaltreatment standards by May 8, 1990. [<T4>Note.</T4>_As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amendingandSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derivedfrom the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' wastecontaminated groundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewatersinto the group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these typesof K061 wastewaters are not subject to the ``soft hammer'' prohibitionsin andSection; 268.33(f). This action will allow these wastewater residuesto be disposed in nonminimum technology units and such residues will notbe subject to the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8.]EPA solicited comment in the April 8, 1988, notice on the issue of whethercommercial fertilizers that contain K061 dust as an ingredient should berequired to meet BDAT as a condition of remaining exempt from the remainingRCRA standards when they are applied to the land. See 40 CFR andSection;266.20. After considering the public comment on this issue, EPA has decidednot to amend the existing exemption at this time. Our reasons are the following:(1) Existing data appear to indicate that application of these fertilizersto the crops to which zinc-based fertilizers are applied does not posesignificant risk from either a food chain contamination pathway or a groundwatercontamination pathway; and (2) Constituent levels (and levels of extractablemetals) of some of the toxic metals in zinc-based fertilizers are virtuallythe same, whether or not the fertilizers contain K061; levels of the remainingconstituent (lead) are more variable, although some of the non K061 fertilizers(i.e., those fertilizers whose zinc comes from a non-waste source) containmore lead than any K061 fertilizer for which EPA has data. It thus is possible(although further study and data-gathering are required) that EPA couldultimately classify K061 based fertilizers as products rather than wastes.It thus does not appear to the Agency to be the proper time to remove theexisting exemption for these fertilizers. Because there has been no opportunityfor notice and comment, and because of incomplete data, it also would notbe proper to reclassify these fertilizers at this time. Accordingly, EPAis not taking action at this time, and so is leaving in place the exemptionfor zinc-containing fertilizers that include K061 wastes as ingredients.A number of commenters (although none from the fertilizer industry) maintainedthat hazardous waste-derived fertilizers are not subject to RCRA at all,because the hazardous waste are not ``discarded materials'', and so arenot solid wastes. They cited <T3>American Mining Congress </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>824 F.2d 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1987) for this proposition. EPAdoes not agree. The Agency views the practice as discarding for severalreasons: (1) recycling involving direct placement of hazardous secondarymaterials on the land for final disposition is discarding because it islike land disposal, (2) unwanted contaminants in the hazardous secondarymaterials (for example, lead and cadmium in K061) which in no way contributeto recycling are being gotten rid of and in fact being disposed of. (Shouldit prove that lead and cadmium are present in hazardous waste and nonhazardouswaste-derived zinc fertilizers at similar concentrations, this last pointwould no longer apply.) This use constituting disposal situation also doesnot involve the type of ongoing industrial process discussed by the courtin the above-cited case. The Agency moreover finds these commenters' argumentsunpersuasive given that they would make legal under RCRA such infamoususe constituting disposal situations as Times Beach, Missouri (use of hazardousdistillation bottom as dust suppressants). The Agency is convinced thatneither Congress nor the court contemplated any such results.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>Interim Treatment Standards for </T4>K061 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[High Zinc Subcategory_Equal to or Greater than 15%] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[effective until August 8, 1990] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.24 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50 </C><T4>Treatment Standards for </T4>K061 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[High Zinc Subcategory_Greater than 15%] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Effective after August 8, 1990] </ITAG><H1> </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="28">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON RECYCLING</ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K061 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Zinc Subcategory_Less than 15%]  </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.24 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> m. <T3>K062_Spent pickle liquor generated by steel finishing operations offacilities within the iron and steel industry (SIC Codes 331 and 332).</T3>Today's rule promulgates final treatment standards for K062 wastewatersand nonwastewaters as proposed. As initially generated, K062 spent pickleliquors contain less than 1% filterable solids and are classified as K062wastewaters. Treatment standards for both K062 wastewaters and nonwastewaterswere established based on the performance of chromium reduction followedby chemical precipitation with sulfide followed by precipitation, settling,filtering and dewatering of the solid residues. The standards for K062wastewaters are based on the concentrations of metals in the wastewaterresidual from this process. The standards for K062 nonwastewaters are basedon the analysis of TCLP leachates of the dewatered solid residues. The standards shown below apply to all K062 wastewaters and nonwastewaterswith the exception of residues generated as a result of lime (Ca(OH)<T2>2</T2>) treatment that are not classified as hazardous wastes accordingto 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(ii) unless they are hazardous because they exhibita characteristic. Therefore, any such residues would not have to complywith the BDAT treatment standards. The treatment standards do apply, however,to residues generated by other than lime precipitation. A comment received on the August 12, 1987 Notice of Data Availability andRequest for Comments (52 FR 29992) suggested that K062 nonwastewaters canbe treated by high temperature metals recovery (HTMR). At this time, theapplicability of HTMR to all K062 nonwastewaters has not been sufficientlyverified in order to develop additional treatment standards. The concentrationsand identity of metals in K062 wastewaters vary widely depending on thespecific steel being pickled. EPA has not been able to define any particularsubcategories of K062 nonwastewaters that would be amenable to a particularrecovery process. Commenters also stated that since EPA is requiring the use of sulfide asa precipitant for K062 wastewaters, various recovery processes that aredesigned to recover metals from metal hydroxide precipitates would be precludedfrom use. This is not the case, for EPA is not requiring the use of sulfide,but rather establishing a performance standard for the K062 wastes. Thesestandards do not exclude the use of lime as a precipitant. In fact, theAgency has information that the majority of generators are indeed usinglime as a precipitant. These lime residues can already be sent to HTMRwithout meeting the standards for K062 nonwastewaters. One commenter stated that EPA should alter the regulatory provision (andSection;261.3(c)(2)(ii)) that excludes lime precipitated K062 nonwastewaters fromthe derived from rule. They stated that if sulfide precipitation can achievea higher water quality, then it should be BDAT for all K062 wastewaters.The Agency cannot remove this exemption without following rulemaking procedures,and did not propose the change. One commenter stated that since aqueous metal recovery processes for metalcontaminated wastewaters exist and are being used, EPA should force K062wastewaters to use them by establishing a treatment standard of ``no landdisposal'' for K062. At this time, the applicability of these recoveryprocesses to K062 wastewaters has not been sufficiently verified in orderto establish a ``no land disposal'' standard. The high acid content andhigh variability in concentrations and identity of metals in these wastewatersmay preclude the use of some technologies such as reverse osmosis and cationexchange due to the strong possibility that the acid or other metals couldfoul the recovery process. Thus, the Agency believes that a standard of``no land disposal'' may eventually be possible to promulgate for certainsubcategories of K062. However, it is unlikely that this standard wouldbe justified for all K062 wastes. At this time, EPA has not been able todefine any particular subcategories of K062 wastewaters that would be amenableto a particular aqueous recovery process. Several commenters argued that EPA should not regulate copper because itis not a hazardous constituent specifically listed on Appendix VIII of40 CFR Part 261. EPA has decided not to regulate copper here for the reasonsstated earlier in connection with F006 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K062 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.094 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>.37 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K062 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>0.32 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.04 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>.44 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> n. <T3>K069_Emission control dust/sludge from secondary lead smelting. </T3>TheBDAT treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for K069 wastewaters andnonwastewaters was proposed based on information supplied to the Agencythat indicated that K069 wastes were totally recyclable without generationof residuals. In response to this premise, one commenter provided informationthat they generate a K069 nonwastewater that cannot be directly recycleddue to a significantly different chemical composition. The informationalso indicates, that, while the waste being generated meets the definitionof the listed waste K069, there also is a significant difference in howit is being generated. Most K069 wastes are baghouse dusts and scrubber sludges that act as primaryair pollution control devices (APCD). The commenter's facility utilizesa baghouse for particulate collection as its primary APCD. In addition,the air leaving the baghouse is sent through a ``secondary'' APCD, consistingof a wet venturi scrubber utilizing lime neutralization. This ``secondary''APCD has been installed primarily to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Thesludge from this process is technically the listed waste, K069, but consistsprimarily of lead contaminated calcium sulfate and calcium hydroxide ratherthan metallic lead, lead oxides, and metal oxides that comprise typicalbaghouse dusts. In addition, the facility stated that it has experimentedwith other neutralizing agents to produce a reclaimable sludge, but hasnot succeeded. At the time of this rule, the Agency has not completed itsanalysis of all of this information. However, it does believe that theseK069 wastes are fundamentally different and that the basis of total recyclingfor the proposed standard of ``no land disposal'' for K069 wastes is notjustifiably extrapolated to these types of K069 wastes. For the purposes of this rule, the Agency is establishing a Calcium SulfateSubcategory and a Non Calcium Sulfate Subcategory for K069 nonwastewaters.The Calcium Sulfate Subcategory is defined as those emission control sludgesfrom secondary lead smelting that are generated as calcium sulfate fromsecondary wet scrubbers using lime neutralization. The Non Calcium SulfateSubcategory is defined as those emission control sludges from secondarylead smelting that are not generated as calcium sulfate from secondarywet scrubbers using lime neutralization. It is important to point out thatthis definition specifically includes ``secondary'' wet scrubbers. TheAgency also recognizes that K069 may be generated as a wet scrubber sludgefrom other primary APCDs and that the primary APCD may incorporate limeneutralization. Because no comments were received from generators of K069from these type of primary APCDs, the Agency assumes that the generatorsagree with EPA's assessment of recyclability of these wastes. As a result,the Agency has decided to promulgate a final BDAT treatment standard of``no land disposal'' based on total recycling for those K069 nonwastewatersin the Non Calcium Sulfate Subcategory. EPA intends to propose and promulgatenumerical treatment standards for K069 nonwastewaters in the Calcium SulfateSubcategory (i.e., those from secondary wet scrubbers using lime neutralization)prior to May 8, 1990. Commenters have also identified additional specific sources of wastewaterforms of K069 such as those being generated at a CERCLA site, during acorrective action at a RCRA facility, and as a leachate from a landfill.In the proposed rule, EPA had based a ``no land disposal'' standard forthe wastewaters on the belief that the total recycling process generatedno wastewater residuals and that it was unlikely that other wastewaterforms of K069 would be produced. Since generation of does occur, the premiseof no generation as the basis for the standard appears to be unjustified.As a result, the Agency is therefore unable to promulgate a treatment standardfor these wastewaters in today's rule. EPA does intend to propose and promulgatenumerical treatment standards for these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. Sinceno standard is promulgated in today's rule for these K069 wastewaters,they are restricted from land disposal according to the ``soft hammer''provisions. [Note._As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amendingandSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derivedfrom the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' wastecontaminated groundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewatersinto the group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these typesof K069 wastewaters are not subject to the ``soft hammer'' prohibitionsin andSection; 268.33 (f).

For K071 wastewaters,a total waste analysis for mercury is necessary to establish compliancewith the standard. These standards are listed in the table at the end ofthis section.The treatment standard for the K071 nonwastewaters was established basedon the performance of a treatment process that includes a series of individualsteps. The main purpose of which is to solubilize the mercury in the K071brine sludge and later convert the mercury to a relatively insoluble mercurysulfide sludge. Mercury sulfide is one of the least soluble forms of mercurysalts. Initially, the K071 brine sludge is leached with acid to solubilizecertain forms of mercury. The sludge and acid leachate are mixed with analkaline hypochlorite to oxidize the mercury to a highly soluble mercuricchloride (this also raises the pH). The resultant sludge is then washedwith hydrochloric acid and water during a filtration step. The treatmentstandard for K071 nonwastewaters is based on the leachability of mercuryfrom this filter cake. The filtrate contains the solubilized mercury, whichis then precipitated out as a mercury sulfide sludge. This sulfide sludgeis also filtered and/or dewatered. The aqueous residual from this processis classified as a K071 wastewater and must meet the treatment standardfor mercury in K071 wastewaters. The sulfide sludge is classified as aK071 nonwastewater, unless the liquids were combined with other wastewatersfrom the mercury cell process prior to treatment. If so, it is a wastewatertreatment residual listed specifically as K106. The Agency has data thatindicate that this sulfide sludge (be it K071 or K106) will meet the treatmentstandard for K071 nonwastewaters, that was derived from the leachabilityof residual mercury in the leached brine sludge. One commenter provided data on a specialized stabilization process forK071 brine sludges as they are initially generated (without acid or waterwashing). These data were generated from bench scale operations. The Agencyhas not determined whether this process has been demonstrated, as yet,on a full scale basis. The Agency is still in the process of examiningthe stabilization data for K071 nonwastewaters (as a process in lieu ofacid leaching) that was submitted. EPA will determine if these data demonstratesufficient treatment to be proposed as an alternative to acid leaching.At the time of this rule, EPA has insufficient information to establishdirect stabilization as a demonstrated treatment alternative to the acidleaching procedure previously described. Extensive EP leachate data were submitted to EPA by three facilities usingonly a water washing followed by a dewatering process. One of the threefacilities supplied TCLP mercury concentrations for the treated K071. EPAconsidered, but did not use, any of these data points in the developmentof the treatment standards because the analysis of variance tests showedsignificantly better treatment was achieved by the acid leaching procedure.However, EPA would like to emphasize that other treatment technologiessuch as stabilization or water washing are not precluded from use by today'srule, provided that these technologies or combination of technologies canachieve the equivalent performance as measured by the treatment standardspromulgated as final in today's rule. Several commenters also stated that EPA wrongly considered the informationindicating that the TCLP is a better measure of evaluating BDAT performancethan the EP (Extraction Procedure). Data were submitted comparing EP datato TCLP data in both treated and untreated K071 wastes. Statistical analyses,performed by EPA, show that the EP and the TCLP procedures yield statisticallysimilar results on the leachability of mercury in K071 wastes. Based onindustry's willingness to accept a TCLP standard based on EP data and EPAanalysis indicating a statistical relationship between the respective extractionmethods for K071 wastes, the Agency has incorporated the additional EPdata into its calculation of the final treatment standard for K071 nonwastewaters.However, the Agency maintains its position that, in general, the TCLP isa better measure of evaluating BDAT than the EP, except where data suchas these exist for tests performed on the same treated waste. Several commenters stated that a total mercury analysis is an inappropriatemeasure of performance for K071 nonwastewaters, since the BDAT treatmentsystem is not designed as a complete recovery system (i.e., mercury isnot being recovered directly, but rather it is being converted to recoverablemercury sulfides). At the time of the proposal, the Agency was developinga standard for K106 (wastewater treatment residues that are primarily mercurysulfides) based on recovery of the mercury by retorting of K106 wastes.EPA had determined that the mercury sulfide residues from treatment ofK071 wastes were either the listed waste K106 or were similar enough toK106 wastes that they could be retorted for mercury recovery. EPA receivedextensive comments from industry opposing the applicability, demonstrability,and economics of retorting K106. At the same time, EPA has examined thedata on the treatment of K106 and determined that there was insufficientdata to support the promulgation of the proposed treatment standards basedon retorting. See discussion of K106 wastes in section III.A.7.w. of thispreamble. Since recovery of K071 mercury sulfide residues was based onthe establishment of retorting as BDAT for K106 and since the Agency hasdecided not to promulgate the standards for K106 at this time, EPA hasdecided to promulgate the treatment standard for K071 nonwastewaters onlyon the analysis of the TCLP leachate and not on a total mercury analysis.[Note: As previously stated, EPA prefers to establish treatment standardsbased on total metal analysis only when recovery is established as BDAT.]However, the Agency is not precluded from adding this requirement in thefuture, if a treatment standard based on retorting or some other recoveryprocess is promulgated for K106 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>071 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>(\1\)</D><D>0.025</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>071 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>0.030</D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> p. <T3>K073_Chlorinated hydrocarbon waste from the purification step of thediaphragm cell process using graphite anodes in chlorine production. </T3>TheBDAT treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for K073 wastewaters andnonwastewaters was proposed based on the premise of ``no generation''.In the proposed rule, EPA specifically requested comment on this premise.In response, several commenters stated that at least one facility is generatingK073 wastes. Since generation has been identified, the Agency is not ableto promulgate a final treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for anyK073 wastes. Additional information provided by one commenter indicates that at leastone facility is incinerating its K073 wastes onsite and that this facilityintends to cease the generation of K073 in the near future. Based on thesecomments, EPA now intends to pursue the development of BDAT treatment standardsfor K073. In particular, EPA will evaluate the performance of incinerationon K073 provided that this facility intends to continue to generate K073past May 8, 1990. If this facility ceases generation and no other generatingfacilities can be identified, EPA may decide to promulgate the proposed``no land disposal'' treatment standard prior to May 8, 1990. However,since no standard is promulgated in today's rule for K073 wastes, thesewastes are restricted from land disposal according to the ``soft hammer''provisions. [<T4>Note</T4>._As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amendingandSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derivedfrom the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' wastecontaminated groundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewatersinto the group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these typesof K073 wastewaters are not subject to the ``soft hammer'' prohibitionsin andSection; 268.33(f). This action will allow these wastewater residuesto be disposed in nonminimum technology units and such residues will notbe subject to the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8.] It is also important to note that, until standards for all K073 wastesare promulgated, those K073 wastes containing halogenated organics mayonly be land disposed as long as they do not exceed a total halogenatedorganic concentration of 1000 ppm established in the July 8, 1987 promulgatedrestrictions for ``California List'' wastes. q. <T3>K083_Distillation bottoms from aniline production. </T3>The BDAT treatmentstandard of ``no land disposal'' for K083 wastewaters and nonwastewaterswas proposed based on the performance of a liquid injection incineratorthat generated no residuals. The K083 nonwastewater examined by EPA, containedno measurable ash content (solid residues from incineration) at a detectionlimit of 0.01% by weight. The liquid incineration unit that EPA visited,did not have a vent scrubber or other pollution control device and didnot generate any scrubber water. This information was the basis of the``no land disposal'' standard for K083. In the proposed rule, EPA specifically requested comment on the premiseof the ``no land disposal'' standards for both categories of K083 wastes.In response, several commenters stated that they do generate K083 nonwastewaterswith detectable levels of ash and K083 wastewaters as scrubber waters.Since generation of these wastes has been identified, the premises of ``noash'' and ``no generation'' may be unjustified for all K083 wastes. As a result, the Agency has decided to promulgate a final rule of ``noland disposal'' only for one subcategory of K083 nonwastewaters. This subcategoryis identified as the No Ash Subcategory and is defined as those K083 nonwastewaterswith less than 0.01% by weight ash. The use of other treatment technologies are not precluded by this rule.For example, while rotary kiln and fluidized bed incinerators are generallydesigned to handle solids and sludges, these units often are designed toincinerate liquids. In any case where these or other treatment technologiescan treat K083 without generating an ash or other solid residual, theseunits may be used to achieve the ``no land disposal'' standard for theK083 nonwastewaters. EPA does intend to investigate the comments submitted and, if necessary,propose and promulgate numerical treatment standards for K083 nonwastewaterswith detectable ash content and K083 wastewaters prior to May 8, 1990.Since no standard is promulgated in today's rule for these K083 wastes,they are restricted from land disposal according to the ``soft hammer''provisions.

Treatment standards for all organic constituentsare based on analyses of total constituent concentration. Treatment standardsfor metal constituents are based on analyses of leachate from the TCLPfor all wastes identified as nonwastewaters and analyses of total constituentconcentration for all wastes identified as wastewaters. The final treatmentstandards for the wastewater and nonwastewater forms of K086 Solvent Washesare listed in the tables at the end of this section. By definition K086 wastes can be from one of three major subcategories(depending on the material used for washing). These are: (1) Solvent Washes;(2) Solvent Sludges; and (3) Caustic/Water Washes and Sludges. For thepurposes of this rule, the K086 Solvent Washes Subcategory is defined asthose K086 wastes which are derived from procedures which have used anyorganic solvents including, but not limited to, the following: acetone,n-butyl alcohol, cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, ethylbenzene, methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylenechloride, naphthalene, nitrobenzene, toluene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene,and/or xylenes. The Agency believes that these are the most typical solventsthat become K086 Solvent Washes. While EPA is specifically identifyingthese sixteen solvents in order to clarify the definition of this subcategory,the Agency recognizes that other solvents may be used by generators. Inthese cases, EPA has not specifically developed treatment standards forthat particular unlisted solvent. While no treatment standard for thatsolvent has been developed, the treatment standards for lead and totalchromium do apply to these K086 Solvent Washes. It is also important tonote that some of these solvents, including those that are specificallylisted in the definition of the Solvent Washes Subcategory, are specificallylisted under the solvent waste codes F001, F002, F003, F004 and/or F005.In such cases, the treatment standards for these solvent wastes that werepromulgated November 7, 1986, are already in effect. However, where twosets of standards exist for a constituent in a particular waste that hasmore than one applicable waste code, the more stringent standard is applicablefor that constituent. For those constituents where standards are expressedas a total concentration and a TCLP concentration, both standards may apply.The treatment standards for all of the organic constituents in the K086wastewaters and nonwastewaters are based on the performance achieved byincineration. The treatment standards for total chromium and lead in K086wastewaters are transferred from a similar wastewater treated at a facilitypreviously sampled by the Agency. The wastewater treatment system includedhexavalent chromium reduction to convert any hexavalent chromium to thetrivalent state, chemical precipitation with excess lime to precipitatedissolved metals as solids, and filtration to remove these solids. Theresidues of this wastewater treatment system include the treated wastewaterand the solids that are classified, for the purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters.These residues did not require further treatment because TCLP leachateconcentrations were not found at treatable levels. Further details regardingBDAT development and data transfer are provided in the Background Documentfor this waste code. For the purposes of BDAT, any solid ash residues from the incinerationof nonwastewaters in the K086 Solvent Washes Subcategory are also classifiedas nonwastewaters. Scrubber waters from air pollution control devices areclassified as wastewaters. Both of these residues must meet the BDAT treatmentstandards for the K086 Solvent Washes Subcategory prior to placement inland disposal units. While EPA has identified incineration in units with liquid injection asBDAT for K086 Solvent Washes, other treatment technologies such as fluidizedbed incineration, multiple hearth incineration, rotary kiln incineration,fuel substitution units, batch distillation and fractional distillationthat can achieve these standards are not precluded from use by this rule.The Agency has data that suggests that approximately sixteen differentBDAT List solvents could be used to clean ink formulating equipment. EPAis concerned that regulation of only the solvents that were found in thetested waste matrix would create an incentive to simply switch to the useof other solvents. For this reason, EPA is regulating all sixteen BDATList solvents. EPA transferred the performance data achieved for some ofthese sixteen solvents from performance data for other solvents that hadsimilar physical and chemical properties. The Agency believes that thesolvents that have been determined to be similar, can be incinerated tothe same treatment concentrations. Details on the transfer of standardscan be found in the BDAT Background Document for this waste code. EPA specificallysolicited comments on this transfer of performance data. Commenters objectedto the transfer of many of these constituents. However, they did not providesufficient data documenting that the proposed BDAT treatment standardsare not achievable. EPA specifically requested that documentation be providedin order for the Agency to consider potential changes in the standards.As a result, today's rule promulgates final treatment standards as proposed.Today's rule is not promulgating final treatment standards for K086 wastesin the Solvent Sludges Subcategory or the Caustic/Water Washes and SludgesSubcategory. Since no standard is established, these subcategories of K086wastes are restricted from land disposal according to the ``soft hammer''provisions. EPA intends to develop and propose numerical treatment standardsby May 8, 1990.

Theseare acenaphthalene, benzene, chrysene, fluoranthene, indeno (1,2,3-cd)pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, toluene, xylenes, and lead. Treatmentstandards for all organic constituents are based on analyses of total constituentconcentration. Treatment standards for metal constituents are based onanalyses of leachate from the TCLP for all wastes identified as nonwastewatersand analyses of total constituent concentration for all wastes identifiedas wastewaters. The final treatment standards for K087 wastewaters andnonwastewaters are listed in the tables at the end of this section. The treatment standards for all of the organic constituents in the K087wastewaters and nonwastewaters are based on the performance achieved byincineration in a rotary kiln. The treatment standards for lead in K087wastewaters are transferred from a similar wastewater treated at a facilitypreviously sampled by the Agency. The wastewater treatment system includedhexavalent chromium reduction to convert any hexavalent chromium to thetrivalent state, chemical precipitation with excess lime to precipitatedissolved metals as solids, and filtration to remove these solids. Theresidues of this wastewater treatment system include the treated wastewaterand the solids that are classified, for the purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters.Further application of a stabilization process to these solids may be necessaryin order to conform with the BDAT treatment standards for K087 nonwastewaters.Further details regarding BDAT development and data transfer are providedin the Background Document for this waste code. Several commenters stated that EPA should not regulate acenaphthalene,phenanthrene, xylenes or zinc because they are not constituents specificallylisted on Appendix VII or Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261. The Agencydoes not totally agree, in that coal tars, zinc cyanide and zinc phosphideare listed on Appendix VIII. One of the reasons that EPA considers coaltars hazardous is the presence of significant concentrations of polynucleararomatic hydrocarbons such as acenaphthalene and phenanthrene. Xyleneshave also been identified in abundance in coal tars. Further, zinc is anaquatic toxin, and the Agency considered adding it to Appendix VIII forthat reason. However, in this rulemaking the Agency is only regulatingzinc when it is an indicator of performance of treatment for other AppendixVIII constituents. Further, the Agency believes that zinc is controlledby treatment of lead, which is regulated by today's rule. Therefore, EPAis not promulgating final standards for zinc as part of the treatment standardsfor K087 wastes, but is promulgating final standards for acenaphthalene,phenanthrene and xylenes. For the purposes of BDAT, any solid ash residues from the incinerationof K087 nonwastewaters are also classified as nonwastewaters. Scrubberwaters from air pollution control devices are classified as wastewaters.Both of these residues must meet the treatment standards for the K087 priorto placement in land disposal units. While EPA has identified incineration in a rotary kiln as BDAT for K087nonwastewaters, other treatment technologies such as fluidized bed incineration,multiple hearth incineration, rotary kiln incineration, and various fuelsubstitution units that can achieve these standards are not precluded fromuse by this rule. Total recycling has been identified as a potentially applicable technologyfor K087 wastes. Total recycling involves treating the K087 waste for (1)reuse in the coke ovens or (2) production of a commercial tar product.At this time, however, EPA has not completed its analysis of data submittedfor purposes of defining which K087 materials can be beneficially recycled.Industry commenters likewise agreed that not every K087 waste is amenableto recycling (although suggesting that most K087 as generated is recyclable).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for </T4>K087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acenaphthalene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>0.071 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chrysene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoranthene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Indeno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>3.4 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>0.65 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>0.070 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.51 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Acenaphthalene <D>0.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chrysene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoranthene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Indeno (1,2,3-cd) pyrene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>.008 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes <D>.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.037 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> t. <T3>K099_Untreated wastewater from the production of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyaceticacid (2,4-D). </T3>Today's rule promulgates final treatment standards forK099 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. These standards are based on chemicaloxidation using chlorine. This treatment system shows substantial treatmentfor 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The treatment standards forwastes identified as K099 are listed in the tables at the end of this section.Other treatment technologies that the Agency believes are applicable arechemical oxidation using other oxidizers, wet air oxidation (a specializedform of chemical oxidation), carbon adsorption followed by incinerationof the carbon, and biological treatment followed by incineration of thebiological sludge. These and any other technology that can achieve thesestandards are not precluded from use by this rule. For wastes and treatment residues identified as K099 nonwastewaters orwastewaters, EPA is promulgating treatment standards for seven organicconstituents. These are 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and six chlorinateddioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans. The 1 ppb analytical quantitationlimit for these constituents described in the final rule for dioxin containingwastes (51 FR 40643) is also used here. This level represents the analyticallimit of quantitation that can be routinely achieved. EPA specifically requested comment on the selection of chlorine oxidationas BDAT for K099. Chlorine oxidation was selected as the treatment technologyfor the destruction of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The data indicatethat this technology provides significant reduction of this chemical. However,the data appear to indicate a slight increase in the concentration of someof the chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans (all values below the routinequantitation limit of 1 part per billion) from the untreated waste to thetreated residuals. At this time, EPA is not certain that this implies thatthe chlorine oxidation process is responsible for this slight increase.The Agency specifically requested comments and data that would indicatethe existence of an alternative treatment technology that could achievethe same performance for the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid without anincrease in the chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Because no commentswere received on alternative treatment technologies, EPA assumes that thecommenters agree with EPA's assessment that chlorine oxidation representsBDAT for K099 wastes. The Agency received a late comment that included additional data on theperformance of chlorine oxidation on K099 wastes. This data, along withthe data originally presented in the K099 background document for the proposedrule, was reexamined by the Agency. These additional data indicated thatthe proposed treatment standard for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid couldnot be achieved on a routine basis. Sufficient data were submitted enablingthe Agency to calculate a revised treatment standard for this constituent.Therefore, the Agency is promulgating the revised 2,4-dichlorophenoxyaceticacid standard as final along with the standards for the chlorinated dioxinsand dibenzofurans are proposed.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K099 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid <D>1.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K099 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid <D>1.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans <D>.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>u. <T3>K101_Distillation tar residues from the distillation of aniline-basedcompounds in the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenicor organo-arsenic compounds. K102_Residue from the use of activated carbonfor decolorization in the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals fromarsenic or organo-arsenic compounds. </T3>In today's rule, EPA is promulgatingfinal treatment standards for K101 and K102 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.These include ortho-nitroaniline in K101 wastes and ortho-nitrophenol inK102 wastes as well as arsenic, cadmium, total chromium, lead, mercuryand nickel. The final treatment standards for these wastes are listed inthe tables at the end of this section. The BDAT treatment standards for K101 and K102 nonwastewaters were proposedbased on information supplied to the Agency that indicated that untreatedK101 and K102 wastes contain 590 ppm to 0.83% of arsenic. In a late commentto the proposed rule, one commenter provided information that they generateK101 and K102 nonwastewaters that contain significantly higher concentrationsof arsenic (up to 26.9% total arsenic). The commenter also stated thatincineration of their wastes poses a significant increase in risk due tothese high concentrations of arsenic. The Agency agrees with the commenterthat these K101 and K102 wastes contain a significantly higher concentrationof arsenic compared to those wastes studied by the Agency (i.e., the wastesthat were used to develop the treatment standards). The Agency also agreesthat direct incineration of organic wastes containing very high levelsof arsenic, such as the K101 and K102 wastes generated by the commenter,poses a significant increase in risk to human health and the environment.As a result, the Agency is therefore, unable to promulgate the proposedtreatment standards as final for K101 and K102 wastes with high arsenicconcentrations. For the purpose of today's rule, the Agency is therefore establishing aHigh Arsenic Subcategory and a Low Arsenic Subcategory for K101 and K102nonwastewaters. The High Arsenic Subcategory is defined as those K101 andK102 wastes that contain greater than or equal to 1% total arsenic. TheLow Arsenic Subcategory is defined as those K101 and K102 wastes that containsless than 1% total arsenic. This level was established based primarilyon the concentration of arsenic (0.83%) measured in the waste tested byEPA. A complete explanation of how this level was determined can be foundin the background document for this waste. EPA intends to propose and promulgatenumerical treatment standards for K101 and K102 wastes in the High ArsenicSubcategory prior to May 8, 1990. Since no standard is promulgated in today'srule for K101 and K102 nonwastewaters in this subcategory, they are restrictedfrom land disposal according to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. Potential technologies applicable to organic wastes containing high concentrationsof arsenic, such as K101 and K102 wastes in the High Arsenic Subcategory,are chemical oxidation or wet air oxidation. These technologies destroyinterfering organics and convert the organic arsenicals to inorganic formsof arsenic. The inorganic forms of arsenic may then be amenable for directrecovery or may be immobilized by specialized stabilization techniques.The treatment standards for the organic constituents in K101 and K102 nonwastewatersin the Low Arsenic Subcategory are based on the performance achieved byincineration in a rotary kiln. The treatment standards for the metals aretransferred from wastewater metals treatment data for similar wastes thathave been previously developed by the Agency. The wastewater treatmentsystem includes a chemical precipitation step to precipitate dissolvedmetals as solids followed by a filtration step to remove these solids.The residues of this wastewater treatment system include the treated wastewaterand the solids that are classified, for the purposes of BDAT, as nonwastewaters.Further application of a stabilization process to these solids may be necessaryin order to conform with the BDAT treatment standards for nonwastewaters.Further details regarding BDAT development and data transfer are providedin the Background Document for this waste code. For the purposes of BDAT, any solid ash residues from the incinerationof K1O1 and K102 nonwastewaters in the Low Arsenic Subcategory are alsoclassified as nonwastewaters. Scrubber waters from air pollution controldevices are classified as wastewaters. Both of these residues must meetthe treatment standards prior to placement in land disposal units. While EPA has identified incineration in a rotary kiln as BDAT for K101and K102 nonwastewaters in the Low Arsenic Subcategory, other treatmenttechnologies such as fluidized bed incineration, multiple hearth incineration,and rotary kiln incineration that can achieve these standards are not precludedfrom use by this rule. For wastes identified as K101 and K102 nonwastewaters in the Low ArsenicSubcategory, EPA is regulating two specific organic constituents that arenot included on the BDAT List but have been selected as indicators of effectivetreatment of these wastes. A standard for ortho-nitroaniline is promulgatedfor K101 and a standard for ortho-nitrophenol is promulgated for K102.Several commenters stated that EPA should not regulate copper or zinc becauseit is not a constituent specifically listed on Appendix VIII of 40 CFRPart 261. The Agency does not totally agree, but is not adopting a standardfor reasons stated in previous sections of this preamble for F006 wastes.At the time of this rule, the Agency had not completed its evaluation ofwaste characterization and treatment information for antimony, arsenicand barium in K101 and K102 nonwastewaters from the Low Arsenic Subcategoryor antimony in any K101 and K102 wastewaters. The proposed rule containedthe notation ``reserved'' for these constituents, noting that EPA wouldbe setting standards when the evaluation was completed. Several commenterssuggested that a treatment standard of ``reserved'' was confusing to theregulated community and unnecessary. Since individual standards would stillhave to be proposed and promulgated through the normal rulemaking procedures,no benefit is achieved by the ``reserved'' notation for these constituents.Therefore, the Agency has dropped it from the final rule for the individualconstituents noted above.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K101 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Arsenic Subcategory_less than 1% total arsenic] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitroaniline <D>14 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>.32 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K101 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitroaniline <D>0.27 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>2.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>.24 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.11 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>.027 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3  </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K102 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Arsenic Subcategory_less than 1% total arsenic] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitrophenol <D>13 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>.32 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3  </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K102 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]) </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitrophenol <D>0.028 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>2.0 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>.24 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>.11 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>.027 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> v. <T3>K103_Process residues from aniline extraction from the production ofaniline. K104_Combined wastewater streams generated from nitrobenzene/anilineproduction. </T3>In today's rule, EPA is promulgating final treatment standardsfor K103 and K104 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. These include total concentrationstandards for aniline, benzene, 2,4 dinitrophenol, nitrobenzene and phenolfor both K103 and K104 wastes. Final treatment standards for total cyanidesare promulgated only for K104 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. The finaltreatment standards for these wastes are listed in the tables at the endof this section. The treatment standards for the organic constituents in K103 and K104 wastewatersand nonwastewaters are based on the performance achieved by solvent extractionfollowed by steam stripping and activated carbon adsorption with incinerationof the solvent stream from extraction. Other treatment technologies suchas steam stripping followed by activated carbon adsorption, and steam strippingfollowed by biological treatment are not precluded from use by this rule.The solvent-containing stream from solvent extraction potentially can berecycled to recover nitrobenzene and aniline, or incinerated. The steamstripper overheads are condensed and decanted with the organic constituentsrecycled back to the process. The spent carbon from the activated carbonadsorption column is sent off-site for thermal regeneration. While theincineration component of this technology is not demonstrated for K103and K104, available information shows that it is demonstrated on wastessimilar to the contaminated solvent stream from extraction. Because the solvent-contaminated stream potentially contains a significantamount of an explosive compound (picric acid), EPA expressed concern inthe proposed rule that it may not be possible to safely use incineration.One commenter stated their belief that incineration could present significantsafety hazards due to the presence of a significant amount of this explosivecompound. The commenter stated that although it is possible that picricacid in solution may not present an explosion hazard, crystals of picricacid may be formed during upsets and malfunctions in the treatment system.The commenter pointed out that the crystals may accumulate over time eventhough the conditions for formation may not always be present and unlesswetted with water will be shock sensitive and could explode with considerableforce. Thus, the commenter believes that incineration is not a viable technologyfor the K104 wastestream because of this potential for explosion. EPA agrees that there is a potential for explosion if the combustion ofthese wastes is not properly controlled. However, incineration of thesetypes of wastes is currently practiced. As such, incineration is fullydemonstrated. EPA believes the issue of explosivity would be present forany technology used for this waste. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expectthat EPA would exempt this or another waste from any treatment based ona mismanagement scenario. Instead, EPA expects that treatment facilitieswill take care to insure and provide design and operating conditions necessaryin treating this waste to the concentrations promulgated in today's rule.One commenter suggested that EPA incorrectly based the standards for K104on a product processing step rather than a waste treatment technology.EPA defines BDAT for both K103 and K104 wastestreams as solvent extractionfollowed by steam-stripping and carbon adsorption. Objections to EPA'stesting procedures were raised because the sampling occurred at a timewhen the plant was operating the process at conditions different from thosenow employed. The commenter contends that the solvent extraction procedurefrom which EPA obtained its BDAT data was actually a manufacturing processstep that has been abandoned because of technical and economic infeasibility.The commenter objected to EPA's designation of the solvent extraction processas a waste treatment technology because at the point where the solventextraction took place, neither the extract nor the residual streams werewastes. The commenter believes the solvent extraction procedure was anexperimental processing step that occurred before the stream was identifiedfor disposal. One commenter pointed out that EPA's determination of BDATwas improper based on the Agency's own statements regarding what constitutes``demonstrated'' treatment technologies. The commenter noted that the Agency'sfinal rule implementing land disposal restrictions for certain dioxin-and solvent-containing wastes (51 Federal Register 40571 et. seq.), EPAresponded to commenters' concerns over use of experimental data, such aspilot and bench scale data to establish BDAT. The preamble to the regulationstates that the Agency agrees with the commenters' position that its determinationsshould not be based on emerging and innovative technologies.EPA believes that solvent extraction is a fully demonstrated technology.In fact, solvent extraction of organic constituents is used for treatmentof hazardous wastes (see EPA's promulgated treatment standard for K048-K052elsewhere in this notice) and widely used in the production of organicchemicals. Further, EPA frequently bases BDAT standards for individualwastes on the performance achieved by bench or pilot scale operation ofdemonstrated technologies when no full scale data are available. The commenterhas provided no data to show that the performance achieved by a full scalesolvent extraction system will not achieve the performance measured byEPA. However, EPA has established a variance procedure, if such data becomeavailable. In the interim, EPA believes that the proposed standards areachievable. Use of solvent extraction does not require recycle of the extract backinto the process. Instead, the extract can be incinerated to achieve thepromulgated final standards. Recovery or reuse of the extract is not precludedby establishment of these standards. Selection of solvent extraction aspart of the BDAT treatment process is based solely on its status as a demonstratedcontrol technology that provides effective removal of constituents fromthe waste stream for subsequent destruction by incineration. One commenter disagreed with the statistical methodology used in developingthe treatment standards for K103 and K104 (the same methodology that isused for all of the BDAT treatment standards). Specifically, the commenterstates that following good statistical practice, EPA should use a ``multiplier''in the 99th percentile calculation that reflects the number of treatmentdata points used in the generation of the treatment standards. The 99thpercentile used by EPA is as follows: C99 = exp (AVG + 2.33 Stand. Dev.).In place of the 2.33 multiplier, the commenter suggests that EPA shoulduse a value that corresponds to the specific number of data points used.For K103 and K104 wastewaters, this value would be 7.042. EPA does not agree with the commenter that the 2.33 value should be changedto a multiplier that corresponds to the specific number of data points.EPA's rationale is summarized as follows: The 2.33 multiplier is extensivelyused by EPA in its variability factor calculations, including the Agency'seffluent guidelines limitations and the recently promulgated solvent rule.Under classical statistical theory, the 2.33 value can be used in the 99thpercentile calculation for any number of data points, provided the meanand standard deviation are known (i.e., that additional data points willnot increase these values). It is EPA's position (supported, in general,by available data) that as the number of data points increase, the meanand standard deviation will most frequently decrease. Therefore, EPA believesthat the use of the 2.33 multiplier is appropriate. As evidence to thisdetermination, EPA points to the variability factors currently developedfor the constituents in K103 and K104. These factors are in the range ofapproximately 1.6 to 15.4, which substantially exceeds the variabilityseen in treatment of wastewaters with a much larger number of data points.Additionally, an engineering analysis of well-designed and well-operatedtreatment systems would, in general, predict that both the average levelof performance and variability would decrease with larger data bases. Whilewell designed and well operated treatment systems do experience fluctuationsin performance, these fluctuations are normally cyclical reflecting thefact that an inherent part of most treatment system control devices isthat they continuously undercompensate and overcompensate for a desiredcontrol parameter. As the data base for such cyclical changes increases,the standard deviation would decrease because the range of values wouldbe essentially the same, while the number of data points would be greater.As a final point in response to this comment, the commenter also recognizesthat the multiplier they suggest may be inappropriate because it yieldsresults which ``might simply be too high.''

However, the retorting process has been demonstratedchiefly on ores consisting primarily of mercury sulfides. In the proposedrule, the Agency stated that these ores are believed to have chemical andphysical characteristics similar to K106 nonwastewaters. EPA received extensivecomments from industry opposing the applicability, demonstrability, andeconomics of retorting K106 nonwastewaters. At the same time, EPA has examinedthe data that it has on the treatment of K106 and similar wastes and determinedthat there was insufficient data to support the promulgation of the proposedtreatment standards for K106. The Agency has data points from a literature source on the treatment ofK106 nonwastewaters combined with K071 nonwastewaters using dewateringfollowed by retorting. Since the source reports that K106 comprised only0.5% of the feed to the retort furnace, the Agency believes the waste mixturedoes not sufficiently represent the majority of K106 wastes. The Agencyhas additional data from the treatment of a different K106 nonwastewaterusing retorting. However, this K106 was not generated by the conventionalmethod of sulfide precipitation, but consisted of elemental mercury thatwas concentrated in the residual from membrane filtration of wastewaterfrom the mercury cell process. EPA did not consider these data to be representativeof K106 nonwastewaters because nineteen of the twenty facilities generatingK106 currently generate it as a mercury sulfide sludge or residual. TheAgency also has data from EPA testing on treatment of K106 nonwastewatersby stabilization. Data collected during these tests show that, while thesetechnologies were properly operated, the data indicated that no significantreduction in leachability was achieved and in some cases, the leachabilitywas increased. Based on review of the sufficiency of the available data and on the commentsreceived, the Agency has decided not to promulgate final BDAT treatmentstandards for K106 nonwastewaters in today's rule. Until sufficient treatmentperformance data can be obtained that verify that these technologies canprovide significant treatment for K106 wastes, the Agency does not believethat it can promulgate treatment standards based on either of these technologies.It is important to point out that the Agency is not precluding the useof retorting or solidification for these wastes and that these technologiesmay prove to be BDAT for these wastes. EPA does intend to propose and promulgatenumerical treatment standards for these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. Sinceno standard is promulgated in today's rule, K106 wastes are restrictedfrom land disposal according to the ``soft hammer'' provisions describedin other sections of this preamble. [Note._As discussed in detail in sectionIII.C.3., EPA is amending andSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residuesderived from the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes,as well as leachate derived from the management of ``soft hammer'' wastesand ``soft hammer'' waste contaminated groundwater. Thereby, moving theaforementioned types of wastewaters into the group of wastes identifiedas the Third Third. Thus, these types of K106 wastewaters are not subjectto the ``soft hammer'' prohibitions in andSection; 268.33 (f). This actionwill allow these wastewater residues to be disposed in nonminimum technologyunits and such residues will not be subject to the certification requirementsof andSection; 268.8.] The Agency has information on other technologies that have been identifiedas potentially applicable to K106 wastes. In particular, a secondary mercuryrecovery facility has been recently identified as treating K106 wastesby an unidentified process. Another facility that uses hydrazine to treattheir wastewaters and generates K106 as a mercury hydroxide rather thana mercuric sulfide, subsequently retorts the K106 waste, to recover mercuryprior to land disposal of a residual. It is possible that because the sulfide precipitate is one of the leastsoluble forms of mercury salts, that no further treatment is required ofK106 nonwastewaters. Since K106 already is a treatment residual from treatingK071 and other mercury contaminated wastewaters, this result would be permissibleunder RCRA. Other alternatives involve changing the process of generation of the wastewatertreatment residuals from the use of sulfide to the use of hydrazine withlime precipitation to facilitate recovery of the mercury from K106 as ahydroxide residue. However, this would require authority under RCRA toregulate industrial process changes to facilitate changes in the compositionof listed hazardous wastes. This authority does not currently exist. x. <T3>K004_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of zinc yellowpigments.

In the proposed rule, EPA specifically requestedcomment on current and potential sources of generation of these wastesas either wastewaters or nonwastewaters. While the Agency has receivedno specific comments that indicated any current generation of nonwastewaterforms of these wastes as specifically listed, several commenters statedthat this rule would preclude them from generation of these wastes. In particular, commenters indicated that K060 is no longer generated becausesodium hydroxide is used as a reagent rather than ammonia. Thus, K060 isnot generated as listed. They stated that they may be forced to switchto ammonia due to an anticipated shortage in the supply of sodium hydroxide,and would thus begin to generate K060 as listed. A commenter also indicatedthat his facility was generating K060, as listed, but claims that he isreusing the K060 as a chemical substitute. One commenter claimed that althoughhis facility is currently not generating K060 due to a cessation in production,but they may decide to resume production in the future. The Agency cannot anticipate shifts in generation due to fluctuating reagentmarket conditions and therefore, has to disagree with these commenters.The Agency points out that this rule does not preclude generation of thesewastes, but rather restricts the placement of these wastes in land disposalunits. It is also important to point out that this is one of premises behindthe EPA's establishment of petition processes for obtaining a variancefrom the treatment standard.In the proposed rule, EPA recognized the possibility that wastewater formsof these wastes could be generated at a CERCLA site, during a correctiveaction at a RCRA facility, or as a leachate from a landfill. The Agency,therefore, also proposed a ``treatment standard'' for these wastewatersof ``no land disposal''. By establishing this standard, a facility thatgenerated and needed to treat a wastewater, could submit a petition tothe Agency for a variance from this treatment standard. The Agency believedthat few, if any, petitions for a variance would be submitted because facilitiesgenerally discharge these wastewaters to a POTW or surface water undera NPDES permit. However, comments from several facilities that have landdisposal units that contain previously disposed K004, K008, K021, K025,K036, K060, and K100 nonwastewaters, stated that if leachate from thesewastes are identified with their respective waste codes, then the leachatewould be considered wastewater forms and the ``no land disposal'' standardbased on ``no generation'' would not be justified. They also stated thatelimination of land disposal of these wastewaters is not feasible and thatnumerical treatment standards should be promulgated. The Agency agrees that this generation of wastewater could be significant,in that these wastes have been land disposed and do exist in many landdisposal units. Therefore, the Agency has decided to promulgate a finalBDAT treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for only the nonwastewaterforms of K004, K008, K021, K025, K036, K060, and K100 nonwastewaters. EPAdoes intend to propose and promulgate numerical treatment standards forthe wastewater forms of these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. Since no standardis promulgated in today's rule for the wastewater forms of K004, K008,K021, K036, and K060, this subgroup of wastes is restricted from land disposalaccording to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. Because K025 and K100 arewastes from the Second Third and Third Third, respectively, these provisionsare not applicable to the wastewater forms of K025 until June 8, 1989 andthe wastewater forms of K100 until May 8, 1990 (unless individual numericaltreatment standards are proposed and promulgated prior to those dates).[Note: As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA is amending andSection;268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from the treatment of ``softhammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachate derived fromthe management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' waste contaminatedgroundwater; thereby moving the aforementioned types of wastewaters intothe group of wastes identified as the Third Third. Thus, these types ofK004, K008, K021, K036, and K060 wastewaters are not subject to the ``softhammer'' prohibitions in andSection; 268.33(f). This action will allow thesewastewater residues to be disposed in nonminimum technology units and suchresidues will not be subject to the certification requirements of andSection;268.8.] <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K004, K008, K021, K025, K036, K060,<T4>and </T4>K100 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>  </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="28">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON NO GENERATION</ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Appropriate Technologies for Certain First Third Wastes for WhichEPA Has Not Promulgated Treatment Standards </ITAG>For the First Third Wastes identified in the tables at the end of thissection, today's rule promulgates no specific BDAT treatment standards.RCRA section 3004(g)(6) (42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(6)) provides that if EPA failsto set treatment standards for any hazardous waste included in the schedulepromulgated on May 28, 1986 (51 FR 19300) by the statutory deadline, suchwaste may be land disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only ifthe facility meets certain statutory requirements and only until May 8,1990. These requirements have been termed the ``soft hammer'' provisions.EPA has identified several treatment technologies that are generally consideredappropriate for the nonwastewater forms of the First Third Wastes. Thesetechnologies include: metal recovery, leaching/oxidation, metals stabilization,ash stabilization, chemical oxidation, cyanide destruction, biodegradation,incineration, PCB incineration, and open detonation/open burning. Treatmenttechnologies generally considered appropriate for the wastewater formsof the First Third Wastes include: aqueous metal recovery, chromium reduction,metals precipitation, steam stripping, carbon adsorption, oxidation/reduction,chemical oxidation, cyanide destruction, biodegradation, incineration,and PCB incineration. As discussed in detail in section III.C.3., EPA isamending andSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residues derived from thetreatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes, as well as leachatederived from the management of ``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer''waste contaminated groundwater. This action will allow these wastewaterresidues to be disposed in nonminimum technology units and such residueswill not be subject to the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8.The technologies are listed as general categories of technologies thatEPA believes have a reasonable probability of application to the wastecodes listed. These categories do not specify any particular type of technology(e.g., incineration can represent liquid incinerators, rotary kiln, fluidizedbed incinerators, etc.). The actual choice of a particular technology oreven train of technologies depends on the physical and chemical characteristicsof the specific waste or waste code. Specific selection of one technologydepends on its functional design (e.g., if a particular nonwastewater isan organic liquid, then a liquid incinerator may be chosen over one designedto handle only solids). EPA notes that many of these wastes, when existing as untreated wastes,are already prohibited from land disposal because they are California Listwastes. The liquid cyanide wastes, for example, could exceed the statutoryprohibition levels for cyanide. Several of the organic hazardous wastesundoubtedly exceed the statutory levels for wastes containing halogenatedorganics (HOC wastes) and are thus subject to the HOC treatment standard(after the effective date). For further discussion of the relationshipof the California list prohibitions to ``soft hammer'' wastes refer tosection III.E.1. The following tables are presented as an aid to generators seeking appropriatetechnologies to treat ``soft hammer'' F- and K-listed wastes. [For a discussionof the treatment requirements for ``soft hammer'' wastes refer to sectionIII.C.] Several technologies are listed for each waste code, in descendingorder of preference. EPA notes that certain technologies are only appropriatefor certain constituent types (i.e., cyanide destruction is appropriatefor cyanide, not to metals or organics) and that more than one treatmenttechnology may be required (if practically available) to treat the differentconstituents of concern in the waste. Thus, an F007 nonwastewater couldrequire both cyanide destruction and metals recovery or stabilization priorto land disposal in a landfill or surface impoundment. Also, while onetreatment process may generally satisfy the treatment requirements for``soft hammer'' waste, the Agency recognizes that treatment trains (i.e.,a combination of different treatment processes) may be appropriate forcertain ``soft hammer'' wastes. For example, K022 wastewaters may requiretreatment by several of the technologies listed. The Agency emphasizes that these tables are not to be considered as stricttreatment guidelines. In general, however, EPA will use these tables inevaluating the demonstrations and certifications (see section III.C.3.)received for these wastes and is providing this information to aid thegenerator in determining the best practically available technology (ifany) for treating his waste in compliance with andSection; 268.8.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Appropriate Treatment Technologies for First Third Nonwastewaters </T4><H1>RCRA waste code </H1><H1>Potential California list applicability </H1><H1>Primary applicable treatment technologies</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">F007 <D>Cyanides </D><D>Cyanide destruction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F008 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F009 <D>Metals </D><D>Metals recovery. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F019 <D> </D><D>Metals Stabilization. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K011 <D>Cyanides </D><D>Cyanide destruction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K013 <D> </D><D>Incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K014 <D> </D><D>Wet air oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Ash stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K017 <D>Halogenated organics </D><D>Incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K073 <D> </D><D>Biodegradation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Ash stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K031 <D>Arsenic </D><D>Metals recovery. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K084 <D> </D><D>Leaching/oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K101 and K102/high arsenic <D> </D><D>Metals stabilization. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K046/explosive <D>Lead </D><D>Open detonate/burn. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Oxidation of explosive. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Incineration. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Metals stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K069/CaSO4 <D>Lead </D><D>Leaching/oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Metals stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K085 <D>Halogenated organics and PCB's </D><D>PCB incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Biodegradation. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Ash stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K035 <D>Organics and/or metals </D><D>Incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K083 <D> </D><D>Wet air oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K086 solv. sludges caust. water <D> </D><D>Biodegradation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Ash stabilization. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K106 <D>Mercury </D><D>Metals recovery. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Metals stabilization.</D></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s200,r100,xs100 </C><T4>Appropriate Treatment Technologies for First Third Wastewaters </T4><H1>RCRA waste code </H1><H1>Potential California list applicability </H1><H1>Primary applicable treatment technologies</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">F006 <D>Cyanides </D><D>Cyanide destruction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F007 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F008 <D>Metals </D><D>Aqueous metals recovery. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F009 <D> </D><D>Chromium reduction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F019 <D> </D><D>Metals precipitation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K004 <D>Chromium </D><D>Chromium reduction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K008 <D> </D><D>Metals precipitation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K061/all </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K011 <D>Cyanides </D><D>Cyanide destruction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K013 <D> </D><D>Carbon adsorption. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K014 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K017 <D>Halogenated organics </D><D>Steam stripping. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K021 <D> </D><D>Carbon adsorption. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K073 <D> </D><D>Chemical oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Biodegradation. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K022 <D>Unlikely to be applicable </D><D>Steam stripping. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K035 <D> </D><D>Carbon adsorption. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K036 <D> </D><D>Chemical oxidation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K083 <D> </D><D>Biodegradation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K060 <D> </D><D>Metals precipitation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K031 <D>Arsenic, Lead or Mercury </D><D>Oxidation/reduction. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K046/nonexplosive <D> </D><D>Metals precipitation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K069/all </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K084 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K106 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K046/explosive <D>Lead </D><D>Oxidation of explosive. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>  </D><D>Metals precipitation. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K085 <D>Halogenated Organics and PCB's </D><D>PCB incineration. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Biodegradation. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Carbon adsorption. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">K086 solv. sludges caust. water <D>Halogenated Organics and/or </D><D>Biodegradation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Carbon adsorption. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Metals </D><D>Chromium reduction. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Metals precipitation.</D></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Burning in Industrial Boilers and Industrial Furnaces as BDAT forCertain California List HOCs </ITAG>In the May 17 proposal, EPA proposed to amend the andSection; 268.42(a)(2)treatment standard (i.e., incineration) applicable to certain Californialist HOCs to include burning in industrial boilers and furnaces (53 FR17604). This approach was based on an earlier May 6, 1987 proposed ruleon boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste (52 FR 17021)and was reproposed in the May 17 proposal because the change in the HOCtreatment standard will precede the boiler and industrial furnace rule(which is scheduled for promulgation in 1989) which will establish finalpermitting and interim status standards for emissions from these devices.The Agency is prepared to accept this discrepancy in timing of the boilersand furnaces rule because these devices are likely to be operated efficientlyso as to achieve substantial destruction of the HOCs in the waste. Thisis because industrial boilers and furnaces have a commercial purpose whichrequires relatively efficient burning (see andSection; 260.10 definitionsof ``boiler'' and ``industrial furnace''). In addition, non-industrialboilers, some of which might be expected to destroy HOCs less efficiently,are essentially prohibited from burning hazardous waste at all (see andSection;266.31(b)). While many commenters agreed with the Agency's proposal, EPA received severalcomments opposed to this approach, stating that the amendment to the HOCtreatment standard should be delayed until the industrial boilers and furnacesemissions standards are effective. However, the Agency maintains that thereasoning presented in the May 17 proposal is valid and is promulgatingthe proposed amendment to andSection; 268.42(a)(2). Today's rule will allowindustrial boilers and furnaces burning in accordance with applicable regulatorystandards to burn California list HOCs. When Part 266 standards becomeeffective for these devices, the devices thus must meet these standards.Until then, these devices must meet other applicable Federal, State andlocal standards. B. Testing and Recordkeeping <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Analysis </ITAG>With the exception of the ``no land disposal'' standard (as discussed insection III. A. 6.), the treatment standards established in today's actionare based on either (1) the concentration levels of the hazardous constituentsin the waste or treatment residual, (2) concentration levels in an extractdeveloped by use of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP),or (3) concentration levels using both total constituent concentrationsand TCLP analyses. Expressing treatment standards as constituent concentrationlevels reflects the performance achieved by the technology (or combinationof technologies) identified as the Best Demonstrated Available Technology(BDAT). In the April 8, 1988 and May 17, 1988 proposed rulemakings, the Agencydiscussed the rationale for determining the analytical tests that EPA believesprovide the most accurate measure of the performance of the technologiesidentified as BDAT. Generally, wastes for which destruction and/or removaltechnologies are BDAT (specifically, technologies that act to destroy organicconstituents and recovery processes that reduce the metal concentrationin a waste) would require a total constituent concentration analysis. Conversely,wastes for which stabilization or fixation technologies (i.e., technologiesthat decrease waste constituent mobility) are identified as BDAT, wouldrequire a TCLP extract analysis. EPA also used the TCLP as a measure ofperformance of metal recovery technologies on the basis that the leachabilityof metals remaining in the residual should also be analyzed as a measureof performance. In cases where a combination of both destruction or removaltechnologies and stabilization or fixation technologies are identifiedas BDAT, both analyses were employed to monitor compliance with the treatmentstandards. EPA solicited comment on this approach. Many of the commenters generally argued that the proposed waste analysisrequirements were inappropriate for use or too restrictive. Several commentersargued that the use of total constituent analysis is unnecessarily stringent,is beyond levels needed to protect human health and the environment, anddoes not provide generators with flexibility in determining how best tomeet the treatment standards. Some commenters asserted that where treatmentstandards are based on total constituent analysis, the development of innovativetechnologies and the application of existing technologies intended to reducemobility will be discouraged. Other commenters expressed concern with theadditional cost of the waste analysis requirements, particularly in caseswhere both testing methods must be used. Concerns with respect to the applicabilityof the analytical tests to complex mixtures of wastes were also expressed.Some commenters suggested an approach whereby the treatment standard wouldbe developed based on both total constituent analysis and TCLP extractanalysis, and would provide the generators with the flexibility of choosingthe most appropriate analytical methodology.Critical to the scheme for restricting land disposal of First Third wastesis the determination of whether certain constituent concentrations in wastesor treatment residues exceed the applicable treatment standards. Sincetoday's treatment standards are based upon the performance capabilitiesof BDAT, the Agency continues to believe that the testing requirementsshould focus on the objective of the technology and provide the most accuratemeasure of the performance of that technology. Because the principle behinddestruction and recovery technologies is to destroy or reduce the constituentconcentration in a waste, the logical way to measure the performance ofthese technologies is to analyze total concentration of waste constituents.As noted in the April 8, 1988 proposal with respect to organic constituents,Congress expected that treatment would destroy organic constituents inhazardous wastes [Vol. 130 Cong. Rec. S9179 (daily ed. July 25, 1984)].Where stabilization or fixation technologies are identified as BDAT, theTCLP is a better measure of performance since it is designed to measurethe mobility of hazardous constituents from a waste matrix. The Agencybelieves this rationale to be the most defensible and thus is imposingthe proposed waste testing/analysis approach as part of the land disposalrestriction rules being finalized today. This approach does not allow the choice of analytical methodologies, assuggested by some commenters, since the design of each analytical test(total constituent analysis or extract analysis) is most appropriate formonitoring the performance of certain technologies, but is not as appropriatefor monitoring others. Commenters indicated that this approach may hinderthe application of stabilization or fixation technologies. However, itwill only do so where (a) current technologies intended to reduce mobilityare unable to reach the level of performance provided by BDAT or (b) wheresuch technologies are not applicable or appropriate on a waste-specificbasis. Since the treatment standards are based upon the ``best'' availabletreatment technologies, the Agency believes that the constituent concentrationcapable of being reached by these treatments must be measured by analyticalmethods which reflect the levels for which the ``best'' treatments weredesigned. With respect to analysis of complex mixtures of wastes, the Agencyrecognizes that such wastes potentially may increase the total number ofconstituents with corresponding treatment standards. However, waste analysisrequirements are limited to two analytical tests (total constituent analysisor the TCLP), even if all existing restriction rules are applicable tothe waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Notification Requirements </ITAG>The Agency, in today's rule, is broadening the applicability of the andSection;268.7 notification provisions to apply to the First Third wastes, whetheror not treatment standards have been established. For First Third wastesfor which treatment standards and effective dates have been established,the notification requirements are the same as for other restricted wastes.However, for ``soft hammer'' wastes, the applicable statutory waste managementrequirements are somewhat different than for other restricted wastes (namely,a RCRA section 3004(g)(6) certification to EPA is not required for ``softhammer'' wastes when land disposed in units other than landfills or surfaceimpoundments). To account for these differences, today's rule includescorresponding requirements in andSection; 268.7. The basic difference between the notification applicable to the ``softhammer'' wastes and the notification applicable to other restricted wastesis that rather than requiring notice of the applicable treatment standardor applicable prohibition (see existing andSection; 268.7(a)(1)), the noticefor ``soft hammer'' wastes requires the generator to notify the receivingfacility of the applicable ``soft hammer'' prohibitions codified in andSection;268.33 (i.e., that such wastes are prohibited from land disposal in landfilland surface impoundment units unless accompanied by a valid certification(and demonstration, if applicable) in accordance with the requirementsof andSection; 268.8, relating to the practical unavailability of treatmenttechnologies). The EPA Hazardous Waste Number, the manifest number associatedwith the waste shipment (if any), and any available waste analysis datamust also be included in this ``soft hammer'' notice. The notificationwill inform treatment facilities (and other handlers) of the obligationto treat ``soft hammer'' wastes destined for disposal in landfill or surfaceimpoundment units to the extent treatment is practically available. Thisnotification also serves to inform managers of these wastes that the storageprohibition in andSection; 268.50 is applicable to the waste. Furthermore, today's action amends andSection; 268.7(a)(3) to specify thatgenerators of wastes which are the subject of case-by-case extensions ornational variances, or disposers of wastes with ``no migration'' exemptionsmust provide notification with each shipment of waste to treatment andstorage facilities receiving the wastes. This change supplements, and isconsistent with, the existing requirements to notify disposal facilities.The Agency is also requiring that generators retain copies of this notification.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Recordkeeping Requirements </ITAG>The November 7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) established a tracking systemfor wastes subject to the land disposal restrictions requiring treatmentfacilities to have copies of the notifications and certifications receivedfrom generators or other treatment facilities, and disposal facilitiesto have copies of the notifications and certifications provided by generatorsor treatment, storage and disposal facilities as codified in 40 CFR 268.7.To better facilitate the ``cradle-to-grave'' tracking system, today's actionincludes amendments to the recordkeeping regulations to cover additionaloff site shipment scenarios and facilities which were previously overlooked.In addition, today's rule amends the recordkeeping provisions to includecertain record retention requirements.The previous recordkeeping provisions were applicable to generators, treatmentfacilities, and land disposal facilities, but the rule language omittedmention of facilities that simply store prohibited wastes without treatingthem. As indicated in the April 8, 1988 proposal, there is no reason forstorage facilities not to be covered by the recordkeeping requirements.The Agency believes that all facilities receiving restricted wastes shouldbe on notice that the waste is restricted and should be notified of theapplicable treatment standard (or applicable prohibition) for the wasteas part of a ``cradle-to-grave'' recordkeeping system. Accordingly, theAgency has corrected this oversight by including storage facilities underthe recordkeeping requirements of andSection; 268.7. Besides the ``generator-to-storage''scenario, this notification requirement also applies to a treatment, storageor disposal facility that sends a restricted waste (or treatment residue)off site to another treatment or storage facility. Note that this requirementis applicable to all restricted wastes, not only those affected by today'srulemaking. EPA also proposed to amend the regulatory language of andSection; 268.7(a)(3).This requirement concerns the case where a generator's restricted wasteis eligible for land disposal because it is subject to an extension ofthe effective date or a ``no migration'' exemption (i.e., the waste maybe land disposed, but will not necessarily meet the otherwise applicabletreatment standards). In accordance with this provision, the generatormust notify the disposal facility of the status of his waste. However,current regulatory language does not account for the possibility that thewaste may not be sent directly to the land disposal facility, but ratherto a treatment or storage facility. To avoid confusion in cases where thewastes are not shipped to a disposal facility, and to be consistent withother andSection; 268.7 recordkeeping requirements, the Agency is amendingandSection; 268.7(a)(3), as proposed, to require that the notice be sentwith each shipment of waste to the receiving facility. Today's rule is adding a provision (see new andSection; 268.7(a)(5)) to requiregenerators to retain copies of data from testing the waste, treatment residual,or extract of the waste or treatment residual developed using the TCLP.The Agency believes that this addition to the regulations will establishconsistency with the existing provisions requiring that data supportingdecisions to restrict wastes based on knowledge of the wastes must be maintainedin the generator's files. Furthermore, this action enhances the enforceabilityof the regulations. Today's action also modifies the tracking system to include in andSection;andSection;268.7(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) provisions stating thatgenerators and storers must retain copies of the notifications and certificationsforwarded to treatment, storage, and disposal facilities and received fromstorage facilities. The Agency believes that these changes enhance theenforceability of the land disposal restrictions regulations and make generatorand storage recordkeeping requirements consistentandCx.18; with the recordkeepingrequirements of treatment and disposal facilities. Today's final rule also modifies andSection; 268.7(a) to provide for a limitationon the time period that records are required to be retained by generators.Under current regulations, owners and operators of facilities are requiredto maintain andSection; 268.7 records for a finite period of time, i.e.,until closure of the facility (andSection;andSection; 264.73(b) and 265.73(b)).Previously, however, the regulatory language did not stipulate a periodof time that generators needed to retain applicable records (i.e., allsupporting data used to determine that a waste is restricted based solelyon the generator's knowledge). As such, generators were required to maintainrecords for an indefinite period of time. In light of the additional informationrequired to be maintained by generators under today's amendments to andSection;268.7 (i.e., copies of the andSection; 268.7 notices, certifications, andall waste analysis data), the Agency believes that a finite time periodmay be a more appropriate burden on generators, while preserving the Agency'senforcement ability. In the May 17, 1988 notice, the Agency proposed a 5-year limitation onthe retention requirement for all records generators produce to complywith andSection; 268.7 of the land disposal restrictions. EPA proposed (consistentwith section 262.40 manifest requirements) that (a) the time period wouldbegin on the date that the restricted waste is sent to on-site or off-sitetreatment, storage, or disposal, and (b) the retention requirement wouldbe extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcementactions. EPA, however, did not propose to develop an exception reportingrequirement like that required in the generator manifest provisions. TheAgency recognized that the proposed retention period differed from andSection;262.40, which requires generators to maintain a copy of the manifest fora 3-year period, but considered the 5-year limit to be an appropriate compromiseto imposing an additional exception reporting requirement. The Agency solicitedcomment on this approach. Several commenters supported a record retention period of 3 years to beconsistent with the generator recordkeeping requirements relating to manifestsand waste analysis (see 40 CFR 262.40(a) and (c)). One commenter statedthat the EPA would have ample opportunity to review these records withinthe 3-year period. Furthermore, it was indicated that a 5-year limit maylead to unnecessary confusion for both the regulated community and theregulators with respect to recordkeeping procedures. The Agency disagrees with the commenters and is promulgating the 5-yeargenerator record retention period as proposed. EPA does not believe thatsuch a retention period will lead to unnecessary confusion. Since suchrecords are already required to be generated, the Agency is not imposingany additional requirement that generators affirmatively take action. Thisrequirement simply provides that generators leave such records in theirfiles for two more years rather than affirmatively taking action to destroysuch records after three years. This 5-year time period is particularlyimportant to the Agency's enforcement efforts because it allows EPA toobtain relevant records which would otherwise be lawfully destroyed afterthree years. Furthermore, the Agency believes that a 5-year record retentionrequirement is appropriate because it is consistent with the 5-year statuteof limitations applicable to RCRA civil violations. In addition, Agency data now indicate that andSection; 268.7 notices arebeing included on manifests in few circumstances. Therefore, adopting sucha requirement should not have a substantial impact on the generator manifestretention requirements. As proposed, the record retention limit is extended automatically duringthe course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulatedactivity or as requested by the Administrator. For the purpose of thisprovision, an unresolved enforcement action includes, but is not limitedto, the issuance of a Notice of Violation, a warning letter, or situationswhere a complaint has actually been filed. The Agency notes that it expects the requirement on the generator to keeprecords of notifications and waste analysis data to be discontinued in1994 (i.e., the latest date by which all listed or identified hazardouswastes will be subject to the treatment requirements of andSection;andSection;268.41, 268.42 and 268.43_assuming that certain wastes may be subject toa 2-year national capacity variance followed by two 1-year case by-caseextensions under 40 CFR 268.5). At that time, EPA will, however, reevaluatethe prevalent waste management practices to determine whether the recordkeepingrequirement for generators is necessary and should be extended.C. ``Soft Hammer'' Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability </ITAG>RCRA 3004(g)(6) (42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(6)) provides that if EPA fails to settreatment standards for any wastes included in the schedule promulgatedon May 28, 1986 (40 CFR 268.10-268.12, 51 FR 19300) by the statutory deadline:<ITAG tagnum="21">Such hazardous waste may be disposed of in a landfill or surface impoundmentonly if_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Such facility is in compliance with the requirements of subsection(o) which are applicable to new facilities (relating to minimum technologicalrequirements); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Prior to such disposal, the generator has certified to the Administratorthat such generator has investigated the availability of treatment capacityand has determined that the use of such landfill or surface impoundmentis the only practical alternative to treatment currently available to thegenerator. (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)(A))</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This so-called ``soft hammer'' applies until EPA sets treatment standardsor until May 8, 1990. After May 8, 1990, all scheduled wastes (except thosesubject to capacity extensions) for which treatment standards have notbeen set will be prohibited from all methods of land disposal that havenot been determined to be protective through the ``no migration'' process(40 CFR 268.6). In today's final rule, the Agency is not setting treatment standards forall wastes covered by the statutory requirements. EPA thus is promulgatingregulations implementing the ``soft hammer'' provisions of RCRA. In the April 8 proposal, the Agency discussed the applicability of ``softhammer'' provisions to wastes also subject to the California list prohibitions(52 FR 25760, July 8, 1987). In today's final rule, the Agency has maintainedthe interpretation discussed in the proposal. During the period in whichthe ``soft hammer'' provisions are in effect, those wastes which are currentlysubject to the California list requirements would remain so, and thus mightbe prohibited from land disposal even though they are also ``soft hammer''wastes. Likewise, compliance with the California list requirements doesnot necessarily fulfill the requirements of the ``soft hammer'' provisions.In previous preambles, the Agency has stated that the more waste-specifictreatment standards and effective dates will supersede the less waste-specificCalifornia list requirements. In this case, the Agency has not made determinationswith respect to the specific ``soft hammer'' wastes, and such wastes must(at the least) be treated or otherwise comply with the applicable Californialist requirements. For a more detailed discussion of the relationship ofthe California list requirements to First Third wastes, refer to sectionIII. E. of this preamble. The Agency is somewhat changing the applicability of the ``soft hammer''provisions from that presented in the April 8 proposal by moving certain``soft hammer'' wastewater treatment residuals to the Third Third (i.e.,andSection; 268.12). The specific wastewater treatment residuals and thejustification for this action is discussed in detail in section III. C.3. It is important to note that the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8,including the demonstrations, certifications, and treatment requirements,are only applicable to those ``soft hammer'' wastes which (1) are not otherwisesubject to California list treatment standards (e.g., halogenated organiccompounds and polychlorinated biphenyls) (as opposed to California liststatutory prohibitions or codified levels, e.g., liquid metal and cyanide-containingwastes), and (2) are to be disposed in landfills or surface impoundments.``Soft hammer'' wastes managed by other methods of land disposal (e.g.,land treatment, deep-well injection), or ``soft hammer'' wastes subjectto California list treatment standards thus are not subject to the requirementsof 40 CFR 268.8. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Interpretation of Specific Terms </ITAG>In the statutory passage from RCRA section 3004(g)(6)(A) cited above, theterms ``treatment'' and ``facility'' are particularly important and werediscussed in detail in the April 8 proposal. EPA received many commentsregarding the interpretation of these terms, as well as the term ``practical'',as they relate to implementation of the ``soft hammer''. a. <T3>Treatment.</T3> In the April 8 proposal, EPA solicited comment on theinterpretation of ``treatment'' for the purposes of the ``soft hammer''.Many commenters stated that the Agency needed to define ``treatment'' inmore concrete terms so that there would be a firm standard to serve asthe basis for certification. (In fact, many owners and operators of disposalfacilities stated that they would refuse to accept ``soft hammer'' wastesbecause of the uncertainty of possible enforcement actions due to the ambiguityinvolving the term ``treatment''.) In spite of such comments, the Agency is not finalizing an interpretationof ``treatment'' that is much more definitive than in the April 8 proposal.Due to the complexity of available treatment technologies, the Agency isnot able to make firm statements defining a hierarchy of treatment technologiesfor every ``soft hammer'' waste code, the availability of which shouldbe investigated before a valid certification can be made regarding a particularwaste code. By definition, the Agency has not made waste-specific determinationsregarding ``soft hammer'' wastes, and therefore cannot make a specificinterpretation of ``treatment'' for each waste code (such an interpretationwould be tantamount to a ``soft hammer'' treatment standard, which is acontradiction in terms). However, the Agency is able to offer a list ofappropriate technologies to be considered as treatment for most of theF- and K-list ``soft hammer'' wastes (see section III. A. 8). In addition,EPA can list generic types of treatment for organic and inorganic wastes,in order of preference (i.e., which are best, next best, and so forth).However, as a preliminary matter, the Agency feels a discussion of theproposed approaches to interpreting ``treatment'' and comments receivedwill be useful in understanding the difficulties encountered were one totake an alternative approach.In the April 8 proposal, EPA expressed its belief that Congress intendedthat, during the period of the ``soft hammer'', only wastes treated tothe most protective levels achievable by practically available technologies(if any) may be land disposed in landfills and surface impoundments (andthat only the most protective of such units, i.e., units meeting the minimumtechnological requirements (MTRs) of section 3004(o), may be used). However,the Agency also stated that treatment is not required solely for the sakeof treatment. Having not made waste-specific determinations regarding the treatabilityof ``soft hammer'' wastes, the problem facing the Agency is to implementan enforceable approach to the ``soft hammer'' provisions by interpreting``treatment'' such that it yields the most environmental benefit practicallyavailable, avoids treatment for the sake of treatment, and does not allowsham or <T3>de minimis </T3>treatment. An interpretation which is too stringent(i.e., an interpretation limiting ``treatment'' to BDAT-type treatment)could actually result in more untreated wastes being disposed in landfillsand surface impoundments either because of the lack of such treatment capacityor because the treatment would possibly increase costs beyond a point thatwould be considered practical. Too lenient an interpretation (i.e., allowingthe use of minimal treatment prior to disposal in a landfill or surfaceimpoundment) could conceivably result in requiring treatment for the sakeof treatment (an unnecessary burden on generators with little or no environmentalbenefit) or could actually encourage the use of sham or <T3>de minimis </T3>treatment where more protective treatment is practicallyavailable. The Agency does not believe this is what Congress intended.EPA requested comment on an approach that would limit the scope of treatmenttechnologies to those that yield a designated percent reduction in thetoxicity or mobility of hazardous constituents, using a 20% reduction asan example. The Agency received mixed comments, some supporting and someopposing the approach. Some of those supporting the approach suggestedlimiting the percent reduction to at least 90%. In reviewing comments,the Agency realizes that this approach would fail to mitigate the ambiguitiesof ``treatment''. Many commenters expressed concerns in evaluating thepercent reduction, especially where a waste or mixture of wastes containsboth organics and inorganics (the reduction of organics could concentratethe inorganics). Another problem would be to specify the waste analysismethod to be used to evaluate percent reduction. And finally, it is clearto the Agency that many generators lack the expertise to identify appropriatetechnologies yielding the designated percent reduction without possiblycostly and time-consuming analyses. Thus, the Agency would be compelledto identify technologies that yield the designated percent reduction forall ``soft hammer'' wastes, which the Agency is unable to do. Therefore,EPA is not finalizing this approach to interpreting ``treatment''. EPA also requested comment on an approach requiring that ``soft hammer''wastes be treated to achieve meaningful reductions of waste toxicity ormobility and stating that sham or <T3>de minimis </T3>treatment cannot give rise to a valid certification.Here again, ambiguity regarding the term ``meaningful'' concerned manycommenters. Also, this approach does not clearly state the Agency's preferencefor the use of practically available technologies to treat ``soft hammer''wastes, providing the most environmental benefit. (Although several commentersindicated that Congress intended to allow ``soft hammer'' wastes to bedisposed without an additional burden of treatment, allowing for whatevertreatment has been previously used, the Agency strongly disagrees and believesthat Congress certainly would prefer the best practically available treatmentof ``soft hammer'' waste to less complete levels of treatment.) In today's final rule, the Agency is interpreting ``treatment'' as processingwhich reduces the toxicity of the waste or the likelihood of migrationof hazardous constituents from the waste. The Agency had attempted to providesome further detail to this broad interpretation by identifying waste managementpractices which EPA does not intend to require (or encourage) and by providingdiscussions in this preamble on the types of treatment the generator isexpected to investigate. The Agency emphasizes that it does not intend to require repetitive treatmentby the same processes, such as re-incinerating ash derived from the incinerationof the original waste. In many cases the Agency expects that the use ofa single process to treat the waste, or quite possibly, one process fortreating organics and a second process for treating inorganics, will satisfythe treatment requirements of andSection; 268.8. EPA is not, however, absolutelylimiting the treatment requirement to a single process because the appropriatetreatment for some wastes may involve a standard treatment train of sequentialprocesses, or the treatment residuals from one process may require a secondtreatment process. For example, use of steam stripping to treat wastewatermay result in a concentrated stream that may require incineration beforedisposal (where the material cannot be recycled). Another example mightbe ash from incinerating an organic/metal-containing waste. In this case,further treatment (e.g., stabilization) might be required (depending onthe concentration level of metals and the practical availability of stabilization).A final example is a waste containing metals and cyanides, which wouldrequire separate treatments for both types of constituents. The Agencywill evaluate previous practices to determine whether such a train of multipletreatment steps is appropriate for a given waste. As stated earlier, EPA is not requiring treatment solely for the sake oftreatment. EPA believes appropriate technologies exist to treat ``softhammer'' wastes, although these technologies may be determined not to bepractically available. The Agency is not requiring, in the absence of practicallyavailable, appropriate technologies, that technologies which are not appropriatefor a given waste be used. However, the appropriate technology which resultsin the most environmental benefit (i.e., in general, the greatest reductionin toxicity or mobility of hazardous constituents) must be used where practicaland available. EPA has attempted to provide some assistance to the generator on the typesof treatment that should be investigated prior to making a certificationunder andSection; 268.8. This assistance is presented in two ways. First,in section III.A.8. of this preamble, EPA provided a list of technologiesappropriate for treating specific F- and K-list ``soft hammer'' wastes,in order of preference, i.e., best to next-best and so forth. Because theAgency has not made a specific determination regarding the treatabilityof each waste, it cannot simply state that the most-preferred technologyis BDAT and that each less-preferred technology yields a correspondinglyless environmental benefit. However, in general, EPA will use this listof preferred technologies as a basic guide to evaluating whether the generatorhas investigated the technologies that yield the greater environmentalbenefit. Also, these appropriate technologies are listed by broad descriptionswhich EPA generally will not differentiate into more specific types oftreatment. For example, ``incineration'' may mean liquid injection incineration,fluidized bed incineration, or rotary kiln incineration. Another exampleis ``stabilization'', which can include the use of silicates, lime/flyash, cement, or cement kiln dust. Although EPA generally will not differentiatebetween the different specific treatment systems within the treatment category,the Agency <T3>will </T3>differentiate between the broad categories (i.e., the Agencymay invalidate a certification for ``stabilization'' of organics if ``incineration''is practically available, assuming incineration is the more-preferred treatmentfor the particular waste).Second, the Agency is providing assistance in the form of a generic hierarchyof preferred treatment types (discussed later in this section). Where thegeneric hierarchy of preferred treatment types is used, the Agency willgenerally not differentiate between individual technologies within thegeneric treatment type to determine whether a different technology shouldbe used. Rather, the Agency will evaluate whether a technology belongingto a more preferred generic treatment type is practically available. Forexample, ``destruction'' may mean thermal destruction or chemical destruction.In general, the Agency will not differentiate between the two; however,the Agency may invalidate a certification if a recovery process (a more-preferredgeneric treatment type) is practically available. These lists of appropriate technologies and generic treatment types arenot intended to be comprehensive, nor are they a complete catalog of thetypes of treatment that may be appropriate to consider in evaluating availabletreatment for a specific waste. There may indeed be other types of appropriatetechnologies available to the generator of which the Agency is unaware(e.g., innovative technologies which the Agency may not consider ``demonstrated''or ``available'' for the purposes of BDAT). [It should also be noted thata more detailed consideration of the actual performance of the technologiesmay, in fact, reveal that EPA's assumed hierarchy is incorrect for anyspecific waste and that there may be specific waste streams where a higher-rankedappropriate technology does not provide the greater environmental benefitor is not appropriate for the waste stream. For example, a particular ``organic''waste stream may contain an unusually high concentration of metals, suchthat incineration would not be considered appropriate.] As a practicalmatter, the lists of appropriate technologies and generic hierarchy oftreatment types represent the minimum effort a generator should make inseeking treatment for his waste, serving as a basis for determining whethertreatment is practically available. The Agency may require further justificationin the demonstration if the certifier has not investigated the availabilityof the appropriate technologies listed for a specific waste. Generically, the Agency generally favors recycling/recovery as the bestmethod for treating a waste, eliminating or reducing the residual to bedisposed. Where recycling is unavailable or inappropriate or ineffective,the Agency prefers technologies resulting in the destruction of hazardousconstituents, where such destruction may be either thermal (i.e., incinerationor burning) or chemical, especially for organics. Where neither recoverynor destruction is available or appropriate, immobilization (stabilization)is often effective, especially for inorganic constituents (Cf. H. Rep.No. 198, 98th Cong. lst Sess. 31 (setting out a comparable hierarchy ofpreferred waste management alternatives)). EPA wishes to note that, giventhe results of the TSDR Survey (see section III. H.), the Agency believesthat liquid incineration and stabilization are generally available (althoughthe generator must determine whether such treatment is appropriate or practicallyavailable for his waste). b. <T3>Facility.</T3> As proposed in the April 8 proposal, the Agency interpretsthe term ``such facility'' in RCRA section 3004(g)(6)(A) to refer to theindividual landfill or surface impoundment unit. This interpretation resultsin the requirement that where ``soft hammer'' wastes (and treatment residues)are disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment, such unit must meetthe minimum technological requirements (MTRs) of 3004(o) applicable tonew units (i.e., double liners, leachate collection system, and groundwatermonitoring). The Agency received numerous comments on its proposed interpretation of``such facility''. Most commenters opposed this restrictive use of theterm and urged the Agency to interpret the term more broadly as referringto the entire facility, so that wastes could be disposed in any unit solong as any new, expanded or replacement units on the facility met theMTRs. The Agency does not agree with these comments and for reasons discussedin the preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 11766) is finalizing the interpretationas proposed. To accept the interpretation urged by commenters would rendersection 3004(g)(6) meaningless; facilities are required to meet the requirementsof section 3004(o) already by virtue of that provision. A further commandto do so is unnecessary. As noted at proposal, the legislative historyto this provision also strongly favors the Agency's reading. Moreover,these commenters ignore the remainder of section 3004(g)(6), which notonly refers to ``such facility'' (referring back to landfills and impoundments),but also applies requirements that apply to new facilities, i.e., doubleliners and leachate collection systems. EPA's interpretation is also consistent with the special concern that Congresshas for surface impoundments and landfills as reflected in section 1002(b)(7)of RCRA:<ITAG tagnum="21">Certain classes of land disposal facilities are not capable of assuringlong term containment of hazardous waste, * * *  and land disposal, particularlylandfill and surface impoundment, should be the least favored method formanaging hazardous wastes;</ITAG>Further, the Agency believes that the alternative of accepting the useof the word facility as applying to all units within the property boundarywould not lead to the interpretation that the commenters wished, but ratherto an even more restrictive result, requiring that the wastes only be disposedat facilities where every landfill and surface impoundment unit at thefacility met the MTRs. This results from the reference in the statute to``* * * the requirements of subsection (o) which are applicable to newfacilities (relating to minimum technological requirements)''. At a newfacility (using the property boundary definition of facility), all suchunits would be required to meet the MTRs. Although the literal languageof 3004(g)(6) allows this reading, EPA believes the better interpretationis the one it is adopting. c. <T3>Practical.</T3> EPA received numerous comments on the April 8, 1988proposal regarding the ``soft hammer'' provision. Although the Agency didnot specifically request comment on the term ``practical'', many commentersbelieved this term was crucial to the interpretation of the statute andexpressed their views that Congress intended ``practical'' to refer tothe use of economic considerations in determining whether a treatment technologyis a ``practical'' alternative to land disposal. In general, the Agency does not consider costs when making waste managementdeterminations under RCRA (since EPA is not authorized to do so), but ratherlimits such considerations to technical feasibility. However, EPA agreeswith the commenters' assertions that economic considerations were not specificallyexcluded by Congress under RCRA section 3004(g)(6) and that by using theterm ``practical'', Congress also allowed for cost considerations in evaluatingwhether available treatment is a practical alternative to land disposalfor the purpose of the ``soft hammer'' under 3004(g)(6). Many commenters expressed their concerns that this interpretation may createinconsistencies and confusion regarding a generator's determinations whetheror not treatment is ``practical''. For example, a generator may considerany increase in cost to be impractical and certify an untreated ``softhammer'' waste for disposal when, in fact, cost effective treatment isavailable. Because this certification would be self-implementing and wouldbe considered valid until EPA took action to invalidate it, the Agencybelieves a discussion of how it will evaluate demonstrations with regardto the term ``practical'' is necessary.Without time for further comment, EPA cannot promulgate a strictly quantifiedinterpretation of the term ``practical''. Indeed, as with the interpretationof ``treatment'', such a task is undoubtedly self-defeating. However, theAgency can indicate how it will evaluate demonstrations and certificationsregarding whether a treatment technology is practically available. First, EPA will evaluate demonstrations with a consideration of previouspractices. If a generator's ``soft hammer'' wastes were treated in thepast, the Agency would consider at least this type of treatment to be ``practical''for that generator. (This assumes that the previous practice is currentlyallowable; for example, a previous practice of treatment in a surface impoundmentthat does not qualify for the treatment in surface impoundment exemptionunder andSection; 268.4, is not allowable.) However, the generator must treathis waste by the <T3>best </T3>treatment (i.e., the treatment yielding the greatest environmentalbenefit) that is practically available. The Agency does not intend the``soft hammer'' provisions to act as an excuse to discontinue current treatmentpractices (except where such practices are no longer allowable), nor doesit intend to limit the scope of ``treatment'' to only previously conductedtreatment. Second, EPA is presenting a cost ratio that measures the costs of treatmentrelative to the baseline cost of shipment and disposal in a landfill orsurface impoundment unit meeting the minimum technological requirements(MTRs) of 3004(o). The cost of shipment and disposal in an MTR unit isthe baseline cost because this cost is incurred by both treated and untreated``soft hammer'' wastes (assuming the wastes are disposed in a landfillor surface impoundment; as stated before, wastes disposed by other methodsof land disposal are not subject to the demonstrations and certificationsof andSection; 268.8). In general, given the ratio of: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,0,0),tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s25 </C>  <H1>costs of treatment, shipment and disposal </H1><H2>costs of shipment and disposal</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA will ordinarily consider a ratio of 2.0 or greater not to be ``practical''.Similarly, a ratio of 1.5 or less will usually be considered ``practical''.Within the range of 1.5 to 2.0, EPA will generally consider treatment tobe ``practical'' unless the certifier can demonstrate why this cost shouldbe considered not ``practical'' (subject to judgement of individual circumstances).The Agency emphasizes that this cost ratio and consideration of ``practical''is only a basic reference tool, and not a hard and fast rule. The generatormay demonstrate that a cost ratio of less than 1.5 is not ``practical'';and likewise, EPA may consider a cost ratio of greater than 2.0 to be ``practical'',especially where previous practices so indicate. One anomalous situation could result if EPA relied solely upon this costratio. For example, Generator A has an on-site MTR unit, while GeneratorB (across the street from Generator A) must ship his ``soft hammer'' wasteout of state to a commercial disposal facility. The costs of shipment anddisposal for Generator A would be negligible, and thus, almost any costof treatment would be considered to be not practical, given the ratio above.Conversely, Generator B's baseline costs would be much greater, and thereforecould be required to consider many more treatment technologies as practical.In such cases, EPA will evaluate Generator A's certification and demonstrationof practically available treatment technologies by methods other than theabove cost ratio. EPA will use other considerations, such as knowledgeof available technologies and relative financial status or size of thefacility and evaluate such demonstrations and certifications on a case-by-casebasis. In addition, the Agency emphasizes that where treatment is demonstratedto be a practical alternative to land disposal of untreated wastes, suchtreatment must be used. For example, a generator whose on-site treatmentprocess is not yet on-line may not disregard ``practical'' off-site treatmentand continue to dispose of untreated ``soft hammer'' wastes until his treatmentprocess is on-line. Such a generator must employ the off-site treatment.(<T4>Note._</T4>As discussed later in section III.C.6. of this preamble,the storage prohibition of andSection; 268.50 applies to ``soft hammer''wastes not subject to a <T3>valid </T3>andSection; 268.8 certification. Therefore, ``soft hammer''wastes may only be stored ``* * * for the purpose of the accumulation ofsuch quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate properrecovery, treatment or disposal''.) Furthermore, as stated earlier, the <T3>best </T3>practical <T3>treatment </T3>must be employed (given the list of appropriate technologiesand the generic hierarchy of preferred treatment-types and determinationof ``practical''). This is not to be confused with the <T3>most practical </T3>(or cost-effective) treatment. Once all ``practical''treatments have been identified, then the best treatment must be used.EPA's interpretation of the term ``practical'' also responds to commentsreceived requesting clarification of whether a generator must investigatetreatment on a national or regional basis, or within an established areaof, for example, 200 miles from the site. Given the Agency's interpretationof what constitutes ``practical'', this question becomes moot. The generatormust investigate all practically available treatment, regardless of Stateor Regional boundaries, or any specific distance from the site.As an alternative to the cost ratio, the Agency considered using a financialratio. Under this alternative, EPA would compare the incremental cost oftreating a particular shipment of waste to a measure of the generator'sfinancial strength, and determine that treatment is not practical wherethe ratio exceeded a specified percentage which the Agency believed wouldimpose a significant hardship on the generator. For example, EPA wouldcompare the incremental cost of treatment to the generator's net pre-taxprofit for the waste generation period, and would consider a particulartreatment to be not practical if the incremental cost exceeded X percentof net pre-tax profit. The principal apparent advantage to using a financial ratio instead ofa cost ratio is that it would tie the determination of whether a treatmentis practical to the individual generator's ability to pay for the treatment.Thus the Agency could systematically avoid requiring a generator to incurundue financial hardship in seeking treatment. However, on further analysis,EPA rejected the use of a financial ratio for several reasons. First, the use of any relatively simple financial ratio would tend to discouragewaste minimization. Generators who produced relatively more waste per unitof product than similar generators in their industry would be more likelyto exceed the ratio (all things being equal) and, therefore avoid the incrementaltreatment cost. Thus, this approach could result in rewarding inefficientgenerators for producing excessive amounts of waste; clearly contrary tothe intent of Congress regarding waste minimization. Second, the use of a financial ratio would pose serious implementationdifficulties. For example, evaluating demonstrations for generators whoproduce wastes from diverse processes would require substantial efforton the part of the generator, EPA, and the States, to generate, coordinate,and substantiate the necessary data. Third, a financial ratio would be difficult to enforce. In addition tothe difficulties likely to be encountered using either the cost ratio orthe financial ratio, such as verifying treatment cost data and generatordiligence in pursuing treatment options, use of the financial ratio hasthe added difficulty of verifying the financial data submitted by the generator.Finally, given the other considerations to be used in evaluating whethertreatment is practical in addition to the cost ratio, the Agency believesthe cost ratio is the more efficient method to evaluate practical treatment,in terms of time and resources. As illustrated in the example above, thecost ratio is not suited for every situation, and the Agency strongly emphasizesthat the cost ratio is not to be the sole consideration in evaluating whethera particular treatment is ``practical''. The Agency realizes that not all generators of ``soft hammer'' wastes havethe sophistication in waste management to know the relative costs of treatment,shipping and disposal for their wastes. However, the Agency believes theadditional information needed to demonstrate the availability of practicaltreatment can be easily ascertained. Also, once the generator has investigatedavailable technologies, EPA does not believe that waste management conditions(i.e., the appropriate technologies which are practical and available)initially certified to will change so drastically during the ``soft hammer''period that a complete reevaluation of ``practical'' treatments will berequired. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Certification Requirements </ITAG>The Agency received many comments regarding the demonstration and certificationrequired under andSection; 268.8 to properly dispose of ``soft hammer'' wastesin a landfill or surface impoundment unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of RCRA section 3004(o). EPA is finalizing the certificationrequirements essentially as proposed in the April 8 proposal, with somechanges made in view of the Agency's final interpretation of the terms``treatment'', ``facility'', and ``practical''. a. <T3>Certification for Treated ``Soft Hammer'' Wastes.</T3> Many commentersstated that residuals from treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes should notrequire certification or subsequent management in MTR units. The Agency,however, disagrees with the commenters' reading of the statute and is todaypromulgating the proposed approach. As discussed in the April 8 proposal(53 FR 11767), the Agency believes the intent of Congress is to requirecertifications and management in MTR units for residuals from treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes. The Agency has not set treatment standards forthese wastes, and EPA does not believe that Congress intended for treated``soft hammer'' wastes (especially where such treatment may be consideredminimal relative to BDAT-type treatment) to be shielded from the requirementsof 3004(g)(6) and treated the same as wastes meeting the stringent requirementsfor treatment under RCRA section 3004(m). It should also be noted thatCongress equated treatment residuals and the underlying waste in section3004(m)(2), so that prohibitions applicable to the waste being treatedapply to the treatment residuals as well (unless, of course, the residualssatisfy the applicable treatment standard_not the case for ``soft hammer''wastes). Therefore, the requirements of andSection; 268.8 also apply to treatmentresidues of ``soft hammer'' wastes. (As discussed more fully below, however,EPA does believe it appropriate to reprioritize the schedule for prohibitingcertain wastewater residues from treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes. Tothis extent, EPA has, it believes, accommodated some of the principle concernsraised by commenters.) Commenters raised one further issue concerning the relationship of the``soft hammer'' provision's applicability to treatment residues, plus therestrictions on placing ``soft hammer'' wastes only in impoundments andlandfills that meet minimum technology requirements. A number of companiesuse BDAT-type treatment to treat ``soft hammer'' wastes, and then furthertreat the resulting treatment residues in impoundments that do not satisfyminimum technology requirements. For example, a number of companies incinerateoff-specification commercial chemical products which are in the first thirdof the schedule of listed wastes but for which EPA did not propose treatmentstandards, and generate scrubber water which is further polished in biologicaltreatment ponds. Such ponds meet the requirements of section 3005(j)(3)and so need not be retrofitted as of November 8, 1988 but for the receiptof the scrubber water from treating a ``soft hammer'' waste. This result is not in keeping with the fundamental policy of the land disposalrestrictions statutory provisions: effective pretreatment of wastes followedby unprohibited disposal of the treatment residues. In addition, the thrustof the ``soft hammer'' provision itself is to make disposal of untreatedwastes for which there is no treatment standard more difficult, but notnecessarily to impose the same difficulties on residues from BDAT typetreatment of those wastes. Accordingly, EPA has decided to modify its proposal so that residues fromsubstantial treatment of certain ``soft hammer'' wastes may be furthertreated in land disposal units that do not meet minimum technology requirements.EPA is accomplishing this by amending the schedule of prohibited wastesto indicate that wastewater (i.e., less than 1% total organic carbon (TOC)and less than 1% total suspended solids (TSS)) residues from the treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes by the following list of technologies, are tobe included in the third third of scheduled wastes for which EPA is todevelop treatment standards. The wastewater residues from treatment affectedby this action are limited to those wastewater (less than 1% TOC and lessthan 1% TSS) residuals resulting from the well-designed and well operatedtreatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes by: metals recovery, metals precipitation,cyanide destruction, carbon adsorption, chemical oxidation, steam stripping,biodegradation, and incineration or other direct thermal destruction. Thereis strong policy justification for taking this step: persons who are substantiallytreating their wastes to levels that may satisfy ultimate treatment standardsare not precluded from further treatment of these wastes in polishing oradvanced biological treatment (i.e., sections 3005 (j)(3) and (j)(13) units)that are substantially protective of human health and the environment (althoughnot equivalent to minimum technology impoundments from the standpoint ofpreventing migration from the unit). Furthermore, EPA does not believethat these types of treatment residuals are the types of highly contaminatedwastes deserving of prioritization in the first third of the schedule (seeRCRA section 3004(g)(2)). EPA also has decided to amend the schedule so that leachate and contaminatedground water that are derived from disposal of a ``soft hammer'' waste,or that contain ``soft hammer'' wastes, are also in the third third ofthe schedule (and thus would not be considered to be prohibited wastesuntil May, 1990 or until EPA establishes treatment standards, whicheveris sooner). As discussed in section III.A.4., EPA generally believes thatcontaminated leachate and ground water (which is basically ground waterwith the leachate in it) can be treated to meet the treatment standardfor the waste from which they are derived or that they contain. Notwithstandingthis, however, if there is no treatment standard for the leachate or contaminatedground water to meet, EPA does not believe it fair to impose the ``softhammer'' standards on these wastes. These wastes may be highly dilutedso that treatment in section 3005 (j)(3) and (j)(13) impoundments may beappropriate. Thus, for reasons of fairness and appropriateness, EPA hasdecided to amend the schedule in section 268.12 to include leachate andcontaminated ground water that are either derived from or that contain``soft hammer'' wastes.The following examples illustrate application of the regulations: 1. Generator A incinerates waste U119, a First Third waste for which EPAhas not established a treatment standard. Scrubber water from the incineratoris piped to an aggressive biological treatment impoundment which has asection 3005(j)(3) retrofit waiver which does not satisfy the equivalencystandard in section 3004(o)(2). The scrubber water from incinerating this ``soft hammer'' waste is nota prohibited waste because it is in the third third of scheduled wastes.Consequently, placement in the surface impoundment does not violate theland disposal prohibitions. 2. Generator B treats a ``soft hammer'' waste in a wastewater treatmentsystem which consists of chemical precipitation, biological treatment (allconducted in tanks), and polishing in an impoundment which has obtaineda section (j)(3) waiver but cannot demonstrate section 3004(o)(2) equivalence.The wastewater residue is not prohibited for the same reason as in example1. 3. Generator C generates a leachate which is derived from disposal of certain``soft hammer'' wastes and certain First Third wastes for which EPA hasestablished treatment standards. The leachate is piped to an impoundmentwhich has obtained a section 3005(j)(13) variance but has not satisfiedsection 3004(o)(2) equivalence. The leachate could not be placed in the impoundment unless it meets thetreatment standards for the listed wastes from which it is derived (orthe most stringent standard in the event of overlapping treatment standardsfor the same constituent). However, if the leachate is treated to meettreatment standards before placement in the impoundment, then the placementis legal because the treated leachate would no longer be prohibited (sinceit would then derive from disposal of ``soft hammer'' wastes_a Third Thirdwaste_and would meet all applicable treatment standards for the prohibitedwastes from which it is derived). 4. Generator D generates a ``soft hammer'' wastewater which is pumped directlyinto an on-site impoundment prior to discharge under an NPDES permit. Theimpoundment is subject to a retrofit waiver under section 3005(j)(13),but cannot demonstrate section 3004(o)(2) equivalence. The ``soft hammer'' wastewater is prohibited from land disposal in the(j)(13) impoundment. In this example, there has been no treatment, andthus this wastewater is not a wastewater residue from treatment. Therefore,this wastewater is subject to the prohibitions in andSection; 268.33(f) andprecluded from disposal in a non-MTR impoundment. Three final notes on this matter. EPA is reprioritizing only these selectedwastewaters, rather than solids destined for landfill disposal, for a numberof reasons. First, wastewaters can be treated further in surface impoundmentsbut not in landfills. Thus, wastewaters could be treated further in non-minimumtechnology units; solids could not be. EPA thus does not wish to foreclosethe possibility of further treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastewater residuals,leachate and contaminated ground water. There is no corresponding opportunityfor treatment for solid residues. Second, most landfill units do meet theminimum technology standards at this time_and virtually all commerciallandfill units receiving hazardous wastes do. Thus, the likelihood of residuesfrom substantial treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes going to non-minimumtechnology landfills is not great. In confirmation, EPA made inquiriesand was not informed of any actual instances of such residues from treatmentof ``soft hammer'' wastes going to non-minimum technology landfill units.Accordingly, EPA is only reprioritizing the schedule for the wastewatersdiscussed above. Third, this action does not affect the regulatory statusof spent solvents, dioxins, or California list wastes contained in wastewaterresidues from treatment, leachate, or contaminated ground water. Thesewastes are not subject to the schedule pursuant to RCRA section 3004(g).Finally, EPA is amending the schedule of prohibited wastes without noticeand comment. EPA believes that the schedule is absolutely committed toits discretion, given that the schedule is not subject to judicial review(see RCRA section 3004(g)(3)). The schedule also arguably constitutes arule of Agency procedure. In either case, opportunity for prior commentis not required when EPA promulgates or amends the schedule. b. <T3>Certification by Owners or Operators as Well as Generators. </T3>Commentsreceived from many owners or operators of treatment and disposal facilitiesexpressed strong opposition to EPA's proposed approach to expand the statutorycertification requirement applicable to generators to include certificationby owners or operators. Given the Agency's interpretation of ``practical'', EPA agrees with thecommenters. The statute requires the<T3> generator</T3> to make the determination whether alternative treatmentis practically available. It is doubtful whether the owner or operatoris able to determine whether a technology is ``practical'' for a generator.Also, because the Agency is requiring the generator to use the<T3> best</T3> practically available treatment (i.e., the treatment whichyields the greatest environmental benefit), the generator must make thedemonstration, whether treatment is practical1y available or not. Therefore,only the generator is required (and allowed) to make the demonstrationand certification pertaining to the practical availability of treatmentfor his waste. However, the owner or operator<T3> must</T3> certify that the generator's waste has been properly treatedby the technology determined by the generator to be the best practicallyavailable treatment. This is consistent with the existing certificationrequirements under andSection; 268.7(b) and will allow the Agency to trackthe waste from cradle-to-grave. EPA emphasizes that it is not requiring an owner or operator to demonstratethat his treatment is the best practical treatment available. Rather, thegenerator must make this demonstration. However, the owner or operator<T3> must</T3> certify that he has properly treated the waste prior todisposal. c. <T3>Certification. </T3>Having somewhat better defined the terms ``treatment''and ``practical'', EPA is promulgating a less ambiguous approach to the``soft hammer'' than was proposed. However, the basic approach is essentiallythe same. Prior to disposal in a landfill or surface impoundment unit meeting theminimum technological requirements of 3004(o), a generator must demonstratehis good faith effort to treat his waste by the best practically availabletreatment technology(ies). The generator must determine which treatmenttechnologies are practical and available, and choose the best treatment.(Where no treatment is practical or available, the generator may so demonstrateand certify.) To make this demonstration, the generator must provide alist of facilities and facility officials contacted, complete with addresses,telephone numbers and contact dates. The generator must document or otherwiseexplain his determination that the treatments are not practically available,or where treatments are available, must justify that he has chosen thebest treatment that is practically available. This demonstration and certification must be submitted to the RegionalAdministrator. The generator must also send the demonstration and certification(and notification) to the receiving facility with the initial waste shipment.Provided that the conditions affecting the certification do not change(i.e., the same demonstration remains applicable), only the certificationand notification need be sent with each subsequent waste shipment. (Copiesof the certifications and demonstrations for each subsequent waste shipmentneed not be sent to the Regional Administrator, provided the conditionsof the original certification do not change.) The notification, demonstrationand certification must also be kept on-site in the generator's records.Also, should the Regional Administrator invalidate his certification, thegenerator must immediately notify all facilities that have received hiswaste that the certification (and demonstration) is no longer valid, andmust keep records of this communication. In general, one treatment process will satisfy the requirement with theexceptions of typically-used treatment trains or a combination of technologies,each of which deals with an organic and inorganic component of the waste.The Agency again notes that it generally believes that liquid injectionincineration (including burning in industrial furnaces) is available fororganic constituents and stabilization technologies are available for inorganicconstituents.Where treatment is available, the generator must send the notification,demonstration and certification to the treatment facility. After propertreatment, the owner or operator must then certify that the waste has beentreated by the best practically available treatment (as documented in thegenerator's demonstration) and send this certification (and notification)and the generator's demonstration with the initial waste shipment to thedisposal facility (a demonstration is not required for subsequent shipmentsunless conditions change). The treatment facility must keep records ofdemonstrations and certifications (and notifications) received and forwardedto disposal (or other receiving) facilities. The owner or operator of atreatment facility is responsible for treating the waste as the generatorindicates in the certification (or demonstration) sent for that particularwaste shipment, and for recordkeeping. The disposal facility may dispose of ``soft hammer'' wastes (whether treatedor not) only in MTR units (including those, like most section 3005 (j)(2)and (j)(4) impoundments, which satisfy the section 3004(o)(2) equivalencystandard) (assuming disposal is in a landfill or surface impoundment).The owner or operator of a disposal facility is responsible for ensuringthat only ``soft hammer'' wastes (or residuals) subject to a certificationpursuant to andSection; 268.8 (and demonstration, for the initial waste shipment)are disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment unit, and that such unitmeets the minimum technological requirements. An owner or operator of a storage facility must keep copies of notifications,demonstrations and certifications of ``soft hammer'' wastes received andforwarded. To implement this approach, the Agency is departing somewhat from the proposedandSection; 268.8. Specifically, EPA is promulgating an additional certificationfor the generator for cases where practical treatment <T3>is </T3>available. This certification requires the generator to certifythat, as indicated in his demonstration, he is sending his waste to betreated by the best practically available treatment for his waste. Also,EPA is adding a certification (similar to the 268.7(b) certification) forthe owner or operator to certify that he has properly treated the generator'swaste, as indicated in the demonstration. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Treatment of ``Soft Hammer'' Wastes in Surface Impoundments </ITAG>As discussed in the April 8 proposal (53 FR 11768), ``soft hammer'' wastestreated in a surface impoundment subject to the exemption for treatmentin andSection; 268.4 would be required to be removed at least annually. TheAgency proposed to allow that certification for disposal may be made withoutremoval of the residuals provided that no further treatment is practicallyavailable. The demonstration and certification may be made at the timeof placement in the impoundment for treatment. Commenters generally supported this approach, citing the identical minimumtechnological requirements for units which can treat restricted wastesand units which can dispose of ``soft hammer'' wastes (and residuals) andthe potential risk of damaging the impoundment liners during removal. Therefore,EPA is promulgating its proposed approach. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Retrofitting Variances </ITAG>As proposed, today's final rule interprets the variance provisions of 3005(j)(11)to allow ``soft hammer'' wastes to be treated in surface impoundments thatmeet the minimum technological requirements of 3004(o) or have receivedvariances under either 3005(j)(2) (one quarter mile from an undergroundsource of drinking water and compliance with applicable ground water monitoringrequirements) or (j)(4) (located and designed to prevent migration of hazardousconstituents to ground water or surface water). This result is logicalsince wastes not meeting treatment standards can also be treated in suchimpoundments (see section 3005(j)(11)). If there is no further treatmentpractically available, the residuals would not have to be removed annually,again paralleling the requirements for wastes for which treatment standardshave been set and which are being treated in surface impoundments. Although many commenters stated that the retrofit waivers granted under3005 (j)(3) or (j)(13) should also be automatically recognized under theland disposal restrictions, the Agency disagrees. EPA believes that Congresswould have included these waivers had it intended to do so. Such waiverssimply do not automatically satisfy the equivalency standard in section3004(o)(2), although they may on a unit-specific basis. Moreover, the absenceof such exemptions in section 3005(j)(11) is highly suggestive. Even ifEPA somehow construed the ``soft hammer'' provision to allow placementin non-equivalent section (j)(3) and (j)(13) impoundments, placement wouldstill be prohibited under section 3005(j)(11). Therefore, ``soft hammer''wastes cannot be treated in surface impoundments operating under retrofitwaivers granted under the authority of 3005(j) (3) or (13), unless an equivalencedemonstration has been made under 3004(o)(2). If this demonstration hasbeen made, the surface impoundment has satisfied the requirements thatwould be applicable to new impoundments, and is not prohibited from receiving``soft hammer'' wastes. (For a further discussion of these issues, seethe April 8 proposal at 53 FR 11768.) <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Storage Prohibition </ITAG>As discussed in the April 8 proposal (53 FR 11770-11771), the Agency believesthe storage prohibition in andSection; 268.50 is applicable to all FirstThird wastes, including ``soft hammer'' wastes. The storage prohibitionin RCRA section 3004(j) applies to wastes which are prohibited from ``oneor more methods of land disposal'', and in RCRA section 3004(g)(6), ``softhammer'' wastes are prohibited from disposal in a landfill or surface impoundmentunit (unless subject to a valid certification). EPA's proposed approach was that the storage prohibition would no longerapply to ``soft hammer'' wastes which are subject to a valid certificationunder andSection; 268.8. No comments strongly opposing this approach werereceived, and therefore, the Agency is promulgating the approach as proposed.``Soft hammer'' wastes thus are prohibited from storage under andSection;268.50, unless such wastes are subject to a valid certification under andSection;268.8 (see section III.C.3. for the significance of <T3>valid </T3>certification).D. Disposal of Restricted Wastes Subject to an Extension of the EffectiveDate In the April 8, 1988 proposal, EPA solicited comment on its intent to changethe interpretation of RCRA section 3004(h)(4) that was originally promulgatedin the November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572). The Agency's originalinterpretation provided that restricted wastes subject to an extensionof the effective date which are disposed in a landfill or surface impoundmentmust be disposed in a ``facility'' in compliance with the minimum technologicalrequirements of section 3004(o). EPA originally interpreted ``facility''to refer to the area within the property boundary, encompassing all wastemanagement units (both new and existing). Because the minimum technologicalrequirements of section 3004(o) (double liner, leachate collection system,and groundwater monitoring) only apply to new, replacement, or lateralexpansion landfill or surface impoundment units (and not to existing units),a waste subject to an extension of the effective date could be disposedat a ``facility'' provided all new, replacement, and lateral expansionlandfill and surface impoundment units met the 3004(o) requirements. However,this interpretation had little actual impact on whether the restrictedwaste would be disposed in an individual ``unit'' that satisfied the 3004(o)requirements. EPA has reevaluated its original interpretation and now believes that Congressintended the term ``facility'' to refer to ``unit'', which is consistentwith the Agency's current interpretation of the term ``facility'' in RCRAsection 3004(g)(6), referring to the disposal of First Third wastes forwhich no treatment standards have been established. Legislative historyto section 3004(h)(4), in fact, states that Congress meant to prohibitdisposal of restricted wastes subject to a capacity variance in all surfaceimpoundments or landfills except those meeting minimum technological requirementsapplicable to new facilities. (See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1133, 98th Cong.,2d. Sess., 87). (This passage in the Conference Report actually refersto disposal of wastes subject to a case-by-case capacity variance undersection 3004(h)(3), but EPA sees no basis for not applying it to section3004(h)(4) as well.) Although many commenters opposed this reinterpretation, the Agency believesthe intent of Congress is clear. These commenters argued that the languageof (h)(4) unambiguously applies to entire facilities and therefore thatthe Agency's existing interpretation is compelled. EPA disagrees. If anything,the literal language of the provisions compells the Agency's amended interpretation,because (h)(4) refers to ``such facility'', referring back to landfillsand surface impoundments. Moreover, the reading the commenters urge makesthe entire section (h)(4) into surplusage. Facilities must already be incompliance with the requirements of section 3004(o) by virtue of section3004(o) itself. Thus, a waste subject to a capacity variance can only goto an entire facility that is complying with section 3004(o), and a commandto do so (which is how the commenters would read (h)(4)) adds nothing tothe law which is not already there. Congress clearly had something elsein mind in promulgating section 3004(h)(4). The ``soft hammer'' provisionof 3004(g)(6) throws light on congressional intent. This provision, asdiscussed previously, definitely requires ``soft hammer'' wastes to bedisposed in minimum technology impoundments and landfills. EPA believesthat Congress intended the same result for the other type of waste forwhich a prohibition effective date has passed but is being disposed withoutcomplying with treatment standards, namely wastes subject to a capacityvariance. Finally, when one reads the unequivocal legislative history statingthat wastes subject to a variance should only be disposed in minimum technologylandfills and surface impoundments, it is clear to the Agency that notonly is it the better reading of (h)(4) to apply to landfill and impoundmentunits, but that this reading probably is compelled. However, the Agency does agree with commenters who asserted that EPA hassome flexibility in setting the effective date of this new interpretation.Many commenters claimed that an August 8, 1988 effective date of the reinterpretationwould disrupt their surface impoundment operations, which have been scheduledto comply with the November 8, 1988 deadline (in section 3005(j)(1)) forretrofitting surface impoundments (i.e., the date on which surface impoundmentsmust cease to receive, store, or treat hazardous wastes unless the unitis in compliance with the minimum technological requirements of section3004(o), or has received a waiver from these requirements under RCRA section3005(j) (2), (3), (4), or (13)). While the 3-month period involved is relativelyshort, the Agency does agree that this reinterpretation could disrupt surfaceimpoundment operations by, in effect, moving the retrofitting deadlineahead without ample notice. Because it is not EPA's intent to unduly disruptbusiness operations where flexibility exists to do otherwise, the Agencyhas decided to make the new interpretation of RCRA section 3004(h)(4) effectiveon November 8, 1988. Since the interpretation of 3004(h)(4) is not a regulationestablishing a prohibition from land disposal, it need not become effectiveimmediately (see RCRA section 3004(h)(1)). However, given that the Agencybelieves its earlier interpretation to be wrong, that Congress intendedthat wastes subject to capacity variances to go to minimum technology landfillsand impoundments, and that the period of business disruption for impoundmentsceases on November 8, EPA believes that good cause exists to make thisinterpretation effective in three months rather than six (see RCRA section3010(b)(3)). E. Relationship to California List Prohibitions As discussed in the July 8, 1987 California list final rule preamble (52FR 25773), and as reflected in andSection; 268.32(h) (i.e., the overlap ofHOCs and other prohibited wastes), where the Agency makes a waste specificdetermination involving a California list waste, such determinations willsupersede the California list treatment standards and effective dates.This principle also applies to the restrictions on the land disposal ofFirst Third wastes. While it is clear that Agency-established treatmentstandards or effective dates for First Third wastes are more waste-specificthan California list determinations, the applicability of the Californialist restrictions to ``soft hammer'' wastes and wastes granted a nationalcapacity variance requires clarification. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. ``Soft Hammer'' Wastes </ITAG>As stated in the April 8 proposal, many of the First Third wastes are alsosubject to the California list prohibitions. Once treatment standards becomeeffective for such First Third wastes, the California list prohibitionsare superseded. However, since no treatment standards will have been promulgatedfor ``soft hammer'' wastes (i.e., no waste-specific determinations willhave been made for these wastes), such wastes will remain subject to theCalifornia list prohibitions and treatment standards. Because EPA does not believe that Congress intended for the statutory Californialist prohibitions to act as a shield from requirements promulgated underRCRA section 3004(g)(6), the ``soft hammer'' requirements will also apply.This includes the requirement that when such wastes (or treatment residues)are disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only those landfill andsurface impoundment units that comply with the minimum technological requirementsof 3004(o) may be used. In other words, treatment to comply with the Californialist prohibitions does not necessarily satisfy the ``soft hammer'' requirementsof 40 CFR 268.8 and, in fact, the California list prohibitions representthe minimum treatment required for such ``soft hammer'' wastes prior toland disposal_since such wastes are prohibited from land disposal at thestatutory levels. The Agency does, however, make a distinction between wastes which are subjectto the statutory prohibitions of RCRA section 3004(d) (e.g., the metalsand free cyanides) and wastes which are prohibited under 40 CFR 268.32and for which EPA has promulgated treatment standards under Part 268 SubpartD (e.g., the liquid hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds(HOCs) in concentrations greater than or equal to 1000 mg/l). For wasteswhich are subject to treatment standards (rather than the statutory prohibitionsof 3004(d), or the codification of the statutory levels, such as diluteHOC wastewaters), EPA has made a determination regarding the best treatmentfor such wastes. The Agency believes that this determination (and subsequenttreatment standard), even though it is not necessarily a waste specificdetermination, is more protective than the treatment requirement underthe ``soft hammer'' provision of andSection; 268.8. Conversely, for wasteswhich are subject to the statutory prohibitions of 3004(d), or which aresubject to the statutory levels codified in 40 CFR 268.32, EPA has notmade a determination regarding the best treatment for such wastes, andtherefore, the waste management requirements under the ``soft hammer''provision of andSection; 268.8 may be more protective. Therefore, where ``soft hammer'' wastes are subject to an applicable Californialist treatment standard under Part 268 Subpart D (i.e., the treatment standardis currently in effect), the ``soft hammer'' provisions of andSection; 268.8do not apply. Likewise, where ``soft hammer'' wastes are<T3> not</T3> subject to an Agency-established California list treatmentstandard under Subpart D (or the treatment standard is not yet effective)the ``soft hammer'' provisions of andSection; 268.8 are applicable, withthe minimum acceptable treatment for such wastes being treatment to complywith the statutory prohibitions under RCRA section 3004(d), or the codifiedstatutory levels under andSection; 268.32. Because the ``soft hammer'' provisionsare only applicable to wastes that are disposed in landfills or surfaceimpoundments, ``soft hammer'' wastes disposed by other methods clearlymust comply with the California list prohibitions (which apply to all formsof disposal). This approach is consistent with the Agency's intent thatwhere more than one regulatory requirement applies, the more stringentrequirement governs.EPA is providing the following list of P- and U-list ``soft hammer'' wasteswhich are potentially subject to the California list HOC treatment standardon November 8, 1988 (see section III.H. of this preamble for a discussionof the rescission of the previously granted national variance for HOCs)for the benefit of the regulated community. EPA notes that such wasteshave the <T3>potential </T3>to be subject to the California list HOC treatment standards,depending upon the concentration levels of Part 268 Appendix III halogenatedorganics (52 FR 25791). After November 8, 1988, such wastes will not beconsidered ``soft hammer'' wastes (because they will have an applicabletreatment standard) and will not be subject to the prohibitions in andSection;268.33(f) or the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8. The wastesmust be treated in accordance with andSection; 268.32 until EPA promulgatesmore waste-specific treatment standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">``Soft Hammer'' Wastes Potentially Subject to the California ListHOC Treatment Standard </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K017_Heavy ends (still bottoms) from the purification column in theproduction of epichlorohydrin </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K021_Aqueous spent antimony catalyst waste from fluoromethanes production</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K073_Chlorinated hydrocarbon waste from the purification step of thediaphragm cell process using graphite anodes in chlorine production </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K085_Distillation of fractionation column bottoms from the productionof chlorobenzenes </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P004_Aldrin </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P016_Bis-(chloromethyl) ether </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P036_Dichlorophenylarsine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P037_Dieldrin </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P050_Endosulfan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P058_Fluoracetic acid, sodium salt </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P059_Heptachlor </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P123_Toxaphene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U029_Methyl bromide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U036_Chlordane, technical </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U037_Chlorobenzene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U041_n-Chloro-2,3-epoxypropane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U043_Vinyl chloride </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U044_Chloroform </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U046_Chloromethyl methyl ether </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U061_DDT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U066_1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U067_Ethylene dibromide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U074_1,4-Dichloro-2-butene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U077_Ethane, 1,2-dichloro- </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U078_1,1-Dichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U129_Lindane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U130_Hexachlorocyclopentadiene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U158_4,4-Methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U185_Pentachloronitrobenzene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U192_Pronamide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U209_1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U210_Tetrachloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U211_Carbon tetrachloride </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U226_Methylchloroform </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U227_1,1,2-Trichloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U228_Trichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U237_Uracil mustard</ITAG>The following examples illustrate the principles discussed above regardingoverlap of California list and ``soft hammer'' wastes: 1. Generator A generates a corrosive waste which is also a commercial chemicalproduct listed in andSection; 268.10 (i.e., a First Third waste). EPA hasnot promulgated a treatment standard for this waste. Generator A cannot dispose of the waste until it is treated so that itis no longer corrosive (or liquid) (see 40 CFR 268.32(a)(1), codifyingthe statutory prohibition level). The waste also is subject to the ``softhammer'' provisions, so that further treatment may be required if the wasteis destined for land disposal in an impoundment or landfill, and such unitsmust comply with the minimum technological requirements of 3004(o). 2. Generator B generates a First Third waste for which no treatment standardhas been promulgated that also contains greater than 1000 ppm HOCs, andthat is not a wastewater. In this case, the waste must be treated by the method specified for HOCsin andSection; 268.42. Residues from such treatment would not be subjectto the ``soft hammer'' provisions. 3. Generator C generates a First Third waste for which there is no treatmentstandard. He mixes this waste with a California list HOC waste that issubject to the treatment method specified in andSection; 268.42. The mixed waste must be treated by the method specified in andSection; 268.42.Residues from such treatment remain subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions(since one cannot automatically render the ``soft hammer'' provisions inapplicableby mixing a ``soft hammer'' waste with a waste for which a treatment standardis applicable; to allow this would create a counterproductive incentive.Moreover, the ``soft hammer'' portion of the mixture still has not metan applicable treatment standard.) However, if the ``soft hammer'' wastecontains organic toxicants, the HOC treatment method undoubtedly constitutes``treatment'' for the purposes of the ``soft hammer'' waste (although furthertreatment of ash for inorganic constituents may be needed, if practicallyavailable). EPA is aware that the interpretive reading provided in this example meansthat all residues from treating mixtures of wastes subject to treatmentstandards and ``soft hammer'' wastes would have to be disposed in surfaceimpoundments and landfills satisfying minimum technology requirements.There could be cases where it is technically desirable to commingle ``softhammer'' wastes with prohibited wastes subject to a treatment standard.If a person desired to dispose of the residues in a non-minimum technologyunit, however, he could only do so by segregating the ``soft hammer'' wastesfor separate treatment. The Agency is not certain how often this situationmight arise. Should it turn out to pose significant practical problems,EPA would consider redesignating such treatment residues as Third wastesprovided all applicable treatment standards are satisfied and providedthat the mode of treatment also is appropriate for the ``soft hammer''waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Wastes Granted a National Variance </ITAG>In the April 8 proposal, EPA solicited comment on its approach to the applicabilityof the California list prohibitions to First Third wastes for which treatmentstandards are promulgated, but which also receive a national variance dueto insufficient treatment capacity. In setting the treatment standard,the Agency is making a more waste-specific determination (than the Californialist prohibitions); however, this determination is not effective untilthe variance ends. EPA proposed an approach where such First Third wasteswould remain subject to the California list prohibitions during the periodof the national variance. For example, assume that a liquid metal-containing First Third waste hasbeen granted a national variance because of inadequate capacity to treatthe waste to the treatment standard, yet was not granted a variance underthe less stringent (in terms of concentration levels of the metal) Californialist prohibitions that would otherwise be applicable. The Agency's proposedapproach would require that, because capacity exists to treat the ``Californialist'' waste to allow for land disposal, the California list prohibitionsstill apply and the ``First Third'' waste would be required to comply withthe California list prohibitions. The First Third treatment standard wouldthen become applicable when the national variance expires. EPA received no comments presenting a valid argument for not promulgatingthis approach, and thus, the Agency is finalizing the proposed approach.This approach is also consistent with the Agency's intent that where morethan one regulatory requirement applies, the more stringent requirementgoverns. F. Petitions To Allow Land Disposal of Prohibited Wastes Under section 3004 (d), (e), and (f) of RCRA, owners and operators of landdisposal units and deep injection wells may petition the Administratorfor a variance from the prohibition on land disposal of untreated hazardouswaste. To be considered for such a variance, the petitioner must demonstrate``to a reasonable degree of certainty that there will be no migration ofhazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injection zone for aslong as the wastes remain hazardous.'' On November 7, 1986 EPA promulgated regulations (51 FR 40572) that provideprocedures for submittal of petitions to allow land disposal of waste prohibitedunder Subpart C of Part 268. The regulation (40 CFR 268.6) includes informationthat must be provided in a ``no migration'' demonstration, the criteriathe demonstration must meet, and the Agency's review and approval procedures.Today's final rule creates additional requirements at 40 CFR 268.6 forpetitioners seeking to demonstrate ``no migration'' for land disposal unitsby adding new procedural and informational requirements, effective on thedate of promulgation, to those already codified at 40 CFR 268.6. (Note:The Agency also has proposed substantive rules to implement the land disposalrestrictions for waste disposed in deep injection wells (52 FR 32446, August27, 1987). The reader should refer to this for a complete discussion ofhow the Agency intends to apply the ``no migration'' standards to deepinjection wells.) The additional requirements for land disposal units thatEPA proposed (53 FR 11771) involve the following factors: 1. Compliance with other applicable laws; 2. Monitoring plans for land disposal units; 3. Changes in operating conditions from the ones described in the varianceapplication; and 4. Detection of migration of hazardous constituents. For today's final rule, these requirements remain largely unchanged fromthe proposal. The Agency received a number of comments regarding the additionalrequirements for ``no migration'' demonstrations promulgated in today'srule, as discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Other Applicable Federal, State, and Local Laws </ITAG>Commenters both supported and opposed a provision that would require petitionersto include information demonstrating that units for which they seek a ``nomigration'' variance comply with other applicable Federal, State, and locallaws. Those objecting to this provision did so implicitly, by opposingany additional burdens or requirements on petitioners desiring to demonstrate``no migration'' and receive a variance. As EPA stated at proposal, this requirement is needed to reveal environmentallysensitive areas and endangered species which must be protected. Since allsubtitle C facilities obviously must comply with all applicable laws, theAgency is not imposing any substantive burden, and indicating which otherlaws apply in the ``no migration'' petition serves the useful functionindicated above and so justifies any incremental administrative burden.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Monitoring Plans </ITAG>a. <T3>Requirement for monitoring media of concern to verify compliance with``no migration'' demonstration. </T3>EPA proposed that petitioners monitortheir units (unless monitoring is technically impractical or infeasible)to determine if the ``no migration'' standard has been satisfied. Commentersboth supported and opposed different aspects of this provision. The Agencycontinues to believe its proposal to be simple common sense. Without continuedmonitoring of a unit to verify the demonstration that there will be nomigration for as long as the waste remains hazardous, there is no way toconfirm that the ``no migration'' standard is being met. Thus, EPA is requiringmonitoring of the appropriate media at the unit boundary. Since a ``nomigration'' unit is to prevent migration for as long as the waste remainshazardous, monitoring in theory could last in perpetuity. EPA believesas a practical matter that monitoring until the end of the post-closurecare period in 40 CFR 264.117(a)(2) (i) and (ii) (or until the wastes areremoved from the unit) should suffice. To preserve flexibility, however,the Administrator may specify an alternate monitoring period on a sitespecific basis. Other commenters emphasized that monitoring should not be required in ageneric fashion that would cause unnecessary monitoring at some units,with no site-specific flexibility. The Agency agrees. Petitioners shouldinclude information that clearly demonstrates why monitoring of any mediumwould be unnecessary. Commenters also suggested that where Subpart F ground water monitoringalready exists, additional ground water monitoring should not be necessary.EPA disagrees. Subpart F ground water monitoring is not measured at (oras near as possible to) the unit boundary, and so will not detect migrationat the earliest practicable time, and therefore will not be sufficientfor the purposes of ``no migration'' verification. The Agency believesthat monitoring immediately at, or as near as possible to, the unit boundarymust be performed to assure that there ``will be no migration from thedisposal unit.'' b. <T3>Exclusion from ``no migration'' where monitoring is ``technically infeasibleor impractical''. </T3>EPA proposed that monitoring would not be requiredfor one or more media where owners or operators demonstrate that monitoringis technically infeasible or impracticable. Most comments received opposedthis provision. Commenters believed that monitoring should be mandatory,and that no infeasibility exclusion exists under Part 264 monitoring requirements.Some commenters argued that if monitoring cannot be performed to verify``no migration'', a variance should not be granted, because a demonstrationcannot be made with a ``reasonable degree of certainty'' if monitoringis infeasible. Some commenters felt that predicting ``no migration'' basedon modeling cannot replace the use of monitoring data to verify that migrationis not occurring. The Agency agrees in principle that, in most cases, monitoring of surfacedisposal units is required to verify a ``no migration'' demonstration andthat modeling alone will not be sufficient for such units. The Agency recognizes,however, that monitoring immediately at the unit boundary sometimes willbe difficult in certain locations or under unusual physical conditionsat a site. In these cases, EPA would require monitoring (or modified monitoring)to be conducted as near as possible to the unit boundary without compromisingthe integrity of the unit. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Changes From Conditions Described in the Variance Application </ITAG>This provision requires owners or operators to report to the Administratorany changes or planned changes in conditions at the unit and/or the environmentaround the unit that may affect conditions upon which the petition wasapproved. Most comments received concerning this provision supported minimizingreporting requirements for those cases where an owner or operator plansor observes changes to a ``no migration'' unit. Commenters favored immediatereporting only of those changes to the variance that are significant andaffect the potential for migration of hazardous constituents from the unit.EPA agrees that minor and seasonal changes in parameters such as pH, conductivity,salinity, etc. do not warrant a report to the Agency. However, the Agencybelieves that where changes are planned or occur that would significantlydepart from those conditions described in the variance and that would affectpotential migration of hazardous constituents, the owner or operator shouldreport them. In particular, proposed changes in the waste stream received,operating practices, or unit design and construction must be reported.In addition, unusual and significant changes in the environment, such asthe water table or surface water flow, warrant reporting. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Detection of Hazardous Constituent Migration </ITAG>This provision remains essentially unchanged from the proposal. It requiresthat if the owner or operator determines there is migration of hazardousconstituents from the unit, he must immediately suspend receipt of prohibitedwaste and notify EPA within 10 days. The Agency is required to determinethe appropriate action to be taken within 60 days from notification. Certain commenters indicated that to avoid false positives, additionalsampling to verify a release should be allowed before making a determinationthat migration has occurred. The Agency agrees. While some commenters objectedthat action should be taken immediately upon detection of a release, EPAbelieves that verification within the 10-day time period is reasonable.The proposed 10-day notification period should provide ample time for theowner or operator to perform additional sampling to verify that waste constituentmigration from a unit has occurred. Therefore, the Agency has decided toretain a 10-day notification period. Commenters also objected to the proposed 60-day period, in which the Agencydetermines whether the owner or operator of a unit can continue to receiveprohibited wastes and whether the ``no migration'' variance is to be revoked,as being too lengthy. EPA disagrees and believes that the 60-day periodis needed to determine whether the termination of waste acceptance andthe revocation of the ``no migration'' variance is appropriate. Furthermore,the 60-day time period is the maximum time for the Agency to decide; undercircumstances that the Agency determines warrant a faster response, itwill do so. Some commenters also stated that where the release is temporary, or onceit has been corrected, waste acceptance should be resumed. EPA disagrees.We instead concur with comments indicating that once a verified releasehas occurred at levels that would constitute migration, the ``no migration''demonstration will have failed, and the unit will have violated the termsof the ``no migration'' variance. At this point, the ``no migration'' variancewould be revoked for that unit. (Corrective action might also be requiredpursuant to section 3004(u) or 3008(h).)G. Approach to Comparative Risk Assessment <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Use of Risk Analyses </ITAG>Within the regulatory framework for implementing the land disposal restrictions,the Agency has in the past considered certain criteria in the determinationof ``available'' treatment technologies. Among the criteria formerly consideredwas whether application of a treatment technology poses greater risks tohuman health and the environment than those posed by direct land disposalof the waste. See 51 FR 40592-40593 (November 7, 1986). The previous framework for determining Best Demonstrated Available Technologiesemployed a methodology that evaluated the analytical results of the comparativerisk analyses to identify whether a treatment alternative was ``available''to set 3004(m) treatment standards. Because of the strong statutory presumptionagainst land disposal, particularly RCRA sections 1002(b)(7) and 1003(a)(6),the analysis required that a treatment technology must be clearly morerisky than land disposal (beyond the level of uncertainty in the model)before it could be designated as unavailable. Although the Agency conductedcomparative risk assessments in the development of regulations prohibitingland disposal of certain spent solvent and dioxin-containing hazardouswastes (November 7, 1986 final rule) and California list wastes (July 8,1987 final rule), use of the analyses did not affect the determinationas to whether a specific treatment technology was available. In both proposals on First Third wastes (see 53 FR 11774, April 8, 1988and 53 FR 17606, May 17, 1988), it was explained that the Agency had decidednot to utilize the existing comparative risk assessment approach for thisrulemaking and was reconsidering its future application in the determinationof ``available'' treatment technologies. One of the primary concerns addressedin the proposals related to cases where the land disposal practice is foundto be less risky than any of the treatment alternatives. In such a situation,the analysis would result in a determination that no treatment technologiesare ``available'' for the purpose of setting treatment standards. Becauseland disposal is prohibited by the statute in many cases, this determinationwould mean that a generator could not treat and land dispose of such wastes,even though the treatment technologies in question may be in compliancewith other regulatory standards that are deemed protective of human healthand the environment and may provide substantial treatment. In the April 8, 1988 and May 17, 1988 proposals, the Agency solicited commenton a risk analysis approach that would distinguish between the overalldegree of risks posed by alternative treatment technologies. Under thisproposed approach, the net risk posed by alternative practices would beconsidered in the identification of ``best'' treatment technologies. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Agency Response to Comments </ITAG>A number of commenters submitted remarks pertaining to the utilizationof some form of risk analysis process. Several of these commenters specificallyaddressed the proposed approach to comparative risk assessment, while mostof the others made recommendations to EPA on risk comparisons between alternativetreatment technologies. Those who commented on the proposed approach, generally agreed that thecomparative risk assessment should be modified to account for the anomalousresults that could occur using the existing method. One commenter supportedthe Agency's decision in which the risks posed by direct land disposaland alternative treatment technologies would no longer be compared. Thiscommenter asserted that EPA does not have the authority under RCRA to conductsuch a comparison as a basis for establishing BDAT. Other commenters continuedto support an approach that weighs the risks of treatment technologiesagainst the risks of disposal of untreated wastes in the considerationof ``available'' treatments. One commenter argued that the existing comparativerisk approach should be modified rather than discarded because it servesas a valuable tool where land disposal is less risky than some treatmentalternatives but more risky than others. Another commenter stated thatCongress could not have intended the EPA to choose a treatment method thatpresents more risks than land disposal. As indicated in the November 7, 1986 final rule (see 51 FR 40593), EPAinterprets section 3004(m) as directing the establishment of treatmentstandards which minimize the threat to the ``environment'' as applyingto all media (i.e., air, land, and water). Because there is no languageindicating that this term does not include all media, EPA does not believethat the section 3004(m) standard can be read to preclude comparative riskanalyses. However, the development of 3004(m) standards, which substantiallydiminish toxicity or reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents,specifically apply to ``levels or methods of<T3> treatment'',</T3> and are not contingent upon a risk comparison oftreatments to land disposal. Upon further consideration, the Agency believesthat the existing risk analysis approach does not begin with a comparisonof equally viable options since land disposal of untreated wastes is nota viable alternative management practice under RCRA (see also RCRA sections1002(b)(7) and 1003(a)(6)). In view of this point and the concern notedearlier, the Agency has concluded that use of the risk analysis methodpreviously employed provides minimal benefit as a decision tool. Thus,the Agency has chosen not to utilize the existing comparative risk assessmentapproach in developing this final rulemaking. The majority of the commenters who addressed risk assessments urged theAgency to compare risks between alternative treatment technologies. Severalcommenters asserted that the methodology for selecting BDAT should assessthe achievement of alternative treatment technologies in reducing the releaseof hazardous constituents to environmental media. Other commenters urgedthe Agency to complete comparative risk assessments between specific technologiesand the proposed BDAT with respect to only certain hazardous waste codes.The Agency agrees that comparative risk analyses between applicable technologieswould likely provide useful information for identifying BDAT. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Future Use of Comparative Risk Assessment </ITAG>In the proposed rulemakings (53 FR 11774, April 8, 1988; 53 FR 17606, May17, 1988), EPA indicated that risk analyses may be conducted to distinguishbetween the overall degree of risk posed by alternative treatment technologiesand to make determinations concerning the ``best'' technology based onnet risk posed by the alternative practices. In light of the commenters'support, EPA is examining the feasibility of implementing such an approachunder future land disposal restriction determinations. However, as a resultof the time constraints of the statutory schedule, EPA is unable to developand utilize such an approach for the waste codes addressed by today's finalrulemaking. To the extent possible, additional details of an approach forcomparing risks between alternative technologies will be included as partof a proposed rulemaking on land disposal prohibitions for ``Second Third''wastes.H. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for FirstThird Wastes, F001-F005 Spent Solvents, California List Halogenated OrganicCompounds, and Contaminated Soil and Debris As explained in the May 17, 1988 proposed rule, EPA developed a new database for capacity analyses, comprised of information from responses tothe National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal andRecycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey). EPA conducted the TSDR Survey during1987 and early 1988 to obtain comprehensive data on hazardous waste managementcapacity and on volumes of hazardous waste being land disposed. The TSDRSurvey was sent to all RCRA permitted or RCRA interim status facilitiesthat have or plan to have treatment, disposal or recycling capabilities.The TSDR Survey was also sent to a statistical sample of facilities thathave only storage. This new data base is the primary source of data forevaluation of capacity for this rule, with supplemental data used as needed.A complete description of the TSDR Survey data set and other supplementaldata will be found in the <T3>Background Document for First Third Wastes to Support 40 CFR Part 268Land Disposal Restrictions First Third Waste Volume, Characteristics andAvailable Treatment Capacity,</T3> referred to hereafter as the ``CapacityBackground Document''. On November 8, 1988 certain capacity variances promulgated in the Solventsand Dioxins final rule (51 FR 40572) expire and the wastes that had beencovered by the extended effective date will be subject to the land disposalrestrictions treatment standards. Also, as explained in section III. H.4., the Agency is rescinding certain capacity variances promulgated inthe California list final rule (52 FR 25760). Several commenters expressedconcern that the increase in wastes requiring treatment capacity becauseof variance expirations and rescissions were not included in the capacityanalyses for the proposed rule. The commenters argued that the volumesof these wastes reduce the capacity available for treatment of First Thirdwastes. However, the commenters were incorrect in this assertion; the volumesof wastes that were subject to capacity variances that are expiring orare being rescinded were included in the capacity analyses in the May 17proposal. The capacity available for treating First Third wastes presentedin the May 17 proposal, and in today's final rule, reflects only the amountof available capacity remaining after accounting for the treatment of wastesrestricted from land disposal under the Solvents and Dioxins and the Californialist final rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Total Quantity of Land Disposed First Third Wastes </ITAG>The capacity analyses for the First Third wastes for which EPA is promulgatingtreatment standards were performed using the new TSDR Survey data. EPAestimated the total quantities of First Third wastes that are land disposedannually based on the results of the TSDR Survey. The total waste quantitiesand the methods by which the wastes are stored, treated, and disposed arepresented in Table 1 below. One method of land disposal, underground injection,is not included in the analyses. Underground injection has been addressedin separate rulemakings. Other methods of land disposal that are affectedby today's rule, such as utilization of salt dome and salt bed formationsand underground mines and caves, are not addressed in the capacity analysesbecause of insufficient data. About 71 million gallons of First Third wastes are disposed of in surfaceimpoundments annually. Ultimately, all of this waste will require alternativetreatment capacity. Approximately 6 million gallons of First Third wastesare stored in surface impoundments annually. Stored wastes are eventuallytreated, recycled, or permanently disposed in other units. To avoid doublecounting, the volumes of wastes reported as being stored in surface impoundmentswere not included in the estimates of volumes requiring alternative treatmentcapacity. However, these wastes will eventually require alternative storagecapacity because of the restrictions on placement of wastes into surfaceimpoundments. About 328 million gallons of First Third wastes are treated annually insurface impoundments that do not meet minimum technology requirements,or are residuals that have been removed from those surface impoundmentsthat do meet minimum technology requirements. An additional 49 milliongallons are stored in waste piles, 29 million gallons are treated in wastepiles, and 378 million gallons are disposed in landfills and land treatmentunits. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,p0,7/8,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Total Volume of Land Disposed First Third Wastes </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million gallons/year]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Storage: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles <D>49 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>6 </D></ITAG>Treatment: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles <D>29 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>328 </D></ITAG>Disposal: <ITAG tagnum="2">Landfills <D>302 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Land treatment <D>76 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>71</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>861</D></ITAG> Table 2 and Table 3 subdivide the total amount of land disposed First Thirdwastes into two categories: wastes for which treatment standards are beingpromulgated today, and wastes for which treatment standards are not beingpromulgated but which are subject to the ``soft hammer'' requirements.Wastes for which standards are being promulgated today are presented inTable 2 below. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,p0,7/8,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Volume of Land Disposed First Third Wastes for Which Standards areBeing Promulgated </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million gallons/year]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> Storage: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles <D>41 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>4 </D></ITAG>Treatment: <ITAG tagnum="2">Waste piles <D>27 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>320 </D></ITAG>Disposal: <ITAG tagnum="2">Landfills <D>274 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Land treatment <D>76 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Surface impoundments <D>70</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>812</D></ITAG>Table 3 presents the waste quantities and the method of land disposal forthe First Third wastes for which treatment standards are not being promulgated,and which are subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions.

Required Alternative Capacity </ITAG>The Agency assessed the requirements for alternative treatment capacityresulting from the promulgation of today's rule. EPA first characterizedthe volumes of First Third wastes for which treatment standards are beingpromulgated, since these wastes require alternative treatment. Waste streamswere characterized on the basis of land disposal method, waste code, andphysical/chemical form. Using this information, the Agency determined whichtreatment technologies are applicable to the waste volumes and placed thewastes into treatability groups. The volumes of alternative treatment capacitythat would be required when owners or operators comply with the land disposalrestrictions being promulgated was then determined. Based on this analysis,the Agency estimates that today's rule could affect about 812 million gallonsof First Third wastes that are land disposed annually. Of this total, about777 million gallons will require alternative treatment capacity, the remainderbeing stored. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, EPA is promulgatingtreatment standards expressed as concentration limits based on the performanceof the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT). It is not a requirementthat BDAT be used to achieve the concentration levels, but these technologies,as described in section III. A., were generally used as the basis for determiningavailable capacity. Several commenters expressed concern that the capacity required to treat``soft hammer'' wastes was not considered in the capacity analyses, andbecause of this omission, the amount of available capacity would be lessthan was presented in the May 17 proposed rule. Since ``soft hammer'' wasteshave no BDAT treatment standards, there is nothing upon which to base acapacity analysis. The Agency evaluated the characteristics and volumesof these wastes, and found that because of their physical form and comparativelysmall volume, they will not have a significant impact on available capacity.(See Table 3.) In addition, the ``soft hammer'' provisions require thatwastes be treated where treatment is practically available (assuming suchwastes are disposed in landfills or surface impoundments). If treatmentis found not to be practically available, the wastes may be land disposedafter appropriate certifications as to availability and practicality oftreatment are made. In effect, the generators of ``soft hammer'' wasteswill do waste-specific capacity analyses. If treatment capacity is in particularlyshort supply, generators can be expected to certify to the lack of practicallyavailable treatment and dispose with limited or no treatment. Thus, thesewastes should not displace treatment capacity for other restricted wastes.Also, several commenters said that the capacity for wastes generated atCERCLA response actions and RCRA corrective actions should be includedin the analyses, since the number of response actions and corrective actionswill be increasing and they could require much of the available capacityto treat large volumes of wastes. The Agency has determined that the greatestlikelihood for a conflict of this type is for those wastes where BDAT isidentified as solids/sludge incineration. The Agency has evaluated thepotential demand for solids incineration capacity from CERCLA responseactions and RCRA corrective actions. Although only gross estimates areavailable at this time, it is clear that this added increment of wasteswould be in excess of the solids incineration capacity available. Therefore,a two-year national capacity variance has been granted to soil and debrisfrom RCRA corrective actions and CERCLA response actions contaminated withwastes for which BDAT standards are based on incineration (see sectionIII. H. 5. b.). Other types of treatment capacity (e.g., stabilization,wastewater treatment) appear to be available in amounts sufficient to accommodateother RCRA corrective action and CERCLA response action wastes. EPA plansto do a more quantitative accounting of these wastes for future land disposalrestrictions rules as volume estimates become more precise. Several commenters also argued that the quantities of wastes requiringalternative capacity are underestimated because they do not include ``derivedfrom'' wastes. To the extent that ``derived from'' wastes were describedin the TSDR survey, they are accounted for in the capacity estimates. However,if ``derived from'' wastes were misreported or were not included in theTSDR survey report, they may be underestimated. The Agency believes thatmost of the potential underreporting of ``derived from'' wastes was forlandfill leachate. Large, commercial hazardous waste landfills can producesubstantial quantities of leachate which, depending on the types and levelsof contamination, may require further treatment. In response to commentsraising potential capacity problems for treatment of leachate, the Agencycontacted several large commercial hazardous waste landfill operators todetermine how they now manage leachate. They indicated that most leachateis now sent to POTW's, to NPDES discharge or to underground injection.Since all of these practices can continue to be used, there does not appearto be a capacity constraint on disposal of leachate. Commenters also raised questions about the ability to treat leachate derivedfrom multiple waste streams to the appropriate treatment standards. TheAgency examined data on leachate submitted by large, commercial hazardouswaste facilities and found that levels of hazardous constituents were generallywell below those seen in industrial wastes. This indicates that wastewatertreatment processes should provide sufficient treatment to allow leachateto meet the applicable standards. Since available wastewater treatmentcapacity far exceeds the demand, the Agency has concluded that there isno capacity constraint on treatment of leachate. (See section III. A. 4.for more discussions of the applicability of treatment standards to leachate.)The volumes of First Third wastes that require alternative treatment/recyclingcapacity are presented in Table 4. This table includes only the quantitiesof wastes that require alternative commercial capacity; the volumes givendo not include wastes that can be treated on-site by the generator. Severalcommenters argued that the Agency overestimated the amount of on-site capacitysince there is no guarantee that on-site treatment will achieve the regulatorytreatment standards. However, the Agency included only BDAT treatment inits assessment of both off site and on-site capacity. EPA develops BDATsuch that any well-designed and well-operated treatment process shouldbe capable of complying with the standards.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Required Alternative Commercial Treatment/Recycling Capacity for FirstThird Wastes </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[million gallons/year] </ITAG><H1>Waste code</H1><H1>Required capacity</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">F006<D>129.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K001<D> 3.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K021<D>\1\ 0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K022 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K044 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K045 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K046 <D>1.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K047 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K060 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K083 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K086 <D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K087 <D>1.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K099 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K101/102 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K004 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K008 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K015 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K016 <D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K018 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K019 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K020 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K024 <D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K030 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K036 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K037 <D>andless;0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K048 <D>37.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K049 <D>32.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K050 <D>11.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K051 <D>78.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K052 <D>12.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K061 <D>83.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K062 <D>40.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K069 <D>0.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K071 <D>3.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K103 <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K104 <D>andless;0.1 </D><F>\1\ See section III.

Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency evaluatedcommercial capacity and determined that there is approximately 274 milliongallons available, ample capacity to treat these wastes. Thus, no capacityvariance was granted for K015, K083, or K086 wastes. b. <T3>Solid/Sludge Incineration Capacity. </T3>Treatment standards for K001,K016, K018, K019, K020, K022, K024, K030, K037, K087, K101 and K102 wastesare based on solid/sludge incineration. The Agency estimated that 6 milliongallons per year of these wastes require solid/sludge incineration capacity.Using the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency evaluated commercial incinerationcapacity and determined that there was about 7 million gallons of solid/sludgeincineration capacity available. Based upon this data, the Agency did notgrant a capacity variance for these wastes. The Agency received a number of comments on the availability of incinerationfor K001 wastes. Commenters noted that some incineration facilities refusedto take K001 wastes containing pentachlorophenol, while other facilitieswould accept only ``true'' K001 wastes, and not wastes which resemble,but are not, K001. Commenters also noted that substantial volumes of K001wastes, as well as some soils contaminated with K001, will be generatedwhen surface impoundments at wood preserving facilities are closed. Basedon these factors, some commenters requested that a two-year national capacityvariance be granted for K001 wastes. An industry association submitted comments which included an informal surveyconducted by one of its members of eight solids incineration facilities.According to these comments, three of the facilities would accept K001waste for incineration without constraints on whether it was ``true'' K001or K001-like waste. A fourth facility expected to receive a permit modificationprior to August which would enable it to take K001, again without constraints.Two facilities said they would incinerate ``true'' K001 wastes. One facilitywould not accept K001 with pentachlorophenol. The final facility was notplanning to continue incineration activities. This information indicates that there is capacity available to incinerate``true'' K001 wastes. The wastes which resemble, but are not, K001 arenot subject to the treatment standards and, therefore, cannot be consideredin capacity determinations. Finally, if a particular generator cannot findan incineration facility that can or will accept his waste, he may qualifyfor a case-by-case extension of the effective date (see 40 CFR 268.5).It is possible that K001 wastes produced when old surface impoundmentsare closed could exceed the available commercial incineration capacity,particularly if the incineration was scheduled to occur within the nexttwelve months. However, a number of factors could affect the amount ofK001 generated during closures, particularly closure plans which incorporate<T3>in situ </T3>treatment either as a final solution or as a volume reductionmeasure prior to removal of the waste. Also, as noted above, the generatorcan apply under andSection; 268.5 for a case-by-case extension of the effectivedate where special circumstances pertain. Soils and debris contaminated with K001 (and other First Third wastes requiringincineration) are being granted a two-year national capacity variance (seesection III. H. 5.). Based upon these factors, the Agency will not grant a capacity varianceto K001 wastes. c. <T3>Solvent Extraction or Incineration. </T3>Treatment standards for K048-K052wastes are based on solvent extraction followed by stabilization of residualsor sludge incineration followed by stabilization of ash. The Agency estimatesthat about 154 million gallons per year of these wastes require eithersolvent extraction or sludge incineration capacity as a result of today'sfinal rule. The Agency evaluated commercial capacity and determined thatthere is approximately l million gallons of solvent extraction capacityand 7 million gallons of sludge/solid incineration capacity available.(Approximately 6 million gallons of sludge/solid capacity will be neededfor K001, K016, K019, K020, K022, K024, K030, K037, K087, K101, and K102wastes.) Therefore, a 2-year national capacity variance from the effectivedate is being granted for these wastes. d. <T3>Stabilization. </T3>Treatment standards for F006 and K046 wastes arebased on stabilization. In addition, stabilization is required for treatmentresiduals from other wastes. (As discussed in section III. A. 7., the Agencyis setting a treatment standard based on stabilization for non-explosiveK046 wastes, while allowing the ``soft hammer'' to apply to explosive K046wastes.) Because the Agency does not have data which allows it to determinethe volume of waste associated with each type of K046, EPA has assumedthe entire volume will require stabilization. The Agency estimates thatabout 148 million gallons per year of these wastes require stabi1izationcapacity as a result of the treatment standards promulgated today. Many commenters questioned the capacity analysis for F006, arguing thatthe evaluation of available stabilization capacity does not guarantee thatit is capable of achieving the treatment standard. The standard is basedon the performance of cement and pozzolanic-based stabilization. Althoughthe TSDR Survey does contain data on other stabilization methods, onlythese two types of stabilization were included in the capacity analysis(i.e., only the types considered as BDAT). Furthermore, the methodologyfor determining BDAT includes factors that account for performance variability;therefore, the Agency is reasonably sure that the capacity included inthis analysis is capable of achieving the treatment standard. The Agencyevaluated commercial capacity and determined that there is approximately495 million gallons of stabilization capacity available, more than enoughto treat these wastes. No capacity variance is being granted for wastesfor which treatment standards are based on stabilization. e. <T3>High Temperature Metals Recovery/Stabilization. </T3>The treatmentstandard for K061 waste containing 15% or more total zinc (high zinc K061)is based on high temperature metals recovery. For wastes containing lessthan 15% zinc (low zinc K061) the standard is based on stabilization. Basedon data received from commenters, approximately 75% of K061 waste contains15% or more total zinc. Thus, an estimated 62 million gallons of high temperaturemetals recovery capacity is required but only 34 million gallons of capacityis available. Therefore, a two-year national capacity variance from thehigh temperature metals recovery standard has been granted to high zincK061 wastes. As discussed in section III. A. 7., the Agency is settingan interim standard for high zinc K061 wastes based on stabilization. Consequentlythe entire volume of K061 waste will require stabilization capacity onan interim basis. Thus, the required stabilization capacity is 83 milliongallons for K061 plus 148 million gallons for other wastes, for a totalof 231 million gallons.Using the new TSDR survey, the Agency has determined that there is enoughstabilization capacity for K061 wastes and other waste codes and, therefore,no capacity variance is being granted for the two-year period during whichthe interim stabilization standard will be in effect. f. <T3>Wastewater Treatment. </T3>Treatment standards for K062 waste are basedon wastewater treatment (chromium reduction, chemical precipitation andfiltration). The Agency estimates that less than 42 million gallons peryear of this waste require various types of wastewater treatment as a resultof the treatment standards promulgated today. Using the new TSDR survey data, the Agency evaluated commercial capacityand determined that there is adequate capacity available for wastewatertreatment. Therefore, no capacity variance is being granted for K062. g. <T3>Sludge Treatment. </T3>Treatment standards for K071 waste are basedon sludge treatment (acid leaching, chemical oxidation, and sulfide precipitationand filtration). The Agency estimates that about 4 million gallons peryear of this waste requires sludge treatment as a result of the treatmentstandards promulgated today. After analyzing the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined thatthere is not enough treatment capacity commercially available to treatK071. Therefore, a 2-year national capacity variance is being granted forK071. h. <T3>Wastes for Which Treatment Standards are Based on Solvent Recoveryor Solvent Extraction. </T3>The treatment standards for K103 and K104 wastesare based on solvent recovery. BDAT for K103 is solvent extraction, followedby steam stripping, followed by carbon adsorption, followed by carbon regeneration.BDAT for K104 is solvent extraction followed by liquid incineration andfollowed by steam stripping, followed by carbon adsorption, followed bycarbon regeneration. Using the new TSDR Survey data, EPA determined that the only volumes ofthese wastes that require alternative commercial capacity are those ``derivedfrom'' wastes not amenable to solvent recovery or solvent extraction becauseof their physical forms. Therefore, the Agency assumed that the K103 andK104 wastes requiring alternative treatment will undergo incineration,followed by stabilization of the ash. The Agency believes that this treatmentcan achieve the standard, and the volumes of K103 and K104 requiring alternativetreatment have been included in the incineration and stabilization totals.i. <T3>Wastes Not Requiring Alternative Capacity. </T3>After reviewing thenew TSDR Survey, EPA determined that a number of First Third wastes donot require alternative capacity, even though treatment standards are beingpromulgated. These wastes are: K004, K008, K015, K018, K021, K036, K044,K045, K047, K060, K099, and some K069. Each of these is discussed below.Treatment standards for K044, K045 and K047 wastes are based on open detonation,for which there is no capacity constraint. The Agency believes that whenopen detonation is properly conducted, the residuals are no longer reactive,nor do they exhibit any other characteristic. Other treatment methods whichachieve the same results are also permissible. Therefore, K044, K045, andK047 do not require alternative commercial capacity and further analysisis not necessary. Treatment standards for K099 waste are based on chlorine oxidation. TheAgency determined that this waste is only being generated at one facility,and that the generator is able to treat the waste on-site. Therefore, novolumes were reported as requiring alternative commercial capacity andno further analysis is necessary. Treatment standards for K015 waste are based on liquid incineration, andstandards for K018 waste are based on solid/sludge incineration. Afteranalyzing the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency determined that neitherof these wastes was reported in the TSDR survey as being land disposed.Therefore, no alternative treatment capacity is required. It is possiblethat all of these wastes are being treated on-site and do not require commercialcapacity. It is also possible that these wastes are not being land disposed,or if they are, they are land disposed by a method not covered in the TSDRSurvey (underground mines) or not included in the proposed rule (deep wellinjection). Finally, the wastes may not have required alternative capacityin 1986, the reporting period covered by the TSDR Survey. Treatment standards for non-calcium sulfate K069 waste are based on totalrecycle, meaning this waste cannot be land disposed. Available informationshows that most K069 wastes currently being generated are being recycledand do not require alternative capacity. As discussed in section III. A.7., some K069 wastes contain high levels of calcium sulfate. These wastescannot be recycled. The Agency is not promulgating a treatment standardfor calcium sulfate containing K069 wastes; these wastes will be subjectto the ``soft hammer'' requirements. The Agency proposed a treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' for K004,K008, K021, K025, K036, K060, K073 and K100 wastes and for wastewatersfrom F006, K022, K046, K061, K069, and K106, based on the belief that theyare no longer being generated or are not being land disposed. Commentersnoted that these wastes are being generated in the form of landfill leachateeven though ongoing production processes may no longer produce the wastes.Also, these wastes may be present in contaminated ground water and, thus,may be generated during cleanup actions. Because a ``no land disposal'' standard could hinder or preclude necessaryand desirable collection and treatment of leachate and contaminated groundwater, the Agency has not established standards for the wastewater componentsof the ``no land disposal'' wastes. In addition, the Agency is revisingthe schedule for the prohibition on land disposal and establishment oftreatment standards (40 CFR 268.10) to move leachate from ``soft hammer''wastes, contaminated ground water from ``soft hammer'' wastes, and certain``soft hammer'' wastewater residues from treatment to the Third Third toavoid disruptive effects while standards are developed (see section III.C. 3. for further discussion). For the non-wastewater forms of K004, K008, K021, K036, and K060 the ``noland disposal'' standard is being promulgated. j. <T3>Other Comments on Capacity Determinations. </T3>Several commentersfelt that available capacity for treating wastes in tank systems was underestimatedbecause additional capacity could be brought on line quickly by vendorsor put into service as on-site capacity. For example, one commenter disagreedwith the variance provided to K071 waste because the BDAT technologiesidentified for K071 are simple chemical tank treatment processes (acidleaching, chemical oxidation, and sulfide precipitation), which could besupplied readily by vendors. The Agency believes that because of the time necessary to construct suchtreatment systems and (in some cases) to satisfy permitting requirements,additional capacity cannot be brought on-line quickly and should thereforenot be considered when analyzing available treatment capacity. In addition,as part of the TSDR Survey, facilities were asked to report any treatmentprocesses planned to be operational (considering construction and permittime) by January 1992. Planned capacity reported in the TSDR Survey, andtaken into consideration in the Agency's capacity determinations, did notindicate that additional capacity that would change the capacity determinationspromulgated today would be available in the near future. Some commenters believe that the Agency's capacity analysis overestimatedthe national capacity to incinerate solids and sludges. Commenters statedthat the Agency did not consider all necessary factors when determiningsolid/sludge incineration capacity. Factors cited as not considered includedmaterial handling restrictions, downtime for maintenance, storage restrictions,and siting and permitting difficulties for future incineration units. Onecommenter felt that the Agency overestimated the volume of waste requiringsolid/sludge incineration capacity because pretreatment and volume reductionwere not considered. The same commenter also felt that the Agency underestimatedsolid/sludge treatment capacity because liquid incineration capacity couldeasily be converted for solid/sludge incineration. The Agency based its latest incineration capacity determination on the1987 TSDR Survey database. When completing the TSDR Survey, the facilitieswere asked to consider downtime for maintenance and other factors whenreporting the treatment capacity for existing and future units. Therefore,such factors should be reflected in the estimates of available solid/sludgeincineration capacity. In addition, the TSDR Survey did request informationon plans to change the types of capacity available (e.g., liquid to solid/sludgeincineration) and this information is included in the estimates. Therefore,EPA disagrees with both of these comments. Commenters expressed concern because the Agency's determinations of requiredtreatment capacity did not take into account the volumes of waste thatwill be removed from surface impoundments undergoing clean closure. Therefore,the commenters felt that the Agency underestimated the volume of wastesrequiring alternative treatment.This issue is discussed earlier in this section with respect to K001 woodpreserving wastes. Some information was provided by commenters on the volumesof wastes currently in surface impoundments at their facilities; however,for the reasons set out in the earlier discussion of K001, the Agency believesthat both the timing of closures and the amount of material which willactually require incineration are uncertain at this time, and thereforecannot be used in the capacity decision. The new TSDR data have implications for ``soft hammer'' certifications.A ``soft hammer'' certification for a waste amenable to treatment by amethod for which ample capacity exists will be critically examined by EPAand is more likely to be invalidated. Examples are wastes amenable to liquidinjection incineration or to stabilization. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for Solvent Wastes andCalifornia List Wastes </ITAG>Using the new TSDR data, EPA reevaluated waste volumes requiring alternativecapacity because of the Solvents final rule (51 FR 40572) and the Californialist final rule (52 FR 25760). The new analyses indicated significant changesin waste management practices and capacity, notably, significant increasesin incineration capacity. Consequently, some national capacity variancesare no longer necessary. Capacity variances are no longer needed for F001-F005solvents generated by small quantity generators (i.e., generators of 100-1000kilograms of hazardous wastes per month), CERCLA response actions, andRCRA corrective actions addressed in andSection;andSection; 268.30(a) (1) and(2), with the exception of solvent-contaminated soils. Also, capacity variancesare no longer needed for California list HOCs, with the exception of HOC-contaminatedsoils. BDAT for these wastes is incineration, and the new data indicatesignificant increases in incineration capacity, assuring adequate capacityfor these wastes. The May 17 notice proposed to terminate these national capacity variancesas of the date of promulgation of the final First Third rule. Based oncomments received, some of which point out the short comment period onthe May 17 proposal necessitated by the statutory deadline, the Agencyhas decided to allow the capacity variances for certain solvent wastesto expire and to terminate the California list HOCs variance on November8, 1988. The Agency believes that the three-month delay will not resultin any adverse environmental effects and will permit generators of Californialist wastes, for which the variance is being terminated eight months earlierthan expected, to arrange for appropriate treatment and disposal of theirwastes, if they have not done so already. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. National Variances from the Effective Date for Contaminated Soiland Debris </ITAG>a. <T3>Legal Authority. </T3>Under RCRA sections 3004 (d)(3) and (e)(3), Congressprovided that the land disposal restrictions provisions for disposal ofcertain ``contaminated soil'' and ``debris'' from CERCLA 104 and 106 responseactions and from RCRA corrective actions would not apply until 48 monthsfrom the enactment of HSWA. These provisions apply specifically to soiland debris contaminated with spent solvents, certain dioxin-containingwastes, and California list restricted hazardous wastes. November 8, 1988,therefore, is the applicable effective date established under RCRA sections3004 (d)(3) and (e)(3) for CERCLA and RCRA corrective action contaminatedsoil and debris. Congress provided no such alternative statutory effectivedate for CERCLA and RCRA soil and debris contaminated with First Third(or Second Third) wastes. Thus, the statutory effective date for thesewastes is the same as for any other hazardous waste which is included inthe first one-third of the schedule_August 8, 1988. No commenter disagreedwith this analysis. (See the May 17, 1988 proposed rule for a more detailedexplanation of legal authority and other aspects of the proposed variance.)An important factor in setting this later effective date for soil and debrisfrom cleanup actions was Congress' evident acknowledgment that it wouldtake extra time to develop treatment capacity for soils and debris contaminatedwith these wastes. Foreseeing this potential shortfall, Congress placedthese wastes on an alternative schedule approximately the same as the onefor the first group of wastes prohibited under section 3004(g). Restrictedhazardous wastes are normally prohibited from land disposal as soon asthe statutory deadline passes (RCRA section 3004(h)(1)). If, however, thereis a lack of adequate alternative protective treatment, recovery, or disposalcapacity to treat the wastes, the Agency may set an alternative effectivedate based on the earliest date on which such adequate capacity becomesavailable, not to exceed two years (RCRA section 3004(h)(2)). b. <T3>Soil and Debris Capacity Variance. </T3>In today's rule, the Agencyis granting a national capacity variance for certain contaminated soilsfor which BDAT is based on solids incineration. A partial estimate of the amount of soil requiring solids incinerationis shown below. These amounts represent the quantity of soils land disposedat RCRA facilities in 1986. The amount of soils generated by CERCLA responseor RCRA corrective actions requiring solids incineration is not currentlyknown. andbullet; Solvent_26 million gal/yr. andbullet; Dioxin_(none reported in 1986). andbullet; California List HOCs (other than First Third wastes for whichtreatment standards were proposed)_4 million gal/yr. andbullet; First Third (for which treatment standards were proposed)_12 milliongal/yr. EPA expects that all of the solids incineration capacity will be utilizedas a result of other actions taken today, and therefore that there willbe a lack of capacity for incineration of soils. In the May 17, 1988 proposal, the Agency also requested comment on theadvisability of applying the variance to debris contaminated with solvents,certain dioxins or HOCs above 1,000 ppm, as well as to debris contaminatedwith First Third wastes. Several commenters addressed this issue and allwere in favor of including debris in the 2-year national capacity variances.The Agency agrees and, therefore, debris is included in the national variancesalong with contaminated soils generated from CERCLA response actions andRCRA corrective actions. Many commenters urged that the variance be broadenedto apply to soils contaminated with solvent, dioxin and California listwastes other than those from CERCLA response and RCRA corrective actions.The Agency believes this to be precluded by the wording of the statute.See the May 17 proposed rule for a more detailed explanation. The national capacity variance applies to soils and debris contaminatedwith spent F001-F005 solvents and F020-F023 and F026-F028 dioxins whichresult from a response action taken under CERCLA sections 104 or 106 ora RCRA corrective action. Soils and debris contaminated with Californialist HOC wastes which result from a response action taken under CERCLAsections 104 or 106 or RCRA corrective actions are also included in thevariance. Such contaminated CERCLA and RCRA soils and debris are coveredby the capacity variance until November 8, 1990_two years from the statutoryeffective date applicable to these wastes. A national capacity variance is also being granted for soils and debriscontaminated with certain First Third wastes for which the treatment standardsare based on incineration; however, it is not limited exclusively to soilsfrom CERCLA response and RCRA corrective actions. The variance appliesto soils and debris contaminated with the following First Third wastes:K001, K015, K016, K018, K019, K020, K022, K024, K030, K037, K048-K052,K083, K086, K087, K101, K102, K103 and K104. Soils and debris contaminatedwith the specified First Third wastes receive a variance that extends theeffective date for the land disposal restrictions to August 8, 1990. The effective dates for soil and debris established by today's final actionhave been summarized in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Summary of Final Effective Dates </T4><H1>Restricted hazardous waste </H1><H1>Prohibition effective date in today's final rule</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">I. Solvent- and dioxin-containing soil and debris from CERCLA responseor RCRA corrective actions <D>11-8-90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II. Soil and debris NOT from CERCLA response actions or RCRA correctiveactions contaminated with less than 1% total solvents or certain dioxins<D>11-8-88  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III.

All soil and debris contaminated with First Third wastes for whichtreatment standards are based on incineration <D>8-8-90</D></ITAG></ITAG> The Agency acknowledges that granting a national capacity variance forcontaminated soils is a policy choice. That is, EPA could have separatedout some segment of CERCLA and RCRA corrective action soils for immediateprohibition instead of rescinding the variance for other HOC and solventwastes requiring solids incineration. EPA did not pursue this course forseveral reasons. First, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to separateout a discrete segment of contaminated clean-up soils to fit the availabletreatment capacity. More importantly, the precise amount of CERCLA andRCRA corrective action soils to be generated over the next 24 months isnot certain due to the unpredictable pace of clean-up actions, whereasthe volume of other surface disposal wastes requiring solids incinerationcapacity is much better quantified. By rescinding variances for the wasteswhose volume is better quantified, EPA is far more certain that the existingtreatment capacity will actually be utilized. That is, EPA is not reservingscarce solids incineration capacity for contaminated soils that might neverbe generated, and is thus structuring these variances to make certain thatscarce solids incineration capacity will actually be utilized. With respect to soils contaminated with spent solvents, certain dioxins,and HOC wastes, only those that result from a response action taken undersection 104 or 106 of CERCLA or a corrective action required under RCRAare included under this capacity variance. For all other soils contaminatedwith these wastes, an application for a case-by-case extension may be submittedif adequate alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made available bythe applicable effective date. c. <T3>Definition of ``Soil'' and ``Debris''. </T3>For the purpose of determiningwhether a contaminated material is subject to this national variance, somedefinition of the terms ``soil'' and ``debris'' is needed. Soil is definedas materials that are primarily geologic in origin such as silt, loam,or clay, and that are indigenous to the natural geological environment.In certain cases soils will be mixed with liquids, sludges or debris. TheAgency solicited comment on appropriate methods for determining whethersuch mixtures should be considered a soil waste. Several commenters addressed this issue; they generally favored the inclusionof such mixtures in the capacity variance. However, they did not offerpractical methods for making a generally applicable determination on whatthese mixtures should be. Therefore, the Agency will make such determinationson a case-by-case basis. As proposed, however, soils do not include wasteswithdrawn from active hazardous waste management units, such as impoundmentdredgings. Such wastes are sludges, not soils, and EPA has evaluated thevolume of these sludges in its capacity estimates (based on TSDR surveyreports), and determined that sufficient capacity exists for these wastes.The variance obviously does not apply to materials produced as a resultof the deliberate addition of soil or dirt to a restricted hazardous waste.Such a practice is forbidden by the provisions of the dilution prohibition(40 CFR 268.3). For the purpose of determining whether a contaminated material is subjectto this national variance, debris is defined as materials that are primarilynon-geologic in origin such as grass, trees, and shrubs, and man-made materialssuch as concrete, clothing, partially buried whole or crushed empty drums,capacitors, and other synthetic manufactured items. This may also includegeologic materials identified as not indigenous to the natural geologicalenvironment at or near the site or identified as indigenous rocks exceedinga total size that, based on engineering judgement, will affect performanceof available treatment technologies. d. <T3>Notes on Drafting of the Regulatory Language. </T3>To implement thesechanges in the various capacity variances, EPA is amending the regulatorylanguage in andSection;andSection; 268.30 through 268.33. With respect to thesolvent wastes covered in andSection; 268.30, the Agency is adding a newandSection; 268.30(c) dealing with contaminated soil and debris from CERCLAresponse and RCRA corrective actions. This provision replaces existingandSection; 268.1(c)(3). New andSection; 268.30(b) groups all the solvent wastes having a November8, 1988 prohibition effective date. As noted above, new andSection; 268.30(c)sets forth the 1990 effective date for CERCLA response and RCRA correctiveaction contaminated soil and debris. Also added is language indicatingthat if these wastes are to be disposed in landfills or surface impoundmentsuntil the prohibition effective date, the landfill or impoundment unitmust meet the section 3004(o) minimum technology requirements (see 53 FR11769). The Agency is making similar changes in andSection;andSection; 268.31, 268.32,and 268.33 to reflect the revised effective dates. The language in andSection;268.33(c) indicates that the 1990 effective date applies to all soils contaminatedwith First Third wastes with treatment standards based on incineration.I. Recyclable Materials Used in a Manner Constituting Disposal In the May 17 proposal, EPA proposed to amend andSection; 266.20 of the regulationsto provide that hazardous waste-derived products that are recycled by beingplaced on the land must meet the applicable treatment standard for eachwaste that they contain as a condition for remaining exempt from all otherhazardous waste regulation (53 FR 17605). The Agency reasoned that conditioningthe existing regulatory exemption in this way would effectuate the landdisposal restrictions statutory provisions by requiring that hazardouswastes comply with applicable treatment standards before they are recycledby being placed on the land. Most commenters supported this proposal, anumber urging the Agency to end the regulatory exemption altogether. Personsproducing fertilizers from waste K061, however, maintained that their fertilizerswere safe to apply and were similar in composition to other zinc containingfertilizers not produced from hazardous wastes. They therefore urged theAgency to retain the regulatory exemption or to reclassify the fertilizers.Finally, a few commenters argued that hazardous secondary materials thatare recycled by being placed on the land are not wastes at all becausethey are not being ``discarded''. EPA has decided to finalize the proposed rule with respect to hazardouswaste derived products that are placed on the land, except that EPA isnot taking any action with respect to fertilizers that use waste K061 asan ingredient (so that such fertilizers will remain exempt from regulation).EPA is conditioning the regulatory exemption for the reasons stated inthe proposal, most particularly because the land disposal restrictionsstatutory provisions indicate that wastes are not to be placed on the landuntil they have been pretreated to meet the standards EPA established pursuantto section 3004(m). Where a waste-derived product is produced from morethan one prohibited waste, the waste-derived product would have to meetthe treatment standard for each hazardous waste that it contains, and ifthere are different treatment standards for common constituents, then the``product'' would have to meet the most stringent of those standards. EPA also solicited comment on an appropriate tracking system for hazardouswaste-derived products to document that these materials meet the applicabletreatment standards. Hazardous wastes sent to recycling facilities forultimate use in waste-derived products that are to be placed on the landare already subject to regulation under section 268.7 (as well as the restof subtitle C), and so persons shipping such wastes already must notifythe recycler that the wastes are prohibited (andSection;andSection; 268.7(a)and 266.21). EPA has decided, however, that once the recycler producesa waste-derived product that meets the treatment standard, the recycleris not required to notify the receiving facility that it (the receivingfacility) is receiving a hazardous waste. The ultimate user of the hazardouswaste-derived product is not a normal disposal facility, but rather operatesas a commercial entity. As such, this entity is not a meaningful repositoryof a treatment facility's (i.e., the recycler's) certification and trackingdocuments prepared pursuant to andSection; 268.7(b). Accordingly, EPA hasdecided that, instead of the recycler submitting information to the ultimateuser, all of the andSection; 268.7 information is to be submitted to theappropriate EPA Regional office or State authority. The only differencein reporting requirements would be that the recycling facility also keeprecords of the name and location of each entity receiving the hazardouswaste-derived product. In this way, the appropriate regulatory authoritywill be on notice of the location of each shipment and that the shipmenthas met the applicable treatment standards for the hazardous wastes containedwithin the waste-derived product. EPA has further determined that fertilizers produced from hazardous wasteK061 should remain exempt from all regulation for the present time. Fora further discussion of this determination, see section III. A. 7. EPA also wishes to take this opportunity to clarify, in response to comment,that the underlying regulatory provision andSection; 266.20, does not applyto materials, such as cement or aggregate, that are not produced from hazardouswastes. This is true even for cement or aggregate produced in a furnacethat is powered in whole or in part by hazardous waste fuel. Section 266.20applies when a process ``use(s) hazardous wastes as ingredients'' to producea product that is then applied to the land (50 FR 628; January 4, 1985).To be covered by the rule, a product must ``contain'' the hazardous waste.Materials such as cement or aggregate that are produced from raw materials,but come from processes that may be fired by hazardous waste fuels, areconsequently not covered by this provision. They do not use hazardous wasteas ingredients. Section 266.20 thus applies when hazardous wastes are incorporateddirectly into a product which is to be applied to the land; hazardous wastesrecycled in this way thus really are being disposed. There is no such directlink with disposal when hazardous wastes are used to power a process thatmay be producing a material that will be used on the land. Products producedin processes that use hazardous waste fuels thus are not covered by section266.20 unless the process also uses hazardous wastes as ingredients ina product destined for land application. Finally, EPA responds briefly to those commenters alleging that materialsused in a manner constituting disposal are not being discarded and thereforeare not solid wastes. As the Agency has explained many times, use constitutingdisposal involves as a practical matter the disposal of wastes. The wastesare being gotten rid of by placing them directly on the land (see e.g.,53 FR 521-22; January 8, 1988). The indications that Congress meant tocontrol this recycling practice under RCRA are legion. [See RCRA section3004(1) (use of hazardous waste as dust suppressant or for road treatmentis prohibited); H.R. Rep. No. 198, 98th Cong. lst Sess. at 46, 67-68 (hazardouswaste-derived products that are placed on the land are to be the specialobject of EPA scrutiny under the Subtitle C program)]. To say that Congressdid not intend to control these use constituting disposal situations underRCRA is to say that Congress had no intention of controlling such damageincidents as the Times Beach dioxin spreading incident where a group ofcommunities were rendered uninhabitable as a result of use of a distillationbottoms mixed with used oil as a dust suppressant. No credible readingof the statute would authorize this type of conduct. Accordingly, EPA viewsall use constituting disposal recycling activities involving hazardoussecondary materials as within its jurisdiction under RCRA subtitle C.J. Reclamation of Indigenous Waste In the proposed rules, the Agency indicated that where it was proposingtreatment standards based on some type of metal recovery technology, itmight not write treatment standards for the wastes generated by the metalrecovery technology (for example, for the slag generated by resmeltinghazardous waste K069, emission control dust/sludge from secondary leadsmelting). (53 FR 11762). The Agency indicated that this result could followfrom application of the so-called ``indigenous'' principle, which statesthat certain wastes destined for material recovery in industrial furnacescan be considered to be indigenous to those furnaces and so cease to besolid wastes at the point they are actually placed in the furnace. (53FR 11753). The particular waste codes that might be affected by applicationof this principle are K061 and K069. Although EPA has discussed this concept for some time, and most commentershave agreed that some type of indigenous principle is desirable and perhapslegally required, EPA has not fixed the precise scope of the concept. EPAproposed a definition in the May 6, 1987 rule dealing with emission standardsfor boilers and industrial furnaces, and plans shortly to repropose a somewhatdifferent meaning for the term as part of a reproposal of the boiler andindustrial furnace standards. This proposed revision would evaluate boththe similarity of the process in which the waste was originally generatedand the one in which it is being recovered, and would also evaluate thesimilarity of the waste from the standpoint of identity and concentrationof Appendix VIII hazardous constituents, and the raw material that it isreplacing. Based on the information now before it, EPA believes that K061 and K069wastes would be indigenous to metal recovery processes. K061 wastes aregenerated by the same type of furnace that recovers the K061 dust, furnacesfrom both the steel industry and the zinc smelting industry are part ofthe same generic SIC code 331, and the dusts are similar in compositionto the virgin ores customarily smelted in zinc smelting furnaces. Not onlyare the zinc levels the same as found in virgin ores (15% minimum), theother toxic metals (lead and cadmium) are also present in zinc ores incomparable concentrations. Hazardous waste K069 is even more clearly indigenousto the secondary lead smelting process since it is generated directly bythe secondary lead process and contains no toxic constituents not alreadypresent in the normal feed material to the secondary lead smelting furnace.It therefore appears to the Agency that these two hazardous wastes wouldbe considered to be indigenous to the respective metal recovery processunder any of the definitions that EPA is considering. Because it appearsat this time to be clear that under any ultimate regulatory regime thesewastes would be indigenous, then the derived from rule would not applyto any of the wastes generated by the metal recovery process. Consequently,the treatment standards EPA is establishing today for K061 and K069 donot apply to wastes from the metal recovery processes because, by virtueof the indigenous principle, the derived from rule would not apply to theseprocesses (i.e., the residuals from such processes would not be derivedfrom a hazardous waste).K. Nonrulemaking Procedures for Site-Specific Variances from the TreatmentStandard In the November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572), the Agency establisheda procedure for obtaining a variance from the applicable treatment standard(40 CFR 268.44). Use of this variance was envisioned in cases where restrictedhazardous wastes differ significantly from the wastes evaluated in settingtreatment standards and, as a result, cannot be treated to meet the applicabletreatment levels or where the technology used to establish the treatmentlevel is not appropriate to the waste. The request for this treatabilityvariance must demonstrate, among other things, that the waste is significantlydifferent from the wastes evaluated in establishing the treatment standardand cannot be treated in compliance with the applicable treatment standard.Prior to today's final rule, the section 268.44 variance procedures wereavailable only through a rulemaking that would amend the regulatory treatmentstandards each time a variance was granted. Today's final rule amends andSection; 268.44 by adding procedures for requestinga site-specific variance from the treatment standard. As explained below,opportunity will be provided for public comment on site specific variances.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>On September 5, 1986, the Agency published a Notice of Availability ofData (51 FR 31783). The notice requested comments on whether EPA shouldhave a variance from the generally applicable treatment standards, andthe procedures under which such variances should be processed. Commentersgenerally supported allowing variances from the treatment standard. Furthermore,in the context of today's modification, some commenters, while recognizingEPA's authority to grant variances through rulemaking procedures, supportedthe use of nonrulemaking procedures. Because there was insufficient timeto fully consider all issues relating to the variance procedure beforethe November 7, 1986 rule was promulgated, only a procedure for obtaininga variance from the treatment standard which required rulemaking was established(51 FR 40572); however, the Agency noted its intention to raise the nonrulemakingvariance issue in the future. The Agency requested comment on several modifications of the variance procedurein the December 11, 1986 California list land disposal restrictions proposal(51 FR 44729). Specifically, comment was requested on the advisabilityof allowing nonrulemaking procedures and on the applicability of such procedures.Comment was also requested on establishing a deadline for variance applications,on provisions for public comment, and on the criteria for granting nonrulemakingvariances. Nonrulemaking variance procedures were again presented for public commentin a Notice of Availability of Data published on August 12, 1987 (52 FR30038). It was noted that the July 7, 1987 California list final rule (52FR 25780) set forth a treatment method equivalency petition (40 CFR 268.42)that need not be processed through a formal rulemaking in cases where therelief sought would not have generic applicability and effect. In the August12 Notice, EPA solicited further comment on the advisability of applyingthe same reasoning to the site-specific variance from the treatment standardso that formal rulemaking procedures are not mandated. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Major Comments </ITAG>The Agency received several comments addressing various aspects of establishinga nonrulemaking procedure for site-specific variances from the treatmentstandard. The majority of commenters supported the establishment of nonrulemakingprocedures; their arguments were based on the need for streamlined proceduresso that variances may be reviewed in a timely manner. Several commenterssuggested that a site-specific nonrulemaking variance could be includedin the permitting process, thus offering an opportunity for public comment.One commenter cited the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Chemical Manufacturers Association </T3>v. <T3>NRDC, </T3>470 U.S. 116 (1985), as support for EPA's authority to usea streamlined variance procedure. On the other hand, two commenters expressedconcerns about utilizing nonrulemaking procedures. One commented that EPAhad the authority to grant variances from the treatment standard, but statedthat all petitions must be subject to public review and comment beforethey are granted. The other commenter strongly opposed the Agency's proposedapproach, arguing that nonrulemaking procedures violate RCRA sections 3004(m),7004, and 7006. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Agency Response and Summary of Today's Approach </ITAG>The Agency believes that nonrulemaking procedures for the variance fromthe treatment standard are not precluded by the statute in cases wheresuch a determination is site-specific, having no generic applicabilityand effect. The Agency is taking this position for a number of reasons.First, since a generator-specific treatability variance would not be ofgeneral applicability and effect, such administrative action would notbe a rule requiring utilization of the Administrative Procedure Act informalrulemaking procedures. Second, to the extent that section 3004(m) createsan independent requirement of rulemaking procedures, this requirement issatisfied by the initial rulemaking in which the BDAT treatment standardis established. In this regard, the Agency notes that there are numerousinstances where a statute requires that a generally applicable standardbe established by regulation, but that variances from that standard neednot be established via rulemaking. Under RCRA, for example, EPA must userulemaking to establish generally applicable standards for treatment, storage,and disposal facilities (RCRA section 3004(a)). EPA, however, has alsoestablished variances from certain of these generally applicable requirementswhich can be granted by means other than rulemaking_for example, the variancefrom the secondary containment requirement for hazardous waste tanks isimplemented by nonrulemaking procedures. (See andSection; 264.193 (g) and(h)). Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is required to establish generallyapplicable effluent limitation guidelines and standards by regulation,but for years has had in place a fundamentally different factors variancefrom these standards that was implemented by nonrulemaking procedures.This Fundamentally Different Factors variance is now codified in the 1987amendments to the Clean Water Act, section 301(n). In the land disposalrestrictions rules themselves, EPA adopted nonrulemaking procedures forprocessing demonstrations of equivalency to a specified BDAT method. (SeeandSection; 268.42(b)).In fact, it appears that at least in RCRA, where Congress meant to precludethe Agency from using nonrulemaking procedures when granting variances,it said so explicitly. (See RCRA section 3001(f)) that mandates use ofinformal rulemaking procedures for processing delisting petitions.) Inother contexts, most notably RCRA sections 3004(o)(2) and 3005(j) (2),(3), (4), and (13), Congress itself explicitly authorized nonrulemakingprocedures for granting other types of variances. It thus appears to theAgency that the brief reference to ``regulations'' in section 3004(m)(1)does not preclude the use of nonrulemaking procedures to grant individualvariances to an already promulgated treatment standard. Therefore, today's final rule promulgates modifications to 40 CFR 268.44that allow a site-specific variance from the treatment standard, havingno generic applicability and effect, to be granted through nonrulemakingprocedures. The Agency agrees as a matter of policy to allow opportunityfor public notice and comment prior to granting a nonrulemaking variancefrom the treatment standard. Because circumstances under which one mightapply for a site-specific variance vary, vehicles for public comment willbe specified on a case-by-case basis. The Agency received no requests for variances from the treatment standardspromulgated in the solvents and dioxins final rule or the California listfinal rule. It is difficult to predict how many requests for variancesfrom the treatment standard will be received as a result of today's finalrule. Therefore, the Agency is not establishing a specific format for thevariance or specifying vehicles for providing public comment at this time.Since the goal of granting site-specific variances from the treatment standardthrough nonrulemaking procedures is to streamline the process, the Agencywill likely provide for public comment through existing public participationvehicles such as permit applications or modifications, CERCLA RemedialInvestigation/Feasibility Study documents, or other relevant proceduresas appropriate. In cases when there is no existing proceeding which providesthe opportunity for public participation, EPA will provide opportunityfor notice and comment through publication in local newspapers, by radiobroadcast, or through other media, similar to the variance procedures alreadyin place under andSection; 260.33. If necessary, the Agency will issue guidanceat a later date on the format for an application and will specify proceduresfor public comment. The criteria by which a nonrulemaking site-specific variance from the treatmentstandard will be evaluated remain the same as those previously promulgated.The demonstration should be made that the waste is significantly differentfrom the wastes evaluated in establishing the treatment standard and cannotbe treated in compliance with the applicable treatment standard. On a site-specificbasis, it may be possible to determine that BDAT treatment is inappropriatefor a particular waste stream. For example, incineration of large volumesof contaminated soil under certain site-specific conditions may be foundto be inappropriate treatment. Such an assertion should be supported byanalytical data and treatability studies to the greatest extent possible.Each request for a variance from the treatment standard must include astatement signed by the authorized representative of the applicant certifyingthat the information is correct. The applicant must apply to the Assistant Administrator for the Officeof Solid Waste and Emergency Response, addressing the criteria containedin andSection; 268.44. The authority for granting site-specific variancesto the treatment standard may be delegated to the Regional Administratorin the future, at which time the application would be made to the RegionalAdministrator in the region where the applicant is located. The Assistant Administrator (or Regional Administrator, if authority isdelegated) will evaluate the application and issue a draft notice tentativelygranting or denying the application. Notification of this tentative decisionwill be provided by newspaper advertisement or radio broadcast in the localitywhere the applicant is located. The Assistant Administrator (or RegionalAdministrator, if authority is delegated) will accept comment on the tentativedecision, usually for 30 days. Public hearings may be held upon requestor at his discretion. A final decision will be made after evaluation ofcomments.L. Rationale for Immediate Effective Date The regulations promulgated today will be effective immediately exceptwhere the Agency has specified a national variance or otherwise specifiedan alternative effective date. HSWA requires that today's regulations becomeeffective on or before the August 8, 1988 effective date of the restrictionson the first one-third of the wastes scheduled pursuant to RCRA section3004(g)(4)(A). If the Agency fails to promulgate regulations for any ofthese wastes by the statutory effective date, the restrictions on disposalof the waste in a landfill or surface impoundment, stipulated in section3004(g)(6)(A) take effect automatically on August 8, 1988. If the Agencyhas not promulgated treatment standards for any scheduled waste by May8, 1990, that waste is prohibited from all forms of land disposal unlessa generator has been granted an extension of the effective date (eithera national variance or a case-by-case extension) or a ``no migration''finding has been made. Hence, August 8, 1988, is the latest date for EPAto promulgate regulations that will prevent the ``soft hammer'' in section3004(g) from falling for all First Third wastes. Section 3004(h) requiresthat regulations established under sections 3004 (d), (e), (f), or (g)be effective immediately upon promulgation. Furthermore, section 3004(m)specifies that regulations setting treatment standards must have the sameeffective date as applicable regulations established under sections 3004(d), (e), (f), or (g). For today's regulations which set treatment standardsand are promulgated under section 3004(g), this date will be August 8,1988. Since the statute clearly states that the regulations implementingsection 3004(g) must go into effect on or before August 8, 1988, in orderto prevent the ``soft hammer'' from falling, EPA finds that good causeexists under section 3010(b)(3) to have an immediate effective date. Forthe same reason, EPA finds that good cause also exists under section 553(d)(3)of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(3), to waivethe requirements that regulations be published at least 30 days beforethe effective date. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Modifications to the Land Disposal Restrictions Framework </ITAG>Today's final rule does two things. First, it promulgates the Agency'sapproach to restricting the land disposal of First Third wastes, presentingthe conditions under which land disposal of these wastes may be continued.Second, it modifies the existing framework of the Land Disposal RestrictionsProgram, as first promulgated on November 7, 1986 (51 FR 40572) and subsequentlymodified in the July 8, 1987 California list final rule (52 FR 25760).Unless otherwise specified, these modifications will apply to all restrictedwastes. This section of today's preamble summarizes these modificationsand refers to more detailed discussions in other sections of this preamble.A. General Waste Analysis (andSection;andSection; 264.13 and 265.13) The Agency is promulgating modifications to andSection;andSection; 264.13 and265.13 to reflect provisions for the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastesin surface impoundments. The framework promulgated November 7, 1986 providedfor an exemption allowing treatment of restricted wastes in section 3005(j)(11)surface impoundments, provided that residuals that do not meet the treatmentstandard are removed annually. As discussed in section III.C.4., this exemptionis extended to allow for wastes subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions(i.e., First Third wastes for which no treatment standard has been established).EPA is also making certain nonsubstantive modifications to make these sectionsmore readable. B. Operating Record (andSection;andSection; 264.73 and 265.73) The Agency is modifying andSection;andSection; 264.73 and 265.73 to requireretention of the andSection; 268.8 demonstration and certification, i.e.the certifications applicable to ``soft hammer'' wastes. EPA is also requiringfacilities to retain the new tracking notice required under andSection; 268.7for generators sending ``soft hammer'' wastes to receiving facilities,and for treatment facilities sending ``soft hammer'' wastes to a disposalfacility. The ``soft hammer'' notice and certification is discussed furtherin sections III.B.2. and III.C.3. respectively. C. Recyclable Materials Used in a Manner Constituting Disposal (andSection;266.20) The Agency is amending andSection; 266.20 to require that hazardous waste-derivedproducts whose placement on the land was previously exempt from Federalregulation must now meet the applicable Subpart D treatment standard (or3004(d) prohibition levels) prior to such placement. EPA is, however, allowingfor one exception to this requirement; namely, K061-derived fertilizers.See section III. I. for a discussion of the Agency's determination concerningthis amendment. D. Purpose, Scope, and Applicability (andSection; 268.1) The Agency is modifying andSection; 268.1 to include the ``soft hammer''wastes in the applicability of the land disposal restrictions, and to allowthe disposal of such wastes in landfill and surface impoundment units meetingthe minimum technological requirements provided such wastes are the subjectof a valid certification under andSection; 268.8. EPA is also clarifyingthe applicability of Part 268 treatment standards to prohibited wastesgenerated from CERCLA response actions. E. Treatment in Surface Impoundment Exemption (andSection; 268.4) The modifications to the requirements of andSection; 268.4 reflect the specialconditions for allowing this exemption to apply to First Third wastes forwhich no treatment standards have been established. Certain nonsubstantivemodifications have also been made to improve the readability of the section.The conditions relating to the disposal of ``soft hammer'' wastes are discussedin section III.C.4. F. Case-by-Case Extensions (andSection; 268.5) The modification to andSection; 268.5 reflects the Agency's new interpretationof RCRA section 3004(h)(4), that wastes subject to a national or case by-caseextension of the effective date, if disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment,must be disposed in a <T3>unit</T3> that meets the minimum technological requirements. EPA'searlier interpretation was that Congress intended such wastes to be disposedin a <T3>facility </T3>that meets the minimum technological requirements of3004(o) (applicable only to new, replacement, or lateral expansion units).The discussion for this modification is found in section III.D. G. ``No Migration'' Petitions (andSection; 268.6) As discussed in section III.F., the Agency is modifying the existing requirementsfor petitioning EPA for a ``no migration'' exemption under andSection; 268.6.This modification promulgates additional demonstrations required in a ``nomigration'' petition, and certain other requirements on the owner or operatorof a waste management unit that is subject to a ``no migration'' exemption.H. Testing and Recordkeeping (andSection; 268.7) The modifications to andSection; 268.7 extend the notification and certificationrequirements to include the First Third wastes, including a new notificationfor ``soft hammer'' wastes. EPA is also applying the recordkeeping requirementsof this section to treatment and storage facilities not previously includedin the ``cradle-to-grave'' paper trail, including an additional changeaddressing wastes that may be land disposed under an extension, exemption,or variance. Also, a 5-year record retention period is being promulgated.The discussion for these proposed modifications is found in Section III.B. Also, as discussed in section III.I., the Agency is modifying the trackingsystem to account for zinc-containing fertilizers which use K061 as aningredient, which EPA has exempted from regulation. Testing requirements for wastes in andSection; 268.43 (i.e., wastes for whichthe treatment standards are expressed as concentration levels in the waste,rather than in the waste extract) are being promulgated. And finally, othernonsubstantive modifications are being made to improve the readabilityof this section. I. Landfill and Surface Impoundment Disposal Restrictions (andSection; 268.8)The Agency is promulgating a new section 268.8 which addresses the prohibitionon disposal of First Third wastes for which treatment standards have notbeen established. An extensive discussion in section III.C. presents theAgency's approach to implementing RCRA section 3004(g)(6)(A), which isapplicable to the disposal of such wastes in landfills and surface impoundments,and also promulgates EPA's approach to the type of information which mustbe supplied and certified prior to such disposal. J. Identification of Wastes to Be Evaluated By May 8, 1990 (andSection; 268.12)As discussed in Section III.C.3., the Agency is amending andSection; 268.12to move certain First Third wastewater residuals from treatment for whichwastewater treatment standards have not been set into the Third Third.Similarly, the Agency is also moving ``soft hammer'' leachate and groundwater contaminated with ``soft hammer'' wastes into the Third Third. Thisaction is taken due to the relatively low intrinsic hazard of these wastesand to avoid discouraging substantial treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes.Also, as discussed in section III.A.4., the Agency is moving one classof First Third wastes to the third third of the schedule_mixed hazardous/radioactivewastes. EPA emphasizes that this action only affects First Third wastesmixed with radioactive wastes. Waste mixtures containing spent solvents,dioxins and California list wastes are subject to the applicable land disposalrestrictions. K. Determination as to the Availability of the Two-Year Nationwide Variancefor Solvent Wastes Which Contain Less Than 1% Total F001 F005 Solvent Constituents(andSection; 268.30) In a June 4, 1987 technical correction notice 52 FR 21010) to the November7, 1986 final rule prohibiting land disposal of certain spent solvent anddioxin-containing hazardous wastes, EPA promulgated an amendment to andSection;268.30(a)(3) reclarifying that solvent wastes that are prohibited in thehands of their initial generator_i.e., that are not subject to any applicablevariance_cannot be permissibly land disposed until treated to meet thesection 268.41 treatment standards. This principle applies to all residuesfrom treatment (unless they are part of a different treatability groupfor which EPA has determined that no treatment capacity exists (see 52FR 21012; June 4, 1987 and also 52 FR 22356-22357; June 11, 1987)). Becausequestions have been raised regarding the policy basis for the action, andbecause the underlying principle is an important one which warrants thefullest consideration, EPA reproposed amended andSection; 268.30(a)(3) aspart of the April 8 proposal (53 FR 11770). EPA did not receive comment on this proposal and thus is promulgating therule as proposed for the reasons stated in the April 8, proposal. In repromulgatingregulatory language, the Agency never withdrew its existing regulation.The Agency notes, however, that its earlier actions on this issue wereprospective only (see 52 FR 21010, stating that the revisions are effectiveon June 4, 1987). Thus, the June 4, 1987 revisions to andSection; 268.30(a)(3)have no applicability to any certifications made before that date or toany treatment residues land disposed before that date (see 52 FR 21012,June 4, 1987 (item andplusmin; 16); <T3>id. </T3>at 21017 (item andplusmin; 62)). L. Waste Specific Prohibitions (andSection;andSection; 268.30, 268.31, 268.32,and 268.33) Sections 268.30, 268.31, and 268.32 are being modified to reflect the reinterpertationof RCRA section 3004(h)(4), pertaining to the disposal of restricted wastesgranted an extension of the effective date, as discussed in Section III.D.Also andSection; 268.32 is changed to rescind the previously granted nationalvariance for California list halogenated organic compounds. For a detaileddiscussion of this rescission, see Section III.H. Although EPA is republishingcertain other language from these regulations, this is for the readersconvenience and is not intended to reopen these provisions for judicialreview (nor did EPA solicit or receive any comment on these provisions).Section 268.33 promulgates the actual prohibitions on the land disposalof First Third wastes (wastes listed in andSection; 268.10) for which EPAhas established treatment standards, and also establishes effective datesbased on the availability of capacity to treat these wastes. Section III.A.describes the development of these treatment standards, and section III.C.presents the capacity data and assumptions on which the effective datesare based. Section 268.33(f) promulgates the prohibitions placed on ``softhammer'' wastes, as discussed in section III.C. It should be noted that the schedules for wastes K019 and K025 (SecondThird wastes listed in andSection; 268.11) have been accelerated to includethese wastes in the First Third. K100 (a Third Third waste listed in andSection;268.12) is also included in the First Third. M. Treatment Standards (andSection;andSection; 268.40, 268.41, 268.42, and268.43) Treatment standards, expressed as concentration levels in both the waste(andSection; 268.43, as expressed in a new Table CCW) and in a waste extractdeveloped by using the TCLP (andSection; 268.42), are promulgated by amendmentsto Subpart D. The existing treatment standard as a specified method (incineration)for certain California list halogenated organic compounds is being modifiedto allow for burning in industrial boilers or furnaces (andSection; 268.42).Also, EPA is modifying the F001-F005 treatment standard for methylene chloridein wastewaters generated by the pharmaceutical industry. The new treatmentstandards are discussed in section III.A. N. Variance from the Treatment Standard (andSection; 268.44) Today's final rule promulgates modifications to 40 CFR 268.44 that allowa site-specific determination to grant a variance from the treatment standardhaving no generic applicability and effect to be made by nonrulemakingprocedures. A detailed discussion of this approach is found in sectionIII.K. O. Storage Prohibition (andSection; 268.50) Only a slight modification to the existing storage prohibition in andSection;268.50 is promulgated to account for the Agency's interpretation of RCRAsection 3004(j), as applicable to ``soft hammer'' wastes which are thesubject of a certification under andSection; 268.8. This interpretation ispresented in section III.C.6. of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. State Authority </ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under RCRA sections 3008, 3013, and 7003although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. Thestandards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR Part 271.Prior to HSWA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardouswaste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in thatState. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State,and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim. Today's rule is promulgated pursuant to sections 3004 (d) through (k),and (m), of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6924 (d) through (k), and (m)). Therefore,it has been added to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federalprogram requirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and take effectin all States, regardless of their authorization status. States may applyfor either interim or final authorization for the HSWA provisions in Table1, as discussed in the following section. Table 2 in andSection; 271.1(j)is modified to indicate that this rule is a self implementing provisionof HSWA for the Land Disposal Restrictions for the First Third of ScheduledWastes. B. Effect on State Authorizations As noted above, EPA will implement today's rule in authorized States untiltheir programs are modified to adopt these rules and the modification isapproved by EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to HSWA, a Statesubmitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim orfinal authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications foreither interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. Itshould be noted that HSWA interim authorization will expire on January1, 1993 (see section 271.24(c)). Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. State programmodifications must be made by July 1, 1991, if only regulatory changesare necessary or July 1, 1992, if statutory changes are necessary. Thesedeadlines can be extended in exceptional cases (see andSection; 271.21(e)(3)).States with authorized RCRA programs may have requirements similar to thosein today's rule. These State regulations have not been assessed againstthe Federal regulations being promulgated today to determine whether theymeet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implementthese requirements in lieu of EPA until the State program modificationis approved. Of course, States with existing standards may continue toadminister and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementingthe Federal program, EPA will work with States under cooperative agreementsto minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able todefer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs ratherthan take separate actions under Federal authority. States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these standards in their applications.However, the State must modify its program by the deadlines set forth inandSection; 271.21(c). States that submit official applications for finalauthorization 12 months after the effective date of these standards mustinclude standards equivalent to these standards in their application. Section271.3 sets forth the requirements a State must meet when submitting itsfinal authorization application. The amendments being promulgated today need not affect the State's UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) primacy status. A State currently authorized toadminister the UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) maycontinue to do so without seeking authority to administer these amendments.However, a State desiring to implement Part 148 and to receive authorizationto grant exemptions from the land disposal restrictions must demonstratethat it has the requisite authority to administer sections 3004 (f) and(g) of RCRA. The conditions under which such authorization may take placeare summarized in section C. A further discussion must be found in theJuly 15, 1985 final rule 50 FR 28728. C. State Implementation State implementation of today's rule is affected by the following fouraspects of the framework established for the land disposal restrictions(51 FR 40572). 1. Under Part 268, Subpart C, EPA is promulgating land disposal restrictionsfor all generators, treaters, storers, and disposers of certain types ofhazardous waste. In order to retain authorization, States must adopt theregulations under this Subpart since State requirements can be no lessstringent than Federal requirements. 2. Also under Part 268, EPA is granting two-year national variances fromthe land disposal restrictions effective date for certain wastes, basedon a lack of alternative treatment or recovery capacity. In addition, case-by-caseextensions of the effective date may be granted for up to one year (renewablefor one additional year) to specific applicants lacking adequate alternativecapacity. The Administrator of EPA is solely responsible for granting variances tothe effective dates because capacity determinations must be made on a nationwidebasis. In addition, RCRA section 3004(h)(3) specifies that the Administratorwill grant or deny case-by-case extensions, after consulting the affectedStates, on the basis of national concerns; therefore, States cannot beauthorized for this aspect of the program.3. Under andSection; 268.44, the Agency may grant waste-specific or site-specificvariances from treatment standards in cases where it can be demonstratedthat the treatment standard is inappropriate for the waste or the wastescannot be treated to specified levels or treated by specified methods.The Agency is solely responsible for granting such variances since theresult of such an action may be the establishment of new waste treatabilitygroups applicable to all wastes meeting the new criteria. Therefore, thisaspect of the program is not delegated to the States. Similarly, the authorityto grant nonrulemaking variances is retained by the EPA. 4. Under andSection; 268.6, EPA may grant petitions of specific durationto allow land disposal of certain hazardous wastes where it can be demonstratedthat there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long asthe waste remains hazardous. States which have the authority to imposerestrictions may be authorized under RCRA section 3006 to grant petitionsfor exemptions from the restrictions. Decisions on site-specific petitionsdo not require the national perspective required to restrict wastes orgrant extensions. However, the Agency is planning to propose an interpretationof the ``no migration'' language in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public comment. Because of the controversysurrounding the interpretation of the statutory language, and the potentialfor changes in policy, EPA will be handling ``no migration'' petitionsat Headquarters, though the States may be authorized to grant these petitionsin the future. The Agency expects to gain valuable experience and informationfrom review of ``no migration'' petitions which may affect future landdisposal restrictions rulemakings. In accordance with RCRA section 3004(i),EPA will publish notice of the Agency's final decision on petitions inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Effect of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program on Other EnvironmentalPrograms </ITAG>A. Discharges Regulated Under the Clean Water Act As a result of the land disposal restrictions program, some generatorsmight switch from land disposal of restricted First Third wastes to dischargeto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in order to avoid incurring thecosts of alternative treatment. In shifting from land disposal to dischargeto POTWs, an increase in human and environmental risks could occur. Alsoas a result of the land disposal restrictions, hazardous waste generatorsmight illegally discharge their wastes to surface waters without treatment,which could cause damage to the local ecosystem and potentially pose healthrisks from direct exposure or bioaccumulation. Some generators might treat their wastes prior to discharging to a POTW,but the treatment step itself could increase risks to the environment.For example, if incineration were the pretreatment step, metals and otherhazardous constituents present in air scrubber waters could be dischargedto surface waters. However, the amount of First Third waste shifted toPOTWs would be limited by such factors as the physical form of the waste,the degree of pretreatment required prior to discharge, and State and localregulations. B. Discharges Regulated Under the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct (MPRSA) Management of some First Third wastes could be shifted from land disposalto ocean dumping and ocean based incineration. If the cost of ocean-baseddisposal plus transportation were lower than the cost of land based treatment,disposal, and transportation, this option could become an attractive alternative.In addition, ocean-based disposal could become attractive to the regulatedcommunity if land-based treatment were not available. Although there may be economic incentives to manage restricted First Thirdwastes by ocean dumping and ocean-based incineration, both technologiesrequire permits, which could be issued only if technical requirements (e.g.,physical form and heating value) and MPRSA environmental criteria (e.g.,constituent concentrations, toxicity, solubility, density, and persistence)were met. MPRSA requires that nine specific factors, including the availabilityand impacts of land based disposal alternatives, be considered before permitscan be issued for ocean disposal. C. Air Emissions Regulated under RCRA Some treatment technologies applicable to First Third wastes could resultin cross-media transfer of hazardous constituents to air. For example,incineration of metal-bearing wastes could result in metal emissions toair. Some constituents, such as chromium, can be more toxic if inhaledthan if ingested. Therefore, it might be necessary to issue regulatorycontrols for some technologies to ensure they are operated properly. The Agency has taken several steps to address this issue. EPA has initiateda program to address metal emissions from incinerators. It has also initiatedtwo rule-makings under section 3004(n) to address air emissions from othersources. The first rule-making will address emissions from equipment suchas pumps, valves, and vents from units processing concentrated organicwaste streams. The second rule-making will address other sources of airemissions, such as tanks and waste transfer and handling.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose </ITAG>The Agency estimated the costs, economic impacts, and benefits of today'sfinal rule. This analysis is required for ``major'' regulations as definedby Executive Order No. 12291. (See the discussion of E.O. No. 12291 below.)The Agency is also required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act to assesssmall business impacts resulting from the proposed rule. The cost and economicimpact estimates serve, additionally, as measures of the practical capabilityof facilities to comply with the proposed rule. The results indicate that today's final rule is a major rule. This sectionof the preamble discusses the results of the analysis of the final ruleas detailed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the final rule.The RIA is available in the public docket. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Executive Order No. 12291 </ITAG>Executive Order No. 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of proposedAgency actions and alternatives during the development of regulations.Such an assessment consists of a quantification of the potential costs,economic impacts, and benefits of the rule, as well as a description ofany beneficial or adverse effects that cannot be quantified in monetaryterms. In addition, Executive Order No. 12291 requires that regulatoryagencies prepare a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for major rules. Majorrules are defined as those likely to result in: andbullet; An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individualindustries; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation, or international trade. The Agency has prepared an RIA and has concluded that the final rule isa major rule with an annual cost to the economy of $907-962 million. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Basic Approach </ITAG>EPA is proposing to set treatment standards for a subset of the First ThirdF and K wastes and to let ``soft hammers'' fall on the remaining FirstThird wastes. The ``soft hammer'' provisions place restrictions on theland disposal of First Third wastes for which no treatment standards havebeen set by August 8, 1988. The ``soft hammer'' provisions will be in effectuntil prohibitions on land disposal (``hard hammers'') fall (on May 8,1990) or for a shorter period if treatment standards are promulgated. Thepossible effects of prohibitions on land disposal of wastes and of laterextensions of the effective date were not examined as part of this analysis.The ``soft hammer'' provisions are discussed in greater detail in sectionIII. C. of this preamble. EPA estimated the costs, benefits, and potential economic impacts of thefinal rule and of one major regulatory alternative to it. Only the impactsof the final rule are presented here; results for the regulatory alternativeare discussed in the RIA. Provisions of the final rule, as analyzed in the RIA, are as follows: andbullet; Treatment standards are established for certain F and K wastes,and andbullet; ``Soft hammer'' provisions apply to remaining First Third wastes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Two ``soft hammer'' scenarios for the final rule were examined: andbullet; Scenario 1: ``soft hammers'' fall on remaining First Third wastesand treatment capacity is assumed not to exist; therefore, these wastesmay continue to be land disposed. Landfills and surface impoundments receiving``soft hammer'' wastes must meet minimum technological requirements. andbullet; Scenario 2: ``soft hammers'' fall on remaining First Third wastesand treatment capacity is assumed to exist; therefore, these wastes mustmeet ``approximate treatment standards'' (treatment that will reduce themobility and toxicity of hazardous constituents), and the treatment residualsmust be disposed of in units meeting minimum technological requirements(except where the residuals are exempt from regulation).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">While neither scenario corresponds exactly to the proposed rule, itwas assumed that the two scenarios would establish upper and lower boundson the effects of the final rule. It was assumed that the ``soft hammer''requirements would not affect wastes managed in waste piles or in landtreatment units, since the only requirement for facilities managing thesewastes would be notification. The effects of the final rule were estimated by comparing post-regulatorycosts, benefits, and economic impacts with those resulting under baselineconditions (i.e., in the absence of the regulation). The baseline is definedto be continued land disposal of wastes in units meeting minimum technologicalrequirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Methodology </ITAG>a. <T3>Determination of Affected Wastes and Facilities. </T3>The first stepin estimating the impacts of the rule was to determine which wastes andfacilities would be affected by the rule. Based on waste characterizationand volume data primarily from the 1986 ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities'' (the TSDRSurvey), EPA identified affected wastes and facilities. (See Section III.H. for a discussion of this procedure.) The average quantity of waste contributedby generator facilities was based on EPA's ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Generators and Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities RegulatedUnder RCRA in 1981.'' The population of wastes that would be affected by the rule may includesome wastes from CERCLA responses or RCRA corrective actions; however,there are insufficient data at present to estimate these quantities. Also,underground injected wastes were excluded from this analysis since thesewastes will be dealt with in the RIA for a separate rule. The population of affected facilities includes: andbullet; Hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities withcommercial management processes (``commercial TSDFs''), which charge afee for hazardous waste management; andbullet; TSDFs with only non-commercial processes (``non-commercial TSDFs''),which provide management services for wastes generated on-site or off-siteby firms under the same ownership; and andbullet; Large and small quantity generators (``generators''), which sendtheir waste off-site to commercial TSDFs for management. b. <T3>Cost Methodology. </T3>Once waste types, quantities, and baseline andpost-regulatory management methods were known for the population of affectedfacilities, EPA developed estimates of baseline and post regulatory costsfor the facilities. In estimating the costs, wastes at a facility thatwere amenable to co-management were grouped to identify economies of scale.Baseline and post-regulatory costs include both on-site and off-site managementcosts. On-site management costs are comprised of two parts: operation andmaintenance (Oandamp;M) costs and capital costs. Oandamp;M costs are incurredannually for operation and maintenance of waste treatment or disposal units.Capital costs include costs for construction and depreciable assets; thesecosts are restated as annual values by using a capital recovery factorbased on a real interest rate of five percent. The annualized capital costsare added to yearly Oandamp;M costs to derive overall annual baseline orpost-regulatory costs for facilities. By taking the difference betweenthe annualized baseline and post-regulatory costs, annualized incrementalcosts for facilities were estimated. Off-site management costs are based on commercial hazardous waste managementprices. Shipping costs were included for wastes sent off-site. c. <T3>Economic Impact Methodology_</T3>(1) <T3>Non-Commercial TSDFs. </T3>To assess economic impacts, EPA convertedthe before-tax incremental costs for facilities from the cost analysisto after-tax compliance costs. Compliance costs were then compared withfacility financial information, organized by Standard Industrial Classification(SIC) code and facility size, to gauge impacts. (See Section C for references.)Two ratios were used to identify facilities likely to experience adverseeconomic effects: andbullet; Compliance cost divided by cost of production (the COP ratio),and andbullet; Cash from operations divided by compliance cost (the CFO ratio).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These ratios bound possible effects on individual firms by lookingat what would happen with complete pass-through of compliance costs tocustomers and with no pass-through of costs. The COP ratio represents thepercent product price increase for facility output that occurs if the entirecompliance cost_accompanied by facility profit_is passed through to customersin the form of higher prices. A change exceeding five percent is consideredto imply a substantial adverse economic effect on a facility. The CFO ratiorepresents the number of times that a facility's gross margin covers theregulatory compliance cost if the facility fully absorbs the cost. Forthis ratio, a value of less than 20 is considered to represent a significantadverse effect.Once facilities experiencing adverse economic effects were identified usingthe two ratios, an analysis was performed to identify which of these facilitieswould be likely to close. Economic effects on individual facilities wereexamined assuming that product price increases of five percent were possible.Those facilities for which the CFO ratio was less than two were consideredlikely to close. (2) <T3>Commercial TSDFs. </T3>For this group of facilities, the analysis ofeconomic effects was qualitative. This analysis included an examinationof the quantity of waste each facility received as a percentage of thewastes restricted by today's rule. (3) <T3>Generators. </T3>EPA's analysis of the economic impacts of this ruleon generators disposing of affected wastes off-site assumed that commercialTSDFs could entirely pass on to generators the costs of compliance (inthe form of higher prices for waste management services). Because of datalimitations, EPA used a different approach to estimate economic impactsfor generators than it used for non-commercial TSDFs. This approach basedcompliance costs on average waste quantities shipped from generators tocommercial facilities and then compared those compliance costs with averagefinancial data for the generators in order to assess impacts. The sameimpact measures used to assess impacts on non-commercial TSDFs were usedto gauge impacts on generators. d. <T3>Benefits Methodology. </T3>The benefits of today's rule were evaluatedby considering the reduction in human health risk that would result fromusing alternative treatment for First Third wastes rather than employingbaseline land disposal practices. Human health risk is defined herein asthe probability of injury, disease, or death over a given time (70 years)due to responses to doses of disease-causing agents. The human health riskposed by a waste management practice is a function of the toxicity of thechemical constituents in the waste stream and the extent of human exposureto the constituents. The likelihood of exposure is dictated by hydrogeologicand climatic settings at land disposal units and the fate and transportof chemical constituents in environmental media. EPA estimated human health risk in four steps. The first step was to estimatethe concentrations of each of the hazardous constituents of the waste streamin each of the three media (air, surface water, and ground water) intowhich they might be released by a certain waste management technology.These estimates depend on the steady-state (i.e., continuous) release ratescalculated for each technology, and on environmental fate and transportcharacteristics for constituents. The next step was to estimate the total human intake, or dose, of eachof the chemicals through inhalation of air or ingestion of ground wateror surface water. A 65 kilogram person was assumed to be continuously exposedto contaminated media over a 70-year lifetime. The Agency next calculated the risk to an individual from the dose derivedin the previous step. For carcinogenic constituents within a wastestream,a dose-response curve was used to estimate the risk. For non-carcinogenicconstituents, the exposure concentration was compared with the health-effectsthreshold to determine whether exposure above the threshold had occurred.Finally, EPA estimated the population risk for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenicconstituents within a wastestream. Population risk for carcinogenic constituentswas determined by multiplying the average individual risk by the numberof people in a given environment. Population risk for non-carcinogenicconstituents was based on the number of persons exposed to concentrationsexceeding the health-effects thresholds. Benefits other than reduction in human health risk_such as resource damageavoided and corrective action costs avoided_were not quantified. Sincethese other benefits are likely to be significant, the benefits presentedhere are probably understated. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Results </ITAG>a. <T3>Population of Affected Facilities. </T3>The number of facilities affectedunder Scenarios 1 and 2 for the final rule is very similar, as shown inTable 1. Most of the affected facilities are generators. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,10,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Number of Affected Facilities </T4><H1>  </H1><H1>Final rule </H1><H2>Scenario 1 </H2><H2>Scenario 2</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Commercial TSDFs <D>35 </D><D>35 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-Commercial TSDFs <D>102 </D><D>102 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Generators <D>1,593 </D><D>1,568</D><R>n,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>1,730 </D><D>1,705</D></ITAG> b. <T3>Costs. </T3>As shown in Table 2, the final rule is a major rule, withcosts of $907-962 million per year.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> Table </T4>2._<T4>Costs of the Final Rule (Annualized Incremental Cost in Millions of1987 Dollars) </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Final rule </H1><H2>Scenario l </H2><H2>Scenario 2</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Treatment of Certain F and K Wastes <D>907 </D><D>907 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">``Soft hammer'' on Remaining First Third Wastes <D>0 </D><D>55</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>907 </D><D>962</D></ITAG></ITAG> Most of the costs of the final rule are due to treatment of F and K wastes.The F and K wastes going to treatment are high-volume wastes; large portionsof the wastes are managed in landfills, land treatment units, or treatmentsurface impoundments in the baseline and go to incineration and/or stabilizationunder the final rule. The ash from incineration often requires stabilizationdue to the ash's metal content; the scrubber effluent from incinerationoften requires wastewater treatment to remove metals. The First Third wastes subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions, on theother hand, are generated in relatively small quantities and thereforedo not affect costs significantly. Their management under the final ruledepends on which scenario is considered. Under Scenario l, the wastes continueto be land disposed in units meeting minimum technological requirements.Under Scenario 2, the wastes are mostly incinerated; however, since thewastes are largely organic with little metal content, the ash from incinerationgenerally does not require stabilization. Under the final rule, the two ``soft hammer'' scenarios result in a significantdifference in cost. Scenario 1_continued land disposal of ``soft hammer''wastes_results in zero incremental cost over the baseline for ``soft hammer''wastes. Scenario 2_treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes under ``approximatetreatment standards''_results in an incremental cost of $55 million peryear. The costs associated with the ``soft hammer'' would be incurred forless than two years, i.e., until hard hammers fell, treatment standardswere established, or extensions to the effective date were granted.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>[Note: </T4>The costs presented in this section were based on incinerationas BDAT for K048-52.

The largest reductions under bothscenarios (150 cases) are treatment of K061 wastes (Emission Control Dust/Sludgefrom the Primary Production of Steel in Electric Furnaces). Restrictionson K048-K052 wastes (from the petroleum refining industry) result in adecrease of another 115 cancer cases.The reduction in number of persons exposed to a non-carcinogen at a concentrationabove its RFD ranges from 414 under Scenario l to 422 under Scenario 2.In this case, much of the benefit under both scenarios is due to K048,K049, K061, and mixtures of these wastes, acting through ground water exposure.Under both alternatives, the average carcinogenic risk to an individualin the population is reduced across all media by imposing land disposalrestrictions. Most of this reduction in average individual risk is attributableto reduction in exposure to arsenic via ground water.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, whenever an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking,it must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describesthe effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, smallorganizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). An RFA is unnecessary,however, if the Agency's Administrator certifies that the rule will nothave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.EPA believes that the final rule could potentially have a significant effecton a substantial number of small entities, and particularly generatorswho are small businesses. However, the Agency does not have sufficientdata to distinguish small business generators from large business generatorsor to identify alternatives for small businesses. The Agency did receiveextensive comments and some data on generators of F006, a substantial numberof whom are small entities. Therefore, EPA has conducted a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis for facilities affected by the standards for F006 wastes.When EPA proposed this rule, it concluded that there would not be a substantialimpact on a significant number of small entities. Since the proposal, EPAhas conducted additional analysis of small business impacts. That analysisindicated that six of the nine non-commercial TSDFs that are small businesseswould be significantly impacted. EPA does not consider six significantlyaffected facilities a substantial number of affected facilities.EPA's analysis of small business impacts did not address commercial TSDFsor generators. Without an evaluation of impacts on generators, which representover 90 percent of all facilities that manage First Third wastes, no definitiveconclusions can be drawn on the potential impacts to small businesses.It is reasonable to expect that, since 60-71 percent of generators overallare significantly affected, there may be substantial impact on small businessgenerators. However, EPA has no data to support this premise due to thelack of information on which generators are small businesses.In order to determine whether alternatives are available to minimize impactson small businesses, it is necessary to identify those wastes generatedby small business generators that are most likely affected by the finalrule. Based on concerns expressed in the comments, it appears that thetreatment standards for F006 wastes from electroplating operations couldimpact small business generators significantly. Therefore, the Agency hasexamined three alternatives to minimize the estimated impact on small businessesgenerating F006 wastes. The Agency recognizes that small businesses inother industries may also be affected significantly.The first alternative considered was not to set treatment standards forF006, and to allow the ``soft hammer'' provisions to apply instead. Underthis alternative, generators could continue to dispose untreated F006 wastesin landfills and impoundments until May 1990 provided appropriate treatmentcapacity was not practically available. However, if appropriate treatmentwas practically available, the generator would be obliged to obtain thattreatment before land disposing the waste (assuming these wastes are disposedin landfills or impoundments). Because the treatment standards for F006wastes were based on a widely available form of stabilization, it appearsunlikely that small business generators could successfully demonstratethat appropriate treatment is not practical or is not available. (Notethat part of the commenters concerns on F006 arose because a major wastetreatment firm, whose stabilization data formed the basis for the proposedstandard, later determined that the levels achieved in those tests couldnot be achieved routinely. However, this was determined to be true foronly two of the constituents_zinc and copper; for other reasons, the Agencyhas deleted zinc and copper from the F006 standards. Therefore, stabilizationas normally practiced by waste treatment and disposal firms should be capableof achieving the F006 standards. The firm which developed the originaltest data agrees with this conclusion.) Since this alternative only providesrelief for small business generators if treatment is not practically available,and it appears that appropriate treatment will be widely available forF006 wastes, this alternative will not be effective in providing reliefto small business generators.The second alternative considered was to set treatment standards, but togrant a two-year extension of the effective date based on lack of treatmentcapacity. While this alternative could provide relief to small entitiesfor the two-year extension period, the Agency cannot legally grant thisextension for reasons other than limited capacity. As noted above, stabilizationcapacity is widely available. The Agency's recently completed capacityanalysis indicates that the amount of available stabilization capacityexceeds the amount needed for First Third wastes. Thus, the Agency cannotmake the finding of insufficient capacity necessary to support an extensionof the effective date.The third alternative considered was to alter the treatment standards forF006 wastes. As noted, the Agency has deleted copper and zinc from thestandards; this change should ensure that well-designed and well-operatedstabilization will achieve the treatment standards. Any further changein the treatment standards would require a change in the BDAT upon whichthe standard is based. Alternative BDAT technologies that fulfill the mandateof the statute are likely to be more costly to the small business generators,rather than less. Less costly technologies, such as dewatering and sludgedrying, do not fulfill the requirement that treatment achieve significantreductions in toxicity and mobility of hazardous constituents. Therefore,this alternative does not minimize impacts on small entities.Based on this examination of the alternatives, the Agency has concludedthat there are not practical and legally available alternatives to minimizepossible impacts on small business generators of F006 wastes.C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3> and have been assigned OMB control Number 2050-0085. Reportingand recordkeeping burden on the public for this collection is estimatedat 10,745 hours for the 19,679 respondents, with an average of 0.55 hoursper response. These burden estimates include all aspects of the collectioneffort and may include time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing andreviewing the collection of information, etc. If an interested party wishes to submit comments regarding any aspect ofthis collection of information, including suggestions for reducing theburden, or would like a copy of the information collection request (pleasereference ICR andplusmin;1442), contact Rick Westlund, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW.,Washington, DC 20460 (202) 382-2745; and Marcus Peacock, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503. The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on theinformation collection requirements contained in this proposal. D. Review of Supporting Documents The primary source of information on current land disposal practices andindustries affected by this rule was EPA's 1986 ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal and Recycling Facilities'' (the TSDRSurvey). The average quantity of waste contributed by generator facilitieswas obtained from EPA's ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generatorsand Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities Regulated Under RCRA in1981'' (April 1984). Waste stream characterization data and engineering costs of waste managementwere based on the following EPA documents: andbullet; ``Characterization of Waste Streams Listed in 40 CFR Section 261Waste Profiles,'' Vols. I and II (August 1985);andbullet; ``Characterization of Constituents from Selected Waste StreamsListed in 40 CFR Section 261,'' Vols I and II (August 1985); andbullet; RCRA background and listing documents for 40 CFR Section 261;andbullet; RCRA Section 3007 industry studies; andbullet; ``RCRA Risk-Cost Analysis Model, Appendix A: Waste Stream DataBase'' (March 1984); and andbullet; Source assessment documents for various industries. andbullet; ``1986-1987 Survey of Selected Firms in the Commercial HazardousWaste Management Industry: Final Report'' (March 1988). Financial information for the economic impact analysis was obtained fromthe 1982 Census of Manufacturers and 1984 Annual Survey of Manufacturers.Producer price indices were used to restate 1984 dollars in 1987 terms.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Implementation of the Part 268 Land Disposal Restrictions Program</ITAG>EPA has stated in earlier rules (see 51 FR 40572, November 7, 1986; 52FR 21010, June 4, 1987; 52 FR 25760, July 8, 1987) that ``restricted''wastes are subject to certain Part 268 requirements (e.g., the andSection;268.7 recordkeeping requirements and the andSection; 268.3 dilution prohibitions)even if such wastes are subject to an exemption, extension, or variancemaking them eligible for land disposal. The Agency has become aware ofsome confusion in the regulated community regarding this point. The confusionseems to have been created through the interchanging use, by both the regulatedcommunity and, in some instances, by EPA, of the terms ``restricted'' and``prohibited''. To eliminate this confusion, EPA clarified the distinctionbetween ``restricted'' and ``prohibited'' wastes in the May 17 proposal(53 FR 17620). For the benefit of the regulated community, the Agency isrepeating the clarification in today's rule. ``Restricted'' wastes are those categories of hazardous wastes that areprohibited from land disposal either by regulation or statute (regardlessof whether subcategories of such wastes are subject to a andSection; 268.5extension, andSection; 268.6, ``no migration'' exemption, or national capacityvariance, any of which makes them currently eligible for land disposal).In other words, a hazardous waste is ``restricted'' no later than the dateof the deadline established in, or pursuant to, RCRA section 3004. Therefore,the F001-F005 solvent wastes and the F020-F023 and F026-F028 dioxin-containingwastes were ``restricted'' as of November 8, 1986, despite the fact thatseveral subcategories of these wastes obtained 2-year national capacityvariances allowing them to be land disposed until November 8, 1988. Similarly,California list wastes were ``restricted'' as of July 8, 1987, despitethe fact that several subcategories of such wastes obtained 2-year nationalcapacity variances allowing continued land disposal until July 8, 1989.Wastes contained in the schedule of thirds (51 FR 19300, May 28, 1986)are considered ``restricted'' no later than the dates specified in theschedule promulgated at 40 CFR 268.10, 268.11, and 268.12. Generators must determine whether their wastes are ``restricted'' at thepoint of initial generation, i.e., when the waste is first considered ahazardous waste subject to RCRA regulation. To determine whether a hazardouswaste is ``restricted,'' generators need only determine whether the wastebelongs to a category of wastes that has been prohibited from land disposalby regulation or by the automatic ``hammer'' provisions of RCRA. ``Prohibited''wastes are a subset of ``restricted'' wastes, i.e., they are those ``restricted''wastes that are currently ineligible for land disposal. Therefore, a hazardouswaste that is not ``restricted'' cannot be ``prohibited'' under RCRA section3004. However, once a waste is considered ``restricted'', at least someof the Part 268 requirements apply.The first Part 268 requirement applicable to ``restricted'' wastes is thatgenerators must determine whether their waste currently is eligible forland disposal pursuant to the requirements of andSection; 268.7. If the wastecurrently is not eligible for land disposal (i.e., the prohibition effectivedate has passed, the waste does not meet all applicable treatment standardsor prohibition levels and no andSection; 268.5 extensions, andSection; 268.6``no migration'' exemption, or national capacity variances apply), thenthe waste currently is ``prohibited'' from land disposal as well as ``restricted''.If, however, the waste currently is eligible for land disposal (i.e., theprohibition effective date has passed but the waste meets the applicabletreatment standards or prohibition levels or is subject to a andSection;268.5 extension, andSection; 268.6 ``no migration'' exemption, or nationalcapacity variance) then the waste is considered ``restricted'' but notcurrently ``prohibited''. All wastes that are ``restricted'' must complywith the andSection; 268.3 dilution prohibition (assuming the wastes areland disposed or otherwise managed after the prohibition effective date),the andSection; 268.7 waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements, andall other applicable Part 268 requirements.As a result of the regulations promulgated today under Part 268, severaloptions will be available to the generator or owner or operator of a treatment,storage, and disposal facility for the management of restricted hazardouswastes. This section helps the regulated community determine the appropriatewaste management procedures. It provides references to the applicable 40CFR Parts 264 and 265 requirements as well as Part 268 requirements forimplementation of the various waste management options.All the sequences in the generator's decision-making process must commencewith a determination as to whether the hazardous waste is restricted inPart 268 Subpart C or RCRA section 3004(d). If the hazardous waste is notrestricted, it cannot be subject to the land disposal restrictions of Part268. It must nevertheless be managed in accordance with Parts 264 and 265.The generator of a restricted waste must determine the appropriate treatmentstandards (if any) under Part 268 Subpart D (or prohibitions under RCRAsection 3004(d)). The applicable treatment standards must be determinedat the point of initial generation prior to any treatment. (Of course,if in the course of managing the waste a new treatability group is created,for example a scrubber water from the incineration of a nonwastewater,the treatment standard applicable to this new treatability group will apply.)At this time, he must determine the effective date of the applicable treatmentstandard under Part 268 Subpart C. EPA has the authority to delay the effectivedates of the Part 268 treatment standards based on the unavailability ofadequate national treatment capacity. Determinations as to the adequacyof treatment capacity are based on the quantity of waste generated andthe availability of alternative treatment, recovery or disposal technologies.For these wastes where EPA has determined that alternative capacity isadequate, or has for whatever reason not established an alternate effectivedate, the treatment standards take effect immediately upon promulgation.The generator must use analysis of his waste (or waste extract, when applicable)or knowledge of his waste to make determinations as to whether his wastemay go directly to land disposal or first must be treated (data supportingsuch knowledge and any waste analysis data must be kept on-site).If the concentrations of the hazardous constituents in the waste (or wasteextract, when applicable) are in compliance with the applicable treatmentstandards, the waste may go directly to land disposal. The generator mustsubmit a notice and certification statement to the land disposal facilityas required under andSection; 268.7. The land disposal facility must verifythe records of the generator in accordance with the facility's waste analysisplan. A generator that operates an on-site land disposal facility mustput the information contained in the notice (except for the manifest number)in the operating record of the land disposal facility.If the concentrations of the hazardous constituents in the waste (or wasteextract, when applicable) exceeds the treatment standards, placement ofthe waste in land disposal units as of the effective date specified inPart 268 Subpart C is prohibited (unless the waste is subject to a case-by-caseextension under andSection; 268.5, or a ``no-migration'' exemption underandSection; 268.6).An off-site treatment or storage facility must obtain a notice from thegenerator as required in andSection; 268.7. This notice must be placed inthe operating record. Generators that are also treatment facilities mustkeep the information contained in the notice (except for the manifest number)in the facility's operating record.When shipping the treatment residual to an interim status or RCRA permittedland disposal facility, the treatment or storage facility must certifyin accordance with andSection; 268.7 that the treatment residue meets theapplicable treatment standards and must also send a notice (andSection; 268.7)to the land disposal facility.If the generator's waste is a restricted waste listed in andSection; 268.10(i.e., a First Third waste) where treatment standards have not been set,and such waste is land disposed off-site by methods other than landfillsor surface impoundments, the generator must provide a notice in accordancewith andSection; 268.7. The off-site disposal facility is required to keepthe generator's notice in its operating record, and is responsible forensuring that the waste is not disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment.If the generator disposes on-site, the information contained in the notice(except for the manifest number) must be kept in the facility's operatingrecord, and the generator must ensure that such waste is not disposed ina landfill or surface impoundment.If the generator's waste is a restricted waste listed in andSection; 268.10,where treatment standards have not been set, and are disposed in a landfillor surface impoundment, such waste may only be disposed in landfill orsurface impoundment units that meet the minimum technological requirementsof RCRA section 3004(o) (double liner, leachate collection system, andgroundwater monitoring), or satisfy the section 3004(o)(2) equivalencestandard. Prior to such disposal, the generator must certify to the RegionalAdministrator in accordance with andSection; 268.8.To make this certification, the generator must investigate practicallyavailable technologies appropriate for treating his waste (see sectionsIII. A. 8. and III. C. of this preamble for guidance on appropriate technologiesand on determining whether such technologies are practical). The generatormust demonstrate that he has made this investigation, certifying that eitherno practically available technologies exist for treating his waste, orthat the best technology(ies) practically available has been contractedto treat the waste. Prior to treatment (if any) and disposal, the generatormust send the demonstration and certification to the Regional Administrator,to the receiving facility, and also keep records on-site. Provided theconditions of the certification remain unchanged, demonstrations and certificationsneed not be sent again to the Regional Administrator. However, if changesdo occur, the generator must submit a new demonstration and certificationto the Regional Administrator. Should EPA notify the generator that hiscertification is invalidated, the generator is responsible for immediatelynotifying the facility(ies) receiving his waste of such action and mustkeep records of such communication on-site.Where the generator demonstrates and certifies that no practically availabletreatment exists, the waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundmentmeeting the minimum technological requirements. For off-site disposal,the demonstration and certification required in andSection; 268.7, as wellas the notice required in andSection; 268.7 must be provided with the initialwaste shipment. The andSection; 268.8 demonstration need not be providedagain as long as the conditions of the demonstration have not changed.Thereafter, only the notice required in andSection; 268.7 and the certificationrequired in andSection; 268.8 must be provided with each waste shipment.If such waste is disposed on-site, the demonstration and certificationrequired is andSection; 268.8, as well as the notice (except for the manifestnumber) required in andSection; 268.7 must be kept in the operating record.If the generator's waste is a restricted waste listed in andSection; 268.10where no treatment standards has been set, and the waste goes off-sitefor treatment, the generator must send the demonstration (only for theinitial shipment), and certification required in andSection; 268.8 and thenotice required in andSection; 268.7. The treatment facility must keep acopy of the certification, demonstration (if applicable), and notice inits operating record. If treated on-site, the information contained inthe notice (except for the manifest number) must be kept in the facility'soperating record. After treatment, the residuals may be land disposed ina landfill or surface impoundment unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of section 3004(o). The owner or operator must certify thatthe treatment indicated in the generator's demonstration has been done,prior to disposal. For off-site disposal, with the initial waste shipment,the generator's demonstration, certification and notice must be sent tothe disposal facility along with the owner operator's certification. Thereafter,only the generator's <T3>and </T3>owner or operator's certification and notice must be sent.For on-site disposal, the information contained in the notice (except themanifest number) as well as all certifications and demonstrations mustbe kept in the operating record. [Note: As discussed in section III. C.3., certain wastewater residuals from treatment of First Third wastes forwhich EPA has not promulgated treatment standards, as well as leachateand contaminated ground water derived from the management of First Thirdwastes for which EPA has not promulgated treatment standards are not prohibitedfrom land disposal until May 8, 1990 (by virtue of amending andSection; 268.12,reprioritizing the schedule) or until treatment standards are established,whichever is sooner.]<ITAG tagnum="84">IX.
