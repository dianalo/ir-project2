REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Corazon Aquino, who hasweathered coup attempts and other political storms, begins herthird year in office Thursday more secure in power than at any timeduring her administration.   But many who saw the Feb. 22-25, 1986, uprising againstPresident Ferdinand Marcos as the beginning of a new era inPhilippine politics are disappointed that dreams of social progressand reform remain unrealized.   The coalition that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power _ reformistsoldiers, human rights activists, the church and business groups _has been shattered in the bickering that followed.   Two years after Marcos' downfall, land reform remains boggeddown in Congress. Human rights groups that once castigated Marcosfor the abuses of his administration now raise similar chargesagainst the Aquino government.   During a radio broadcast Sunday, Mrs. Aquino described her firsttwo years in office as ``very difficult.''   ``I do not describe it as enjoyment,'' she said. ``Butdefinitely it is fulfillment of the highest decree.'' She saidimproving the economic condition of the Filipino people would beher first priority in the coming year.   Last week, the major topic of Manila newspapers was a debateover calls for a ``limited state of emergency,'' raising darkmemories of the worst excesses of the Marcos era.   ``It appears that the anniversary will confirm the demise of afailed reformist revolution,'' wrote commentator Amando Doronila inThe Manila Chronicle. ``It will show that the revolution, two yearsafter, is like a crushed ant hill, with its inhabitants scurryingabout without direction and in disarray.''   Despite the disillusionment, most Western and Philippineanalysts doubt that disgruntled military officers, Marcos loyalistsor communist rebels can topple the popular 55-year-old widow beforeher term expires on June 30, 1992.   Military challenges to the Aquino administration reached theirhigh-water mark in August, when mutineers seized media and militaryinstallations before being driven off about 15 hours later.   The leader of the August attempt, Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, wasarrested in December. Ironically, he played a major role in theFeb. 22, 1986, military mutiny that triggered the popular uprisingMrs. Aquino rode to power.   Most analysts believe that communist rebels appear to lack boththe military strength and political following to topple Mrs. Aquinowithin the next four years.   ``The question used to be, `Will Cory make it to 1992?''' saidone Western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Now itis, `What will she do in the rest of her term?'''   Beyond surviving, the principal achievement of the Aquinoadministration has been the restoration of popular democracy,marked by ratification of a liberal constitution and the electionsof senators, congressmen and regional officials.   Last week, however, Senate President Jovito Salonga noted thatthere were 700 allegations of fraud in the Jan. 18 regionalelection. He said those who believe real democracy has beenrestored ``are more obsessed with theory than actual fact.''   Prospects for broad social, economic and political reform havebeen clouded by a $28 billion debt, a cumbersome legislature andpolitical polarization widened by the 19-year-old communistinsurgency and the military's rising clout.   For much of her term, Mrs. Aquino faced serious challenges fromthe military, and she owes her political survival in part to afaction under Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.   As chief of staff, Ramos held most of the armed forces behindthe government and fended off the six coup plots. But socialactivists fear her reliance on Ramos has lessened the government'scommitment to reform.   The government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for allegedinvolvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. Norhas it fulfilled Mrs. Aquino's 1986 campaign promise to abolish theCivilian Home Defense Force, a military-backed militia widelyaccused of human rights abuses.   And the government has endorsed formation of about 200anti-communist vigilante groups, which human rights activists andchurch groups have accused of widespread abuses.   ``She had one thing which could have put aside thesechallenges,'' said Mariss Diokno, a prominent human rightsactivist. ``And that was the people. Instead of turning to thepeople, she turned to the military to bail her out. That is thetragic element.''   Friction between the military and civilian branches burst intothe open last week over proposals for the limited state ofemergency to deal with communist rebels.   Brig. Gen. Honesto Isleta, Ramos' former spokesman, suggestedsuch a step to deal with the communists. Rep. Eduardo Gutang, aretired general, proposed a national security act similar to thosein Malaysia and Singapore, which allow for detention without chargefor 60 days.   After criticism from liberal congressmen and the Manila press,Ramos said there was no need for a state of emergency. But hecalled for ``tougher laws,'' including a national identity cardsystem, longer detention for suspected rebels and reimposition ofthe death penalty.   Sen. Rene Saguisag, a former presidential spokesman and humanrights lawyer, accused the military of ``blackmail,'' and Sen.Teofisto Guingona branded the identity card system as the trappingsof a police state.   In a page-one commentary Sunday, the pro-Aquino Philippine DailyStar said the ouster of Marcos had given the country ``a new leaseon life, a new chance to make dreams ... into realities.''   It added: ``Today, all those dreams remain, for the most part,still dreams.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert H.
