The Frankfurt exchange was slightly higher.    Trading in Tokyo was moderate in what traders described as a day of consolidation.    The market retreated during the afternoon session as trading slowed after a busier morning session in which the Nikkei index closed about nine points above its level Oct. 19, the day before the stock market crash hit Tokyo.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which rose 246.92 points Wednesday, fell 86.51 to close at 25596.31. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index, which gained 23.28 Wednesday, fell 6.19 to 2106.20.    First section volume was estimated at 1.1 billion shares, down from 1.7 billion shares Wednesday.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, share prices were firmer after an earlier decline. The Nikkei index was up 64.53 points to 25660.84 at the end of the morning session.    Many dealers expressed relief that the market managed a correction Thursday.    The Nikkei index had risen 1512.99 points, or 6.4%, during a run of 13 straight winning days ending with a modest decline of 42.06 points Monday. Monday's brief pause was followed by two days of sharp gains totaling 440.01 points.    One dealer said comments Wednesday by Bank of Japan officials that the recent pace of the market's rises was &quot;slightly beyond normal bounds&quot; may have been a factor in prompting Wednesday's declines.    &quot;It was just right that he said this for us just now,&quot; he said.    Dealers said auto makers were stronger on news Japanese domestic car sales rose 19.1% in February, and the firmer dollar in Tokyo. Honda gained 30 yen to close at 1,590 ($12.25), while Toyota Motor rose 20 to 2,330, and Nissan gained 21 to 898.    Export-led electrical issues also were higher.    Buying interest &quot;is shifting very rapidly from sector to sector,&quot; said one trader, noting that steel and other heavy industry stocks, which posted rapid gains during the sharp rallies Tuesday and Wednesday, were mostly lower Thursday.    Share prices in London closed mixed in stronger trading volume after an early rally ran out of steam. But the market's 100-share index ended above the 1800-point level for the second day in a row.    Dealers said buying interest propelled stocks to their best levels since the October stock crash in morning trading. But prices faltered in the afternoon as buying interest dried up and participants moved to consolidate their positions around current levels. A weaker opening on Wall Street also hurt shares in late trading.    The 100-share index ended 4.6 points higher at 1813.3. The Financial Times 30-share index dropped 4.3 points to 1463.6. Volume was a healthy 579.7 million shares, up from 534.3 million Wednesday.    Dealers said the market had been expected to pause for breath after the gains made in recent sessions. In addition, breaching 1800 points on the 100-share index has made a few people nervous, they said. Allied-Lyons eased seven pence to 364 ($6.40). The company said Australia's Bond Corp. had increased its stake in Allied to 6.28% from 5.01%.    A Bond Corp. unit also issued #100 million ($177 million) of Eurobonds convertible into Allied-Lyons shares. Dealers said the Allied-Lyons share price fell as investors switched out of the shares into the convertible.    Cadbury Schweppes fell 3 to 267. The company reported pretax profit rose 35% in the year ended Jan. 2.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed mixed to higher in what brokers called choppy trading.    Equities advanced in before-hours trading, but a wave of selling pushed them lower in the first few minutes of official dealings.    In midsession, the market hovered directionless in a narrow range, brokers said, citing a lack of stimulating news and little turnover. But a bout of buying toward the end of trading pushed blue-chip shares up, letting gainers outnumber losers by a narrow margin.    Given the lack of sellers in the market, even small buy orders pushed some stocks sharply higher. Lufthansa, the country's national air carrier, saw its shares rise 8 marks to 150 ($88.40) after the group reported growing passenger volume and higher net income for 1987.    Computer maker Nixdorf jumped 13.5 to 564.5, still helped by news of a large Chinese telephone system order.    Chemical and pharmaceutical issue Schering climbed 12.5 to 450 in what one Frankfurt broker called a mostly random movement. Among other chemical shares, Hoechst gained 0.8 mark to 255, BASF eased the same amount to 243.8, and Bayer was unchanged at 264.5.    The automobile sector was the only one that closed consistently higher, with Daimler-Benz advancing 2.8 698.3, Bayerische Motoren Werke adding 2 to 529.5, and Volkswagen inching up 1 to 250.5.    Elsewhere, stocks closed lower in Paris and Milan, mixed in London, Frankfurt, Brussels and Amsterdam, and higher in Zurich and Stockholm.    Paris share prices were marked down across the board for the second straight day in fairly quiet trading in the absence of any market-affecting news.    Share prices closed higher in Singapore, Sydney, Wellington, Manila and Seoul, were mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Taipei.    The rise in Sydney was the fourth in a row. Market players cited a stabilizing of the gold price and the improved sentiment surrounding major world share markets for the rally.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
