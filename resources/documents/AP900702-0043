Control of Disputed Islands</HEAD><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The disputed Kuril Islands should be turned into aspecial economic zone owned by the Soviet Union and Japan under theauspices of the United Nations, the Communist Party newspaperPravda says.   The Soviet Union occupied the mineral-rich islands north ofHokkaido after the end of World War II in 1945 and has rejected allJapanese demands since then to give them back.   Writing in the Sunday edition of Pravda, political commentatorVsevolod Ovchinnikov said the fate of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotanand Habomai, known as the Northern Territories, should be settledwhen President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visits Japan early next year.   Ovchinnikov said the dispute could be solved by agreeing duringthe summit to place the islands under U.N. trusteeship as a specialeconomic zone jointly owned by the Soviet Union and Japan.   ``The two sides could also discuss other variants that would bemutually acceptable,'' Ovchinnikov said.   He said that until recently, Japanese officials have refused tobudge on the issue of the Kuril Islands.   The meeting between South Korean President Roh Tae-Woo andGorbachev during the Soviet leader's visit to the United States inJune and their agreement to work on regional problems should benoted by Japan, Ovochinnikov said.   ``Now that Seoul has expressed its readiness to provide itscapital, techology and equipment for Siberian projects, Tokyo'stough stand is losing its meaning,'' the Pravda commentary said.   It said only a mutually acceptable compromise on the KurilIslands will end the 45-year-old dispute, and that Gorbachev'svisit will be the best time to achieve that goal.   The islands' economic value lies in its deposits of iron, copperand gold. The main occupation is fishing.</TEXT></DOC>
