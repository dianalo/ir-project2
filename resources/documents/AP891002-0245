In the most recent survey for the Nov. 15 balloting by thenewspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, Collor de Mello was the choice of 33percent of the voters, down from more than 40 percent four monthsago.   The populist Leonel Brizola, his most vehement adversary, had 15percent, and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Worker'sParty, a front-runner early on, had 7 percent.   The private polling organization IBOPE on Sept. 28 gave Collorde Mello 35 percent, Brizola 14 percent and da Silva 8 percent.   All other candidates came below the top three in both polls.   Collor de Mello, ideologically right-of-center and running underthe banner of the newly formed National Reconstruction Party,promotes himself as an independent without ties to vestedinterests. He promises to launch an all-out war on what he says isa corrupt government bureaucracy.   ``There's a tremendous sense of moral outrage out there, adisgust with the status quo,'' said Eli Diniz, a political scienceprofessor at the University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro.``Collor de Mello, running as the anti-candidate andanti-politician, has capitalized on it.''   But political opponents charge that Collor de Mello is guilty ofthe same kind of corruption he vows to eliminate.   ``The man is a hoax,'' said Rep. Vivaldo Barbosa of Brizola'sDemocratic Labor Party.   In August, Barbosa delivered a 228-page report to the JusticeMinistry containing allegations of corruption during Collor'stenure as governor of the poor northeastern state of Alagoas fromJanuary, 1987, to this past May. The accusations are now beinginvestigated.   The report charges that:   _He gave a $400,000 state contract to a company owned by a closepolitical associate, Zelia Cardoso de Mello (no relative), withoutcompetitive bidding.   _He named thousands to state jobs just before he resigned asgovernor to run for president.   _He spent almost $1 million on official propaganda extolling hisadministration's work during his last five months in office andmore than half the money went to media outlets owned by his family.   _Around 1987, a state bank exchanged a debt of $124,000 with thefamily-owned business TV Gazeta for free commercials on the stationas well as on three radio stations and for advertisments in anewspaper owned by the family.   _He spent more than $1 million in state money intended foremergency expenditures _ more than 5,000 percent above what wasbudgeted _ from January to May and some of the money was used tobuy gifts of flowers, crystal and silverware for friends andpolitical colleagues.   The charges run head-on with Collor de Mello's image as anaustere corruption fighter who cracked down on politicians andpublic servants.   Collor de Mello is best known for his refusal as governor to paythe exorbitant salaries of an elite group of state employees, knownas ``maharajas.''   Some of these functionaries, by combining two or threegovernment jobs but not really working at them, were amassingpaychecks of up to $10,000 a month in contrast to Brazil's montlyminimum wage of about $70.   The battle with the maharajas is the centerpiece of Collor deMello's presidential campaign.   He also has gained support by sharply criticizing President JoseSarney, who many Brazilians blame for soaring inflation of morethan 1,000 percent annually and rampant corruption.   Direct presidential votes were banned by a right-wing militaryregime that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. Sarney, the firstnew civilian chief, took office in March, 1985, following a vote byan Electoral College made up of congressmen and staterepresentatives.   Collor de Mello's campaign office has provided literatureresponding to some of the allegations against the candidate.   According to the material:   _The contract with Zelia Cardoso de Mello was legal. No biddingwas necessary, as she was clearly qualified for the job.   _With Collor de Mello as governor, Alagoas was among the threestates that spent the least on official propaganda. Whatadvertising occurred was placed where it would reach the biggestaudience.   _Emergency funds spent were ``modest,'' and a good part of themoney went to worthy projects such as health care and housing.Flowers were bought for receptions for visiting dignitaries.   Herbert de Souza, of the Brazilian Institute of Analysis andStatistics, said Collor de Mello's popularity will be seriouslytested with the free television time given the major candidates onall networks.   ``The other candidates are using their TV time to go afterCollor de Mello, and most people are now going to hear theallegations of corruption against him for the first time,'' Souzasaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Oct. 9</NOTE></DOC>
