Paul Grayson and his brother George started Micrografx Inc in1982.andP;  The company is a leader in business graphics software formicrocomputers, the products use either a Microsoft Windows orOS/2 Presentation Manager graphical user interface (GUI).andP;  Graysonbelieves companies that invested heavily in developing productsfor OS/2 Presentation Manager and ignored Microsoft Windows made astrategic blunder that will be difficult to reverse.andP;  Many peoplebelieve software development has not kept up with innovations inhardware, but Grayson feels Micrografx has frequently pushed theirgraphics applications beyond the level of current hardwarecapability.andP;  He sees the GUI as the way of the future and believesthe current 40 million microcomputer users will expand to aneventual two billion.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Micrografx Inc.

I see the personal computer as a tool that is going to dramaticallychange mankind and all of his society right now and into the next 30 years.andM;That's going to happen regardless of Micrografx.andP;  My goal is to get out infront of that and make it happen.andP;  So if it's going to happen anyway in 30years, I'd like to make it happen in 20 years.andP;  So i'd like to acceleratethat and ultimately get some credit for creating some great products thatchange the world in a positive way.andM;CC: A lot of people look at what is available today, and they say 'that isthe target and that's where we are going to be for a while' rather thanlooking ahead?andM;Grayson: We're probably guilty of looking too far ahead.andP;  One of the thingswe sometimes hear from our customers when we deliver a new product is that itneeds too much hardware.andP;  I guess that goes back to the original 1.0 PC Draw.andO;it needed more memory, it needed a hard disk, so we've always been pushingthe envelope.andM;There are things that we would love to be able to do on a personal computerwith graphics that we simply don't have the hardware to do.andP;  You could lookat some of the things that are going on with supercomputers in the graphicsarena, and you could easily see how those could be applied to personal use ofgraphics on a personal computer.andM;Intel is promising about a 786 in the year 2000.andP;  We're still going to beable to push that hardware to the point where people are going to say, I needa faster machine.andM;Many people complain that application software really hasn't kept up withhardware development.andP;  But I really feel in the case of graphics, inparticular with our applications, we're still pushing it faster than it'sgoing.andM;CC: A significant number of the readers of Computing Canada are busy doingapplications for their company.andP;  All their training has been based on acharacter interface.andP;  how difficult is it for people with that background tofigure out what to do about a graphics environment, and to actually developapplications that use it?andM;Grayson: I think there's some really exciting things going on there too.andO;First of all, there is this class of people that have learned to usecharacter user interfaces and they're kind of proud of it.andP;  Sometimes there'san inhibition to move to something that's easier because you're proud of theinvestment that you as an individual have made and that you're able todemonstrate to less talented people, or less well trained people.andM;You kind of have to consider those in context.andP;  Maybe there are 40 million PCusers today, and most of them are using character interfaces, but I thinktomorrow there will be 200 million, and eventually there will be twobillion....andM;CC: Coming back to the application developer....andM;Grayson: One of the things that is really exciting is to see some of theend-user development tools that are starting to appear.andM;In particular I'm thinking of Tool Book and SQL Windows.andP;  In our visit toCanada, we visited a number of corporations that are beta testing Tool Bookand that are already usin g SQL Windows to prototype applications.andM;The trends in the environment -- object oriented, task automation, and enduser programming tools like SQL Windows -- are really optimal forcorporations because they can package productivity application and thencustomize those.andP;  They can build their own workbench, their own desktop,their own workstation that's completely customized to their environment.andM;It's really starting to realize some of the dreams of MIS departments that goback 20 or 30 years where we tried on mainframes to develop these integratedbusiness-wide applications ...andP;  I think that we now have an opportunity withWindows 3.0 and these types of tools to really achieve a very high level ofintegration and task automation.andM;CC: For an MIS professional who has lived in that character world, do theyhave to forget everything they knew?andM;Grayson: I don't think they have to forget everything they knew, but I thinkthey have to learn some new things.andP;  I think it's very easy for somebody whois computer literate to make this transition.andP;  Many of them have already doneso.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
