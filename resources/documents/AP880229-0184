However, Administrator Lee M. Thomas said it might do more harmthan good to begin a major regulatory program affecting suchbuildings while EPA, states and communities are trying to deal withasbestos in schools.   The asbestos in question is ``friable'' _ it can be crumbled byslight pressure, such as a hand squeeze, and release fibers to theair. Though asbestos has not been permitted in new buildings since1978, it was used in millions of structures from the 1920s on.   The fibers, if breathed, can cause lung cancer and otherillness. The cancer may not show up for 40 years, and the dangerincreases the earlier the exposure _ which is why school childrenare such a concern.   Thomas did call for increased grants to states to improveenforcement of existing regulations and funds to advise buildingowners, to increase the supply of inspectors and to developguidance for dealing with pipe and boiler insulation. His estimatestotalled $6.6 million a year for the next three years.   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., whose pressure has helped win passageof existing asbestos-in-schools programs, said in a statement,``Everything in this report points toward aggressive federalintervention except EPA's recommendations, which amount to nothingmore than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug.''   Congress required the report on the status of asbestos innon-school buildings in 1986. In partial response, EPA subjected a1984 building survey to more detailed analysis, reporting for thefirst time the condition of asbestos it found.   The agency had reported that about 20 percent of the buildingscontained friable asbestos. About 35 percent of schools, however,already were known to have such asbestos, and Congress has requiredtighter school regulations.   By October 1988, all schools must adopt asbestos managementplans to take effect in July 1989. ``The successulf implementationof this school program should remain our first concern, and we allhave much to learn from it,'' wrote Thomas. ``I fear a majorinitiative in other buildings could do more harm that good.''   John A. Moore, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxicsubstances, ``We've got finite resources ... a finite number ofpeople who are experts.''   The report said carrying out the school regulations will costabout $3 billion and a similar program for other buildings couldcost $51 billion.   EPA's 1984 survey did not cover elementary and secondaryschools, state and local government buildings or apartmentbuildings of fewer than 10 units, leaving 3.6 million buildings tobe sampled. An estimated 14 percent of the buildings, 501,000,contained damaged friable asbestos, and 9 percent, or 317,000,contained significantly damaged friable asbestos.   Since only 231 buildings were tested, the range of uncertaintyin the results was wide. EPA said there was a 95 percent chance thefigure reported as 20 percent was somewhere between 14 percent and27 percent; the 14 percent damage figure was between 6 percent and22 percent and the 9 percent significant damage could be anywherefrom zero percent to 19 percent.   This and other statistical points were criticized by the SafeBuildings Alliance, a trade association of former asbestos productmanufacturers, which said, for example, that EPA's surveyorsdisagreed with each other 95 percent of the time on the conditionof the asbestos they were looking at.   Moore, however, said the agency's methods had been approved byoutside experts.   Bill Borwegen, health and safety director of the ServiceEmployees International Union, said, ``The gut level issue here isthe right to know. It's federal policy that workers have the rightto know what dangerous chemicals they're dealing with. ... We wantto inform building occupants if there's a hazard.''</TEXT></DOC>
