Pacific Resources, which operates a refinery and 19 gasoline stations in Hawaii, announced last March its plans to purchase 32 stations, plus four petroleum product terminals and contracts to supply 25 owner-operated stations from Shell. According to a company spokeswoman, the FTC told Pacific Resources that it considered the acquisition to be anti-competitive.    Houston-based Shell is a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. </TEXT></DOC>
