The agency also moved to regulate services that show thephone numbers of people who make long-distance calls.</LP><TEXT>   The agency voted 5-0 to require 900 &quot;pay-per-priceservices,&quot; for which callers are billed through theirtelephone company, to provide a brief message stating thecost of the call, the nature of the service and the identityof the company offering the service. If callers decide tohang up on hearing the message, they won't be charged for thecalls, according to the new rules. The provision will applyonly to calls that cost more than a total of $2.   The fast-growing 900 industry, which is expected to reach$1 billion in revenue this year, accounts for about one-thirdof all telephone complaints to the FCC. Consumers complainthey aren't told how much the services cost, said RichardFirestone, head of the FCC's common carrier bureau, and thattheir children often call the services without parentalpermission.   The agency also mandated that callers be given anopportunity to block their telephones from calling any 900services.   Nevertheless, Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of theConsumer Federation of America, said the FCC's rules may notbe tough enough. The information could be &quot;too limited tomake people aware of charges and what {they} need to do toavoid being charged,&quot; he said.   Lisa Broderick, chairman of Talisman Communications Corp.in New York, a 900-service company, said the FCC's rulesgenerally reflect what long-distance carriers alreadyrequire. She said the rules shouldn't hinder the industry'sgrowth -- a fear that some in the 900 business had expressedwhen the FCC first proposed the rules in March.   An American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. spokesman said thatthe FCC rules are similar to those enforced by ATandamp;T. But ATandamp;Tgives customers 18 seconds to hang up, while the new FCCrules don't specify any minimum length of time.   Much of the growth in the 900 industry has come fromoperators who offer a wide range of services including sportsscores and entertainment programming by dialing a 900 prefixin place of an area code. An increasing portion, however, iscoming from unscrupulous operators touting phony job offersand &quot;free&quot; vacations.   Separately, the FCC voted 5-0 to begin regulating thetechnology that lets phone customers see the telephone numberof anyone calling them on the phone. The regulation wouldapply only to interstate calls, as the commission doesn'thave authority over calls within a state.   The agency said that such caller-identification services,when offered locally, have reduced the incidence of obscenephone calls. But privacy advocates contend that the servicesare a form of wiretapping, and can release more informationto marketers than people want to disclose.   The agency put out for public comment a series of rulesthat seek to balance the privacy interests of callers againstthe perceived benefits of the proposed services.   The agency said it was leaning toward requiringlong-distance carriers to offer callers the ability to blockthe identification of their phone numbers on a call-by-callbasis. Mr. Firestone, the FCC official, said the agency mightrequire requests for blocking to go through operators in thehopes of inhibiting obscene callers from requesting thattheir phone numbers be blocked.   ---   Bob Davis contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
