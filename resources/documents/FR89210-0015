Lynn, Chief AdministrativeJudge, Board of Indian Appeals, 703-235-3816.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On November 6, 1987, the Office ofHearings and Appeals published proposed regulations providing for the amendmentof its regulations concerning appeals to the Board of Indian Appeals. 52FR 43009 (Nov. 6, 1987). The amendments would ensure compatibility betweenthe appeal provisions set forth by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 25 CFRPart 2 and those of this office in 34 CFR Part 4.Six public comments were received concerning the proposed changes to 43CFR Part 4. These comments will be addressed with reference to the sectionsof Part 4 to which they relate.<T3>Section 4.200: </T3>When the proposed regulations were written, a referenceto the appeals provisions, located in 43 CFR 4.200, was inadvertently overlooked.This omission is being corrected in the final rules to show that proceduralrules relating to appeals to the Board from decisions of officials of theBureau of Indian Affairs are contained in 43 CFR 4.330 through 4.340.<T3>Section 4.310(b): </T3>The service provisions are being expanded basedupon an internal comment. The provision will state explicitly that serviceupon an attorney or other authorized representative is service upon theparty and incorporates the provision of 43 CFR 4.22 noting that when aparty is represented by more than one attorney, service on any one attorneyis sufficient. These clarifications are intended to reduce, when possible,the number of people who must be served, and to be consistent with Bureauregulations.<T3>Section 4.311(d): </T3>This subparagraph is being amended based uponan internal comment. The amended subparagraph will request that documentsnot be bound along the side.<T3>Section 4.312: </T3>One commenter suggested inserting ``BIA official''before ``administrative law judge'' so that the section will clearly setforth the Board's authority to adopt, modify, reverse, or set aside anyfinding, conclusion, or order of a Bureau official. The suggestion is accepted.<T3>Section 4.320: </T3>One commenter objected to the proposed change requiringan Indian tribe to first seek rehearing from the administrative law judge(Indian probate), rather than appealing directly to the Board, when theissue involved in an appeal is an escheat of an interest in Indian trustor restricted property to the tribe. The language of the section is beingchanged in order not to give Indian tribes different appeal rights thanindividuals, and to carry out the original intent of the regulation, whichwas obscured by inartful language. The comment is not accepted. <T3>Section 4.320(a): </T3>Based upon an internal comment, a sentence isbeing added explicitly stating that a notice of appeal not timely filedwill be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. This statement is in accordancewith long-standing Board practice.<T3>Sections 4.320(c) and 4.323: </T3>The language of these regulationsis being corrected to include regulatory changes that became effectiveon August 13, 1987, after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 52 FR 26344 (July 14, 1987), as corrected in52 FR 35557 (Sept. 22, 1987). The changes were inadvertently omitted fromthis proposed rulemaking.<T3>Sections 4.330(b)(2) and 4.337(b): </T3>Three commenters questionedthe continuation of the limitation on the Board's jurisdication that preventsit from reviewing discretionary decisions of the Bureau. One commenternoted that review of Bureau decisions by the Board was intended to ensureobjective and independent administrative review; the other two commentersnoted that no other appeals board in the Office of Hearings and Appealsis prohibited from reviewing discretionary decisions. The commenters suggestedthat the discretion/law distinction should be dropped and the Board shouldbe given full authority to review all Bureau decisions. One commenter urgedthat discretionary decisions should at least be reviewable by the Boardon an arbitrary, capricious, or abuse of discretion standard.In this same context, one commenter suggested that the provisions regardingtreatment of discretionary decisions in andSection; 4.337(b) should be droppedand the Board given full authority to review such decisions. Two othercommenters believed that if the distinction was retained, standards neededto be specified in the regulation for whether the Board would dismiss anappeal from a discretionary decision, or refer it to the Assistant Secretary_IndianAffairs.The Board is not the only appeals board within the Office of Hearings andAppeals limited in its review of discretionary decisions. Under 43 CFR4.1(b)(4) and 4.700, appeals not falling within the jurisdiction of a standingappeals board are assigned to ad hoc boards of appeal which are prohibitedfrom reviewing discretionary decisions. At this time, the Department believesthe discretion/law distinction in review of Bureau decisions should beretained. The comments are, accordingly, not accepted.<T3>Section 4.330(b)(3): </T3>One commenter questioned the provision requiringBureau decisions based on recommendations or actions of officials of theMinerals Management Service to be decided by the Board of Land Appealsrather than the Board of Indian Appeals. The commenter believed that suchdecisions routinely involve questions of Federal Indian law and the expertiseof the Board of Indian Appeals should be utilized in reviewing these decisions.The Department continues to believe that the broader mineral law expertiseof the Board of Land Appeals should be applied to decisions arising fromrecommendations or actions of the Minerals Management Service. Those casesinvolving Indian minerals, which are not based on recommendations or actionsof the Minerals Management Service will, however, be decided by the Boardof Indian Appeals. The comment is not accepted.  <T3>Section 4.331(b): </T3>One commenter questioned the provision restrictingthe Board's review authority over decisions that are approved in writingby the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs prior to issuance. As a Secretarial-levelofficial, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs has authority to issueor approve decisions that are final for the Department. The Board has notbeen delegated general review authority over such decisions. The commentis not accepted.<T3>Section 4.332(a):</T3> Three comments were received concerning theproposed reduction of the time for filing a notice of appeal with the Boardfrom 60 days to 30 days. The change was proposed so that the appeal periodswould be the same throughout the review process for Bureau administrativedecisions and so that final resolution of appeals would not be unnecessarilydelayed. The commenters objected to the use of the date of mailing as thestart of the appeal period, rather than the date of receipt. One commenternoted that date of receipt should be used because decisions were sent bycertified mail, return receipt requested.The comments are accepted in part. Section 4.332(a) is being revised toprovide that the appeal period begins upon receipt of the decision by theappellant. However, the time for filing a notice of appeal will remain30 days.<T3>Section 4.332(b):</T3> Three comments were received relating to theprocedures for allowing the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs to assumejurisdiction over appeals filed with the Board. Two commenters believedthat the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs should not have this authority;the third commenter believed that appellants should be given an explicitright to choose whether they wanted their appeals considered by the Boardor by the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs.The Office of Hearings and Appeals was created as a separate office withinthe Office of the Secretary of the Interior in 1970 to provide independent,objective administrative review of decisions issued by the Department'svarious program Bureaus and Offices. In promulgating the initial regulationsproviding for review of administrative decisions of the Bureau of IndianAffairs, the Department stated: ``Exercise of the Secretary's review authorityby the Board of Indian Appeals will ensure impartial review free from organizationalconflict in that the Board is part of the Office of Hearings and Appealsin the Office of the Secretary and as such is independent of the Bureauof Indian Affairs.'' 40 FR 20819 (May 13, 1975).The usual appeal procedures within the Department do not include appealsto the Assistant Secretaries. If the Assistant Secretaries were to handleappeals routinely, they would have to create, in effect, an Office of Hearingsand Appeals within their own offices. The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairshas recently been a part of the Bureau appeal process because of the vacancyin the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the official who previouslyhandled administrative appeals from the Bureau. It was never contemplatedthat the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs would handle administrativeappeals as a routine or frequent part of his official duties. Therefore,the comment suggesting that appellants be given a choice of forum for administrativeconsideration of their appeals is not accepted.It is also recognized, however, that there are some decisions involvingIndians and Indian tribes that involve policy considerations that cannotadequately be addressed through the usual appeal procedures. It is anticipatedthat the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs will infrequently exercisethe authority to assume jurisdiction over an appeal. The Assistant Secretary_IndianAffairs is aware that such assumption of jurisdiction will operate to alterthe legitimate expectations of the parties as to normal processing of theirappeals. For this reason, the final regulations issued by the Bureau ofIndian Affairs show that the authority to assume jurisdiction over an appeallies exclusively with the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs and he orshe will not consider petitions filed by the parties asking for such review.Because the Department continues to believe that there are some instancesin which it may be appropriate for the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairsto review an appeal, the comments suggesting that that official be entirelyremoved from the review process are not accepted.<T3>Section 4.332(c): </T3>One comment was received suggesting that thisprovision was an improper limitation on the duty of Bureau officials toassist Indians who are not represented by counsel in preparing an appeal.The only substantive change proposed from the existing regulation was theaddition of the words ``not represented by counsel.'' The change was proposedto clarify that the duty to assist in the preparation of appeals extendsto those Indians or Indian tribes who are not being represented by legalcounsel. The Department does not believe the change would limit the priorduty of Bureau officials to assist Indians who are not represented by counseland, therefore, does not accept the comment.<T3>Section 4.332(d): </T3>One commenter suggested that an appeal bondshould be required only in extraordinary circumstances. The language ofthe proposed regulation, which was not changed from the existing regulation,states that ``an appropriate bond may be required.'' Because of the diversityof circumstances that may exist in which a bond is requested, it is believedthat case-by-case consideration of bond requests must be allowed. The interestsof the appellant in prosecuting the appeal must be weighted against thepossible disadvantage to other parties should the appeal be decided againstthe appellant who may then be found not to have the financial resourcesto carry out the obligations imposed by the decision. It is not believedthat changes need to be made to this regulation.<T3>Section 4.336: </T3>One commenter suggested that a briefing scheduleshould not be established until all objections to the composition of theadministrative record are resolved. Few cases presently before the Boardinvolve challenges to the composition of the administrative record andit is not anticipated that the new procedures will substantially increasethis type of challenge. The Board has previously been able to accommodatechallenges to the composition of the administrative record on a case-by-casebasis, and expects to do so in the future. No need is seen at this timeto provide specific time-frames for challenges to the administrative record.Therefore, the comment is not accepted. Another commenter suggested that the right to seek review of Board decisionsby the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs should be made explicit. Thiscomment was based on the erroneous belief that the Assistant Secretary_IndianAffairs presently has the right to review Board decisions. There is noauthority for the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs to review a decisionof the Board. The comment is, therefore, not accepted. <T4>Paperwork Reduction Act </T4>This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.<T4>Compliance With Other Acts. </T4>The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under E.O. 12291 and certifies that this document will nothave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).
