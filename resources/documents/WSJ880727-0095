Emigrant currently holds 9.9% of Home Savings Bank's 12 million shares outstanding. The transaction is valued at roughly $216 million for the shares Emigrant doesn't already own.    In national over-the-counter trading, Home Savings Bank closed yesterday at $15.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.    In a letter to Home Savings, Emigrant requested that Home Savings reply by Aug. 9, adding that the $20-a-share offer could be raised &quot;if in the course of our negotiations additional value in Home can be demonstrated to us.&quot;    Emigrant, which is owned by the Milstein family of New York, has $3.5 billion in assets and 20 branches, said a spokesman for the bank. Home Savings, with assets of more than $1.65 billion, has 13 banking offices in the New York metropolitan area.    To finance the transaction, Emigrant said it would use a combination of working capital and borrowing. It also said it would expect to retain the current employees and officers of Home Savings. </TEXT></DOC>
