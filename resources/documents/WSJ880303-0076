Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Super Tuesday round of primaries and caucuses is likely to winnow the Democratic field to two major contestants -- plus the high-rolling Jesse Jackson -- and could make the nomination of Republican George Bush almost inevitable.    Next Tuesday, in what is almost a Southern regional primary, each party will select about a third of its delegates to the summer conventions. It is the biggest campaign day on the calendar. Of the Super Tuesday contests, 14 will be held by both parties in or on the borders of the South. Democrats, who hold 21 contests altogether, will choose 1,307 delegates that day. The Republicans, with 17 contests, will choose 753.    The battle for Super Tuesday actually opens on Saturday in a preliminary event in South Carolina, when Republicans go to the polls in a contest sharply fought by Vice President Bush, the front-runner in the race, and his two principal opponents, Sen. Robert Dole and former Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson. Mr. Bush's opponents hope to break the momentum the vice president established by his victory in New Hampshire.    By most estimates, Mr. Bush is positioned to surge ahead in the race for the Republican nomination and if he sweeps the GOP primaries and caucuses Super Tuesday and ends up with 600 of the 1,139 delegates he needs to win the nomination, chances of stopping him will seem remote.    The Democratic picture is more confused. But most experts figure two traditional contenders will emerge, along with Mr. Jackson, who still is given little or no chance of winning the nomination. Likely winners Tuesday are Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who if he carries some key Southern states may emerge as the clear leader, and Rep. Richard Gephardt, although Sen. Albert Gore, with his Southern strategy, hopes to edge out Mr. Gephardt.    It could be very close. After talking to politicians in most of the Super Tuesday states, Mark Siegel, a Democratic National Committee member, figures moderate and conservative voters will move in the end to Mr. Gephardt, allowing him to win most of the Southern states, including Texas and Florida. Even at that, he would end up with about 370 delegates, only a handful more than Mr. Dukakis, who starts off with a big base in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.    Mr. Jackson, with the Siegel arithmetic, finishes third with about 280, and Mr. Gore finishes fourth with about 245. A candidate needs 2,082 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.    No longer in contention for the Democrats are Sen. Paul Simon and former Sen. Gary Hart. Super Tuesday is also the last chance for GOP Rep. Jack Kemp.    The first thing to note about the Democrats is that almost all of their contests involve proportional representation. That means that in most states there will be something for almost everybody, making it more difficult for anyone to deliver a knockout blow and making it more likely that the Democratic process will be longer and more exhausting.    Here is a primer for the Democratic candidates:   Michael Dukakis. If anyone is the frontrunner going into Super Tuesday, it is Gov. Dukakis, who is more and more widely seen as the choice of traditional Democratic liberals. He starts Super Tuesday with a base of almost 100 delegates in his native Massachusetts and neighboring Rhode Island. He should get a big chunk of Washington state's 65 delegates and is expected to win Maryland.    It gets tougher as he moves South. But he runs surprisingly well in many polls. Mr. Dukakis is the best-organized of all the Democratic candidates and he has plenty of cash to buy TV time in big-city markets. Mr. Dukakis could win close to 400 delegates thanks to proportional representation on Super Tuesday without coming in first in a single Southern state, estimates Mr. Siegel, the Democratic Party consultant. But if Mr. Dukakis actually did come in first in Texas and Florida and one or two Deep South states, he would be well on his way to the nomination.    Richard Gephardt. Rep. Gephardt doesn't have the most money but he may have the most compelling message, urging Americans to take hold of their own destiny, partly by getting tough with trading partners that discriminate against American exports.    He is targeting Texas and Oklahoma, where he has separated himself from Mr. Dukakis by his support of an oil-import fee. Mr. Gephardt's strong trade message finds receptive audiences in states like North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia and he expects to easily win most of the 77 delegates in his home state of Missouri.    Albert Gore. Sen. Gore, after avoiding confrontations with his fellow Democrats in the ice and snow of Iowa and New Hampshire, bided his time and husbanded his cash for a showdown in the South. Many experts now think that strategy was a mistake, and Tuesday's vote will be a make-or-break test for the senator. Sen. Gore's special opponent, and special problem, is Rep. Gephardt. Both camps are vying for the moderate mantle in this race.    The Gore people still say they hope to win in Tennessee, the senator's home state, and Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Mississippi and parts of Florida. But few other politicians think that is likely. If Mr. Gore finishes third or fourth on Super Tuesday, the battleground he chose for himself, his hopes of winning the nomination are doomed.    Jesse Jackson. No candidate, in either party, is riding higher or feeling better than Mr. Jackson.    Just like four years ago, he has his loyal and enthusiastic black base. Blacks represent 15% or more of the population in about 60 of the 167 congressional districts in the 20 Super Tuesday states. More than four years ago, Mr. Jackson is picking up support from disaffected poor whites and from white Democratic liberals.    He could carry Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia and he could finish a strong second in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, and North Carolina.    The Republican rules lend themselves to the possibility that Mr. Bush can emerge from Super Tuesday with a huge cache of delegates. In eight states, winner-take-all provisions make it possible for candidates to sweep the delegate slots in individual congressional districts. Five of them, moreover, have provisions that can result in the awarding of all the at-large delegates to the candidate who wins the statewide balloting. The other states use some form of proportional representation to allocate convention delegates.    Here is a primer on the Republican candidates as Super Tuesday nears:   George Bush. Mr. Bush shows strength throughout the South and, according to campaign chief Lee Atwater, is running almost without opposition in Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia and Mississippi. The vice president is positioned to take as many as 15 or 16 of the 17 states and to capture more than 500 delegates.    Mr. Bush is weakest in Washington state, where Mr. Dole is running strong. And though Mr. Bush runs far ahead in South Carolina, the size of the Robertson vote and a new Dole offensive could endanger his lead there in the gateway to Super Tuesday. But the size of the expected Bush victories have significance, too. In Texas, for example, if Mr. Dole and Mr. Robertson can hold Mr. Bush to below 50%, they will prevent him from taking all of the 30 at-large state delegates awarded to any candidate who wins a statewide majority.    Robert Dole. The Kansan's best hope now is to confine Mr. Bush to 400 delegates while winning more than 200 of his own; his strategists acknowledge that the more Mr. Bush pushes above 500, the harder it will be for Sen. Dole to catch him. &quot;The key for us,&quot; Dole campaign chief William Brock says of Super Tuesday, &quot;is survival.&quot;    The bulk of Sen. Dole's Super Tuesday delegates are likely to come from outside the Deep South. Dole strategists are targeting areas of Missouri, Oklahoma, Maryland and North Carolina. In Florida, Mr. Dole is still making efforts to win support in selected pockets such as Orlando and the Tampa Bay area but some campaign insiders think he could get shut out in that critical state. The campaign harbors hopes of prevailing in a few districts of Texas and Alabama.    Pat Robertson. As always, Mr. Robertson's strength is the great unknown, and Robertson strategists have been working quietly to build support in rural conservative Democratic strongholds where the other candidates aren't competing. &quot;The old invisible army is like the Stealth aircraft,&quot; says campaign chief Marc Nuttle. &quot;You can't see it with the regular radar.&quot;    Mr. Robertson is playing down his expectations in South Carolina, which only two weeks ago he vowed to win, but still hopes for a strong showing there and in Florida and Oklahoma. He's also working areas such as East Texas, where there are few Republicans. A critical question: Can he lure large numbers of Democrats to cross over and vote for him in the GOP contests, as permitted in nine of the Super Tuesday states?    Jack Kemp. The congressman from the Buffalo suburbs, his campaign already in serious jeopardy, is placing all of his political eggs in the South Carolina basket. His goal there is to beat Mr. Robertson and Mr. Dole and to go into Super Tuesday with a media boost for having taken second place. His aides acknowledge that he isn't likely to win any Super Tuesday states.    ---                   Super Tuesday Delegates             Delegates at stake on Super Tuesday                                  REPUBLICAN    DEMOCRATIC    Alabama                           38            56    American Samoa                    --             3    Arkansas                          27            38    Florida                           82           136    Georgia                           48            77    Hawaii                            --            20    Idaho                             --            18    Kentucky                          38            55    Louisiana                         41            63    Maryland                          41            67    Massachusetts                     52            98    Mississippi                       31            40    Missouri                          47            77    Nevada                            --            16    North Carolina                    54            82    Oklahoma                          36            46    Rhode Island                      21            22    Tennessee                         45            70    Texas                            111           183    Virginia                           *            75    Washington                        41            65    Super Tuesday Total              753         1,307    Overall Total                  2,277         4,162    Needed for nomination          1,139         2,082    *Non-binding &quot;beauty contest&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
