Voting 5-0, the FCC proposed allowing such independentcompanies as Teleport Communications Group and MetropolitanFiber Systems Inc. to connect their fiber-optic networks tolocal phone systems run by the Bell companies and GTE Corp.for interstate services. Teleport, owned by New York-basedMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., and MFS, owned by Peter Kiewit Sons'Inc. of Omaha, operate fiber-optic loops that serve bigbusinesses and long-distance carriers in major cities.</LP><TEXT>   The FCC still must decide thorny pricing and technicalmatters, but a final decision, perhaps by year end, couldlead to a competitive market for certain local phoneservices, at least for business customers. &quot;This is thebeginning of the end of the monopoly phone franchise,&quot; saidGregory Sawers, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Hecompared yesterday's action to the Execunet court decisionsin the late 1970s that cleared the way for MCI CommunicationsCorp. to compete with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   The FCC's plan initially would be limited to &quot;specialaccess,&quot; or private-line, services that corporations use toconnect branch offices or distant buildings. The commissionis also exploring whether to allow the alternativetelecommunications companies to plug into the local phonenetworks for so-called switched access, or local phonecompany services that connect calls to a subscriber's line.With switched access, for example, a big business could usean alternative phone company to reach its customers, asopposed to reaching only its branch offices.   To date, the alternative providers have attracted onlyabout $100 million of the $5 billion-a-year special accessservices market. Overall, the market for access to localsystems totals about $25 billion.   The FCC's proposal follows action in a handful of stateswhere phone companies and alternative carriers have beennegotiating interconnection agreements. For instance, NynexCorp.'s New York Telephone, Ameritech Corp.'s Illinois Bell,and Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell unit have worked outinterconnection agreements. Earlier this week, New York stateregulators approved a New York Telephone filing spelling outintrastate interconnection arrangements.   The commission proposed giving the seven Baby Bellcompanies and GTE a choice of allowing alternative-servicecompanies to install their equipment in phone companyswitching centers or allowing them to locate their equipmentnearby but pay the same prices and receive the same servicesas if were installed at the centers. Under the proposal,competitors would be allowed to monitor and control their owncircuits, and phone companies would be required to makecertain equipment available to competitors.   The commission noted that its interconnection decisionsare closely linked to a proceeding concerning how the localcompanies charge long-distance carriers to handle theircalls. This statement helped local phone companies as theytried to sort out the potential impact of the commission'sproposal.   Larry Cashion, Nynex's director of regulatory issues, saidit was important that the commission recognized that theissues are related. Ultimately, the phone companies expect towin more pricing flexibility on both the federal and statelevels to match the new competition.   For customers, real competition will lead to more choices.&quot;Customers could mix and match services in different ways,&quot;Mr. Cashion said. Eventually, the alternative providers willbe positioned to offer their services to smaller businesses,not just big corporations and long-distance companies, hesaid. Moreover, fiber loops won't be a big-city phenomenon asinvestors find they can be operated profitably in smallercities and towns, he said.   For the phone companies, the proposal signals morecompetition, but also additional business frominterconnection fees, Mr. Cashion said. But just how therevenues will shake out is hard to tell, he said.   Robert Atkinson, Teleport's senior vice president forregulatory affairs, said the FCC's action will encourageinvestors to enter the budding industry. He said it wouldalso encourage the phone companies to become more efficientand pay more attention to their customers. &quot;The telephoneindustry will be better off as long as they learn to adapt,&quot;he said.   The commission is seeking public comment on the proposal.It is expected to vote on a final ruling later this year.   Separately, the FCC adopted a rule requiring U.S.long-distance carriers to negotiate lower internationalaccounting rates with foreign carriers. The accounting ratesdetermine a substantial portion of the charges forinternational phone calls.   The commission expressed concern that the rates are toohigh. In Europe, for example, the commission said U.S.carriers are paying 50 cents to $1.40 per minute more toterminate calls than carriers from other countries. Thecommission also proposed additional steps to bring downaccounting rates, including a U.S. effort to ensure thatrates are based on costs.</TEXT></DOC>
