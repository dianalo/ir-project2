Now, with the brutal military crushing of the pro-democracymovement in Beijing this past spring, a new generation of Chineseexiles is looking to hua qiao for help in toppling China's leaders.   Wang Gungwu, vice chancellor of the University of Hong Kong andan expert on overseas Chinese, hears ``echoes from the past'' as hesurveys the situation. Survival will not be a problem for the newexiles; they can expect to be sustained by their brethren abroad,he says.   The story of the hua qiao spans many centuries, as wave uponwave of Chinese have left their native land to escape grindingpoverty, to flee political persecution, or just to seek fortune.One estimate puts the current overseas Chinese population atroughly 30 million.   They can be found in every corner of the globe.   Among them are world-famous architects (I.M. Pei), best-sellingnovelists (Maxine Hong Kingston), and leaders of nations (PrimeMinister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore). They are prominentbusinessmen, and every major city has restaurants run by them.   But the overseas Chinese also have maintained ties to theirhomeland, and at times some have become deeply involved in itspolitics.   The most obvious example was their support for Sun Yat-sen, aleading figure in the fight against the Manchu dynasty that hadbeen in place since 1644 and was also known as the Qing dynasty. Itfinally fell in 1911, with Sun as a leading player in China'srevolutionary movement until his death in 1925.   In explaining why overseas Chinese supported Sun against theweak Manchu empire, his biographer Harold Z. Schiffrin wrote: ``Ifas minorities they were persecuted or discriminated against abroad,they wanted a powerful home government for protection.''   Sun owed a large debt to the overseas Chinese.   ``Whenever he went overseas, he was looked after by the overseasChinese,'' said Wang of the University of Hong Kong. ``They clothedhim, fed him and protected him.''   They also provided some financial backing, he added. ``Thesupport was vital. He couldn't have survived.''   Other hua qiao have since answered appeals from Chinese leadersfor help.   Soon after Mao Tse-tung's Communist Party took power in 1949, iturged Chinese intellectuals living abroad to return and help build``New China.''   Although no reliable estimate is available on the number ofprofessionals who answered the call, thousands did return andplayed a key role in China's development, especially nuclearphysicists. Many later paid the price during political purges ofintellectuals.   The Chinese diaspora is once again in the spotlight because ofthe spring pro-democracy demonstrations and the new exile movementseeking help from the hua qiao.   But the exiles have found that the overseas Chinese are not amonolithic community. Their political and economic outlooks varywidely. Perhaps the only common thread is that they are an ethnicminority in almost every country in which they live.   The degree of assimilation by Chinese abroad varies tremendouslyand to some extent determines how closely tied they are to mainlandChina affairs.   Some of the most assimilated and the oldest overseas Chinesecommunities are in Southeast Asia, where reaction to thepro-democracy movement generally was muted.   In Thailand, precise figures on the ethnic Chinese populationare difficult if not impossible to determine because of widespreadintermarriage since the first wave of migration more than 200 yearsago.   But up to 12 percent of the population is believed to have solidChinese roots, including a dozen Chinese-Thai families that can besaid to largely run the private economy and the prime minister, whohas a Chinese-born grandfather.   ``I was born here, my parents are Chinese from China, but I loveThailand and I feel I belong to this country,'' said one ethnicChinese businessmen in Bangkok, the Thai capital. ``I have neverbeen to mainland China. I think that it would be very difficult tolive there.''   Chinese in the Philippines, who began arriving even before theSpanish colonizers in the late 16th century, also have assimilatedrapidly by intermarrying, taking Hispanic names and adopting RomanCatholicism. They, too, are very influential in economic andpolitical life.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
