U.S. banks and securities firms hold a small minority ofthe more than $3 billion in debt incurred by Mr. Maxwell. Buttheir inclusion among creditors in the scandal surroundingthe late financier shows how the pursuit of fees andcommissions in one business line can lead financialinstitutions to assume risks in other areas.</LP><TEXT>   One of the most striking examples of this is the dual roleof Bankers Trust New York Corp. One Wall Street professionalestimates that the banking company made loans of roughly $250million to Mr. Maxwell's companies, an amount that heestimates may later have been reduced to $150 million orless. A spokesman for Bankers Trust declined to comment onthe estimates of its exposure.   Since November 1988, investment bankers at Bankers Trustalso worked on 11 merger-and-acquisition transactionsinvolving Mr. Maxwell or one of his businesses, according toSecurities Data Corp., thus becoming one of Mr. Maxwell'smost active merger advisers.   One reason Bankers Trust got so much merger business fromMr. Maxwell was the bank's willingness to make loans,according to the same Wall Street professional. &quot;It was clearthat the way to get fee-paying business out of Maxwell waslending to him,&quot; says one investment banker. The BankersTrust spokesman wouldn't comment on any link between thelending and the advisory assignments.   Several U.S. financial institutions also had big loans outto Maxwell entities in connection with Mr. Maxwell's heavycurrency trading, among them Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. andCiticorp. Goldman's loans, secured by shares of two Maxwellcompanies, appear to have exceeded $100 million, based on thevalue of the shares that Goldman disclosed holding ascollateral.   John Kenny, an analyst at the Barclays de Zoete Wedd unitof Barclays Bank, said Maxwell Communication Corp. reportedforeign-exchange gains of #80.7 million ($146.1 million) inthe year ended March 1991, which accounted for more than halfof the company's pretax profit of #145.5 million.   Based on the magnitude of those results, Mr. Kenny said,&quot;it sounds to me like they could have been {wagering} thebest part of #1 billion {in currency trading} to achieve thatprofit.&quot; He added, &quot;Most analysts recognized at the time thatif you can win #81 million on treasury functions, you canlose that much and more.&quot;   Goldman's loans were secured by 26 million shares ofMaxwell Communication and 40 million shares of Mirror GroupNewspapers PLC, Mr. Maxwell's other public company. Oneperson on Wall Street said Mr. Maxwell had an extensiverelationship at Goldman involving foreign exchange,securities trading and other business. In December 1989, forexample, Goldman acted as lead manager in a sale by Mr.Maxwell's Macmillan Inc. unit of $138.6 million in BerlitzInternational Inc. stock.   Citicorp, which had been holding 25 million shares ofMaxwell Communication in connection with a foreign-exchangetrade, sold 5.8 million of those shares between Nov. 4 andNov. 20. Mr. Maxwell died on Nov. 5. One person familiar withthe transactions said a Maxwell entity had failed to make apayment due on a $30 million transaction.   The Shearson Lehman Brothers unit of American Express Co.on Nov. 6, the day after Mr. Maxwell's death, took possessionof 1.9 million shares of Berlitz stock valued at about $35million that had been put up as collateral for a stock loanof undetermined size. Shearson is still holding the Berlitzstock.   Less than a month earlier, Lehman Brothers, the investmentbanking arm of Shearson Lehman, on Oct. 9 served as leadunderwriter on a $249.2 million sale of 7.1 million shares ofScitex Corp., an electronic printing systems company owned byRobert Maxwell Group PLC.   Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. also made a $32.5 million loan to Mr.Maxwell on Aug. 30 in connection with the sale of his 50%stake in MTV Europe. Merrill represented Mr. Maxwell inselling the stock to Viacom International Inc. in exchangefor $65 million in Viacom stock. When the sale closed onSept. 10, Mr. Maxwell repaid the loan from Merrill withViacom stock, which Merrill then resold along with theMaxwell Viacom shares.   Officials at Goldman, Citicorp, Shearson and Merrilldeclined to comment. Salomon Brothers Inc. is also said tohave made loans to Mr. Maxwell based at least partly oncurrency dealings. However, a Salomon Brothers spokesman saidthat its parent company doesn't have &quot;material financialexposure with respect to open transactions with companiesaffiliated with the late Robert Maxwell.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
