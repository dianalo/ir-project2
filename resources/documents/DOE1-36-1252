For providing a qualifiedanalytical tool for calculating critical mass flow rates through sucha crack a detailed test program was carried out using subcooled waterup to pressures of 14 MPa. A real crack and several simulated cracks(rough slits) were examined experimentally. The important parameterssuch as inlet pressure, subcooling temperature of water, slit width,and inner surface roughness were varied in a wide range and the measureddata compared with calculated values from different models. The datacomparison indicates that the model published by Pana leads to predictionswhich agree best with the observed data. First calculations were carriedout using the friction coefficient zeta, which results from single phaseflow measurements. A correlation has been developed to calculate zetafrom the geometrical dimensions of the crack and was integrated intoan advanced version of the Pana model. The modified Pana model was qualifiedagainst some hundreds of test values. The measured data were predictedwith a relative standard deviation of less than 20%.</TEXT></DOC>
