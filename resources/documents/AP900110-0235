The dollar was changing hands at 145.20 yen at late morning. Itstarted trading at 145.23 yen, down 0.07 yen from Wednesday's145.30-yen close here, and moved from 145.20 to 145.50 yen. Itended at 145.55 yen in New York overnight.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 87.86 points, or 0.23percent, ending the morning session at 37,608.65. It shed 254.95points Wednesday.   The Nikkei index headed higher on broad small-lot buyingearlier, due to relaxed regulations on margin trading, dealers said.   The stock exchange Thursday began assessing securities used ascollateral in margin trading at 60 percent of their real valuerather than the previous 50 percent in a step to encourage buyingand to rejuvenate the market.   But the index fell back as institutional investors stepped tothe sidelines, said Kazumasa Iijima, a dealer with Nippon KangyoKakumaru Securities Co.   ``Market players just are not in a buying mood, mainly becauseof uncertainties over the election,'' he said.   A national election for the lower house of Parliament isexpected in February, and the market is largely concerned withwhether the governing Liberal Democratic Party can retain itsmajority in the house.   The LDP lost its majority in the less powerful upper house lastyear as a result of money and sex scandals involving the party'sCabinet members, and an unpopular consumption tax.   In currency trading, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowlyafter a surge in the dollar earlier this week. Sentiment for thedollar remained bullish, but market players were reluctant to pushthe U.S. currency higher for fear of another central bankintervention, said Toaru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with NewJapan Securities Co.   The Bank of Japan has actively sold the dollar in the past twodays to support the yen.   Market rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board sold thedollar for yen Wednesday, and news about the resignation of theexecutive vice president and chief financial officer of CampeauCorp., also accelerated the market's wait-and-see mood, Kanai said.   Campeau, a Canadian real estate company that owns U.S.department store chains, including Bloomingdale's, has been infinancial trouble and there is speculation its department storeunits would file for bankruptcy protection.   ``But the dollar is basically strong as buying of the (WestGerman) mark has slowed while the yen isn't attracting anybody,''Kanai added.</TEXT></DOC>
