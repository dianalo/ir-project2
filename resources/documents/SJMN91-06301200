All the parties are arriving withuncompromising positions and will deliver their hardest line in a series offormal speeches. There will be no opportunity to bargain.;   The real actionis to begin four days later, when Israel opens separate negotiations withSyria, Lebanon and a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians living inIsraeli-occupied territories. These are the discussions that could bearfruit.;   &quot;Right at the outset, the Arab side will say, 'We want all the landback,' and the Israeli side will say, 'Not an inch,' &quot; predicted Joseph J.Sisco, who was a senior State Department official for Middle Eastern affairsduring the Nixon and Ford administrations.;   Nevertheless, Sisco said theMadrid conference may prove to be a watershed event because &quot;things do happenin a room when people are facing each other.&quot;;   Sisco and other Middle Eastexperts caution that nothing will happen quickly, except breakdowns andwalkouts. Breakthroughs will take months, if not years.;   &quot;Prospects lookbetter than ever before, but it will be a long, tortuous route ahead,&quot; saidRobert G. Neumann, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Morocco andAfghanistan. &quot;Everyone will say, 'No, no, no' at the beginning, things willcome to a breakdown and the United States will have to weigh in to keep theprocess going.&quot;;   There is a consensus within the Bush administration andamong outside experts that the best chance for a breakthrough is in theconflict between Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,which Israel has ruled since seizing the territory from Jordan in the 1967Middle East war.;   The dispute least likely to yield to progress in the shortterm is that between Israel and its most-hated enemy, Syria, which has agreedto hold talks with the Jewish state in hopes of regaining the Golan Heights,also lost to Israel in 1967.;   &quot;The Palestinian issue is ripest for action,&quot;said Peter Rodman, a former senior foreign policy planner for PresidentsReagan and Bush. &quot;The trick is for the Palestinians to get the Israelis toembrace and implement (the Israelis') own proposals, which is no easy feat.&quot;;  Palestinians have been demanding an independent state, but Israel has refusedto give up the land and allow a sovereign Palestinian nation to exist on itsborder.;   Israel's longstanding offer to the Palestinians is limitedself-government, with Israel maintaining military control over theterritories, a proposal Palestinian leaders have repeatedly rejected in thepast.;   The 1978 Camp David accord, which produced a peace agreement betweenIsrael and Egypt, proposed such a self-rule arrangement as a five-year interimstep that would be followed by a permanent political settlement.;  Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories appear more amenable to thatidea now because political developments in the region are working againsttheir efforts to establish an independent state, Middle East experts agree.;  These factors include a steady expansion of Jewish settlements in theterritories, the diminishing effect of a nearly 4-year-old Arab uprising -- orintifada -- against Israeli occupation and the rise of moderate forces overradical elements in the Arab world.;   Although the Palestine LiberationOrganization continues to insist on nothing less than independence, the Bushadministration is courting more moderate Palestinian leaders in theterritories in the belief that most residents there are tired of the longconflict and want to compromise.;   The administration believes most Israelisfeel much the same way about their 43-year-old state of war with the Arabs andare more open to compromise than the government of Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, who continues to insist that he will not surrender one inch ofterritory the Arabs want to reclaim.;   The Bush administration's strategy isto lure Shamir into negotiations based on the principle of exchangingterritorial concessions for peace and recognition. Once Shamir embarks on theprocess, U.S. officials predict, pressure from both the Israeli public andIsraeli supporters in the United States will force him to continue down thatpath so long as the Arabs show good faith.;   &quot;The Arab side already has madeits choices about moving in new directions. Now it's Israel's turn to move ina new direction,&quot; said James J. Zogby, executive director of the Arab-AmericanInstitute.;   &quot;The pressures that brought everybody to the table in the firstplace will keep them there,&quot; Zogby added. &quot;Everybody has no place else to go.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  OWEN ULLMANN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911027  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  944  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 27, 199100301200,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
