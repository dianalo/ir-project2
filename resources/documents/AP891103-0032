Bennett.   Bennett, acknowledging that sometimes he's ``too damn quotablefor my own good,'' drew a roar of laughter Thursday from the WhiteHouse audience of more than 100 prominent media leaders. Later, topspokesmen for various Cabinet members responded the same way.   Addressing the media leaders who came to the White House tolearn the results of a survey on the impact of anti-drug abuse adsthey had run, Bennett began by praising Bush's support for the waragainst drugs.   Then he recounted a day when he and Bush ``were leaving aCabinet meeting, he looked out the window and there was Millie andthe puppies, and he said, `You know, sometimes it's easy to getdistracted when you should be thinking about Cabinet affairs, andonce in a while my mind wanders and I see Millie and the puppiesand then I get back to work.'   ``I said, `Well, that's sort of like the Cabinet anyway, Mr.President, all those puppies pawing on each other, stepping on eachother's heads all trying to get your attention,''' Bennett said asthe audience burst out laughing.   ``It's probably somewhat reminiscent of the Cabinet doing otherthings to each other which I won't repeat here _ dampening eachother's coats, shall we say? But everybody trying to get theattention of mama,'' he said.   Bush decided not to include Bennett in his Cabinet even thoughCongress created Bennett's position _ director of the Office ofNational Drug Control Strategy _ as a Cabinet-level office.   Bennett has maintained he doesn't mind being excluded from theCabinet, where he served earlier as President Reagan's educationsecretary, as long as he has the president's support.   All the top spokesmen for Cabinet members contacted Thursdayevening responded with laughter when told of Bennett's remark.Cabinet members were out of town or had left their offices for theday by the time their reaction was sought.   ``It's a good line,'' said David Runkel, spokesman for AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh.   Bob Marx, spokesman for Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner,conceded when asked for a response, ``We're not going to be able toplay. He's not around to ask. Sounds like fun though.''   Steve Goldstein, spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan,controlled his chuckles to come up with a more serious response,saying, ``Manuel Lujan has known George Bush for 20 years, and ifhe needs to reach the president, all he has to do is call.''   Bennett's deputy chief of staff, David Tell, said, ``What's thebig deal? It's just a joke,'' but sounded relieved to learn theadministration spokesmen had responded with laughter.   Bennett is known for his occasionally sharp-edged humor andcutting comments, and they have gotten him in trouble in the past.   During an education summit in September in Charlottesville, Va.,Bennett moderated a closed session with a number of governors andlater publicly summed up what had been discussed.   ``There was pap _ standard Democratic pap,'' Bennett said.``There was standard Republican pap, and there was stuff thatrhymes with pap on both sides too.''   Two days later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidBennett had been rebuked by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.</TEXT></DOC>
