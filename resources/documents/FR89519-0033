Background</ITAG>Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Act) (42 U.S.C.1437f) authorizes a housing assistance program to aid lower income familiesin renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Assistance payments arelimited by Fair Market Rents (FMRs) (or payment standards based on FMRsin the Housing Voucher Program) established by HUD for different areas.In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to rentprivately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest(non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities. The FMRs proposed in this Notice govern the following Section 8 HousingAssistance Payments Programs: the Section 8 Existing Housing CertificateProgram under Part 882 (Subparts A and B), including space rentals by ownersof manufactured homes (Subpart F), the Moderate Rehabilitation Programunder Part 882 (Subparts D and E), the Section 8 Housing Assistance Programfor Projects with HUD-insured or HUD-held Mortgages under Part 886 (SubpartA), as well as for existing housing under the Section 8 Housing AssistanceProgram for the Disposition without Substantial Rehabilitation of HUD-ownedProjects under Part 886 (Subpart C). In addition, FMRs are used to establishpayment standards for the Housing Voucher Program.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedures for the Development of FMRs</ITAG>Section 8(c) of the Act requires the Secretary of HUD to publish FMRs periodically,but not less frequently than annually. The Department's regulations providethat HUD will develop FMRs by publishing proposed FMRs for public comment,analyzing the public comment, and publishing final FMRs. (See 24 CFR 888.115.)Final FY-1990 FMRs will be published on or before October 1, 1989, as requiredby section 8(c)(1) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Fair Market Rent Schedules</ITAG>This document proposes revised Fair Market Rents, which reflect estimatedrent levels as of April 1, 1990. Schedules at the end of this documentlist the FMR levels for Existing Housing (Schedule B) and ManufacturedHome Spaces in the Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate Program (ScheduleD). FMRs for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program are 120 percent of theSchedule B Existing Housing Fair Market Rents (see 24 CFR 882.408(a) and888.113(e)(1)). The FMR for a Single Room Occupancy (SRO) unit in the Section8 Existing Housing Certificate Program is 75 percent of the zero-bedroomFMR listed in Schedule B. The FMR for an SRO unit in the Moderate Rehabilitationprogram is 75 percent of the Moderate Rehabilitation FMR for zero-bedroomunit. The payment standard amount for an SRO unit in the Housing VoucherProgram is 75 percent of the zero-bedroom FMR listed in Schedule B or theHUD approved community-wide exception rent.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Method Used to Develop FMRs</ITAG>The criteria used by HUD in developing the FMRs are: (1) The 45th percentilerent (that is, the rent below which 45 percent of the standard qualityrental housing units are distributed); (2) Rents based on units occupiedby recent movers (households who moved within two years before the dateof the survey data used in these calculations); and (3) Exclusion fromthe data base of public housing units and recently completed housing (unitsbuilt within two years of the survey dates). (See 24 CFR 888.113.)In establishing the proposed FMRs, HUD uses the most accurate data available.Data used to compute the FY-1990 FMRs include the 1980 Census data, post-1980American Housing Survey (AHS) data and reliable area specific data submittedby public commenters.The proposed FMRs were calculated by updating last year's final FMRs oneadditional year to April 1, 1990 based on the most recent CPI data availableon average annual changes for rents and for utilities. The FMRs have beencalculated for each Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA), MetropolitanStatistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan county.This year's proposed FMRs incorporate the results of the 1985 and 1986metropolitan area AHSs. Based on a case-by-case analysis of these surveys,HUD is proposing to modify the base FMRs for some areas.The Department is proposing to decrease the FMRs for six areas: BeaverCounty, PA PMSA; Boston, MA PMSA; Detroit, MI PMSA; New Orleans, LA MSA;Oakland, CA PMSA; Pittsburgh, PA PMSA.Three AHS areas have proposed FMRs with smaller increases than would havebeen made using only the CPI adjustments: Phoenix, AZ MSA; Portland, ORPMSA; Washington, DC-MD-VA PMSA.Eight AHS areas have proposed FMR increases that are larger than the CPIincreases: Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN PMSA; Dallas, TX PMSA; Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood-PompanoBreach, FL PMSA; Fort Worth, TX PMSA; Miami-Hialeah, FL PMSA; Philadelphia,PA-NJ PMSA; San Antonio, TX MSA; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL MSA.The FMRs for the Houston, Galveston-Texas City, and Brazoria, TX PMSAsand for the State of Alaska are again being proposed for decreases as theresult of further declines in their CPI surveys. The proposed FMRs forthe Denver and Boulder, CO PMSAs reflect decreases that are the combinedresult of a downward adjustment indicated by the most recent AHS data andthe decrease in the local CPI. The local CPI for the Dallas and Fort Worth,TX PMSAs also continued to decline in the past year, but, as indicatedabove, the proposed FMRs have been increased to reflect an adjustment inthe base rent required by the new AHS data.Decreases are being proposed for the FMRs in the Richland-Kennewick-PascoMSA and Cowlitz County FMR areas in the State of Washington, and in theColumbia, Missouri MSA, based on the results of local rental surveys thatwere conducted under the direction of the HUD Regional Office in responseto concerns that the current FMRs for these areas were too high.The FMRs for the Salem-Gloucester, MA PMSA remain unchanged, based on theDepartment's evaluation of the most recent CPI and AHS data which suggestthat the current FMRs, including previously approved modifications resultingfrom public comments, are appropriate.This year's proposed FMRs for manufactured home spaces were calculatedby updating last year's FMRs to April 1, 1990, using the most current averageannual change in the CPI residential rent index (with heating costs includedin the rent factored out). As a result of decreases in the CPI, FMRs forthe following areas are proposed for decrease: Denver, CO PMSA; Boulder-Longmont,CO PMSA; Dallas, TX PMSA; Fort Worth-Arlington, TX PMSA; Houston, TX PMSA;Galveston-Texas City, TX PMSA; Brazoria, TX PMSA; and all areas in theState of Alaska.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Request for Comments</ITAG>The Department seeks public comment on FMR levels for specific areas. Commentson FMR levels must include sufficient information (including local dataand a full description of the methodology used) to justify any proposedchanges. Changes may be proposed in all or any of the unit sizes on theschedule. Recommendations and supporting data must reflect the rent levelsthat exist within the entire market area (Metropolitan Statistical Area,Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, or nonmetropolitan county).Local rental market surveys must show the 45th percentile rent levels.To be representative, the local data must exclude units built within thelast two years of the survey, should include only standard quality rentalhousing units, should not be drawn solely from vacant units, and shouldapproximate the same proportion of units by structure type (for example,highrise or single family detached) and date of construction as existsin the total local inventory. Since the Department's data base includesonly recent movers, where possible, commenters may wish to submit surveysbased only on recent movers.Local rental market surveys may be conducted to cover all bedroom sizes,or only selected bedroom sizes. Surveys that cover only two-bedroom unitsare acceptable if rent proposals for other size units are consistent withestablished HUD differentials by bedroom size, or if other pertinent dataare supplied to support the proposals for other size units. When three-and four-bedroom units are surveyed, the following procedure must be usedto determine appropriate FMR proposals: (1) Determine the 45th percentilerents for the three- and four-bedroom units surveyed, (2) multiply the45th percentile three-bedroom rent by 1.087 to determine the three-bedroomFMR, and (3) multiply the four-bedroom rent by 1.077 to determine the four-bedroomFMR. The use of these factors will produce the same upward adjustmentsin the rent differentials by bedroom size as those applied to the rentdifferentials for three- and four-bedroom units in the HUD methodology.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment requiredby the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4374) is unnecessary,since the statutorily required establishment and review of fair marketrents is categorically excluded from the Department's National EnvironmentPolicy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(1).Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Undersignedhereby certifies that this Notice does not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs reflectthe rents for similar quality units in the area. Therefore, FMRs do notchange the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not inthe Section 8 program.This document does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations issuedon February 17, 1981. Analysis of the document indicates that it does not(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.156, Lower-IncomeHousing Assistance Program (Section 8).Accordingly, the Fair Market Rent Schedules are proposed to be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
