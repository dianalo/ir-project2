The commissioner, Zemah Ishai, said the level of the lake, knownin Hebrew as Kinneret, was less than 2.75 inches away from thelevel at which continued pumping would destroy the reserve.   Ishai told Israel radio that he ordered water supplied insteadfrom underground water reservoirs. Besides the lake, Israel alsopumps water from two aquifers, but they are near empty from severalyears of dry winters.   Israel radio said the northern port city of Haifa was expectedto suffer water supply problems because of the decision.   Ishai said Israel was negotiating with Turkey to import water tohelp fill used-up reserves.   ``We have a problem of shortage, of an accumulated deficit inthe water economy for dozens of years ... the demand in Israel isgrowing and the welcome immigration will increase the demand,''Ishai said.   Israel expects a million Soviet Jewish immigrants to havearrived by the end of 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
