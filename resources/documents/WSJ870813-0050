Separately, prices of seasoned Eurodollar bonds were little changed.    Syndication windows opened after Tuesday's portion of the U.S. Treasury's refunding appeared to have gone reasonably well, dealers said. &quot;The markets showed a bit more strength, with slight underpinning from Treasurys,&quot; said an official at one large U.S. bank.    British equity markets also firmed after a period of volatility, encouraging a successful #100 million ($157.5 million) convertible offering by Grand Metropolitan PLC, a U.K. food, liquor and hotel concern, through Swiss Bank Corp. International.    Although many dealers considered the U.S. dollar market risky, the Nordic Investment Bank managed a respectable syndication of $100 million of 8 3/8%, four-year Eurobonds through Mitsubishi Finance International Ltd.    The multilateral development lender appeared to benefit from its familiarity in the markets and its triple-A rating on debt outstanding, dealers said. Launched at a spread of 61 basis points over U.S. Treasurys, the issue spurred moderate demand.    Three issues were denominated in Canadian dollars, which trade in sympathy with the U.S. dollar. Dealers said there is demand for such bonds in Switzerland, the Benelux countries and West Germany, where investors like the relatively high coupons but are growing less interested in Australian dollar bonds, issued this year in record amounts.    &quot;There's a re-emergence of retail demand driving these issues,&quot; said a Canadian dollar bond specialist, noting that Canadian borrowings are being swapped into floating-rate financings at rates of about 30 to 35 basis points below the London interbank offered rate.    Of the new Canadian issues, most interest was focused on Berliner Bank's 75 million dollars ($56.4 million) of 10 1/4%, four-year Eurobonds, priced at 101.30, or a launch spread of about 34 basis points over Canadian government issues. Led by Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd., the issue was particularly appealing to Berlin residents because of a local tax exemption giving them a yield pick-up.    Bayernhypo Finance N.V.'s 65 million dollars of 10 3/8%, five-year Eurobonds, led by Banque Paribas Capital Markets, also was seen as a strong contender.    But the competition was expected to slow placement for GMAC Canada Ltd.'s 100 million dollars of 10 3/8%, five-year Eurobonds, led by Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd. However, a UBS official said that &quot;the GMAC name is known to a broad base of investors,&quot; and that demand would be wider geographically than for the others.    Grand Metropolitan's 15-year convertible bonds indicated a coupon of 6% to 6 1/4% at par, and a conversion premium of 18% to 22%. </TEXT></DOC>
