(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The steeple stands upright amid thetornado-tossed rubble of Grace Presbyterian Church, but it is onthe floor, not the roof _ a symbol of the damage to this rural townand its determination to rebuild.   ``We are going to have a prayer meeting,'' church memberCharlotte Hollingsworth said Wednesday as she searched the debrisfor church records and hymn books. ``We are dragging out chairs tohave a service on the lawn, or somewhere.''   The roof was torn out from underneath the steeple by Tuesday'spredawn tornado, which left a 12-mile path of destruction in thisNorth Florida town of 3,500 residents. Four people were killed andat least 18 injured.   Preliminary damage estimates ranged up to $27 million.   ``No event, with the exception of World War II, affected peoplelike yesterday,'' said T.C. Merchant Jr., 72, editor of The MadisonEnterprise-Review. ``It looked like some 500-pound bombs droppedout there.''   State damage-assessment teams surveyed the area 50 miles east ofTallahassee to support a state application for federal aid, anddamage figures were expected today, said Dick Morgan, spokesman forthe state Department of Community Affairs.   Insurance adjusters took pictures and videotapes of the damage,and utility crews replaced damaged power lines and poles.   The American Red Cross reported 17 homes destroyed and 30heavily damaged by the tornado. Chris Floyd, Red Cross damageassessment coordinator, said residential damage ranged from$600,000 to $700,000.   But Hugh Ross, claims manager with the Florida Farm Bureauinsurance office in Gainesville, said he thought residentialdamages would be at least $2 million.   ``We haven't found anything yet that could be calledsalvageable,'' said James Rowe, 53, whose home was demolished.``We've got basic coverage. I'm sure, like everybody else, we don'thave enough to cover everything.   ``The good Lord helped us accumulate what little we did have,and he will help us again. ... We're so glad to be out of thisalive,'' Rowe said.   Meanwhile, William H. McCoy, president of North Florida JuniorCollege, said the campus lost at least three buildings and ninewere heavily damaged. He estimated fixing or replacing them,including a nearly completed regional library, could cost $20million to $25 million.   Damage at a shopping mall, chicken farm, utilities and otherproperty hadn't been calculated.   A disaster declaration signed by Gov. Bob Martinez on Tuesdayallowed state agencies to provide equipment and cleanup crews. Morethan 100 inmates from the region's jails were organized into roadgangs, said Madison County Sheriff Joe Peavy.   The state's worst tornado since 1966 killed four people in aminutes. Three others remained hospitalized Wednesday night.</TEXT></DOC>
