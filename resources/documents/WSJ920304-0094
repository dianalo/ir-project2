The high court's unanimous ruling was the latest in aseries of recent decisions bolstering federal judges' powerto impose fines or other sanctions on litigants who filefrivolous suits or harass opponents with voluminous motions.</LP><TEXT>   The justices ruled on a case involving a protracted legalbattle between Coastal Corp., a Houston-based energy holdingcompany, and an in-house lawyer the company fired seven yearsago. The lawyer, Donald Willy, sued Coastal in a Texas statecourt, claiming he was fired because he had objected to thecompany's alleged violation of environmental laws.   Coastal denied the charge and succeeded in getting thelawsuit moved from the state court to a federal court inHouston. Corporate defendants generally prefer to litigate infederal courts rather than state courts, which are perceivedas more sympathetic to individual plaintiffs.   Mr. Willy argued that his case shouldn't have beenswitched to federal court because he hadn't made a claimunder federal law. Nevertheless, the court said it hadjurisdiction to hear the case and dismissed Mr. Willy'slawsuit as meritless.   The judge also accused Mr. Willy and his lawyer at thetime of creating &quot;a blur of absolute confusion&quot; with variousfilings, including a 1,200-page unindexed document the judgecalled &quot;a conscious and wanton affront to the judicialprocess.&quot; The judge ordered Mr. Willy and his attorneyjointly to pay Coastal's legal fees of $22,625. It is unusualfor clients to be made responsible for their lawyers'actions. That Mr. Willy himself was a lawyer and personallyinvolved in shaping his court strategy made him morevulnerable to sanction.   After being punished, Mr. Willy replaced his lawyer andappealed. The federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled thatthe federal trial court didn't have jurisdiction over thecase. The appeals court, however, affirmed the imposition ofsanctions, although it instructed the trial judge torecalculate the amount of legal fees owed. The trial judgethen lowered the penalty to $19,307, and the appeals courtaffirmed the action.   Mr. Willy appealed to the Supreme Court, contending thatthe trial court exceeded its constitutional authority when itimposed a sanction in a case over which it didn't havejurisdiction. In an opinion written by Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist, the high court rejected the argument, concludingthat federal courts may police litigants' behavior -- andmake them pay for it -- even when it is later ruled that thecourts didn't have jurisdiction in such cases. &quot;The interestin having rules of procedure obeyed . . . does not disappear&quot;in a case such as Mr. Willy's, the high court said.   Michael Maness, Mr. Willy's current lawyer, said in aninterview that his client plans to pursue his unlawful-firingclaim in Texas state court. (Willy vs. Coastal Corp.)</TEXT></DOC>
