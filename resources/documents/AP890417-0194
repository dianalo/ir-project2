But the thieves failed to give further instructions, no ransomwas paid and the location of the remaining two paintings _ ``WiltedSunflowers'' and an early version of the Dutch impressionist'sworld famous ``The Potato Eaters'' _ remains a mystery, policespokesman Sgt. Theo Reus told The Associated Press.   He said the painting ``The Loom'' was recovered unharmed onApril 6 in the trunk of a car parked near the home of R.W.D.Oxenaar, director of the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum in thiseastern Dutch village.   Total value of the three works taken after a museum window wassmashed on Dec. 12 has been estimated at $100 million to $125million.   Recovery of ``The Loom'' followed almost a month of secretnegotiations between Oxenaar and the thieves, Reus said.   He said that on March 13, the crooks sent Oxenaar a writtendemand for a $2.5 million ransom in exchange for the threepaintings.   The letter drew no response because it contained no proof thesender was in possession of the paintings, he added.   On March 22, a man telephoned Oxenaar asking, ``Why did you notrespond to my letter?'' and threatening to burn all threepaintings, Reus reported.   A week later, he said, Oxenaar was mailed a recent photograph of``Wilted Sunflowers'' that experts said was genuine, and on April6, Oxenaar was called and told where ``The Loom'' had been left.   ``They (the thieves) may have thought just a photograph wasn'tconvincing enough,'' the sergeant said.   He said the thieves called Oxenaar last Monday to arrange fordelivery of the ransom money, but did not follow up as promisedwith further instructions.   Reus said Monday of efforts to recover the masterpieces, ``Wehaven't really found anything _ just one painting and that wasgiven to us.''</TEXT></DOC>
