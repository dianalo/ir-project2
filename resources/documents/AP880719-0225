The 20-minute video being distributed in the Democratic NationalConvention complex hits Dukakis on issues ranging from the deathpenalty to tax increases to saying the pledge of allegiance inschool.   It goes to great lengths to link Dukakis with former PresidentJimmy Carter and contains some of the most strident assaultslaunched to date between Bush and Dukakis.   ``But it's not just military muscle that Dukakis opposes,'' anarrator says. ``He seems to challenge American patriotism itself.''   In a statement distributed by a group called Americans for Bush_ described as an ``independent project of the National SecurityPAC'' _ the Bush backers said it was targeted at conservativeDemocrats who have backed President Reagan in the past twoelections.   The theme of the video is ``experience vs. experiments'' andtakes Dukakis to task for a prison furlough program ``that releasedcriminals for the weekend'' and attacked him for vetoing a billdealing with the pledge of allegiance in schools.   ``In his home state of Massachusetts, birthplace of the Americanrevolution, Dukakis vetoed a bill requiring schoolchildren topledge allegiance to our flag,'' the narrator said.   In one segment, the camera pans over the field of Democraticpresidential candidates, scanning all of the group but freezing onDukakis and Jesse Jackson. Most polls taken when the vicepresidential nomination was still an open question showed Jacksonbadly damaging Democratic hopes of winning the election.   Organizers of the effort said they had scheduled a preview ofthe video at the Georgia World Congress Center, adjacent to theconvention hall and home base for media organizations covering theconvention.   Floyd Brown, who described himself as a consultant to the group,said Democratic National Committee officials halted the preview.   DNC spokesman Mike McCurry did not immediately return two phonecalls seeking comment.</TEXT></DOC>
