As part of the solution to that problem, the 44-year-old president of American Airlines' flight attendants union -- who has logged her share of miles during a 25-year career as an attendant -- flies twice a week from Dallas to Los Angeles to attend law school.    &quot;We need to have union leaders who know more than strike and picket,&quot; she says about her work on her degree. Her plan in the American negotiations has been to mount a corporate campaign, a &quot;clean&quot; job action she feels her largely middle-class membership would more be likely to support. And a law degree would help.    The feisty, stocky Ms. Gibbs seems born to crash through barriers that stand in the way of what she wants to accomplish. She doesn't have an undergraduate degree, so she attends law school at the University of West Los Angeles, where she was admitted without one. Now, she's putting herself to the test in the battle to end the two-tier system, a campaign that will be difficult because the pilots union doesn't support her Association of Professional Flight Attendants.    She's leading her 10,000 members into the dispute with tenacity and eagerness. &quot;She's tough,&quot; says union board member Sandra Muehlig, a flight attendant from Washington. &quot;We knew these would be tough negotiations and we needed a real leader.&quot;    The American negotiations are being watched by other flight attendants and airlines as an indication of whether the two-tier wages will survive in other contracts, many of which are up for negotiation soon. &quot;It's very significant to us,&quot; said Vicki Frankovich, president of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, which represents Trans World Airlines' attendants. &quot;American was the first to introduce the two-tier wages and it will be fitting if they are the first to abolish it.&quot;    For Ms. Gibbs, the battle is also a personal campaign against what she sees as the development of a two-class system in this country. American and other companies, she says, have tried to erase attendants' awareness of economic class issues by creating a mystique that their work is glamorous. But then, she says, the airlines created a two-class work force with their two-tier wages, which American used to set the pay of its most junior attendants 37% below that of employees hired before 1983. &quot;It's getting to be a polarized group out there,&quot; she says.    Ms. Gibbs needs to satisfy the demands of the lower-paid, younger B-scale attendants. They are rapidly becoming the majority at the union and will have the votes soon to keep her in or kick her out of office.    She maintains that the younger group recognizes the two-class issue more clearly than the higher-paid workers. In one recent union newsletter she published a drawing of Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of American's parent, AMR Corp., with pie on his face. &quot;Crandall's getting more than his fair share of the American Airlines pie,&quot; the caption proclaimed.    Some A-scale attendants were incensed. &quot;They can't believe that Mr. Crandall would do that to them,&quot; says Ms. Gibbs. But &quot;the B-scalers looked at that picture and had no question what side they were on,&quot; she says.    Ms. Gibbs says that up to now class consciousness has been absent among flight attendants because many of them come from middle-class, managerial families like her own. She grew up in Missouri with her parents, who owned a furniture and TV business. Before heading to Texas as a flight attendant at 19, she worked through her childhood and teen-age years with her five brothers and sisters as circus acrobats.    At American, she has been suspended twice. The most recent suspension was for 10 days in 1986 after she was accused of hitting a company negotiator during an intense bargaining session. Ms. Gibbs says she accidentally struck the man when she turned around as he was running up behind her. She has challenged the suspension in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas. The case is pending. The earlier suspension was 20 years ago and also took place during a bargaining session.    American Airlines officials decline to comment on Ms. Gibbs's leadership. &quot;We feel it is inappropriate for us to comment on the effectiveness of a union official,&quot; says a company spokesman. But last week, another company spokesman called her crusade to eliminate the two-tier system &quot;Star Trek city.&quot; The company has also maintained she doesn't have the support of the union.    Ms. Gibbs's role at the union has been controversial. A sizable faction of the union opposes her battle with the company and her militancy. Other attendants publish an opposition newsletter that argues for a more conciliatory stance toward the company.    In waging the current fight against American, Ms. Gibbs has organized a so-called corporate campaign. The union says it won't strike, but will work to gain the sympathy of the company's lenders, passengers and other business partners through informational picketing and attending annual meetings. The union is also planning to ask union sympathizers nationwide to cancel insurance policies at companies that hold American stock, fly other airlines and withdraw bank accounts from American's lenders.    American has shown its displeasure with the strategy, firing 20 attendants last week for passing out leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The flight attendants have challenged the firings in federal court.    Ms. Gibbs is also involved in an effort by flight attendants unions around the country to form a national union. She says she might seek a position as a leader in such a group. But she says she might also move into politics. &quot;That's where you make mountains move,&quot; she says. </TEXT></DOC>
