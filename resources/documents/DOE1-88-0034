<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0034 </DOCNO><TEXT>Over the past fifteen years of high-energy physics, electron-positronannihilation has been the most productive of all reactions probing thefundamental interactions. The e{sup +}e{sup {minus}} annihilation processis unique in offering at the same time copious production of novel particles,low backgrounds from more conventional physics, and the most efficientuse of the energy which an accelerator provides. These features haveallowed the detailed characterization of the charm and bottom quark-antiquarksystems and the unambiguous discovery of gluon jets---the crucial ingredientsin the establishment of Quantum Chromodynamics as the correct theoryof the strong interactions---as well as the discovery of the tau leptonand confirmation of the weak and electromagnetic properties of all thequarks and leptons at high energy. Over the past few years, experimentswill begin at SLC and LEP, and we anticipate new discoveries from thedetailed study of the Z{sup 0} resonance. It is time, then to begin tothink out how one might continue this mode experimentation to still higherenergies. This document is the report of a committee convened by theDirector of SLAC, Burton Richter, to set out the major physics goalsof an e{sup +}e{sup {minus}} collider in the energy range 600 GeV-1 TeV,corresponding to the next feasible step in accelerator technology. Thecommittee was charged with the task of outlining the main experimentsthat such a collider might carry out and the requirements which thoseexperiments place on the accelerator design. 106 refs., 105 figs., 13tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
