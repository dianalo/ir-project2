(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jack Kemp calls the vice president of theUnited States an ``embarrassment'' to the Republican party. PaulSimon asks whether Democrats can trust a man who has supportednuclear power and the B-1 bomber.   Candidates are on the attack as the New Hampshire primarycampaign rushes to its climax Tuesday.   For several of the dozen candidates bidding for support in thefirst presidential primary of this election year, Wednesday loomsas a day for unpacking and putting their White House dreams instorage.   That prospect lends an air of desperation to their tactics andheightens the temptation to lash out at the opposition, especiallythose leading in the polls.   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Texas professor, saidnegative ads are appearing earlier than in past presidentialcontests.   While candidates may get some short-term benefit from savagingtheir opponents, she warned, ``anyone who goes on the attack riskslooking non-presidential.''   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas chipped away at Vice President GeorgeBush's once formidable lead in national polls by suggesting thatBush was more bystander than participant in Reagan administrationcouncils.   That tactic worked well in Iowa and now Bush, looking more likean underdog, has adopted it in New Hampshire and is portraying Doleas a Senate leader who has failed to produce the votes to sustainReagan vetoes or to get Robert H. Bork a seat on the Supreme Court.   Most of the attacks stay within a limit that enables theattacker to claim he's using comparative, not negative advertising.   The most egregious example of an attack that went beyond normalbounds was material distributed by supporters of former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson that suggested a member of Rep. JackKemp's family had an abortion.   The material, distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters,asked, ``Does he deny that his own family was involved in anabortion?'' Kemp aide Mary Brunette said the allegation was ``alie. There's absolutely no truth in it whatsoever.''   Connie Snapp, a Robertson spokeswoman, said there was apossibility a campaign worker in Illinois was involved indistributing the anti-Kemp material.   During Sunday's GOP debate, Kemp acted outraged when Bush said,``Give peace a chance,'' in Afghanistan.   ``That is a embarrassment,'' said Kemp, ``a Republican talkingabout give peace a chance.''   On Monday, Kemp elaborated on his wrath. ```Give peace a chance'was the rallying cry of the Gephardt-Simon-Jim Wright-wing of theDemocratic party that cut off all aid to the freedom fighters inCentral America,'' the New York congressman said. ``It was anembarrassment to our party to have our vice president talking likeJim Wright or Dick Gephardt.''   Kemp also has attacked Bush and Dole with literature claimingboth would raise taxes and cut Social Security benefits.   Jamieson said the rule is that front-runners don't attack.   She cited an ad run by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as aclassic front-runner appeal.   ``I'm for more trade,'' says Dukakis, the leader in all polls ofNew Hampshire Democrats.   Dukakis comes across as taking a positive position that quietlyreminds voters that another candidate _ Rep. Richard Gephardt ofMissouri _ has a trade policy his opponents have calledprotectionist.   Gephardt came out of Iowa a winner and quickly was attacked inads run by Simon. Those ads cited Gephardt votes in favor ofnuclear power and the B-1 and said they were inconsistent with thecongressman's current positions.   During the Democrats' debate Saturday, Gephardt complained toSimon:   ``When you say in a TV ad, `Who do you trust?' you're reallybringing into play motives, motivation and whether or not somebodyis reliable and I think that goes over the line. We can disagree onissues.''   Jesse Jackson called the complaints about attacks ``campaignfatigue, this tit for tat on how bruised I am.''   But Ms. Jamieson said there was a legitimate distinction.   ``I don't like distinction between positive and negative,'' shesaid. ``You have fair and unfair. Anything that distorts one's ownor an opponent's record is unfair.''   Once Dole became the big winner in Iowa and erased Bush's biglead in New Hampshire polls, he became the target of attacks.   Du Pont, on the brink of extinction if he doesn't score abreakthrough Tuesday, contends Dole would raise taxes. That's aboutthe worst thing a Republican can say about another Republican inthis campaign.   To prove his point here in notoriously anti-tax New Hampshire,du Pont thrust a no-tax pledge at Dole during Sunday's debate andsaid, ``Sign it.'' Dole refused.   Bush also has taken up the tax cry against Dole, though he leftit to surrogates.   At a news conference, Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, a Bushbacker, described Dole as ``a waitin', walkin', talkin' taxincrease about to happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
