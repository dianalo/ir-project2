The purpose of the demonstration project is to enhance the ability of theFederal Aviation Administration to recruit and retain experienced, qualifiedemployees in designated occupations in certain hard-to-staff facilities.Improved staffing at these facilities is also expected to result. To accomplish this purpose, this demonstration project proposes to providefor payment of a retention allowance to employees occupying safety-relatedpositions at selected hard-to-staff facilities in the Chicago, New Yorkcity, and Los Angeles areas. The allowance may be as much as 20 percentof an employee's rate of basic pay. The retention allowance is not an additionto the employee's rate of basic pay. However, the retention allowance isconsidered to be part of ``total remuneration'' for the purposes of computingovertime pay entitlements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLAS). The demonstration project would cover employees at participating facilitieswho occupy safety-related positions, such as air traffic controllers, aviationsafety inspectors, and airway facilities maintenance technicians (approximately2,000). The demonstration would run for five years from the date of implementation.On public hearing: A public hearing will be held by OPM at FAA Great LakesRegion Headquarters, O'Hare Lake Office Center, 2300 East Devon Avenue,Room 170, Des Plaines, Illinois, on December 14, 1988, during which interestedpersons or organizations may present their written or oral views on theproposed demonstration project. The hearing will be informal in nature.However, anyone who wishes to testify at the hearing should contact theperson listed under ``For Further Information Contact'' for a specificscheduled time, so that OPM can regulate the course of the hearing andprovide enough time for all interested persons and organizations to presenttheir comments. Priority will be given to those scheduled, and others willbe heard in any remaining available time. Each speaker's presentation willbe limited to 10 minutes. The hearing record will be left open for twoweeks after the conclusion of the hearing to receive additional writtendata, views, and arguments from hearing participants. <ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>The proposed demonstration project plan reads as follows: <ITAG tagnum="85">The Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration DemonstrationProject </ITAG>A proposal for an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) DemonstrationProject Submitted by the Department of Transportation (DOT) <ITAG tagnum="74">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I.

Executive Summary</ITAG>Purpose   The purpose of the demonstration project is to test the effectiveness ofa quarterly retention allowance in recruiting and retaining experienced,qualified employees in selected occupations at hard-to-staff Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) facilities.Participating Facilities   The following ten facilities have been selected for participation in thedemonstration project:<ITAG tagnum="15">Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, Aurora, Illinois</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois (includesAir Traffic Control Tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, Santa Ana, California FarmingdaleFlight Standards District Office, Farmingdale, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California (includesAir Traffic Control Tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Los Angeles Standards District Office, Los Angeles, California</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, Ronkonkoma, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, Westbury, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Flight Standards District Office, Valley Stream, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Teterboro Flight Standards District Office, Teterboro, New Jersey</ITAG>ParticipatingEmployees   The demonstration project will cover employees at the ten participatingfacilities who occupy safety-related positions, such as air traffic controllers,aviation safety inspectors, and airway facilities maintenance technicians.The employees include approximately 1,632 non-supervisory employees andapproximately 327 supervisory employees for a total of approximately 1,959employees as of September, 1988.Labor Participation   Employees covered by this project are represented by three unions: TheNational Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) representing 62.2percent of bargaining unit employees, the Professional Airway Systems Specialists(PASS), representing approximately 13.5 percent of bargaining unit employees,and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), Local 2791,representing approximately 5.5. percent of employees.Proposed Personnel System Change   The invervention is described in detail in the proposal and consists ofa quarterly retention allowance not to exceed 20% of the annual rate ofbasic pay.Implementation and Training   Briefings will be conducted for all employees at the participating facilities  While the project does not affect training directly, it is expected toresult in improvements in the training process because the overall experiencelevel is expected to rise. There will be more fully qualified employeesand fewer trainees.Evaluation Plan A rigorous evaluation will be conducted to assess project outcomes andto evaluate their applicability to other Federal organizations. Becausethe project will be conducted at the ten facilities which have been deemeddifficult to staff, comparison with any non-equivalent control sites wouldbe difficult to interpret. Much of the evaluation will consist of pre-and post-demonstration comparisons. CostsThe estimated costs for the demonstration project for the first year willbe approximately $17.8 million for the ten identified facilities, basedon current pay rates. The estimated cost of the allowance is expected torise to approximately $21.6 million, based on current pay rates, by thefifth year of the project. Benefits of Proposed ProjectThe anticipated benefits of the demonstration project include the fulland stable employment at the selected facilities; more experienced employeesoccupying safety-related positions; higher levels of full-performance-levelemployees; reduced use of overtime. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Introduction</ITAG>A. PurposeThe purpose of the demonstration project is to determine whether pay incentiveswill enhance the ability of the FAA to recruit and retain experienced,qualified employees in designated occupations at certain hard-to-stafffacilities. Staffing levels are expected to improve at these facilities.To accomplish this purpose, this demonstration project proposes to providefor payment of a retention allowance to employees occupying safety-relatedpositions at selected hard-to-staff facilities. The allowance may be asmuch as 20 percent of an employee's rate of basic pay. The retention allowanceis not considered part of an employee's rate of basic pay. However, theretention allowance is considered to be part of ``total remuneration''for the purpose of computing overtime pay entitlements under FLSA. B. Problems With the Present Pay SystemAdequate staffing of FAA facilities with experienced personnel is vitalto ensuring a high level of public safety. As part of its safety responsibilities,FAA is currently engaged in a full-scale effort to increase the size andquality of its safety-related work force. Comprehensive changes are beingmade to the recruitment, pre-employment processing, and the technical trainingprograms and processes. A study of the existing pay system for air trafficcontrollers has identified numerous problems with the inflexibility ofcurrent methods for classifying and compensating these employees. Similarstudies of other safety-related occupations will be undertaken. The resultsand recommendations of these studies will serve as a foundation for futureproposals to revise current laws and regulations. Once implemented, allthese changes should improve DOT's ability to preserve the safest, mostcomplex aviation system in the worlds. However, DOT is still confrontedwith a more persistent and immediate problem_some facilities continue tobe hard to staff. Staffing of certain facilities is a problem that has plagued DOT and FAAfor many years. Problems associated with staffing include difficulty inattracting adequate numbers of employees, high turnover rates, a low percentageof employees at the full performance level, and high overtime usage. Theseproblems also contribute to difficulty in granting employees' request tomove to other facilities, difficulty in approving annual leave requests,and low morale. The agency has tried many approaches at hard-to-staff facilities, withinthe limitations of existing laws and regulations, in an effort to solvethese problems, with only limited success. For example, FAA has given additionalcredit for promotion consideration to employees who have experience ata variety of facilities; developed a ``farm team'' system of progressionwhere surrounding facilities feed personnel into larger facilities; reorganizedfacilities and job functions; developed revised classification standardsand re-evaluated positions; conducted nationwide recruiting campaigns;developed a cross-option recruitment program for air traffic control specialists;guaranteed employees who are not successful at the most complex facilitiesthe opportunity to return to their former facility; and guaranteed employeesa choice of duty assignment after a specified length of service and attainmentof full performance level. Yet, in spite of these efforts, staffing diffcultiescontinue to plague certain facilities. Those facilities which are difficult to staff are characterized by somecombination of the following conditions:andbullet; Cost-of-living. The initial cost of a house, annual real estatetaxes, and costs associated with utilities and consumer goods act as majordeterrents to employees locating in high-cost areas.andbullet; Location. Many individuals do not wish to live in large citiessuch as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. It becomes more difficult toattract and retain employees in those locations due to an increase in thenumber of comparably graded facilities that are located in areas such asTampa, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Phoenix, and Denver.andbullet; Commute. In many instances, employees must commute 30 to 50 milesor more to work in heavy traffic in order to reside in acceptable and affordablehome. andbullet; Weather. The climate in northern locations like Chicago adds tothe complexity of safety-related work and may not appeal to as many individualsas the climate in ``sun belt'' locations.andbullet; Complexity of the work. The complexity of the operation at somefacilities can intimidate many potential candidates and discourage themfrom transferring to the facility. For example, in 1987, Chicago O'HareInternational Airport was one of the busiest airports in the nation. Thereare 23 possible runway configurations at O'Hare, many more than at mostmajor airports, with many configurations including aircraft operating onintersecting runways. There are 28 satellite airports in the Chicago area,which adds to the complexity of controlling air traffic at O'Hare.andbullet; Disparities in workload. Employees at different facilities mayhave considerably different workloads but still be classified at the samelevel and receive the same pay. For example, all full performance levelcontrollers at each facility level are classified at the same grade althoughthe amount of air traffic activity at the most active tower is significantlygreater than that of the ``lowest'' active tower at the same facility level.andbullet; Competition with private industry. In some areas which have alarge concentration of aviation industry companies, competition for employeesqualified for many airway facilities positions and for aviation safetyinspectors is very high. Private sector firms often can offer considerablyhigher salaries than the federal government, and can therefore attractmany current and potential FAA employees.Several of these problems are strictly monetary in nature, i.e., the highcost of living, the availability of affordable and conveniently locatedhousing, and competition with private industry. Pay incentives should theroeticallyhelp in attracting and retaining employees who are primarily influencedby these factors. The other factors are more difficult to address, sincethe agency has not control over the weather, commuting patterns, or generalundesirability of a particular community. Neither can the agency simplydecide to move work activities to more desirable locations, since the locationswhere the agency provides its services are dictated by the public's demandfor air service.FAA's staffing problems have captured the attention of numerous publicand private sector organizations and individuals, including members ofCongress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), the news media, and theAviation Safety Commission.On June 2, 1988, in testimony given before the Subcommittee on Aviationof the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, the GAO reportedthat ``* * * Personnel rules do not permit FAA to correct significant workforce shortages, especially in high cost locations.'' In its report datedOctober 8, 1987, the Senate Appropriations Committee directed the administrationto develop proposals to eliminate the constraints found under current personnellaw and regulations that prohibit FAA from providing incentives to compensatefor cost-of-living or similar factors in order to provide the needed staffat certain hart-to-staff facilities. Additionally, H.R. 4650 and S. 1600,bills introduced during the current congressional session, provide forthe FAA to develop compensation systems tailored to ``* * * facilitatethe use of flexibilities in assigning rates of basic pay in order to betterrecruit, motivate and retain a well-qualified work force'' (S. 1600); andto ``* * * establish a pay rate and grade system * * * designed to * ** recruit and retain a well-qualified workforce * * *'' (H.R. 4650).This demonstration project addresses problems in the pay area.C. Proposed Personnel System ChangeMany researchers have shown that pay is one of the most important and influentialincentives an employer can offer in an attempt to alter employee behavior.Offering a pay allowance at hard-to-staff facilities could influence potentialemployees to accept or overlook the negative factors associated with apracticular facility or geographic area. It can be expected that more employeeswill be motivated to apply for positions at the participating facilities,and to remain in those facilities for longer periods of time. The demonstrationproject will test whether a retention allowance of up to 20 percent ofbasic pay will help to attract and retain experienced employees for hard-to-stafffacilities. The demonstration project provides for payment of a retention allowanceto employees occupying saftey-related positions at ten hard-to-staff facilities.The retention allowances will be paid at the end of the 6th, 13th, 19th,and 26th pay periods of each calendar year. Except as explained below,the quarterly retention allowance will be computed as a specified percentage(not to exceed 20 percent on an annual basis) of the employee's rate ofbasic pay in effect at the beginning of the quarterly allowance period.In the case of an employee who is initially employed in or reassigned toa covered position after the beginning of the quarterly allowance period,the basis for the computation will be the rate of basic pay in effect onthe date the emplolyee was employed in or reassigned to the covered position.The amount will then be prorated on the basis of the number of full weeksof employment in a covered position during the period. In the case of apart-time employee, the quarterly retention allowance will be proratedon the basis of the employee's scheduled tour of duty as of the beginningof the quarterly allowance period (or the date of initial employment inor assignment to a covered position). Allowances will not be prorated onthe basis of hours worked or hours in a pay status. Except as provided below, employees who leave covered positions duringa quarterly allowance period will not receive an allowance for that period.In the case of an employee who is involuntarily assigned by FAA after thebeginning of a quarterly allowance period to a position at the same orhigher grade level which is not covered by the demonstration project, thequarterly retention allowance for that period will be prorated on the basisof the number of full weeks of employment in a covered position duringthe period. Employees who are absent without leave or suspended duringthe quarterly allowance peirod will not receive an allowance for that period.All covered employees will be told at the beginning of each allowance period(or upon initial employment in or assignment to a covered position) whatthe amount of the allowance for that period will be, and eligible employeeswill receive the full allowance proffered them. The retention allowance is not considered part of an employee's rate ofbasic pay for any purpose. However, the retention allowance is consideredto be part of ``total remuneration'' for the purpose of computing overtimepay entitlements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). AdditionalFLSA overtime pay entitlements deriving from the payment of a quarterlyretention allowance will be paid at the same time the allowance is paid.The allowance may be as much as 20 percent of an employee's rate of basicpay. It is anticipated that all eligible employees will recieve the maximumallowance in the first full year of the project. However, the Directorof OPM and the Secretary of Transportation will periodically assess theprogress made toward the project's objectives. The Secretary, in consultationwith the Director of OPM, may cap allowances below 20% or may discontinuethe allowances altogether if staffing problems are significantly amelioratedor eliminated and allowances are no longer required. The Secretary's decisionsmay apply uniformly to all covered positions or may differentiate amongsites, occupations, or grade levels. Furthermore, the Secretary may authorizethe Administrator of FAA to set allowances, for all or for certain categoriesof covered positions, on an individual, case-by-case basis. Although it does not require waiver of laws or regulations, this personnelsystem change is being conducted as a demonstration project because itinvolves the creation of a new pay system in which retention allowancesserve as an alternative to other pay adjustments. D. Project Goals The demonstration retention allowance is intended to achieve two primarygoals: (1) To attract a sufficient number of experienced, qualified employeesto apply for positions at the selected hard-to-staff facilities; and (2)to retain experienced, qualified employees at these facilities. E. Participating Facilities Numerous factors were considered when designating a facility as ``hard-to-staff''including: Cost-of-living; undesirability of the location; commuting problems;weather conditions; complexity of work; and workload. The facilities selected for the demonstration project represent a crosssection of the causal factors described above. These facilities do nothave all the problems to the same degree, but represent the best groupfor testing the use of pay incentives to solve staffing problems. The following facilities have been selected to participate in the demonstrationproject:<ITAG tagnum="15">Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, Aurora, Illinois ChicagoO'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois (includes Air Traffic ControlTower and Terminal Radar Approach Control)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, Santa Ana, California</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Farmingdale Flight Standards District Office, Farmingdale, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California (includesAir Traffic Control Tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office, Los Angeles, California</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, Ronkonkoma, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, Westbury, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York Flight Standards District Office, Valley Stream, New York</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Teterboro Flight Standards District Office, Teterboro, New Jersey</ITAG>Other facilities may be added to the project during the course of the 5-yeardemonstration period. The process for adding facilities will be the Secretary'srecommendation, the Director's approval, and the publication of a noticein the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at least 30 days in advance of the start of thefirst quarter of eligibility.F.

The processfor adding positions will be the same as that for adding facilities. Theaddition of new facilities and positions may not cause the number of coveredemployees to exceed 5,000.Total current employment in these positions at the ten participating facilitiesis approximately 1,959. Current employment statistics for the selectedfacilities, itemized by series and grade, are provided in Appendix A. G. Labor ParticipationThe employees covered by this proejct are in exclusive bargaining unitsrepresented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA),representing approximately 62.2 percent of bargaining unit employees, theProfessional Airway Systems Specialists (PASS) representing approximately13.5 percent of bargaining unit employees, and the American Federal ofGovernment Employees (AFGE), Local 2791, representing approximately 5.5percent of bargaining unit employees. Meetings to brief all three organizationson the details of the project were held in late September and early October,1988. Further consultations and negotiations with the unions will takeplace during the comment period for this project.DOT is proceeding to fulfill its obligation to consult or negotiate withthe unions, as appropriate, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 4703(f).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Methodology</ITAG>A. Project DesignThe purpose of a demonstration project is to test changes under controlledconditions before making commitments to put them into effect for a widerpopulation of Federal employees. The project at this point is a simplebefore/after design. There are no designated control sites at this timeand much of the analysis will rely on pre/post measures. However, effortswill be made to make comparisons between this treatment and alternativetreatments for comparable staffing problems at other Federal agencies.B. Selection of Demonstration Sites The facilities which have been selected are a sample of a larger groupof FAA facilities which have experienced staffing problems. Among the factorsconsidered in selecting facilities were cost of living, desirability oflocation, weather conditions, complexity of the work, workload, and localmarket competition. C. Project Implementation and Training Briefings on the demonstration project will be conducted for managementofficials in FAA headquarters and regional offices. On-site briefings forall employees will be done at each of the participating facilities andwill include detailed orientation on the background and purpose of theproject, implementation and administrative procedures, and anticipatedresults. These orientations will ensure that all employees have a thoroughunderstanding of the project. Appropriate human resource management andaccounting/payroll organizations will receive detailed orientation andtraining. D. Project Duration The demonstration project is proposed to begin no sooner than 180 daysafter preliminary approval by the Office of Personnel Management and nosooner than 90 days after the final notice has been published. After implementation,the project will be conducted for a period of up to five years. Duringthis period, the staffing situation at each facility participating in theproject will be closely monitored and analyzed. After the five-year activestage of the project the overall results will be analyzed to determinethe success of the project in fulfilling the stated objectives and goals.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Evaluation Plan </ITAG>A rigorous evaluation will be conducted to assess project outcomes andto evaluate their generalizability to other Federal organizations. Becausethe project will be conducted at ten facilities which have been deemeddifficult to staff, comparison with non-equivalent control sites wouldbe difficult to interpret. Much of the evaluation will consist of pre-and post-demonstration comparisons. The evaluation model will postulate both specific and general effects forthe retention allowance. The evaluation will consist of three elements:(1) A formative evaluation to determine whether the project has been implementedas designed and whether the institutional and administrative arrangementsare operating appropriately; (2) assessments of the 5-year experimentalphase, annually as a minimum; and (3) a summative evaluation of the project'soverall impact upon completion of the project. Some baseline data, including vacancy rates, use of overtime, and outputmeasures have been collected in the process of diagnosis. Additional measuresincluding staff experience levels, training requirements, and employeeattitudes will be taken periodically throughout the demonstration. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Costs </ITAG>The estimated costs for the demonstration project for the first year willbe approximately $17.8 million for the ten identified facilities, basedon current pay rates. The estimated cost of the allowance could vary overthe duration of the project but in no case should exceed $21.6 millionfor the ten identified facilities, based on current rates. This estimateassumes little change in job market conditions and an increase in employmentlevels at the participating facilities. Detailed cost estimates by facilityare included in Appendix B. These costs will be offset somewhat by theanticipated reduction in overtime and costs associated with reduction turnoversuch as reduced permanent-change-of-station travel. The demonstration alsoavoids costs that would be incurred by alternative solutions. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Benefits </ITAG>The retention allowances are expected to result in the following benefitsfor the FAA: andbullet; Full and stable employment at the selected facilities. The agencyshould be able to attract a larger number of experienced employees to theparticipating facilities. Once they are on board at the facilities, employeesshould be more likely to remain there for a longer period of time, andturnover will therefore be reduced. andbullet; More experienced employees occupying safety-related positions/highernumbers of full-performance-level employees. The allowance should enablethe agency to attract a larger number of fully-trained employees from otherfacilities. These employees will need less training to become fully qualifiedthan new employees hired from outside the agency. Reduced turnover amongemployees will also increase experience levels. andbullet; Reduced overtime. Higher staffing levels, reduction in turnover,higher experience levels, and more full-performance-level employees shouldresult in a reduction in overtime use.These benefits in turn should help to ensure a continued high level ofsafety. All of these benefits may not be experienced at all of the participatingfacilities, since the staffing problems and their causes vary among thefacilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Responsibilities</ITAG>The Office of Personnel Management has overall responsibility for designingand implementing the evaluation plan (5 U.S.C. 4703(b)(1)(H)) and for monitoringthe evaluation. FAA's Office of the Associate Administrator for Human ResourceManagement (AHR) will have responsibility for conducting and coordinatingthe evaluation to ensure that it is accomplished as planned. Responsibilityfor data collection will be shared by the participating facilities, regionaloffices, the organizations responsible for agency databases, FAA's Officeof Management Systems (AMS), and OPM. Analysis of data will be the responsibilityof AHR and AMS, with additional support to be provided by contractor organizations.Data will also be supplied to OPM on request.Reports will be provided by AHR to the FAA Administrator, the Secretaryof the Transportation, and the Office of Personnel Management, as wellas to the air traffic facilities, airway facilities, and aviation standardsorganizations in FAA. The reports will be provided in a summary mannerand in detail on an annual basis.
