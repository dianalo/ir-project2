Thirty-two comments werereceived. The comments were submitted by domestic tobacco producers' organizations,tobacco trade associations, tobacco dealers, tobacco cooperatives, tobaccoimporters and exporters, tobacco manufacturers, chemical manufacturers,foreign governments, and other interested persons. Ten of the comments supported the proposed rule in its entirety. Othercomments, discussed below, questioned one or more aspects of the proposedrule. This final rule will substitute the term ``prohibited pesticide residue'',which is defined as any pesticide residue exceeding the maximum concentrationof residue for a specific pesticide or combination of pesticides as setforth in andSection;29.427, for the term ``banned pesticide'' (which wasdefined in andSection;29.401(p) as any pesticide which has been canceled,suspended, revoked, or otherwise prohibited under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide and Rodenticide Act). Conforming changes will also be made in two other sections which used theterm ``banned pesticide.'' Thus andSection;29.401(u), the definition of testing,will refer to chemical analysis to determine ``levels of pesticide residues'',rather than ``levels of banned pesticides.'' Also, andSection;29.429, Dispositionof imported tobacco exceeding pesticide residue standards, will refer toany lot which contains ``prohibited pesticide residues'' rather than ``abanned pesticide exceeding the standards.'' This change in terminologyis necessary because ``banned pesticide'' is a term that is used by variousnational and international organizations to refer to pesticides the useof which has been completely prohibited in a particular jurisdiction. Thesechanges are made in order to avoid any possible confusion. Ten comments expressed concern that the elimination of the specific referenceto pesticides which have been canceled, suspended, revoked, or othewiseprohibited under FIFRA could result in the inclusion of pesticides thatare approved for use on tobacco on the list of prohibited pesticide residuesin andSection;29.427. This was not the intent of the proposed rule and wedo not believe this particular concern necessitates a change in our proposalin this regard. When the initial regulations concerning pesticide residues in tobacco wereissued (51 FR 30196, August 22, 1986), it was stated in the supplementaryinformation that the list of pesticides for which residue limits were establishedwould be subject to revision from time to time as the circumstances require.The list comprises those pesticides which are not approved for use on tobaccoin the United States (i.e., those pesticides which have been canceled,suspended, revoked, or otherwise prohibited under FIFRA) but which areknown or believed to be used on tobacco in foreign countries and for whichreliable testing methodologies exist. The proposed rule called for theaddition of six pesticides to the list in andSection;29.427; these were DDE,hexachlorobenzene (HCB), methoxycholor, cypermethrin, methamidophos, andlindane. Four comments objected to the addition of any pesticides to the list inandSection;29.427 and also set forth the commenters' views about the perceivedadverse economic effects of the Act. It is our view that effective implementationof the Act requires that the regulations be revised from time to time aschanges occur in the use of pesticides and as additional information becomesavailable to us. With respect to the specific additions proposed by us, thirteen commentsquestioned the inclusion of methamidophos because that pesticide is a metaboliteof another pesticide, Orthene, which is approved for use on tobacco inthe United States. The manufacturer of Orthene noted that methamidophosoccurs as a plant metabolite from the application of Orthene and that suchresidues cannot always be distinguished from residues of methamidophosapplied by itself. The agency believes that these comments have merit.Accordingly, methamidophos is not included in this final rule. Twelve of the comments questioned the inclusion of lindane, correctly notingthat this pesticide is still approved for use on tobacco plant beds. Theagency believes that these comments have merit. Accordingly, lindane isnot included in this final rule.   The proposed rule also called for the revision of some maximum allowableconcentrations of residues and the establishment of levels for the newly-addedpesticides. With minor modifications, based upon the comments addressingthe proposed revisions, the proposed maximum allowable concentrations ofresidues for individual pesticides and combinations of pesticides are adoptedin this final rule.The maximum allowable concentrations of residues were established in thefollowing manner. The program for testing flue-cured and burley tobaccofor pesticide residues has been under review since its inception. Initially,the maximum allowable concentrations of pesticide residues were establishedby analogy to the residue tolerances established by the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA), for food crops. The agency believes that the program canbe placed upon a footing that is more specific for pesticide residues ontobacco. In establishing new maximum allowable concentrations of residues,we relied upon research conducted by several land-grant universities, informationfrom the Codex Alimentarius Commission, published scientific literature,regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, data from the Department'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) domestic tobaccomonitoring program, and data on pesticide residues in imported tobaccocollected by testing imported tobacco under the present regulations.During the two-and-a-half years that the regulations have been in place,over 14,000 samples of imported flue-cured and burley tobacco have beentested for pesticide residues. The resulting data provides norms for expectedpesticide residue levels. Residues significantly in excess of expectedlevels indicate that good agricultural practices may not have been followedin the production of that tobacco. Consideration has been given to sourcesof pesticide residues which would not be inconsistent with good agriculturalpractices, such as incidental drift from the spraying of adjacent fieldsand unavoidable exposure to contaminated soil and ground water.Some pesticides are persistent and degrade very slowly in the environmentand thus may continue to occur in tobacco for many years after applicationof the pesticide has ceased. Limits for these unavoidable residues willbe based upon the levels that are unavoidable in domestically grown tobacco.The levels for persistent pesticides were derived by analyzing resultsof tobacco monitoring samples taken from various areas of the United States.The pesticides involved are DDT, TDE, DDE, aldrin, dieldrin, toxaphene,heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), formothion,and dibromochloropropane (DBCP).The available data for the pesticides dicamba, 2,4-D, cypermethrin andpermethrin are more limited than that for other pesticides. Although allof the maximum allowable concentrations of residue are subject to changeas new data becomes available, the levels for these pesticides will bedenominated ``temporary'' in order to indicate a greater likelihood ofrevision.Four comments asked that the data used to determine the maximum allowableconcentrations of residues be published for public comment before the finalrule is issued. We do not believe the publication of this data in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is either necessary or practical. We indicatedin our proposed rule that this information was available for public inspectionand it remains available to all interested parties. However, we do notbelieve this final rule should be delayed for this reason.Four comments objected to the establishment of maximum allowable concentrationsof residues for combinations of pesticides, arguing that the combinationscould result in the inappropriate exclusion of tobacco containing onlytrace residues or in inaccurate measurements from the totaling of smallamounts. The agency does not believe that the residue levels for combinationsof pesticides pose any significant problem. Although not expressly statedin terms of combinations, the pre-existing regulations relied upon thatconcept. For example, residues of the pesticides chlordane, formothion,toxaphene, permethrin, DDT, and TDE can be measured only by measuring theircomponent isomers and totaling the individual residue levels. In the two-and-a-halfyears in which the regulations have been in place, no problems have beenencountered in this regard. The measurement of the residues of componentisomers in increments of hundredths of a part per million and the totalingof the levels before rounding-off to the nearest tenth of a part per millionis consistent with the practices of the Food and Drug Administration andthe Environmental Protection Agency. The necessity of totaling the residuelevels of component isomers was taken into account when it was decidedto set the maximum allowable concentrations of residue no lower than 0.1ppm.One comment suggested that, for combinations of pesticides, a minimum amountshould be established for inclusion in the total residue level becausedifferent laboratories may have different lowest detectable levels. Theagency believes, however, that private laboratories which cannot detecta particular pesticide or isomer at the hundredth part per million should,in those instances where such levels would be significant (<T3>i.e.</T3>, where such levels, if present, could result in a total overthat allowed), report the results as inconclusive and importers shouldnot certify the tobacco as being free of prohibited pesticide residues.Three comments concerned the designation of certain proposed maximum concentrationsof residues as ``temporary.'' These suggested that a minimum time periodbe specified before temporary maximum concentrations of residues for pesticidesbecome ``permanent'' in order to give interested parties the opportunityto comment on any modification. The agency believes ample opportunity willbe afforded for comment. Before any change would be made in these regulations,a proposed rule would be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, allowing interested persons an appropriate periodof time to comment. Accordingly, this final rule will not be modified inthat respect.Three comments were received concerning the temporary maximum allowableconcentration of residue for dicamba. Comments from major tobacco manufacturingcompanies and the Pesticide Committee of the Tobacco Workers Conferencesupported the temporary maximum allowable concentration of residue fordicamba in the proposed rule. One comment questioned the increased temporarymaximum allowable concentration of residue because of the sparsity of availableinformation on dicamba residues in tobacco. Dicamba is approved for useon commodities other than tobacco and even under good agricultural practicesmay appear as a residue in tobacco. It is the agency's view that the maximumallowable concentration established in this rule for dicamba should recognizethese factors. The agency recognizes that the available data on dicambais limited and so the residue level should be designated as temporary.Accordingly, this final rule will not modify the residue level specifiedin the proposed rule for dicamba.Four comments questioned the proposed establishment of separate maximumallowable concentration of residue for the o,p and for the p,p isomersof DDT, TDE, and DDE, noting that these classifications would not be consistentwith the reporting procedures of other government agencies. The agencybelieves that these comments have merit. In order to remain consistentwith the reporting procedures of other government agencies, a combinedmaximum allowable concentration of residues will be established in thisfinal rule for all six isomers of DDT (o,p DDT, o,p TDE, o,p DDE, p,p DDT,p,p TDE, and p,p DDE). The maximum concentration of residues for the sumof DDT, TDE, and DDE will be 0.4 ppm, rather than 0.2 ppm each for theo,p and p,p isomers as in the proposed rule.The Act prohibits the entry into the United States of imported flue-curedand burley tobacco which is found to contain prohibited pesticide residues.Tobacco which is not certified by the importer as being free of prohibitedpesticide residues must be tested and found to meet the tobacco pesticideresidue requirements. Tobacco certified as not containing prohibited pesticideresidues is subject to random sampling and testing. If the test resultsare positive, the importer may request a retest. The testing process involvesa delay between the time samples are taken and the time that test resultsare available. In order to prevent the entry and use of tobacco later foundto be contaminated, and to preserve the integrity of the testing and retestingprocess, it is necessary to require that imported flue-cured and burleytobacco not be mixed, blended, manipulated, altered, processed, manufactured,moved, shipped or transported from the point of entry until it has beendetermined that the tobacco does not exceed the maximum allowable pesticideresidue concentrations set forth in andSection; 29.427. This final rule willestablish these requirements in a new andSection; 29.431.Five comments opposed this new provision but suggested that, if the provisionis adopted, exemptions should be provided which would allow tobacco tobe partially processed under defined circumstances while awaiting the testresults. These comments also expressed concern over delays in the receiptof test results and the costs associated with deferring processing untilthe test results are received. Although in the past there have been delaysin providing test results, we believe the problems causing the delays havebeen corrected and the turnaround time is now approximately ten workingdays. The agency believes that these new requirements do not impose unreasonableburdens on importers. The agency also believes that the proposed safeguardsare the only practical means of assuring that imported tobacco containingprohibited pesticide residues is denied entry into the United States asthe law requires. Accordingly, this final rule adopts andSection; 29.431as set forth in the proposed rule.This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established toimplement Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 andhas been determined to be ``nonmajor'' because it does not meet any ofthe criteria established for major rules under the Executive Order.The information collection requirements contained in the provisions ofthe regulations that would be amended by this final rule have been previouslyapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB No. 0581-0056.Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act,full consideration has been given to the potential economic impact on smallbusiness of this final rule. Few, if any, of the firms which will be affectedby this final rule meet the definition of small business because of theirindividual size. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, hasdetermined that this action will not have a significant economic impactupon a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Administrative practices and procedures, Tobacco.For reasons set forth in the preamble, the regulations in 7 CFR Part 29,Subpart B, are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
