(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A grand jury refused to indict a youngmother for manslaughter in the prenatal, cocaine-linked death ofher 2-day-old daughter, authorities said Friday.   The case of Melanie Green, 24, sparked heated debate over themerits of such prosecution after Winnebago County State's AttorneyPaul Logli charged her May 9 with involuntary manslaughter anddelivery during pregancy of a controlled substance to a minor.   The move drew fire from some members of the medical, socialservice and legal communities, who argued fear of prosecution couldprevent drug-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking medical help.   ``This office brought the charges and sought the indictmentbecause we believed at that time and still do believe that it wasan appropriate response to the death of a newborn child,'' Loglisaid Friday at a news conference.   ``There are no winners in a case like this,'' said WinnebagoCounty Public Defender Gary Pumilia, who accompanied Ms. Green toThursday's grand jury proceeding.   ``A case like this gets a lot of publicity, but the battle inthe trenches is being fought in juvenile court,'' in child-abuseand custody cases involving suspected prenatal drug abuse, he said.   Ms. Green's daughter, Bianca, was 2 days old when she died Feb.4 of oxygen deprivation attributed to her mother's alleged cocaineuse during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to the drug can causenumerous health problems, including low birth weight, impairedmotor ability, irritability that can hinder learning, strokes andseizures.   Ms. Green, who does not have a telephone, could not be reachedimmediately for comment on the grand jury action.   She had said earlier, ``I loved her, I did.'' She refused todiscuss her alleged drug use, but said authorities ``should helppeople. I tried to get help but I couldn't get any.''   Logli called for state legislation ``to address the verypressing issues brought on by this prosecution,'' citing the needto protect infants, eliminate drug abuse among pregnant women andprovide for criminal prosecution in the event of injury.   While charges related to the baby's death have been dropped,prosecutors have not decided whether to pursue drug-abuse chargesagainst Ms. Green, Logli said, adding he also was concerned aboutthe welfare of her son, a first-grader.   Attorney Colleen Connell of the American Civil Liberties Union,which was representing Ms. Green, had said most drug rehabilitationprograms will not accept pregnant women.   Cocaine was found in Bianca's system and in her mother's, Dr. P.John Seward, the county coroner, said. The drug was carried throughthe placenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability to acceptoxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage.   Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlledsubstance to a minor.</TEXT></DOC>
