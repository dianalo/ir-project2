Charles Rose, D-N.C., told ThomasO. Kay, administrator of the Agriculture Department's ForeignAgricultural Service, at a hearing on abuses in a credit guaranteeprogram for farm exports.   ``I resent that,'' Kay retorted.   ``I don't care if you resent it or not,'' replied Rose, chairmanof the House tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. ``You were coveringup a fraudulent practice in the Foreign Agricultural Service.''   The Justice Department is investigating the program, under whichUSDA guarantees private companies they will be paid for Americanfarm goods they export even if foreign buyers default.   Tobacco shipments worth a total of $30.3 million were guaranteedunder the program for 1988, according to Agriculture Departmentofficials.   The controversy concerns a USDA inspector general finding that14 companies falsely told the department that all of the tobaccofor which they obtained credit guarantees was American grown.   Actually, some had been imported, blended with American tobaccoand re-exported under the program, the report said.   Initial reports of a problem emerged from Iraq in 1986, bringingcongressional demands for an investigation. Tobacco-state lawmakerssaid the program was designed to aid U.S. farmers, not foreigners.   At the time, the Foreign Agricultural Service dismissed theconcern. Follow-up by the inspector general, however, resulted inthe allegations under investigation and which are agitating CapitolHill.   ``It makes my blood boil,'' declared Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C.,who said he was ``hoping that the people who have broken the lawend up in the penitentiary.''   Kay told lawmakers he was as ``infuriated'' as they were by thedisclosures and said claims by exporters that their tobacco was 100percent American may have constituted fraud.   He said, however, that he had been surprised by the allegationsand that he had seen no reason to question the assurances ofexporters.   It had always been the policy of the Foreign AgriculturalService to provide credit guarantees for the U.S.-produced portionof exports that blended American products and those coming fromoverseas, he said.   Rose said that sounded exactly the opposite of what Kay had toldlawmakers at a June hearing and he instructed the administrator toproduce any documents showing that such has been the policy.   After finding that the department's counsel was not present, Kaypromised to provide the panel with whatever paperwork existed.   Rose then called on witnesses from the inspector general'soffice and the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm ofCongress, who had testified earlier and were still among thespectators.   They said they had turned up no documents showing that theForeign Agricultural Service had ever maintained a policy ofproviding the guarantees for the American portion of blendedexports.   GAO officials said their investigation indicated guarantees wereprovided only for exports that were 100 percent American. They saidthey were told that the only exception was for a type of baby foodthat contained a small amount of oil not produced in the UnitedStates.   Kay told the panel that the baby food example indicated that``the possibility existed'' that blended exports could receivecredit guarantees.   That phase of the dispute is pertinent because the serviceissued a new policy last month under which it will guarantee creditfor the U.S.-produced portion of a shipment that is at least 75percent American. Kay said that was actually stricter than the oldpolicy.   Allan I. Mendelowitz, GAO senior associate director, told thesubcommittee that the Foreign Agricultural Service ``took ahands-off management approach because it viewed the programs ascommercial programs that are the responsibility of the privatesector.''   Kay said that was not the view of the agency and demanded toknow the name of service employee who had given that information toGAO staffers.   ``I will guarantee you that he will be reprimanded,'' Kay said.   Rose told the administrator to forget about getting the names.   ``I don't think you need to berate them for doing their jobs aswe paid them to do,'' Rose said.</TEXT></DOC>
