After deliberating for about 90 minutes Tuesday, the U.S.District Court jury found John Clark III of Cedarburg, Wis.,violated civil securities laws when he bought stock in a companyknowing his employer was negotiating to buy that company.   The six-person jury found no violation on the part of RussellVanMoppes, a broker in the Bellevue office of Piper, Jaffray andamp;Hopwood, who executed Clark's stock purchases.   No criminal charges were brought in the case and none arepending, said Jim Kidney, an SEC attorney from Washington, D.C.,who tried the case before U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly.   ``This is the first insider-trading case the SEC has ever triedbefore a jury,'' Kidney said.   The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that the SEC may seekinsider-trading penalties in addition to the return of illegallyobtained profits. But it said such penalties can only be soughtbefore a jury. Previous insider-trading cases have been triedbefore judges alone.   SEC regulations prohibit profiting on stock trading when it isbased on information not available to the public.   Clark bought stock in Affiliated Hospital Products Inc. inDecember 1984 after he learned his employer, Smith andamp; NephewAssociated Cos., was negotiating to buy Affiliated for at least 50percent more than the current market price of the stock, Kidneysaid. The shares were traded on the American Stock Exchange.   Clark bought 3,000 shares at prices ranging from $17.875 to$19.75 a share. The following month, Smith andamp; Nephew announced itsoffer to buy Affiliated for $36 a share. Two days afterward, Clarksold his shares for $35.125 apiece, realizing a profit of $47,466,the SEC said.   Zilly ordered Clark to pay $57,026 as unlawful profits gained byhim, his wife and by VanMoppes. Zilly said he also will set penaltydamages, ranging from one to three times the unlawful profits,after he receives information on Clark's financial situation.   The court ``will require a penalty in this case to demonstrateto this defendant and to the world that insider trading will not betolerated,'' Zilly said.   Kidney said VanMoppes recommended the Affiliated stock toanother client and later bought some himself, based on informationfrom Clark. The SEC had alleged VanMoppes had used insiderinformation, but the jury found VanMoppes was not liable underinsider-trading laws.</TEXT></DOC>
