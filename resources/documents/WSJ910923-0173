The move runs counter to Bush administration policy butreflects the frustration of Timothy Ryan, director of theOffice of Thrift Supervision, and William Seidman, chairmanof the Resolution Trust Corp., with the limited optionsavailable to carry out the huge thrift industry cleanup.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;So far, the favored method of resolving an institution isto put it into the RTC and bite the bullet,&quot; said a senioradministration official. &quot;They are really in good faithlooking at new techniques to carry out the cleanup.&quot;   Nothing in existing law precludes regulators from makinguse of what is known as open-institution assistance. But theidea has proven a controversial one, especially when judgedagainst the similar policy of &quot;forbearance&quot; in the 1980s thatallowed weak Sandamp;Ls to stay open, rack up losses and drive upgovernment costs of cleaning them up later.   Thrift regulators say the right opportunity for helping anopen institution hasn't yet come along. But also constrainingthem is the opposition of senior Treasury officials,including Secretary Nicholas Brady and Deputy Secretary JohnRobson, who worry the idea could stir up antipathy inCongress and make it even more difficult to win passage ofthe administration's plan to pump another $80 billion intothe bailout.   The issue was described as &quot;prickly&quot; by Mr. Robson. &quot;Thequestion is if you provide assistance to these institutions,even if they survive, do you save the taxpayer money?&quot; Mr.Robson said in an interview. &quot;It's a hard calculation tomake.&quot;   Under open-institution assistance, as envisioned by Mr.Ryan, taxpayer money intended to pay off depositors could beredirected to the shareholders of sick thrifts that merge.Currently, shareholders' interests are wiped out when aninstitution is closed. OTC spokesman Paul Lockwood said theagency isn't convinced that all of the remaining weak Sandamp;Lsneed to be closed. Some might survive -- and save taxpayermoney -- if given assistance.   &quot;It's not all black and white anymore,&quot; Mr. Lockwood saidof the early days of the bailout, when it was obvious whichinstitutions needed to be closed immediately. &quot;Now we'relooking at ones that require us to make careful judgmentcalls.&quot;   The Senate Banking Committee has approved an amendment tobanking legislation urging regulators to pursue suchtransactions -- for banks as well as thrifts. Althoughsponsored by Democratic Sen. Terry Sanford of North Carolina,the little-noticed measure was drafted by lawyers from theOTS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   The amendment is being pointed to as providing politicalcover for wary regulators interested in open-institutionassistance. Significantly, FDIC officials described lastweek's agreement with First Union Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.,to buy Southeast Banking Corp. of Miami as a first step inthat direction.   The transaction involved the mingling of federal andprivate funds as First Union agreed -- in the firstarrangement of its kind -- to share in the losses onSoutheast's bad loans.   It will take a while, Mr. Seidman said, before anyoneshakes hands on an open-institution deal. Besides demagogicpolitics, questions of who should assume legal liability foran insolvent institution's assets complicates matters.   &quot;There may be, sometime down the line, assistance to{institutions} that are not near failing,&quot; he said. &quot;That isstill under discussion, but I don't think you'll see thatanytime soon.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
