The system, entitled Investigative Filesand Records system, will contain files on employees of the FDIC or otherpersons involved in the FDIC's programs or operations who are or have beenunder investigation by the FDIC's Office of Inspector General where fraudor abuse has been suspected.Pursuant to subsections (k)(2) and (k)(5), respectively, of the PrivacyAct (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), (k)(5)), the FDIC is exempting from the provisionsof andSection;andSection; 310.3 through 310.9 and andSection; 310.10(d)(2) ofits regulations (12 CFR 310.3-310.9 and 310.10(d)(2)) the following: (1)Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes; provided,however, that if any individual is denied any right, privilege or benefitto which he/she would otherwise be entitled under Federal law, or for whichhe/she would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of suchmaterial, such material shall be disclosed to such individual, except tothe extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identityof a source who furnished information to the Government under an expresspromise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or,prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identityof the source would be held in confidence; and (2) investigatory materialcompiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,or qualifications for Corporation employment to the extent that disclosureof such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished informationto the Corporation under an express promise that the identity of the sourcewould be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under animplied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.As a result, an individual who is the subject of a record contained inthe system will generally not have access to the type of material describedabove or be able to request an amendment to any such record.Notice of the exemptions in the form of a proposed rule was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 13, 1989 (54 FR 25126), for a 60-daycomment period. No comments were received on either the proposed rulemakingor the proposal to establish the system. Accordingly, the Board of Directorsof the FDIC adopts the rule as proposed without change.As the amendments neither alter any existing nor create any new record-keepingor reporting requirements, the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable.The Board of Directors of the FDIC hereby certifies that the rule willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,as it simply implements an exemptive provision of the Privacy Act, whichapplies to records about individuals. Therefore, the provisions of theRegulatory Flexibility Act are inapplicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR part 310</ITAG>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Privacy.For the foregoing reasons, 12 CFR part 310 is amended to read as follows:1.
