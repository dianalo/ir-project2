Current plans call for OSHA to lose the employees next fiscalyear when California returns its worker-safety protections to thesupervision of a state agency, which will get 50 percent of itsfunds from the federal government.   The federal share of the cost of the California program will beroughly $14.8 million and OSHA is to lose the 179 positions nowassigned to work that will be taken over by the state.   But Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole proposed boosting OSHA'sbudget by the amount needed to pay for the California program andallow OSHA to relocate the California positions elsewhere in thecountry.   ``OSHA should retain and redeploy the 179 positions,'' Mrs. Dolesaid Wednesday in a statement. She said OSHA's jurisdiction andresponsibilities have expanded in recent years without correspondingboosts in staff size.   Mrs. Dole made the request in letters to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,and Rep. William H. Natcher, D-Ky., chairmen of the Senate and Housesubcommittees with jurisdiction over OSHA's budget.   OSHA currently has about 2,400 workers, according to agencyspokesman Roy Clason. Including the money Mrs. Dole requestedWednesday, its proposed budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1,is $268 million, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
