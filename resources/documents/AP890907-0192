An intensive search of the city's crowded financial district,involving police, FBI agents, transit police and the CaliforniaHighway Patrol, was launched for the pair, dressed in blue jeans andbaseball caps.   Brink's Inc. offered a $100,000 reward for information leading tothe apprehension of the suspects, described as white males in their30s, said the armored car company's corporate vice-president, BuckCrebs.   An empty Brink's bag was found at the scene and some envelopes,their contents unknown, were missing, said officer David Ambrose.Neither authorities nor the bank would immediately release detailson what might have been stolen.   ``It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery,'' saidDeputy Chief Larry Gurnett.   Ambrose said the ski-masked bandits apparently entered the52-story building shortly before 10 a.m. through a sidewalk-leveldoor on California Street, while the Brink's guards entered on PineStreet, a parallel street on the opposite side of the building.   The four apparently met near the rear indoor entrance to thecity's main Bank of America branch. The robbers opened fire, hittingboth guards, said Ambrose.   Robert Gee, 57, of San Francisco, apparently tried to interveneand also was shot, said Ambrose.   Brink's identified the dead guard as Joseph San Arriola, 53, ofVallejo, Calif. The father of six children, Arriola was a five-yearveteran of the company. He suffered gunshot wounds to the face andthe back of the head.   The other wounded guard was identified as Clifford Spencer, 24, apart-time Brink's employee who started working for the company 2{months ago.   Spencer underwent surgery to remove a bullet that entered abovethe left eyebrow, ricocheted off the skull and entered the upperspine, hospital officials said. He was in serious condition withparalysis on his left side before surgery, hospital spokeswomanGloria Rodriguez said.   Gee was wounded in the mouth, she said. He was listed in faircondition.   Judy Adami, owner of The Smoke Shop, on the same floor but out ofsight of the bank entrance, said Gee collapsed at her stand, but wasconscious and asked for help.   ``He said, `There's been a robbery. I've been shot. I'm hurt,'and his teeth were all out,'' she said. Gee gave Adami, and laterpolice, a description of the robbers before he was taken for medicaltreatment.   Bank of America is a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp., one of thenation's largest banking concerns. The building is the city'slargest in terms of square feet.</TEXT></DOC>
