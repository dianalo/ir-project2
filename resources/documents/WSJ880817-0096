The patients usually got worse, and many died. Quack treatments were eventually discarded by medical science, but when it comes to foreign policy they are still popular with Congress.    Two years ago, in a fit of moral posturing, Congress passed a bill imposing sanctions on South Africa. Since then sanctions have thrown thousands of blacks out of work, boosted support for pro-apartheid white parties and helped bring political reform largely to a halt. As with bleeding, the evidence is clear that sanctions don't work. They do nothing to end apartheid; they merely add to the burdens of the black majority.    None of this matters to sanctions supporters in Congress. It is a measure of their cynicism that they totally disregard the effects on South African blacks of their grandstand plays designed to win American votes. Last week, the House approved a bill that would impose a near-total trade embargo and force U.S. investors to sell $4 billion worth of shares in South African firms. Any who did not do so within six months would face fines and jail terms of $250,000 and up to five years. The measure now goes to the Senate, where several Senators who once favored sanctions have said they will oppose it.    Chief among them is Senator Richard Lugar, the chief GOP sponsor of the 1986 sanctions. He is convinced it would be &quot;reckless&quot; to continue with further sanctions now. He points out that complete U.S. disinvestment is supported only by the extreme left and right within South Africa. Senator Lugar believes a better U.S. strategy might include promoting black economic and political empowerment in South Africa.    Blacks in South Africa have little chance of overthrowing the white regime through revolution. But they can continue to build their economic power as members of labor unions, owners of businesses and as consumers. South African blacks consume more than half of the country's production and, as former Assistant Secretary of State Alan Keyes points out, economic realities have so far done far more than outside political pressure to erode apartheid. More economic muscle would give blacks greater leverage to pressure the government for speedy reform.    Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, has proposed an alternative to sanctions that would encourage &quot;black empowerment&quot; in South Africa. His measure would provide U.S. grants and loans to black South African businesses and groups fighting discriminatory laws. His proposal lost in the House after a perfunctory debate, but it will probably be revived in the Senate.    Feel-good remedies for South Africa, such as the quackery of sanctions, should be abandoned before they do even greater harm. South African blacks already have rejected any further such treatment. A June study by the respected Investor Responsibility Resource Center stated that &quot;surveys indicate that a majority of urban {blacks} do not support disinvestment from, or comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.&quot;    Thabo Gallens, an assembly-line inspector, speaks for a growing number of South Africans when he told the Washington Post that &quot;as soon as we blacks realize the strength of our labor and our pocketbooks, the closer we will be to liberation.&quot; Black empowerment, while admittedly not an overnight solution, is far more likely to create the conditions for peaceful, permanent change in South Africa. </TEXT></DOC>
