On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell 30 cents Mondayto close at $16.43 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinefell 0.71 cent a gallon to 48.51 cents, and home heating oildeclined .50 cent to 43.75 cents a gallon.   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,meeting in Vienna, agreed Monday to extend their existingproduction accord but kept haggling over whether to prolong it forthree months or six months.   Analysts in Vienna said an extension of the accord highlightedthe members' inability to overcome their differences on outputlevels and reach a new agreement. The agreement already has beenextended once _ from last December until this month _ because the13 OPEC members could not reach a new pact.   One OPEC faction wants to cut production to push weak oil priceshigher. Another _ including Saudi Arabia _ wants to increaseproduction or at least maintain it at current levels to takeadvantage of an expected increase in demand in the second half ofthe year.   ``It comes down to the Saudis and their allies are notinterested in doing anything to shore up the price of oil,'' saidPeter Beutel, an assistant director of the energy group at EldersFutures Inc. in New York.   Oil prices fell in reaction to developments at the meetingbecause ``the market has been disappointed by the opportunitieslost,'' Beutel said.</TEXT></DOC>
