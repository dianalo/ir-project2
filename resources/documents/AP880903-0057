Communist North Korea, meanwhile, announced today it wouldboycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics because its demand to be aco-host had been rejected.   The students, demanding the Olympics be shared with North Korea,pelted troopers with scores of firebombs and rocks in a clash atSungkyunkwan University. Police hurled rocks and unexplodedfirebombs back at the protesters, who also brandished iron bars andwooden clubs.   Several protesters and officers were injured, but police had nofigures.   A declaration by the students said: ``If the Olympics cannothelp nurture a desirable atmosphere, they are nothing but divisiveOlympics, dictatorial Olympics and war Olympics.''   Radical leaders claimed during a rally before the clash that theOlympics were being used by the government to impose dictatorialrule and increase the risk of war with the North.   North Korea, in a report carried by its official Korean CentralNews Agency, said the Olympics were being used to perpetuate thedivision of the Korean peninsula and it urged other nations to backits boycott.   ``For us Olympic Games are important, but more important is thefuture destiny of our entire nation. For this reason, we cannottake part in the Olympic Games that is forced by single-handedhosting,'' said the report, monitored in Tokyo.   The agency, citing a statement released by the North's Olympiccommittee, said the Games will be ``crippled'' by a boycott, butonly Cuba and Ethiopia have said they will back North Korea.   The head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee, ParkSeh-jik, said earlier today that Seoul would keep the door openuntil the last day of the Olympics for North Korea to participate.   The International Olympic Committee and South Korea said theGames could not be shared because they are given to a single city.Talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the twoKoreas on the Olympics.   Park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse anyprotests during the Olympics to avoid disruption. The gas used byriot police during demonstrations often floats into residential andbusiness areas and the government does not want to spoil the Games.   ``There will be no tear gas, even if one or two groups stage anydisruptive actions,'' Park said.   Radicals have said they may stage protests during the Olympics.The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, lackpublic support.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said today he doubted that theradicals would attempt to disrupt the Olympics. ``The students knowthey will not be supported by our people,'' Kim told The AssociatedPress in an interview.   Kim also played down any potential threat from North Korea.   South Korean officials fear the North may attempt to sabotagethe Olympics. The two sides see the Olympics as a major symbol intheir struggle for dominance on the divided Korean peninsula.   The peninsula was divided in 1945. The North invaded the Southin 1950 to start the Korean War and the border between the twosides remains tense.</TEXT></DOC>
