Bishop</HL><DD> 04/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   INEVITABLY, the moment a patient leaves a doctor's office, dozens of questions come to mind.    The diagnosis, assuming the patient can remember the exact words, may have been too technical or too vague. The doctor often scribbles out a prescription without explaining what the drug is supposed to do. Or the description of an impending operation may have been too involved to grasp.    Fortunately, there are several medical books available that are authoritative, comprehensive and yet simply written.    The Complete Home Medical Guide (published by Crown Books, 1985, $39.95), compiled under the aegis of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, is one of the newest and best of the many medical guides on bookstore shelves. The guide covers the gamut of common and not-so-common disorders, diseases and treatments, including some of the newest therapies.    Another guide, Take Care of Yourself (Addison-Wesley, 1986, $14.95), is organzied by symptom, rather than by diagnosis or disease as most medical guides are. The book, written by two doctors, Donald M. Vickery and James F. Fries, provides a step-by-step approach for each symptom, from acne to wheezing. The reader can then decide whether to consult a doctor or whether the problem can be handled at home.    Questions regarding medicines can be answered with the Essential Guide to Nonprescription Drugs by David R. Zimmerman (Harper andamp; Row, 1983, $10.95) or the Pill Book (Bantam Books, 1986, $12.95), a guide to prescription drugs. Each book lists drugs by both generic and brand names and describes how they work and what their side effects may be.    For intrepid readers willing to wade through complex medical jargon, the Merck Manual and Physicians' Desk Reference are available in most bookstores.    The Merck Manual, published by Merck andamp; Co. (14th edition, $19.75), a major pharmaceutical company, is in its 14th edition and is the most widely used medical text. Its 2,500 pages cover -- in sometimes excruciating and frightening detail -- the cause, pathology, symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and standard treatment for almost every known human ailment.    The PDR, published annually by Medical Economics Co. (1987, $32.95), is a compilation of the government-approved labeling of almost all marketed prescription drugs. It, too, is highly technical and dwells at length on side effects. Neither the Merck Manual nor the PDR should be touched by anyone prone to even slight hypochondria.    To interpret the medical jargon that riddles the Merck Manual and medical journal articles, try the Mosby Medical Encyclopedia (New American Library, 1985, paperback, $12.50). This is essentially a dictionary of medical terms written in easily understood language. It is supplemented with an anatomical atlas, height and weight tables and nutritional data.    For anyone with a special interest in heart or vascular disease, from arrhythmias and heart attacks to stroke, the American Heart Association Heartbook, (E.P. Dutton, 1980, $25) is recommended, although some sections have become outdated by recent advances.    A similar definitive, easy-to-understand work on all types of cancers is the American Cancer Society Cancer Book (Doubleday, 1986, $22.50). </TEXT></DOC>
