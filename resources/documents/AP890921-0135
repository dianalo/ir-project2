Officials said the cause of Wednesday night's crash was unknownand there was no initial indication that the 9-month-old plane mighthave had engine trouble.   Passengers said they felt the engine power being cut and thenfelt reverse thrust as the pilot apparently tried to stop theaircraft.   The twin-engine 737, which can carry up to 150 passengers, hasone of the longest and safest histories of any commercial jet.   The 737-400 differs from previous models in that it has a morepowerful version of the CFM56 engine, which is produced jointly byGeneral Electric Co. and Snecma, a French company, said T. CraigMartin, a Boeing Co. spokesman.   A 737-400 operated by British Midland Airways crashed Jan. 8beside a highway about 100 miles north of London, killing 44 people.It used CFM56-3C engines; the USAir jet in Wednesday's accident hadCFM56-3B2 engines.   British investigators said initially that the crash may haveresulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly shuttingdown the other engine, but no official report has yet been issued onthe cause, Martin said.   In June, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most of theBoeing 737-400s then in operation grounded because of two incidentsin one week in which the engines failed.   The FAA ordered airlines to replace certain parts on the -3B2engines and restrict their power output because of safety concerns.Most of the planes affected were inspected and returned to servicewithin a few weeks.   Martin said the USAir flight that went down was a short-haulflight for which full thrust would not have been needed. He alsosaid the plane probably was not involved in the grounding because ofits age.   A thumbnail sketch of the 737-400:   LENGTH: 119 feet, 7 inches.   WINGSPAN: 94 feet, 9 inches.   ENGINES: Two turbofan jets built by CFM International, a jointventure of General Electric Co. and the French industrial consortiumSNECMA.   CAPACITY: Pilot, co-pilot and up to 146 passengers and flightattendants in typical mixed-class configuration, or up to 168 incharter configuration.   RANGE: Up to 2,879 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
