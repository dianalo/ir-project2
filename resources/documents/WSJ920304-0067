These funds use a bewildering array of stock-pickingstrategies and, in any one year, they tend to generate wildlydifferent results.   How come? The manager of a U.S. stock fund has just oneway to beat the competition, by making better stock picks.But an international stock fund manager has three differentways to add value: by picking countries, by pickingcurrencies and by picking stocks. In each of these threeareas, international funds employ sharply divergentstrategies.   Take currencies. In any particular year, currency zigzagscan mean big gains -- or big losses -- for foreign stockfunds. Some funds use hedging techniques, figuring that thiswill limit their losses in periods when a strengtheningdollar is threatening to slash the value of foreign stocksfor U.S. holders.   &quot;We have a long-term view that the dollar is in a longdecline against foreign currencies,&quot; says Martin Wade,president of T. Rowe Price Associates' five foreign-stockfunds. &quot;But if we think the dollar is in a period of revivalagainst foreign currencies, we do hedge.&quot;   Other funds counter that it is impossible to consistentlyguess the direction of exchange rates, so they avoid hedgingaltogether. &quot;We've done a lot of work to try to find peoplewho can accurately predict currency movements over the longterm,&quot; says Mark Holowesko, director of equity research forTempleton, Galbraith andamp; Hansberger. &quot;We've never found anybodywho could do a good job through more than one currencycycle.&quot;   Many foreign stock funds concentrate their stock picks incountries they deem attractive, meanwhile ignoring marketsthat seem overvalued. Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicagonewsletter, calculates that the average international fundhas just 21% of its assets in Japan. That compares with a 48%market weighting for Japan within the Morgan Stanley CapitalInternational index that tracks the combined stock-marketperformance of Europe, Australia and the Far East.   International funds also tend to favor larger-companystocks, in part because these stocks are easier to sellshould a fund decide to quickly change its countryallocations.   With international funds using such a wide variety ofinvestment styles, how should investors go about pickingamong these funds? Here are five strategies suggested bymutual fund experts:                                                                                                          Stick with big players. Lipper Analytical Servicescalculates that two-thirds of mutual fund investors' foreignstock money is managed by six major fund groups: AmericanFunds Group, G.T. Global Financial Services, T. Rowe Price,Scudder Stevens andamp; Clark, Templeton and Vanguard Group.   With the exception of Vanguard, which uses outsideinvestment advisers for its two large international funds,these fund groups all have a global network of analysts. Noneof these groups would be a bad choice for fund investors,says Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds.&quot;These groups are well-established internationally and youcan find an awful lot of good choices among them,&quot; he says.   But Mr. Phillips notes that a few of the better-performinginternational funds are found outside of these largecomplexes. Among them: Harbor International Fund and IvyInternational Fund, both managed by Hakan Castegren. The Ivyfund charges a commission and is sold through brokers, whileHarbor is a no-load fund distributed by HCA Securities ofToledo, Ohio.                                                                                                          Combine funds. Because international fund performancevaries so widely, some investment advisers suggest combiningdifferent types of funds. That way, you might own one fundthat currency hedges and one fund that doesn't, or you mightbuy one fund that specializes in growth stocks and anotherone that invests in &quot;value&quot; stocks that are cheap relative toassets or current earnings. Such a strategy doesn'tnecessarily involve forking over a lot of money. Someinternational funds demand a minimum initial investment ofonly $1,000 or even less.   When combining different funds, a favorite strategy is tobuy both a large-company fund and a small-company fund, suchas those that invest in emerging markets.   Many of the well-known international funds, like T. RowePrice International Stock Fund and Scudder InternationalFund, stick mostly with large-company stocks. &quot;These firmsmanage a ton of money, so liquidity is very important tothem,&quot; says Kenneth Gregory, editor of L/G No-Load FundAnalyst, a San Francisco newsletter.   But there's a growing group of smallstock specialty funds,like T. Rowe Price International Discovery Fund andMontgomery Emerging Markets Fund, which have significantexposure to the world's developing stock markets. Mr. Gregorythinks that, by investing in one of these funds, investorscan boost their returns.                                                                                                          Go regional. Donal Botkin, a senior vice president withSEI Capital Resources, suggests combining an internationalfund that makes big country bets with two regional funds, onefor Europe and the other for the Pacific region.   The idea is to use the regional funds to get exposure tosmaller, more aggressive companies around the world. Thatway, you not only complement the large companies that tend tobe bought by truly international fund managers, you also havea hedge in case the international manager goes badly wrongwith his country bets.   &quot;Regional managers are going to be invested in localmarkets most of the time, whereas an international managermay be out of those markets totally,&quot; says Mr. Botkin.Regional funds &quot;lock in the broad exposure to differentregions.&quot;   Europe and Asia specialty funds are offered by DeanWitter, Fidelity Investments, Financial Funds, G.T. Global,Merrill Lynch, T. Rowe Price and Putnam Cos.                                                                                                          Consider indexing. Vanguard Group offers two internationalindex funds, one for European stocks and the other forPacific region stocks. Combined together in the rightproportions, the two index funds are designed to replicatethe performance of Morgan Stanley's Europe, Australia and FarEast index.   George Sauter, who oversees Vanguard's international indexfunds, notes that mutual fund investing involves two majorongoing costs, trading costs and management costs. &quot;In theinternational area, those two costs are extremely high,&quot; hesays. He thinks index funds, which have very low turnover andminimal management costs, should outperform the average fund&quot;because of the cost advantage.&quot;                                                                                                          Try publicly traded funds. For those who like their fundsat bargain prices, there are three publicly traded funds withworld-wide stock exposure, Clemente Global Growth Fund,Pacific European Growth Fund and Worldwide Value Fund. Allthree are so-called closed-end funds and theirexchange-traded shares can currently be bought for less thantheir per-share portfolio value.   &quot;If you're interested in diversifying internationally, allthree of them are probably a better deal&quot; than a regularmutual fund, says Ron Olin, a closed-end fund specialist withHouston's Deep Discount Advisors.</TEXT></DOC>
