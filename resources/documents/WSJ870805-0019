James Exon was delighted. &quot;We have won one for America's national security,&quot; the Nebraska Democrat said.    But it may have been a costly victory. Alan Greenspan, who is about to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says he believes that the incident frightened foreign investors and precipitated the decline in the dollar and the rise in interest rates that occurred in March and April. The end result: billions of dollars in additional interest costs for the U.S. government and U.S. consumers and businesses.    The Fujitsu case illustrates the dilemma facing the U.S. as it assumes its new role as the world's largest debtor. Huge trade deficits mean that the nation must pull in roughly $150 billion a year from overseas to finance growth. But fears about that flood of foreign capital are causing a backlash that threatens to throttle the flow of money that is keeping the nation afloat.    &quot;It's schizophrenia,&quot; says Robert Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. &quot;We continue to have policies that make us a big borrower, and then we try to discourage people from lending to us.&quot;    Commerce Department figures starkly illustrate the transformation of the nation's financial status. In 1981, the U.S. was still one of the world's great creditor nations, holding $140 billion more in foreign assets than foreigners held in the U.S.    But six years of huge trade deficits and budget deficits have changed all that. By the end of last year, the department says, foreigners held $264 billion more in U.S. assets than Americans held overseas. Some administration officials doubt the accuracy of those numbers, but no one questions the trend.    As long as the nation's appetite for foreign capital remains so voracious, economists say, any effort to stop the flow from abroad could have serious consequences at home. &quot;We need them more than they need us right now,&quot; contends Paul Getman, a senior financial economist for Wharton Econometrics, &quot;and that's going to continue to be the case for some time.&quot;    Among the actions that have recently given pause to foreign investors is the perilous game of chicken that Congress and the administration play over the nation's debt limit. Although it has become an annual ritual, the political tensions surrounding this year's debt-ceiling fight make it even more dangerous than usual. Congress has been refusing to grant the administration's request for a long-term increase in the debt ceiling, enacting instead a short-term measure that will expire at midnight tomorrow. Yesterday, though, House and Senate conferees agreed to extend the federal borrowing limit through May 1989 and to raise the debt ceiling to $2.8 trillion, up $480 billion from the current $2.32 trillion level.    Some members of Congress hope to attach a change in the Gramm-Rudman budget law to the debt-ceiling increase; others have suggested waiting until September for the Gramm-Rudman change or perhaps adding a tax-increase bill to the debt limit as well. In either case, this high-stakes game risks causing the nation to default on its obligations for the first time in history. Even a temporary default would interrupt billions of dollars of federal interest and principal payments, severely shaking investor confidence in the U.S. government.    &quot;We shouldn't be playing around with credibility that has built up over 200 years,&quot; Treasury Secretary James Baker complains.    Also worrisome to foreign investors are a variety of measures in the House and Senate trade bills that threaten to restrict investment from overseas.    The House of Representatives, for instance, includes in its bill a provision requiring foreign investors with significant ownership of U.S. businesses or real estate to register with the Department of Commerce. Administration officials believe that could have a &quot;chilling&quot; effect on investment from overseas.    And in the Senate, Sen. Exon successfully sponsored a measure allowing the Secretary of Commerce to investigate mergers, acquisitions or takeovers by foreigners that might damage either &quot;national security&quot; or &quot;essential commerce which affects national security.&quot;    Separately, congressional tax-writing committees are considering a &quot;technical correction&quot; to the 1986 tax bill. Treasury officials say the change would override a number of existing tax treaties that the U.S. has negotiated with other countries to protect foreign investors. O. Donaldson Chapoton, the Treasury's top tax official, calls the proposal &quot;a more flagrant disregard of our treaty obligations than any tax provision previously enacted.&quot; The Treasury worries that a sudden abrogation of the treaties and a unilateral change in the taxation of foreign investment here would discourage new investment from abroad.    While Treasury Secretary Baker has generally fought to preserve the free flow of investment, he, too, has unintentionally contributed to foreigners' concerns this year. In a bureaucratic misstep, his department canceled a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles before fully considering the problems that its action would create for thousands of investors who have bought U.S. corporate bonds through the Caribbean island nation. The Treasury was forced to retreat two weeks later.    Treasury officials argue that the incident had little lasting effect. But others familiar with foreign markets are less confident. &quot;It was part of a cumulative series of actions that say to the foreign investor: 'We don't want you,'&quot; says Richard Hammer, a partner at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse in New York.    David Resler, the chief economist for Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, agrees. &quot;You can't just say, 'Oh, sorry guys. My mistake. All is well,'&quot; he says. &quot;Things just don't work that way. It's like the guy whose wife finds out he was cheating on her. And he says, 'Sorry, honey, I won't do it again.' Well it doesn't go away that quickly.&quot;    So far, the damage from all these incidents has been kept under control. &quot;I don't think we've seen enough to really add up to a shock to foreign investors,&quot; says William Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. &quot;They remain at the nuisance level.&quot;    But the trend is disturbing. Many economists argue that foreigners' nervousness about investing in the U.S. could lead them to demand either a lower dollar or higher interest rates in return. The toll on the U.S. economy could be severe. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson warns that passage of a tough trade bill could cause the dollar to plummet, &quot;boxing the Fed into a tighter monetary policy.&quot; The result would be higher interest rates, and possibly even a recession.    &quot;We've never been in a position where foreign capital flows are as important as they are now,&quot; says Mr. Resler. &quot;If we end up in a recession this year,&quot; sanctions on foreign investment and trade could well be to blame.    At the moment, Congress is leading the movement to restrict foreign investment. Members worry about the effects of the ever-increasing role of money from abroad. &quot;Are we going to be held hostage to other people in the world and have no control over our own economic destiny?&quot; asked Sen. Richard Shelby, a Democrat from Alabama, in a question to Mr. Greenspan at his confirmation hearing earlier this month.    Sen. Exon has been one of the most outspoken proponents of blocking certain foreign investment. When Fujitsu announced its plans to take over Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. last year, he was quick to complain. Fairchild accounts for only a small fraction of U.S. semiconductor production and was already controlled by Schlumberger Corp., a largely French-owned firm. Nevertheless, Sen. Exon said that the merger would be detrimental to the national security.    Complaints from Sen. Exon and others, including the late Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, led Fujitsu to drop its takeover effort.    Sen. Exon dismisses Mr. Greenspan's contention that the Fujitsu incident resulted in higher interest rates. &quot;Economists have such a broad range in which to operate that they can say 'on the one hand' or 'on the other hand,' and sometimes they are all over the lot,&quot; complains Sen. Exon. &quot;I think that's a legitimate criticism of Alan Greenspan.&quot;    Moreover, even if it did cause rates to rise, the senator contends, &quot;I think that begs the question as to whether or not the U.S. is going to sell out its national-security interests to keep interest rates down.&quot;    Most of the congressional concern seems to focus on direct foreign investment -- involving companies, plants and real estate -- rather than indirect investment in bonds, Treasury bills or certificates of deposit.    &quot;It's not unlike the unwillingness of Latin American nations to have their debt converted to equity,&quot; says Mr. Cline. &quot;People are unwilling to see the counterpart ownership that goes with foreign investment.&quot;    But some economists argue that direct investment is preferable to indirect investment. For one thing, they say, it is more stable than financial investments, which can be sold at a moment's notice. And Mr. Lawrence of the Brookings Institution argues that a company like Fujitsu can bring an infusion of know-how, as well as capital. &quot;As a country that has fallen behind in certain areas,&quot; he says, &quot;that's the great benefit that direct investment offers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
