Thus, under thereaction conditions of 700 K, methanol pressure of 40 kPa and W/F 9.0g h mol{sup -1}, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5,and Zn-ZSM-5 were 40.3, 48.2, and 67.3% respectively. Over Zn-ZSM-5,aromatic products were composed of benzene (4.5%), toluene (25.1%), xylenes+ ethylbenzene (46.7%) and C{sub 9}{sup +}+ (23.7%). The reaction conditionswere optimized to obtain the highest yield of aromatic hydrocarbons overZn-ZSM-5. The yield of aromatics increased with temperature up to 700K,but a further temperature increase led to the decomposition of methanolto carbon oxides. The selectivity for aromatics gave a maximum of 70%at a methanol partial pressure of 22 kPa. The yield of aromatic hydrocarbonsincreased with the degree of cation-exchange of H-ZSM-5 with Zn-cations,indicating the essential role of the zinc species in the enhancementof the selectivity for aromatics. The zinc species were supposed to havea capability of efficiently converting olefinic intermediate to aromatichydrocarbons. In order to confirm this, the reactions of propylene and1-butene over Zn-H-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5 were studied. The introduction ofzinc cations enhanced considerably the yield of aromatics from lowerolefins. Zn-borosilicate, which has negligible acidity, has no activityfor propane conversion, but has a high aromatization activity for lowerolefins. At low conversion levels, butadiene was obtained with a highselectivity from 1-butene. From these results, it is concluded that thezinc species has a high capability of abstracting hydride ions from olefinsto form the allylic species. 13 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
