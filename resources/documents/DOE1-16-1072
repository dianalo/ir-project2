It is shown that indium separated into gaseous phase in inthe form of at least three compounds: tri-, mono- and oxychloride withthe temperature of adsorption on quartz of 385, 475 and 655 K respectively.All the compounds are easily washed off quartz instrument surface bya weak (0.05 mol/l) hydrochloric acid solution.</TEXT></DOC>
