<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-72-1355 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dynamics of many systems of interacting quasiparticles can be describedin the mean field approximation by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation(NSE). The bound state of a larger number of quasiparticles in such asystem is equivalent to a dynamical soliton, its amplitude being proportionalto the number of bound quasiparticles. Soliton dynamics in the presenceof impurities is analyzed. In adiabatic approximation soliton dynamicsis similar to classical dynamics of a particle, moving in the effectivepotential field. But the adiabatic approximation becomes inadequate whenthe scattering of a rather fast soliton by point impurities is studied,and scattering intensity is characterized by the reflection coefficient.The reflection coefficient of the soliton is calculated in the Born approximationof the perturbation theory based on the inverse scattering technique.An analytical comparison with the scattering of linear wave packet iscarried out. In particular, we analytically describe the nonlinear resonantscattering by two point impurities. (author). 13 refs, 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
