We develop a general formalism to showthat the gravitational instability theory for the origin of large-scalestructure is now capable of critically confronting observational resultson cosmic microwave background radiation angular anisotropies, large-scalebulk motions and large-scale clumpiness in the galaxy counts.</TEXT></DOC>
