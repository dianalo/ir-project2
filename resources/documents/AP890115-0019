The 100,000 victims interviewed as part of the JusticeDepartment's National Crime Survey were subjected to rape, robbery,aggravated assault and simple assault.   In the report issued Sunday, the Bureau of Justice Statisticssaid the methods of resisting among the 73 percent who reporteddoing something ranged from attacking the attacker, to threateninghim or her, to screaming from pain or fear.   About a third resisted or tried to capture the offender, about afourth ran away or hid and another fourth tried to persuade orappease the offender. Some tried more than one tactic.   While 63 percent felt their action helped the situation, 7percent said it harmed, 6 percent said it helped and hurt, 13percent said it did neither and 11 percent were not sure.   ``About three-fifths of the violent crime victims who felt thatself-protection helped the situation indicated that their actionshelped them avoid injury or greater injury,'' said the report byCatherine J. Whitaker.   About 31 percent of those who felt their self-protection measureswere beneficial said they worked by helping scare off the offenderand about 19 percent of the victims said their actions helped themmake their own escape.   The report cautioned that the findings ``should not be used torecommend whether or not victims should defend themselves or todetermine the measures that are most effective.''   The survey did not determine the exact circumstances of each caseor whether the victims were correct in their determination of whatharm the assailant had intended before the self-protective actionswere taken.   ``Finally, it should be noted that the National Crime Survey doesnot collect information on homicides and therefore misses any casesof self-protection that may have resulted in the death of thevictim,'' the report says.   John Stein, deputy director of the National Organization forVictim Assistance, says there's no universally appropriate responseto a violent crime, and that even if there were one, the likelihoodis that the victim would be too shocked to carry it out.   ``If we do resist, it's not because it's a calculated decision,''said Stein. ``When we're working with victims, our first rule is ifthey're alive, we tell them, `You did the right thing.' Rule two is,`Even if you were brilliant or what you think was stupid ... thelikelihood was any reaction you had was something you probably couldnot have changed.'''   It all stems from the ``flight or fight'' reaction to stress thatscientists say remains at the core of the human physiology.   When one is confronted with a violent criminal, the situation``clearly is not one in which training, thinking, cognitive stuff istaking place a lot,'' Stein said.   ``I'm not saying we are powerless in moments of crisis, but wecertainly emphasize to victims is that the level of decision-makingwe are likely to operate under is very low, very primitive,'' hesaid. ``That's one of the reasons why we're not certain that, forexample, self-defense training is likely to have much of an impactover the ability of a would-be victim to turn an assault into merelyan attempted and unsuccessful assault.''   Other key findings of the survey:   _Victims said they believed their assailants were under theinfluence of drugs or alcohol in about 36 percent of violent crimes,including 46 percent of the rapes.   _Police, when notified of a crime, arrived within 10 minutes tosee the victim in 56 percent of the violent crimes, 38 percent ofpersonal thefts and 35 percent of household crimes. They arrivedwithin an hour in 95 percent of violent crimes, 84 percent ofpersonal thefts and 85 percent of household crimes. Previous surveyshave found that police are called only in about half of all violentcrimes, 40 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personalthefts.   _Police had later contact with victims in 37 percent of theviolent crimes reported to them _ including 62 percent of rapes _ aswell as 35 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personalthefts.   _The victim received help or advice from a victim assistanceoffice or agency other than the police in a little under 10 percentof the violent crimes reported to police.   The survey's results were based on interviews between July 1986and June 1987 with about 100,000 people age 12 and older in 49,000households selected to represent all parts of the country, theJustice Department said.   The report did not estimate how much the survey results woulddiffer if every crime victim were asked the same questions. However,traditional polls involving barely 1,000 people typically havemargins of error in the 3-to-4-percent range.</TEXT></DOC>
