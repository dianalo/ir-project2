These regulations, which currently are contained in SubpartA of the Antidumping Regulations, 19 CFR 353.2 to 353.24, for the mostpart reflect the administrative practice of the U.S. Department of theTreasury and its constituent unit, the U.S. Customs Service, prior to thetransfer of responsibility for administration of the antidumping law tothe Department in 1980. Since the Department assumed responsibility for the antidumping law, theDepartment has engaged in two significant rulemaking proceedings. The first,completed in 1980, largely promulgated procedures conforming to the majorprocedural revisions enacted in the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub.L. 96-39; July 26, 1979) (``1979 Act''). The second rulemaking proceeding,which is nearing completion, also dealt largely with procedures, modifyingthe Antidumping Regulations to (1) conform to the provisions of Title VIof the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-573; October 30, 1984)(``1984 Act''); and (2) incorporate needed improvements identified by theDepartment and others as a result of practical experience with the administrationof the antidumping law, as amended by the 1979 Act.With respect to antidumping methodology, however, the Department has developedits methodology largely through adjudication of individual cases. In part,this was an inevitable result of the Department's inexperience in administeringthe antidumping law. In addition, a certain amount of administrative flexibilityhas proven necessary in order to deal with the novel factual situationswhich continually arise. Nevertheless, the case-by-case approach has producedcertain undesirable consequences.First, as a result of the Department's eight years of adjudicating antidumpingproceedings, there is now a substantial gloss on the existing AntidumpingRegulations in the form of administrative practice. This administrativepractice is not readily accessible to the public. One objective of a rulemakingproceeding would be to codify this practice in the form of regulations,thereby making the antidumping law and the Department's antidumping methodologymore accessible to the public.Another consequence of the adjudicative approach is that in some instancesthe Department has issued inconsistent determinations, a failing for whichCongress chastised the Department in the legislative history of the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. H.R. Rep. No. 40, 100th Cong., 1stSess. (pt. 1) 143 (1987). Therefore, another objective of rulemaking wouldbe to codify and clarify the Department's antidumping methodology so asto avoid unwarranted inconsistencies in the future.Finally, based upon its experience in administering the antidumping law,the Department is concerned that the substance and procedures of the lawmay have become so complicated as to reduce the usefulness of the antidumpinglaw as a tool in combatting unfair foreign pricing practices. Therefore,the Department is seeking ways in which to streamline and simplify antidumpingproceedings for all parties concerned (including the Department), withoutsacrificing substantive and procedural fairness.The Department already has identified certain likely amendments which shouldbe made to the Antidumping Regulations. However, before initiating a rulemakingproceeding, and in order to accomplish the objectives noted above, theDepartment invites public comment on proposed amendments to the AntidumpingRegulations. Although the Department is most concerned with amending thoseprovisions of the Antidumping Regulations dealing with the calculationof dumping margins, the Department also is interested in procedural suggestionswhich will help to streamline and simplify antidumping proceedings. Inaddition, while the Department intends to initiate a separate rulemakingproceeding to incorporate into the Antidumping Regulations certain of thestatutory changes made to the antidumping law by the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-418; August 23, 1988), commentersmay, if they so desire, submit suggestions concerning the 1988 Act amendmentsas part of their response to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Procedures</ITAG>If the Department determines that any amendment proposed in response tothe Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is appropriate, a notice of proposedrulemaking asking for public comment on a specific proposed amendment oramendments shall be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>The Department has not reached any conclusions concerning any of the mattersraised herein. The Department wishes to receive public comments on allaspects of the Department's administration of the antidumping law. TheDepartment believes that such public comment would enhance its understandingof the issues and problems that need to be addressed. Therefore, interestedpersons are invited to address any issue of law, policy, or procedure,and to suggest appropriate amendments to the Antidumping Regulations whichthe Department should consider.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 353</ITAG>Business and industry, Foreign trade, Imports, Trade practices.<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
