The bill, which among other things would give the Securities and Exchange Commission the ability to seek fines from firms that fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading, was approved by a vote of 410-0.    House Democrats hope that the overwhelming vote, along with the sweeping civil charges recently filed by the SEC against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., will combine to persuade the Senate to move on the bill. &quot;I think there is an irresistible momentum that has been provided by the present climate,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House finance subcommittee and one of the bill's co-sponsors.    The Senate Banking Committee appears unlikely to even consider the bill in its present form. Democratic and Republican aides to that committee said the panel most likely will try to wrap the House bill's stiffer insider-trading penalties together with parts of several other pieces of pending securities legislation. That could complicate the bill's chances of winning final passage.    &quot;We'd like to think we can salvage some elements of our corporate-takeover bill,&quot; said one banking panel aide. That bill, whose chief sponsor is committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), ran into trouble earlier this year when it became clear that many in the Senate believed it would tilt the rules of mergers and acquisitions too much against corporate raiders and in favor of corporate management.    The package being discussed by Senate banking panel staff members would seek to revive some of that bill's less controversial provisions -- such as one reducing the amount of time investors have before they must disclose a 5% stake in a company -- and combine them with the stiffer insider-trading penalties and with some other provisions dealing with post-crash changes.    The package, for example, would seek to formalize the existence of the White House's working group on financial markets. The group, created by the president earlier this year, includes the Treasury secretary and the chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    But that sweeping approach is likely to get a chilly reception from the House, and could stop any securities legislation this year. Implicitly criticizing the package approach, Rep. Markey said the tender-offer bill is stalled and post-crash market changes would be better dealt with next year, while the insider-trading bill &quot;has real political legs.&quot;    Similarly, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to Sen. Proxmire's imminent retirement, House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell, another of the bill's sponsors, said in a prepared statement: &quot;If we don't get the (insider-trading) bill this year, we'll get it next year.&quot; The Michigan Democrat added that he expects it to succeed this year.    In addition to establishing monetary liability for securities firms whose employees engage in insider trading, the bill passed by the House would provide, for the first time, for the payment of bounties to informants. Under this unusual provision, the SEC could pay those providing information as much as 10% of the penalty imposed or the settlement reached.    Besides broadening the penalties that can be sought by the SEC, which can take only civil actions, the bill would boost the amount of criminal fines and sentences that can be imposed for insider trading. It would increase the maximum criminal fine for individuals to $1 million from $100,000, and the top fine for corporations and partnerships to $2.5 million from $500,000. It also would double, to 10 years, the maximum jail term for insider trading.    Rep. Dingell long has opposed any legislative definition of insider trading, and in keeping with his wishes, the bill doesn't offer one. </TEXT></DOC>
