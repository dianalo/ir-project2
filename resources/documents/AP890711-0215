(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Xerox Corp. said its board had approved aleveraged employee stock ownership plan for salaried employees andthe repurchase of roughly 11 percent of the company's common stock.   Xerox said Monday the employee stock ownership plan for 57,000salaried employees would be financed in part by forfeited meritraises and the loss of company contributions to a 401(k) retirementplan.   The company said it will implement the plan by issuing $785million worth of new series B convertible preferred stock and usingthe proceeds to repurchase 11 million of its 103 million outstandingcommon shares.   The repurchase of common stock was to be accomplished through atender offer, details of which the company said it would revealTuesday.   David T. Kearns said the repurchase and the ESOP plan wouldprovide ``greater value'' for shareholders.   ``By giving our employees a major stake in the company throughthe ESOP, we are creating value by more closely aligning employeeobjectives with shareholder objectives,'' Kearns said.   The initial ESOP funding will come from bank loans, which will berepaid over 15 years using three sources, Xerox said.   The first source will be dividends on the preferred shares heldby the ESOP. The second will result from the elimination as of Jan.1, 1990, of company contributions to a 401(k) plan for salariedemployees. The final segment will require use of a portion of the1990 merit increase budget for U.S. employees.   Company spokesman Thomas C. Abbott said most of the money forrepaying the loans will come from the preferred share dividends. Buthe said he didn't have a detailed breakdown of how much each segmentwould contribute to repayment of the loans.   The plan affects the salaried employees of Xerox businessproducts and systems operations, Crumm and Forster Inc., XeroxCredit Corp., and the headquarters staff of the corporation andXerox Financial Services.   The employees won't have to use any of their own money from theircurrent salaries to finance the ESOP.   The company also said it was willing to negotiate an ESOP for its6,000 hourly workers represented by the Amalgamated Clothing andTextile Workers Union. Abbott said the union raised the issue of anESOP during contract negotiations that were completed earlier thisyear.   The company also said it would negotiate an ESOP with otherunions representing another ``several hundred'' hourly workers.</TEXT></DOC>
