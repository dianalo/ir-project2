The ruling appears to carve out a new exception in California to the general rule that workers' compensation laws are the exclusive means to compensate victims of industrial accidents. The ruling could influence courts in other states.    In the past, legislatures have provided exceptions where employers have intentionally harmed employees or where worker injuries have been exacerbated because an employer fraudulently concealed the cause.    In San Jose, the ruling came on a pre-trial motion in a class-action lawsuit against Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co. by workers at a former Firestone tire manufacturing plant in Salinas, Calif. Firestone was seeking dismissal of the suit, in which the plaintiffs alleged that they were exposed to benzene and other hazardous substances and that Firestone knew of the danger but concealed its knowledge and avoided protective measures.    The workers didn't allege they had contracted any currently diagnosable physical injury. But they asserted that their immune systems had been impaired, making them more vulnerable to cancer, and that the disease was latently present in their bodies.    Firestone has asserted that the suit is groundless because it fails to allege any existing injury.    In his opinion, Judge Robert Aguilar likened the alleged injuries to cases where employers had inflicted emotional distress upon workers, which California courts previously ruled to be wholly excluded from the bounds of the state worker-compensation system.    &quot;The physical injuries alleged here involve no present impairment of earning capacity and no clearly perceptible manifestation of physical dysfunction or disease,&quot; according to the judge's opinion. &quot;Accordingly, the court finds that the civil wrong alleged here lies outside the contemplation of the legislature. . . .&quot;    Unless overturned on appeal, the decision gives the plaintiffs their day in court. They are seeking, among other things, a medical monitoring fund that would help locate and aid in early diagnosis and treatment, as well as $100 million in punitive damages for the alleged fraud and concealment.    &quot;It means a disease in its latency period suffices as an injury to evoke the equitable powers of the court&quot; and avoid the strictures of the worker-compensation system, said Gordon Stemple, an attorney in Los Angeles for the plaintiffs. He said the ruling could have broad meaning for workers seeking remedies for hidden injuries.    But some legal scholars were critical. &quot;Courts have been trying to circumvent (workers' compensation laws) for the last 10 to 15 years. This seems to be one of those efforts, and it sounds dubious,&quot; said John Fleming, professor at the University of California at Berkeley's Boalt School of Law. &quot;You are creating a cause of action out of whole cloth.&quot;    Mr. Fleming said he questions whether courts should recompense people suffering from &quot;mere apprehension of possible future damage.&quot;    In Akron, Ohio, a Firestone spokesman said the company was considering an appeal but didn't have any further comment. </TEXT></DOC>
