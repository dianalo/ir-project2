Like any complicated product, personal computers from a variety of makers have had their share of faulty parts that had to be replaced. But Compaq's problems with its Portable II personal computers appear to be the first involving a major manufacturer in which, as a Compaq spokesman put it, &quot;bodily injury could result.&quot; No one was hurt in the three known explosions, Compaq said.    The Houston-based computer maker has discovered that certain faulty servicing on some of its Portable II personal computer models can cause a lithium battery that powers the computer's clock to explode. The battery is about the size of a normal AA battery.    Asked to describe the magnitude of the possible explosions, the Compaq spokesman said &quot;that's hard to say, but it damages the computer and smoke comes out. You know it's happening.    &quot;The potential is there for bodily injury,&quot; the spokesman added, though he couldn't specify what types of injuries might be caused.    The spokesman emphasized that computers that have not been serviced or modified can't explode.    The financial impact of the problem for Compaq is likely to be minimal. Because the explosions can occur only if service people incorrectly solder two wires together, Compaq isn't recalling the computers. Instead, earlier this month it began advising repair outlets, dealers and users of the potential problem and how to avoid it.    Compaq also last week notified the Consumer Product Safety Commission of the problem. The commission said it hasn't decided on any action.    The Portable II was introduced last February. Compaq said only about 8,000 units manufactured in the &quot;first few months&quot; of production have the potential to explode. Compaq will replace the potentially dangerous parts if the computers are brought in for servicing.    Compaq won't say how many Portable II units it has shipped this year but Dataquest, a market research group based in San Jose, Calif., estimated the number at 65,000. Dataquest estimated that the Portable II -- the most popular of Compaq's four portable models -- accounts for about 25% of Compaq's total sales in dollars and in units. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Compaq posted sales of $438.4 million and net income of $26.7 million, or 95 cents a share.    Compaq shares closed Friday at $20.25, off $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The Compaq spokesman said the first reported explosion occurred in the Compaq factory in Houston sometime during the summer. The computer had been incorrectly serviced by a Compaq employee, the spokesman said.    Sometime after that, two users reported explosions similar to the one at the factory. The computers were unattended in all three explosions, Compaq said. The spokesman said it took Compaq several months to locate the problem. &quot;We finally were able to duplicate it and blew up some of our own,&quot; he said.    Users with questions about their computers can call Compaq's toll-free number: 800-847-5785. </TEXT></DOC>
