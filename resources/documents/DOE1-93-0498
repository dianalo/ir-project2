Plastics and rubbers havingintrinsic corrosion resistance have long been used as coatings for corrosionprotection of internal surfaces of such plant. Changes in approach havedeveloped in recent years both in the choice of coating material andin application methods and parameters, the aims being shorter applicationtimes and reduced maintenance requirements in service. The ultimate goalof a maintenance-free solution to corrosion has been sought, on the otherhand, through the use of structural plastics for component construction.Proprietary thermoplastics components have proven successful in auxiliaryCW plant. Construction in GRP (glass-fibre reinforced plastics) is suitablefor either auxiliary plant on for much larger structures for main turbineCW systems; up to 10 years successful experience now exists with majorGRP items. CEGB policy is to develop corporate standards and codes ofpractice to ensure the optimum utilisation of the benefits of coatingsand structural plastics in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
