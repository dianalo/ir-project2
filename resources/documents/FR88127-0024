The Existing Standard </ITAG>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's current standard forside impact protection is Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214,<T3>Side Door Strength. </T3>The standard specifies performance requirementsfor each side door in a passenger car to mitigate occupant injuries inside impacts. The standard seeks to do this by reducing the extent to whichthe side structure of a car is pushed into the passenger compartment duringa side impact. The standard requires each door to resist crush forces thatare applied by a piston pressing a steel cylinder against the door's outsidesurface in a laboratory test. The standard does not attempt to regulatedirectly the level of crash forces experienced by an occupant when strikingthe car interior in such an impact. Since the standard became effectiveon January 1, 1973, vehicle manufacturers have generally chosen to meetthe performance requirements of the standard by reinforcing the side doorswith metal beams. NHTSA's analysis of real-world crash data has shown that the strengtheningof the side doors with the beams is indeed effective, but primarily insingle car side impacts. The agency's November 1982 study, ``An Evaluationof Side Structure Improvements in Response to Federal Motor Vehicle SafetyStandard 214,'' (DOT HS 806-314) estimated that 480 lives have been savedand 9,500 fewer hospitalizations have occurred per year as a result ofthe standard. The study also found that while single vehicle occupant fatalitieswere reduced by 14 percent, the standard had little effect on reducingfatalities in multi-car collisions. (The agency evaluation report (DOTHS 806-314) analyzing the effectiveness of the current standard and otherrelevant information have been filed in the agency's Docket 82-19, Notice1. Other information on the agency's side impact protection program isalso available in Docket 79-04, General Reference and Notices 1 and 2,Docket 82-11, General Reference, and Docket 82-19, Notice 1.) <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Proposed Amendments </ITAG>Because of the large number of fatalities and injuries which continue toresult from side impact crashes, the agency initiated a research programto upgrade the current standard. This effort focused primarily on thoracicprotection since data indicate that contact between the thorax and theside interior is a major source of serious injuries and fatalities. The agency has conducted research on improved side impact protection sincethe late 1970's. Much information has been acquired not only from agencyresearch but also from industry and research groups throughout the world.The agency has presented its findings and has communicated with groupsin numerous meetings and conferences such as Society for Automotive Engineers(SAE), Stapp Car Crash Conferences, Experimental Safety Vehicle Conferences(ESV), International Research Council on Biokinetics of Impacts (IRCOBI),and NHTSA sponsored public meetings (1979 and May 1986). NHTSA has soughtto address all pertinent aspects of the side impact problems which coverthe test procedure, side impact dummy, injury criteria, and crashes asthey occur in the real world.The agency has tentatively concluded that the available information issufficient to proceed with a proposed upgrade of the current side impactregulation FMVSS No. 214_Side Door Strength.Based on that research, today's notice proposes to upgrade the standardby using a test procedure which simulates a two-vehicle side crash representativeof the real-world side crashes that occur most frequently today. The proposedtest uses a moving deformable barrier, weighing approximately 3,000 pounds,to represent a vehicle which is traveling at 30 mph and strikes the sideof another vehicle which is traveling at 15 mph. To measure the magnitudeof injury threat resulting from the side impact collision, the agency isproposing to use a specially developed side impact dummy. Two of thesedummies would be used in a test, with one being placed on the front outboardseat and the other on the rear outboard seat on the struck side of thecar.This proposal would complement the current standard, which is primarilyeffective in single vehicle side impact accidents, by providing additionalprotection in multi-vehicle side impacts. The current standard does notdirectly assess the injury probabilities associated with different vehicledesigns in a specific impact. Instead, it uses the ability of the sidedoors to resist intrusion as a surrogate measure of the potential for injury.Today's notice would set specific performance criteria which must be metto reduce the possibility of thoracic side impact injuries without increasingharm to the pelvis. The notice would require passenger cars not to exceedspecified performance limits for the thorax and the pelvis. For the thorax,the performance limits are based on a combination of peak accelerationvalues measured on the lower spine and the greater of the accelerationvalues of the upper and lower ribs of the test dummy. This notice seekscomments on the appropriateness of the proposed acceleration limits rangingfrom 80 g's to 115 g's. In addition, the notice seeks comments on the appropriatenessof the proposed limits, ranging from 130 to 190 g's, on the peak accelerationthat the pelvis should experience during the impact. Finally, to reducethe possibility of occupant ejection, the proposal would require that eachdoor in the struck vehicle remain closed during the crash test.To provide manufacturers with sufficient leadtime to design their passengercars to meet the proposed performance requirements, the standard wouldbe phased-in in accordance with the following implementation schedule:10 percent of all cars manufactured during the first full production year(September 1 to August 31) beginning more than 24 months after the issuanceof the final rule;25 percent of all cars manufactured during the second full year beginningafter that 24-month period;40 percent of all cars manufactured during the third full year after that24-month period; and100 percent of all cars manufactured on or after the beginning of the fourthfull year after that 24-month period.The basis for each of those proposals is discussed in the remaining sectionsof the notice, which present a review of the fatality and injury experiencein side impacts involving current cars, the rationales and research supportingthe proposed test procedures and performance requirements, the estimatedbenefits of the standard, and the potential costs. A more detailed discussionof those issues is contained in the agency's Preliminary Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (PRIA), which has been placed in the docket for this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Safety Problem</ITAG>The agency has separately analyzed the fatality and injury experience ofpassenger car occupants involved in side impact crashes. As discussed below,the data show that side impacts account for an average of almost 8,000fatalities and more than 23,000 serious injuries annually. These figuresrepresent 30 percent of all passenger car occupant fatalities and 34 percentof the serious injuries that occur in passenger cars.A. FatalitiesNHTSA reviewed available crash data from 1978 to the present to determinethe number of fatalities in side impact crashes. That review showed thatside impacts resulted in an average of 7,676 fatalities per year over thateight year period. The review further showed that while side impact fatalitiesdeclined steadily from about 8,300 in 1978 to about 7,000 in 1982, theyincreased again to about 7,400 in 1985. The percentage of all car occupantskilled in side impacts averaged 30.3 percent over this eight year period.Side impact fatilities as a percentage of all occupant fatalities remainedfairly constant from 1978-1982, at about 29 percent, but increased to about32 percent in 1985.The agency also examined the data on fatal crashes to identify the firstharmful event in fatal side impact accidents. Based on a review of datafrom crashes in 1982-1985, the agency found that 66 percent of all sideimpact fatalities are due to vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts. Pole typeimpacts (poles, posts, fire hydrants, and trees) make up an additional18 percent and other fixed objects (boulders, culverts, embankments, bridgeabutments, guard rails, etc.) together comprise approximately 10 percentof all side impact fatalities.The agency also examined its data files to determine what areas of thebody were being injured in side impacts. Since the Fatal Accident ReportingSystem (FARS) does not provide information on the body region injured orthe contact points, the agency examined data from the 1979-1985 NationalAccident Sampling System (NASS) and the 1977-1979 National Crash SeverityStudy (NCSS) on fatalities in which the most severe impact to the fataloccupant's vehicle was a left side or right side deformation. Only modelyear 1973 and later vehicles were included in this analysis to ensure thatthe data reflected the effect of side door beams, which were required beginningJanuary 1, 1973, and appeared in many cars prior to that date. The datashow that, for all types of side impact accidents including occupant ejections,head injuries are the most frequent sources of side impact fatalities (47%),followed by chest (29%), neck/spine (11%), and abdomen (8%).Many head injuries occur as a result of a person being ejected from a vehicle.Because of the increase in the usage of manual safety belts and the introductionof automatic safety belts, the agency expects that there will be a reductionin the number of persons ejected from a vehicle. Thus, the performancecriteria proposed in today's notice are meant to address crashes in whichan occupant is retained within the car. NHTSA then examined the accident data to determine what type of injurieswere occurring during a side impact in which there was no ejection or rolloverand in which the injury-producing contact points in the vehicle's interiorwere known. NHTSA found that the major injury categories in side impactaccidents involved impacts between a person's chest or abdomen and thevehicle's interior. Thus, NHTSA's research has focused on developing countermeasuresfor these types of injuries. Today's proposal should also help reduce head and other injuries resultingfrom complete ejections, since it would require that all doors of a testedcar remain closed during the crash test, thus reducing the possibilityof ejection. In addition, NHTSA is also preparing to publish an ANPRM ona somewhat related topic. The ANPRM will request comments on several meansof reducing the risk of head and neck injuries and ejections through sidedoors and side windows in cars. The ANPRM and this notice are related inthat both address injury reduction to car occupants involved in side crashes.However, NHTSA believes they are not interdependent in that potential vehiclemodifications to reduce thorax injuries (e.g., lower door padding) arenot related to those that might be made to reduce head and/or neck injuries(e.g., A-pillar padding). NHTSA is not now prepared to make specific proposalson head and neck injuries and will be seeking more information and datain the ANRPM. B. Injuries In addition to examining the data on side impact related fatalities, theagency also reviewed data on the number of injuries in non-fatal crashes.NHTSA estimated the average number of injuries, by deformation locationand the maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) level per occupant survivor,that would have occurred in 1982-85 if all cars in the fleet were MY 1973and later cars_that is, if they all had side door beams. (The AbbreviatedInjury Scale is used to rank injuries by level of severity. An AIS 1 injuryis a minor one, while an AIS 6 injury is one that is currently untreatableand fatal.) The total estimated number of AIS 3-5 injuries (serious tocritical injuries) from all crash modes is about 68,600 annually, whichis based on data from the 1982-85 NASS file. That analysis showed thatside impacts resulted in a total of about 23,500 AIS 3-5 injuries annually,34 percent of all AIS 3-5 injuries. This is consistent with the fatalityexperience in these four years. In that time, side impacts accounted for32 percent of all fatalities. The analysis also shows that the side interiorand side hardware/armrests account for almost 52 percent of the maximumAIS 3-5 injuries for front seat occupants sitting near the struck sideof the vehicle, and nearly 59 percent of the maximum AIS 3-5 injuries forrear seat occupants sitting near the struck side of the vehicle. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. The Proposed Test Procedure </ITAG>This section discusses the size, weight, geometry, and stiffness of themoving deformable barrier that would be used in a barrier-to-car crashtest. In some respects, the barrier is more representative of a car, whilein others, more representative of a light truck. NHTSA requests commentswhether the barrier should be more consistently representative of the populationof either cars or light trucks. A. Moving Deformable Barrier <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Description of the Moving Deformable Barrier </ITAG>NHTSA is proposing a test procedure which simulates a typical two-vehicleside impact. The notice proposes to use the moving deformable barrier (MDB)developed by the agency in that test. The MDB is a steel structure witha 102 inch wheelbase, 63 inch track width, and has two aluminum honeycombblocks on the front to simulate the energy absorption characteristics ofa striking automboile. One block has a high compression strengh of 245psi, is 4 inches thick and is mounted 21 inches above the ground to simulatethe bumper/frame of the striking vehicle. The other block has considerablylower compressive strength, i.e., 45 psi, is 15 inches thick, and is usedto simulate the softer, front end structure of the striking vehicle. Thefront and rear wheels of the MDB can be turned to accommodate the impactangle specified below. Complete design drawings for the MDB have been placed in Docket No. 79-04-GeneralReference (Item 052). NHTSA notes that while the proposed regulatory testdoes not include detailed specifications for the MDB, specifications alongthe lines of drawings included in the docket would be included in the finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Barrier Weight </ITAG>NHTSA set the weight of the barrier to be representative of the weightof future vehicles expected to be involved as the striking vehicles inside impact crashes in the United States. Thus, NHTSA derived the weightof the barrier from the median curb weight of impacting vehicles involvedin serious to fatal injury side impact cases. In multiple vehicle accidentsresulting in serious injuries and fatalities, passenger cars and light/medium/heavytrucks are about equally likely to be the striking vehicle. In 1986, the average curb weight for new passenger cars was 2820 poundsand for light trucks about 3,500 pounds. Because the overall weight ofvehicles is expected to decline in the 1990's, the time when this proposedrule would be implemented, the agency set the weight of the barrier at3,000 pounds, which represents a 2,700 pound curb weight vehicle with 300pounds of occupants and cargo. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Barrier Stiffness </ITAG>In developing the MDB, NHTSA originally designed the barrier to have thestiffness or crush characteristics of a 1981 Chevrolet Citation strikinganother vehicle in the side at an angle of 60 degrees. The stiffness orcrush characteristics are controlled by the two aluminum honeycomb blocks.Together, these blocks give NHTSA's MDB an average stiffness of about 10,000lbs. per inch for a large magnitude of crush at the proposed 90 degreeimpact angle. This value is at the upper end of the passenger vehicle scale(similar to an AMC Concord). Many light trucks (e.g., GMC Astro, ChevyBlazer, and Mazda B-2000), which represent a significant portion of thestriking vehicles, are within this range of stiffness as well. The agencybelieves that the MDB front face stiffness should be higher than typicalpassenger car front structures and more like light trucks because trucks(as striking vehicles) are currently responsible for nearly as many seriousinjuries and fatalities as are passenger cars. Serious injuries and fatalitiesare expected to increase in the future without safety improvements becauseof a continuing increase in light truck popularity and increased numberof smaller sized passenger cars. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Barrier Geometry</ITAG>When NHTSA designed the barrier in 1979, the agency set the maximum andminimum bumper heights to represent the 50th percentile values for 1979sales-weighted, two-door sedans. All other barrier dimensions were selectedby direct measurement of four 1979 model passenger cars, i.e., the FordFairmont, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Citation, and the Chevrolet Impala.In 1979, these make/models had the highest sales volumes. The bumper heights(distance between the upper and lower edges) of these 1979 cars range fromabout 4.6 inches to about 7.5 inches. As would be expected from the factsthat the bumper height of passenger cars is regulated by the bumper standard(Part 581), this agrees well with the bumper heights of the ten best sellingmake/models in 1984 which range from about 4.9 inches to 7.5 inches.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Harmonization</ITAG>There are two other side impact barriers that the agency considered indeveloping this proposal. One of those barriers was developed by the Committeeof Common Market Automobile Constructors (CCMC) and the other was developedby the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC). The agency is concernedabout using either of those barriers because it believes that they arenot representative of the U.S. vehicles that are involved as the strikingvehicles in side impacts. Compared to the NHTSA barrier, the CCMC and EEVCbarrier weigh approximately \1/3\ less, are less stiff in crash tests bya factor of approximately 5, and have a lower and narrower barrier face.As stated above, NHTSA believes the NHTSA MDB stiffness and weight areappropriate because they approximate the properties found in vehicles thatcause a significant number of serious injuries and fatalities. The Europeanbarriers, as currently configured, are based on the typical or averageEuropean car. The weight and front end stiffness of a typical Europeancar is considerably lower than the weight and front end stiffness of typicalU.S. cars and light trucks. NHTSA invites commenters to addresss theseconcerns and to advise the agency whether it is possible to achieve internationalharmonization of safety standards by modifying one or more of the above-mentionedbarriers.B. Impact Speed and AngleNHTSA examined the data in the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) todetermine the appropriate impact velocities and impact point to be usedin the crash test. By using the NCSS data, the agency determined the medianspeed of all side impact accidents (26 mph striker/13 mph struck), andthe median speed of the serious injury accidents (35/17.5 mph). Based onits analysis of accident data and its judgment about the threshold speedof serious injury accidents, NHTSA tentatively decided that the thresholdspeed of serious injury (30/15 mph) was the most appropriate test speed.The agency also reviewed the angle of orientation between the longitudinalaxis of the striking and struck vehicles and determined that 90 degreeimpacts were the most frequent. In view of the potential difficulty ofconducting tests in which both the target and striking vehicles would bemoving and in which first contact must be made at the same specified spot,the agency has devised a test in which only the striking ``vehicle'' ismoving. Using vector analysis, the agency combined the impact speed andimpact angle data and determined that the dynamics and forces of a crashin which a vehicle traveling at 30 mph perpendicularly strikes the sideof a vehicle traveling at 15 mph could be represented by a test configurationin which:andbullet; The test vehicle is stationary; andbullet; The longitudinal centerline of the MDB is perpendicular to thelongitudinal centerline of the test vehicle; andbullet; The front and rear wheels of the MDB are crabbed at an angle of27 degrees to the right of its longitudinal centerline in a left side impactand to the left of that centerline in a right side impact; and andbullet; The MDB moves at that angle and at a speed of 33.5 mph into theside of the struck vehicle.C. Impact Point The agency examined crashes involving serious to fatal injuries to determinethe median value of the impact points. The impact reference point describesthe relative positions of the striking vehicle and the struck vehicle atthe time of impact. In particular, NHTSA defined the impact reference point,for the purpose of a left side impact, as the position of the left forwardedge (corner) of the striking vehicle when contact is first made with theleft side of the struck vehicle. This definition is based on accident datawhich contained documentation of the damage that occurred to the side ofthe struck vehicle. Based on the crash data, NHTSA found that the averageimpact reference point was 37 inches forward of the center of the wheelbasefor all car sizes. This means that for a left side impact, the left edgeof the striking vehicle would be 37 inches forward of the mid-point ofthe wheelbase of the struck vehicle at the time of initial contact.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Performance Requirements </ITAG>A. Thorax <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Development of the Performance Criterion </ITAG>To assess the probability of an injury to the thorax in a side impact,the agency has developed a new injury measure called the Thoracic TraumaIndex (TTI). The TTI was developed from and evaluated with test data obtainedfrom 84 cadaver tests that have been conducted over the past 10 years.The results from those tests represent the largest biomechanical data basethat has been used to support an NHTSA rulemaking action. In these instrumentedcadaver tests, NHTSA was able to compare the acceleration measured on thecadaver's ribs and spine and the severity of thoracic injury received duringeach impact. These tests showed that the occurrence of injuries to thethorax, which includes both the ribs and the internal organs protectedby the ribs, is strongly related to the peak lateral acceleration experiencedby the struck side rib cage and the lower thoracic spine. The TTI is a formula which uses the age and weight of each test subject,along with the lower thoracic spine and maximum rib accelerations to determinethe probability of injury. While the calculation of benefits requires theuse of the TTI, performance requirements can be specified in terms of acombination of peak rib and spine accelerations called the Thoracic TraumaIndex (dummy) or TTI(d). TTI(d) is further defined in S4.1 of the proposedamendment. The benefits associated with a given TTI(d) requirement canbe predicted using the TTI to assess changes across the entire vehiclefleet. The TTI(d) may be considered as the TTI where the age is zero andthe weight is 165 lbs. (which is approximately the weight of the side impactdummy). When the agency first developed the TTI, only the acceleration of the fourthrib (termed the upper rib in the TTI calculation) was measured in cadavertesting. Since then, the lateral acceleration of the eighth rib (termedthe lower rib) has generally been recorded during cadaver testing. Becauseof this, NHTSA has revised the method of calculating the TTI and the TTI(d)by using the higher of the acceleration responses from the upper and lowerrib. One beneficial effect of this change in the calculation of the TTI(d)is that it will promote the development of more balanced countermeasuresthat provide protection to the upper and lower thorax and the abdomen aswell. NHTSA has recently had an opportunity to evaluate further the ability ofthe TTI injury measure to distinguish between different AIS injury levels.The Forschungsvereinigung Automobiltechnik (FAT), an association of some30 German motor vehicle and equipment manufacturers, sponsored a numberof tests at the University of Heidelberg. These tests, (which are includedin the total of 84 tests mentioned above) were designed to study lateralimpacts of human cadavers, as well as three different designs of side impactdummies, seated in actual car bodies. Using the cadaver injury data, NHTSAevaluated the performance of TTI in predicting the injury severity levelresulting from a lateral impact. In the FAT tests, which were conducted on a sled, the deformable barrierdeveloped under the auspices of the Committee of Common Market AutomobileConstructors' was propelled into an Opel Kadett ``body in white'' in whichthe test subject (a human cadaver) was seated in the front seat on thestruck side. Each car body was struck twice at an angle of 90anddegrees;,once in the left side, and once in the right side. The speed of the barrierwas either 40, 45, 50, or 60 km/hr. Each cadaver was exposed to one crashtest. NHTSA's review of the test results, which is contained in the Societyof Automotive Engineers paper entitled ``Side Impact_The Biofidelity ofNHTSA's Proposed ATD and Efficacy of TTI,'' (SAE Report No. 861877, Oct.,1986), again showed that TTI effectively distinguished between differentlevels of injury. That is, the higher the value of TTI calculated for thetest, the greater was the probability of serious injury experienced bythe cadaver. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimated Benefits of the Thorax Criterion </ITAG>As a part of its side impact protection research program, NHTSA has conductedcrash tests of 12 production passenger cars (20 crash tests) using thetest conditions and anthropomorphic test dummy (side impact dummy or SID)proposed today. (The tests of the production cars are discussed in moredetail in section VII of this notice.) To evaluate the effects of meetinga specified thorax performance criterion, the agency analyzed the probabilityof thoracic injury for each of the cars in the 20 tests using the TTI andother factors and compared this to the level of injury that would occurfor each of the alternative values of the proposed TTI(d) thorax criterion.Assuming the production vehicles tested by NHTSA are representative ofthe total fleet of new cars, the estimated benefits for the different levelsof the proposed TTI(d) thoracic injury criterion were calculated. Thatis, all cases exceeding a particular chosen maximum TTI(d) were reducedto the specified level while all vehicles having lower values retainedtheir original values. Injury distributions were then recalculated usingthe altered TTI(d) values. Results are shown in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1_Thorax Benefits for Different Maximum Levels of TTI(d) Performancein the Baseline Fleet </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Reductions in injuries/fatalities] </ITAG><H1>TTI(d) </H1><H1>AIS 3 </H1><H1>AIS 4 </H1><H1>AIS 5 </H1><H1>Total </H1><H2>AIS 3-5 </H2><H1>Fatals </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">80 <D>3,582 </D><D>364 </D><D>175 </D><D>4,122 </D><D>1,238 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85 <D>3,059 </D><D>303 </D><D>136 </D><D>3,498 </D><D>1,001 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90 <D>2,510 </D><D>240 </D><D>118 </D><D>2,867 </D><D>866 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95 <D>1,921 </D><D>179 </D><D>97 </D><D>2,197 </D><D>718 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100 <D>1,393 </D><D>127 </D><D>75 </D><D>1,595 </D><D>553 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105 <D>931 </D><D>83 </D><D>54 </D><D>1,068 </D><D>397 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110 <D>539 </D><D>47 </D><D>39 </D><D>625 </D><D>285 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115 <D>247 </D><D>21 </D><D>22 </D><D>291 </D><D>162 </D></ITAG></ITAG> Since restraint system usage reduces fatalities and injuries in side impacts,the agency also examined how increased safety belt usage, as a result ofeither state safety belt use laws or automatic restraints, would affectthe estimated benefits expected from the use of structural modificationand increased padding to improve side impact protection. In determiningthe effect of restraint system usage on side impact protection, the agencymade a number of assumptions, which are discussed in detail on pages IV-43through IV-55 of the PRIA. The agency assumed that manual or automatic safety belt usage would bein the 40-70 percent range. NHTSA also examined the available accidentdata and estimated the effectiveness or restraint systems in reducing torsoinjuries in side impacts. That review showed that safety belts are lesseffective in reducing torso injuries in sied impacts than they are in reducinginjuries to other portions of the body in side impacts. Based on the accidentdata, NHTSA estimated that, for the occupant on the struck side, manualsafety belts would be 19-26 percent effective in reducing upper torso relatedside impact fatalities and 23-30 percent effective in reducing AIS 3-5injuries. NHTSA further estimated that automatic safety belts would be18-25 percent effective in reducing upper torso related side impact fatalitiesand 21-28 percent effective in reducing AIS 3-5 injuries. Applying theseestimates, NHTSA determined that approximately 5-14 percent of the potentialreduction in fatalities and 6-16 percent of the potential benefit in reducingAIS 3-5 injuries would already be achieved by increases in safety beltusage before in final side impact rule was fully implemented. Thus, theagency reduced the estimated effectiveness of the proposed side impactrequirements by the expected benefits of increased restraint use and derivedthe final benefit estimates shown in Table 2. As with any requirementsfor new vehicles, the benefits accrue over the 10-15 year life of the modelyear fleets affected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 2_Estimated Thoracic Benefits Resulting From the Side ImpactProposal After Making Adjustments for Restraint Usage </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Thoracic Benefits] </ITAG><H1>TTI(d) </H1><H1>AIS 3-5 </H1><H1>Fatals</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">80 <D>3,503-3,913 </D><D>1,072-1,185 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85 <D>2,967-3,319 </D><D>865-957 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90 <D>2,426-2,718 </D><D>747-828 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95 <D>1,885-2,082 </D><D>618-686 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100 <D>1,343-1,510 </D><D>476-529 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105 <D>897-1,010 </D><D>341-379 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110 <D>524-591 </D><D>244-272 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115 <D>244-275 </D><D>139-155</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Alternative Thoracic Injury Criterion </ITAG>General Motors has developed what is known as the viscous injury criterion(VC) for use in analyzing soft tissue injuries in frontal impacts. Thisinjury criterion is based on the product of the instantaneous thorax compression(C) and its rate of compression (V) that occurs during impact. At the agency's1986 public meeting on side impact protection, GM urged the adoption ofa VC criterion for measuring the potential for injury in side impacts.Although NHTSA believes that the work GM has done in frontal impacts usingthe VC criterion shows that such an approach may be promising, there are,at this time, not data to support adopting the VC as a criterion for assessingvehicle safety in side impacts. A further drawback to the use of the VCcriterion at this time is that there are no dummies (including the agency'sexisting SID) that have been designed with biofidelity for measurementof lateral VC. Although the side impact dummy (known as the EUROSID) beingdeveloped by the European safety community will be able to measure chestcompression, this dummy is still undergoing evaluation. Further, it isnot known whether these measured displacements will be appropriate withrespect to biofidelity. For additional discussion of the EUROSID dummy,see today's Federal Register notice on the agency's proposed new side impacttest dummy. In contrast to the VC criterion, the agency has a substantial amount ofcadaver impact tests that indicate that the TTI(d) proposed in this noticeis a reliable predictor for thoracic injuries. In addition, the agencyhas developed a reliable test dummy (SID) that can be used to measure performanceusing the acceleration based criterion (TTI(d)). At this time, NHTSA believesthat the TTI(d) is fully adequate for use in this proposal and that muchmore additional information is needed before the agency can evaluate theeffectiveness and reliability of the viscous injury criterion in assessingside impact injuries. When and if additional biomechanical informationis available of the adequacy of the VC criterion in side impacts, theagencywill consider that information to determine whether it should be proposed.B. Pelvis NHTSA has done research to develop criteria to limit pelvic injury in sideimpacts. The research, which has been published in a paper, ``Synthesisof Pelvic Fracture Criteria for Lateral Impact Loading,'' presented atthe Tenth International Technical Conference of Experimental Safety Vehicles,reviewed data from the above-mentioned 84 cadaver impact tests which measuredthe acceleration of the pelvis. (The agency used the same cadaver datain setting the proposed injury criterion for the thorax.) As a result ofthat review, the agency developed estimates of the probability of pelvicfracture for different acceleration levels measured in the pelvis of thecadavers. The agency is concerned that certain design modifications could reducethoracic response by shifting the load path into the pelvis. A pelvic injurycriterion has been proposed to prevent worsening of pelvic protection.To evaluate the effects of requiring cars to meet various maximum pelvisacceleration levels, the agency estimated the probability of pelvic injuryfor each of the 12 production passenger cars that were crash tested bythe agency in one of its research programs. The test results showed thatapproximately 17 percent of the front seat occupants and 11 percent ofthe rear seat occupants would receive a fractured pelvis as a result ofthe acceleration experienced in those crash tests. The agency then calculatedthe expected benefits derived from having vehicles comply with variouslimits on pelvic acceleration levels. Those results are shown in Table3. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp7,p6,6/7,i1,s6,5,5,4,5 </C><T4>Table </T4>3<T4>_Estimated Pelvic Fracture Injury Reduction</T4> <H1>Alternative levels of peak pelvic g's </H1><H1>Front seat near side </H1><H1>Front seat far side </H1><H1>Rear seat near side </H1><H1>Total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">130 <D>959 </D><D>31 </D><D>35 </D><D>1,025 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">150 <D>718 </D><D>25 </D><D>7 </D><D>750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">170 <D>486 </D><D>17 </D><D>7 </D><D>510 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">190 <D>30 </D><D>1 </D><D>0 </D><D>31</D></ITAG></ITAG> As was done with the estimates of the potential thoracic benefits, theagency then recalculated the pelvic benefit estimates to take into accountthe effects of increased safety belt usage.

Prohibiting Door Openings The potential benefits of requiring the doors to remain closed during theside impact consist of reducing the number of persons who are ejected froma car through a door and strike an object outside the car. After reviewingthe results of the 12 vehicle crash tests, the agency found that four ofthe vehicles had a door open during the crash. NHTSA then estimated thenumber of ejections that occur in side impacts and evaluated the potentialeffectiveness of keeping the door closed in reducing occupant deaths andinjuries. The agency estimates that the proposed requirement has the possibilityof reducing 106 fatalities and 167 serious to critical injuries annually.As with its other benefit estimates, the agency then calculated the effectof increased restraint system usage on the level of benefits to be derivedfrom the proposed door requirement. Since the prevention of ejection isone of the prime benefits of safety belt use, an increase in restraintsystem use would have a larger effect on reducing the estimated benefitsof the door retention requirement than on reducing the benefits of theproposed thorax or pelvis requirements. Taking into account the effectof increased safety belt usage, the agency estimates that the proposeddoor retention requirement would reduce 59-85 fatalities and 88-131 AIS3-5 injuries annually. D. Test Procedure The proposed test procedures provide that a test dummy is to be restrainedduring a test only if that dummy is located in a seating position equippedwith an automatic belt. This provision is proposed because, although beltusage is increasing, through the passage of mandatory use laws and a growingawareness of safety on the part of consumers, manual restraint usage isunlikely to reach 100 percent. Thus, the agency desires to assure protectionfor unrestrained occupants. Recent accident data analyses indicate thatbelt type restraints may be somewhat beneficial in side impacts. Unrestrainedtesting should, therefore, be on the conservative side. Also, the unrestraineddummy is generally propelled to the far side of the vehicle in a side impacttest, thus creating the potential of causing the far side door to open.Allowing this to occur would aid in evaluating the capability of the farside door to remain closed during a side impact crash, which is a requirementin this proposal. For manual belt systems, or manual belts used to supplementautomatic restraint systems, the agency's limited testing leads to uncertaintywhether such restraint use affects compliance with the proposed requirements.Thus, the agency seeks comments on whether compliance testing should beconducted with restrained or unrestrained dummies and the reasons therefore.Component test procedures may eventually be possible alternatives to theagency's proposed side impact test which uses a moving deformable barrierand the side impact dummy to measure vehicle safety. The agency is awarethat various industry organizations have conducted considerable researchtoward the development of devices and procedures for side component tests.Particularly prominent in this area is the recent work sponsored by theMotor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) which used the 1985 FordLTD as the base vehicle. See ``Status and Update of MVMA Component Testing,''SAE Report No. 871116. Although this program essentially demonstrated thefeasibility of the MVMA component approach for the Ford LTD, the problemswhich still remain indicate that it may not be possible to develop a componenttest procedure utilizing a single set of requirements (involving specifiedram face dimensions to achieve a prescribed magnitude of side structurepre-crush coupled with the impact speed of a simulated thorax) that wouldbe adequately applicable to all vehicles considering the wide range ofvehicle sizes and side structural characteristics. Volkswagen AG recently reported results from their studies on a componentprocedure which is considerably different from the MVMA approach. See ``ComponentTest Procedure For Side Impact Protection,'' SAE Report No. 871117. Thisprocedure is a composite of test and analysis, but is subject to the sameproblem of appropriate application to all vehicles as noted above. It is apparent that the component approach has some potential beneficialfeatures (particularly for the use by a manufacturer in the early stagesof vehicle design). While the agency believes that the concept needs additionalresearch, it encourages the further development of this approach. Commentson this subject are specifically solicited. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Feasibility of the Countermeasures </ITAG>NHTSA has performed a substantial number of vehicle crash tests to examinethe existing side impact performance for many cars, as determined by theTTI(d) and pelvis acceleration measured on the side impact test dummy,and to evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques to improve sideimpact performance. In particular, the research programs have concentratedon making production feasible structural changes and adding additionalpadding to the interior surface of the vehicle's side door to improve sideimpact protection. As discussed in more detail below, this research hasshown that the use of structural modifications in combination with paddingor the use of padding alone can reduce the probability of thoracic andpelvic injuries. The following discussion highlights several of the more important sideimpact research programs conducted by NHTSA. The details of these and otheragency research programs are discussed more fully in the Preliminary RegulatoryImpact Analysis. In 1977, NHTSA began a program to improve the side structureintegrity for lightweight subcompact cars using a 2-door Volkswagen Rabbit.The agency decided to concentrate its research efforts on light vehicles,because it anticipated having the greatest difficulty in improving thelevel of side impact protection in those vehicles. The agency also believesthat any countermeasures developed for those vehicles could more easilybe adapted for use in larger and heavier vehicles. NHTSA chose the VW Rabbitafter testing the side impact performance of three small front wheel drivevehicles. The peak thoracic and pelvic accelerations measured on the sideimpact test dummy seated in the Rabbit indicated the Rabbit to be an ``average''performer in its class. The research program devloped four levels of structrual modifications tothe 2-door VW Rabbit to investigate the effect of increased side strengthon intrusion. Those levels were categorized by the weight that the modificationsadded to the car and were designated as lightweight, middleweight, heavyweightand ``optimized'' (the ``optimized'' version used parts that had performedwell in tests of the three other designs, but had been reduced in weight).These structural additions focused on the front seat area; no structurewas added to the rear quarter panel or C-pillar areas. Intrusion was reducedby a factor of nearly 50 percent (from approximately 20 inches to 10 inches)with the heavy and optimized weight designs, but the dummary peak accelerationswere not significantly altered. Concurrently with the programs to improve the structural integrity of thevehicle, NHTSA also conducted research at its Vehicle Research and TestCenter in East Liberty, Ohio to select and evaluate interior padding. Theinterior padding was an ``add-on'' feature so that the door structure didnot require alteration to accommodate the padding. The agency assumed thatmanufacturers would incorporate these features in production vehicles byusing the door structure itself and part of the door thickness so as tominimize the space taken from the occupant compartment. In January 1981, NHTSA began another research effort conducted in two parts.This was called the modified integrated vehicle (MIV) program. One partwas conducted by VW to improve the side impact protection of a 4-door VWRabbit and the other part was conducted by MCR Technology Inc. using theChevrolet Citation. The program evaluated both structural modificationsand padding changes, independently and combined. The first phase of theresearch effort concentrated on developing ``production feasible'' improvements,which would add little weight to the vehicle. To evaluate the performanceof the modifications, the agency conducted a series of tests on the Rabbitsimulating a vehicle moving at 22 mph striking another vehicle moving at11 mph. The impact angle was 60 degrees. The agency's MDB was used as thestriking vehicle. These tests involved an unmodified VW Rabbit, a structurallyunmodified Rabbit with additional interior padding, a structurally modifiedRabbit with no additional interior padding, and finally a structurallymodified Rabbit with additional interior padding.In the second phase of the MIV program, the agency tested the structurallymodified and padded Rabbit in two additional impact configurations. Theconfigurations simulated a vehicle moving at 30 mph striking another vehiclemoving at 15 mph at impact angles of 60 degrees and 90 degrees. In thesetests, a Chevrolet Citation was used as the striking vehicle.In summary, NHTSA's testing shows that it is possible to develop ``productionfeasible'' countermeasures that can reduce potential thorax and pelvicinjuries in side impacts. Based on the results obtained in this testing,NHTSA has, as discussed below, developed estimates of the effectivenessof different side impact countermeasures in reducing injuries.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Estimate of Needed Improvement in the Vehicle Fleet</ITAG>In addition to the testing which was done on the modified and unmodifiedRabbits and Citations, NHTSA has also conducted a series of 20 tests on12 different unmodified passenger cars. (In some cases, a 2-door and 4-doorversion of the same model were tested and, in other cases, there were repeattests of the same models. One test was for a completely redesigned vehicle.)The agency tested these vehicles in the impact configuration and test speedproposed in this notice. The vehicles tested were the AMC Concord, ChevroletCelebrity, Chevrolet Citation (2-door and 4-door models), Chevrolet Spectrum,Dodge 400, Dodge Omni 2-door/Plymouth Horizon 4-door, Ford Granada (2-doorand 4-door models), Honda Civic, Mazda 626, Nissan Sentra, including itsMY 1987 redesign, and VW Rabbit.NHTSA used the results from the tests of the production vehicles to estimatethe percentage of the passenger car fleet that currently meets the proposedalternative levels of the standard. In assessing the changes needed incurrent vehicles to meet the standard, the agency has not calculated theeffectiveness for modifications that only involve structural changes. Therewere six cases of comparable baseline versus structure alone tests. Inthree of these tests for the driver, the TTI(d) went up and in three tests,the TTI(d) went down. A number of other tests have shown relatively littleor no benefit from structure alone countermeasures. Because of these results,the agency does not consider the structural countermeasure it developedas a consistent means to reduce side impact injuries. This does not meanthat countermeasures using only structural modifications will not work.It simply means that the approaches evaluated by the agency did not consistentlywork.Table 5 shows the percentage of the current passenger car fleet meetingthe various alternative levels of thorax acceleration at different seatingpositions in a car. The agency requests manufacturers to provide additionalside impact test results so that the agency can refine its analysis ofthe percentage of the fleet currently meeting the alternatives. The agencyhas examined the effects of setting the TTI(d) limit between the valuesof 80 and 115 g's for the thorax.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp7,p6,6/7,i1,5,6,6,5</C><T4>Table 5_Percent of the Fleet Meeting Alternative Levels for the Thorax</T4><H1>TTI(d)</H1><H1>(In percent)</H1><H2>Driver</H2><H2>Rear passenger</H2><H2>Both positions</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">80<D>16.7</D><D>25.0</D><D>8.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85<D>25.0</D><D>25.0</D><D>8.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90<D>25.0</D><D>41.7</D><D>8.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95<D>41.7</D><D>58.3</D><D>25.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>50.0</D><D>66.7</D><D>33.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105<D>50.0</D><D>83.3</D><D>50.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110<D>58.3</D><D>91.6</D><D>58.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115<D>66.7</D><D>100.0</D><D>66.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>Table 6 presents estimates of the percentage of the fleet that would needvarious countermeasures to meet the various levels of the TTI(d) beingconsidered for the standard.

For rear passengers, padding alone is also assumed to be 35percent effective. The agency derived these effectiveness estimates basedon the performance improvements resulting from the use of various sideimpact protection countermeasures in cars. The agency then applied theseeffectiveness estimates to the thoracic acceleration results of each ofthe 12 production cars and the results were then compared to the alternativelevel of the standard being proposed to determine which countermeasureis needed for each vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 6_Percent of the Fleet Needing Various Countermeasures To MeetAlternative Levels of the Standard for the Thorax</T4><H1>Driver</H1><H2>TTI(d)</H2><H2>(In percent)</H2><H3>None</H3><H3>Padding</H3><H3>Structure and padding</H3><H3>Heavyweight structure and padding</H3><H1>Rear passenger</H1><H2>(In percent)</H2><H3>None</H3><H3>Padding</H3><ITAG tagnum="1">80<D>16.7</D><D>33.3</D><D>16.7</D><D>33.3</D><D>25.0</D><D>75.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">85<D>25.0</D><D>33.4</D><D>33.3</D><D>8.3</D><D>25.0</D><D>75.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">90<D>25.0</D><D>41.7</D><D>25.0</D><D>8.3</D><D>41.7</D><D>58.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">95<D>41.7</D><D>50.0</D><D>8.3</D><D>0.0</D><D>58.3</D><D>41.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>50.0</D><D>41.7</D><D>8.3</D><D>0.0</D><D>66.7</D><D>33.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">105<D>50.0</D><D>50.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>83.3</D><D>16.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">110<D>58.3</D><D>41.7</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>91.6</D><D>8.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">115<D>66.7</D><D>33.3</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>100.0</D><D>0.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>Table 7 indicates the percentage of the fleet meeting various alternativestandards for pelvic g's.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp7,p6,6/7,i1,6,6,6,4</C><T4>Table 7_Percent of Fleet Meeting Alternative Levels for Pelvic Acceleration</T4><H1>Pelvic acceleration</H1><H1>(In percent)</H1><H2>Driver</H2><H2>Rear passenger</H2><H2>Both</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">130<D>0</D><D>33.3</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">150<D>27.3</D><D>91.7</D><D>27.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">170<D>54.5</D><D>91.7</D><D>45.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">190<D>72.7</D><D>100.0</D><D>72.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>Table 8 presents the percentage of the fleet that would need various countermeasuresto meet the alternative levels of the pelvic g's standard being analyzed.The perecentage of the fleet needing each countermeasure is derived byassuming effectiveness as follows: for drivers_padding is approximately35 percent effective, structure and padding is approximately 40 percenteffective, and heavyweight structure and padding is 57 percent effective.For rear passengers, padding is approximately 33 percent effective.

Costs</ITAG>As a part of its research program on side impacts, NHTSA has done severalmajor studies of the potential costs associated with improving side impactprotection. The first cost study was based on the work begun in 1980 withthe Budd Company to develop several structural modifications for improvingthe side impact design of subcompact two-door sedans. As discussed earlierin this notice, the Budd Company developed four alternative side structuredesigns based on the 1976/1977 VW Rabbit two-door passenger sedan. Theproduction version VW Rabbit was used as a baseline for comparing the weight,cost, and crash impact performance of the four modified design versions.The four design concepts were categorized by the total added weight ofthe modifications to the car and were designated as a lightweight design,middleweight design, heavyweight design and an ``optimized'' design. Thecrash test results for the lightweight and middleweight designs showedthat none of the structural modifications described above sufficientlyimproved side impact protection as measured by reductions in thoracic acceleration.The heavyweight and optimized designs showed some promise of reducing sideimpact injuries and consequently, the agency used those designs in calculatingthe cost associated with this proposed rulemaking.   Subsequent to completion of the work by Budd, NHTSA sponsored several studiesto analyze the costs and manufacturing feasibility of structural modificationsand increased padding to improve side impact protection. Those studieshave concentrated on examining approaches that would support the type ofvehicle construction techniques that would be used in efficient high-volumeproduction using more sophisticated tools. Those studies found that thetypes of modification examined by the agency could be simplified if a vehiclemanufacturer planned to incorporate the side impact features into a newvehicle design. In particular, the studies found that many of the partsused by the agency in its original research program could be modified,combined, eliminated, or incorporated into the basic original structuralmembers using the original tools. In addition to examining the costs ofstructural improvements, the agency has also analyzed the costs associatedwith the addition of padding.   The costs and weight changes derived using the modified vehicle tests conductedseveral years ago, where the primary purpose of the modifications was toreduce intrusion, represent relatively high values for both costs and weights.As discussed earlier, the test results showed that structural improvementsalone did not necessarily result in significant reductions in thoracicacceleration, an injury criterion being proposed by the agency in thisnotice.   The agency believes that a more effective and efficient approach for reducingoccupant thorax and pelvis injury in side impacts is to provide equivalentpadding (either actual padding or modified, energy-absorbing sheet-metalstructure) as necessary in the door area. This should be more efficientfor these types of injuries, and have much lower associated costs. Thishas been demonstrated by actual production vehicles. For example, the 1987Nissan Sentra incorporated significant improvements, at a cost of apparantlyless than $100 over the earlier version of this model, to considerablyimprove both the frontal and side forces on vehicles occupants. Also, thereare some designs of small and other cars tested by NHTSA that already haverelatively good side impact performance for the dirver (e.g., Concord 4-doorwith TTI(d) of 72.5, Spectrum 2-door with TTI(d) of 83.5, Celebrity withTTI(d) of 79.0. In addition, 25 percent of the rear seat passengers ofthe cars tested by NHTSA had TTI(d) values below 85 g's. Since a numberof cars demonstrate very good side impact performance without special additionof countermeasures (i.e., only configurational differences), the agencybelieves that other vehicles could also be redesigned to improve performanceat little increase in consumer costs. The agency's judgment is that individualmodels can have overall lifetime costs of meeting requirements down tothe 85 TTI(d) level of somewhere between zero and $100 (additional fueland secondary weight costs included). The overall fleet-weight costs ofthe 85 TTI(d) level, for example, could be less than $50 per vehicle, ifsufficient leadtime is provided such that most vehicles can be designedwith the side impact requirements in mind.   NHTSA combined the estimates of the vehicle modification costs, includingthe fuel economy and secondary weight costs, associated with differenttypes of side impact protection modifications and the estimates of thepercentage of the fleet that would need modifications to meet various thoraxand pelvis accelaration levels. These total costs range from fleet averagesof $8 to averages of over $100 per car, depending on the injury level selectedand assumptions on secondary weight factors.   NHTSA wants to emphasize that the costs of the proposed requirements areexpected to be significantly lower than the estimates derived from itsoutdated cost studies. The NHTSA tests showed that some existing vehiclescould meet various proposed levels of safety with little modifications.This suggests there are less costly ways of upgrading side impact protection.The improved performance of some existing cars appears to be due to thelarger cross-sectional thickness of the door and quarter panels of thoseparticular vehicles. This would create better performance due to the outerand inner panels not being completely crushed together as the door is beingpushed into the passenger compartment, prior to dummy contact. This alsoallows the inner panel to absorb some of the dummy's energy before beingcrushed into the outer panel and the ensuing rigid barrier.   The agency believes that future model designs, by manufacturers who donot have this cross-sectional thickness feature, can incorporate this designconcept, resulting in lower safety improvement costs for most vehicles.  Considering that most of the vehicles NHTSA has tested are not likely tobe in the fleet 5 years after implementation of the final rule when thestandard becomes fully effective, and that a phase-in procedure is proposed,the agency believes that it is reasonable to assume that manufacturerswould incorporate safety improvements in their clean-sheet design of mostnew models to comply with the standard prior to and at the time of fullimplementation. This approach will entail research and development, engineering,and testing expenses in order to meet the standard, but perhaps, with verylittle added cost per vehicle.    The agency has not designed and tested countermeasures to prevent dooropenings during the compliance tests. Thus, specific cost estimates formeasures to meet this provision of the proposal are not available. However,based on its November 1982 evaluation of Standard No. 214, the agency believesthat reductions in the possibility of door openings are feasible throughstructural improvements made to reduce the TTI(d) and pelvic g's. The 1982evaluation found that the inclusion of side door beams reduced the incidenceof door openings by 20-40 percent in single vehicle crashes and 10-30 percentin multi-vehicle crashes. The agency believes that further reductions arepossible as a by-product of measures adopted to comply with the proposedinjury criteria. Thus, the costs of reducing door openings are believedto be included in the above-mentioned costs, or, in the alternative, areestimated to be relatively small, on the order of $2-$4 per vehicle affected.It is estimated that only a small portion of the fleet would be so affected.Comments are specifically requested on these assumptions.   In addition to the costs associated with designing and producing the countermeasuresneeded to meet the proposed performance requirements, today's proposedrule also would result in some test equipment costs. The SID dummy is basicallya Part 572 dummy with a modified thorax that uses thoracic and pelvic accelerationto measure impact loads. NHTSA estimates that buying a complete new SIDdummy would cost approximately $22,000. However, with the phase-in implementationof the Hybrid III Dummy required to meet FMVSS 208 compliance certificationin the future, many of the existing Part 572 dummies could be modifiedto meet the SID requirements at a substantial savings to the manufacturers.In addition to the cost of the dummy, there are costs associated with calibratingthe dummy, purchasing replacement parts and performing the dynamic crashtest. NHTSA estimates the total incremental cost per dummy per test applicationto be approximately $2,500. In addition, the estimated cost of the NHTSAMDB is approximately $23,000 with instrumentation. This does not includeexpendable aluminum honeycomb face and bumper, which, at present, has tobe replaced after each test, and is estimated to be an additional $2,100per test. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Leadtime </ITAG>The leadtime needed to comply with the proposed range of requirements mightvary markedly from manufacturer to manufacturer. As discussed earlier,depending on the level of the performance requirements adopted in the finalrule, some manufacturers may need little change in some of their models.In addition, for manufacturers that only need to adopt padding countermeasures,the leadtime is relatively short. Based on engineering judgment, the agencybelieves the normal leadtime to design, tool and test new interior trimpanels and arm rests is approximately 14 to 18 months. However, manufacturersneeding to adopt either the optimized or heavyweight structural modificationsand padding could need significant amounts of leadtime. In instances where a manufacturer can make the needed structural modificationsby making minor design changes to such vehicle structures as the door andthe ``A'' and ``B'' pillars, it is possible to make those changes withapproximately two years of leadtime. However, unlike approaches that usepadding only or minor alterations to existing vehicle parts, some passengercars may need significant improvement to the vehicle body shell to complywith the standard. Thus, if significant revisions are necessary, some vehiclemodels may require as much as five years of leadtime to develop, design,and produce the needed changes. The agency believes that the best approachto addressing the varying leadtime requirements is to phase-in the standard.This will allow manufacturers that can use the relatively straightforwardpadding approach in some of their models, to adopt that countermeasurein the early years of the phase-in. A phase-in approach will also providesufficient time for manufacturers to design, develop, and produce significantstructural modifications for those vehicles that need major changes. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Effect on the Current Version of Standard No. 214 and Other Standards</ITAG>As discussed in the beginning of this notice, agency research has shownthat the requirements of current Standard No. 214 have been effective inreducing fatalities and injuries in single vehicle impacts. The agencybelieves that the primary reason for the effectiveness of the current standardis that it reduces intrusion into the vehicle. The amendments proposedtoday do not include any limits on intrusion, but instead place limitson the acceleration experienced by a side impact test dummy in a simulatedside impact. Given the effectiveness of the current requirements, NHTSA is proposingto retain them even if it adopts the new performance requirements beingproposed today. The agency notes that, for convenience, the proposed regulatorytext does not repeat the existing requirements, but instead sets forththe new performance requirements as a new Standard No. 214 which wouldreplace the existing requirements. If the agency decides to adopt the proposednew requirements, it would issue a final rule combining the new and existingrequirements into Standard No. 214. However, the agency requests commentson retaining the existing requirements of Standard No. 214, if the proposednew performance requirements are adopted. The agency also requests commenters to address whether the agency shouldadopt a separate limitation on intrusion that occurs during the simulatedside impact test proposed today. Standard No. 201,<T3> Occupant Protection in Interior Impact,</T3> also contains requirementsthat are aimed at reducing injuries in side impacts. Section 5.3 of thatstandard sets requirements for the armrests used in vehicles. The purposeof those requirements is to reduce the potential for thoracic and pelvicinjuries. Since the amendments proposed today include limits on pelvicand thoracic acceleration, the agency requests comments on whether thefinal rule should delete the Standard No. 201 requirements insofar as theyapply to (a) armrests built into the interior surface of the side doors,and (b) folding armrests. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Phase-in of New Requirements </ITAG>As discussed above, NHTSA is proposing to phase-in the new requirements.While the proposed regulatory text does not specify the phase-in requirement,the agency contemplates adding regulatory text along the lines used toexpress the phase-in of automatic restraint requirements of Standard No.208,<T3> Occupant Crash Protection.</T3> See andSection; 4.1.3 through andSection;4.1.3.5.2 of Standard No. 208 and 49 CFR Part 585. NHTSA requests commentson this approach. Specific regulatory text would be set forth in a finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Regulatory Impacts </ITAG><T3>A. Executive Order 12291 </T3>NHTSA has examined the impact of this rulemaking action and determinedthat it is major within the meaning of Executive Order 12291, and significantwithin the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policiesand procedures. The agency has prepared a Preliminary Regulatory ImpactAnalysis describing the economic and other effects of this rulemaking action.The analysis is available in the docket. <T3>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </T3>NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under theRegulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that it would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly,the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis.Few, if any, passenger car manufacturers would qualify as small entities.Small organizations and governmental units should not be significantlyaffected since the potential increases associated with this proposed actionshould only slightly affect the purchase price of new motor vehicles. <T3>C. Environmental Effects </T3>NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that implementationof this action would not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment. <T3>D. Paperwork Reduction Act </T3>The reporting and recordkeeping requirements proposed in section XI ofthe preamble of this notice in connection with the phase-in of the newrequirements are considered to be information collection requirements asthat term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget in 5 CFR Part1320. Accordingly, those proposed requirements are being submitted to OMBfor its review pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Comments on theproposed information collection requirements should be submitted to: Officeof Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Office for NHTSA. It is requestedthat comments sent to OMB also be sent to the NHTSA rulemaking docket forthis proposed action. <ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Submission of Comments </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It isrequested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments mustbe limited to 15 pages in length. (49 CFR Part 553.21) Necessary attachmentsmay be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit.This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primaryarguments in a concise fashion.If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality,three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidentialinformation, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the streetaddress given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidentialinformation has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section.A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter settingforth the information specified in the agency's confidential business informationregulation (49 CFR Part 512). All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examinationin the docket at the above address both before and after that date. Tothe extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also beconsidered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time afterthat date, and comments received after the closing date and too late forconsideration in regard to the action will be treated as suggestions forfuture rulemaking. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant material asit becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommendedthat interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.Persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rulesdocket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a self-addressedstamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor willreturn the postcard by mail. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 </ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles.
