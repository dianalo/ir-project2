Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told reporters in Jerusalem thatIsrael was ``waiting for proposals'' from the Shiites. ... ``Wehope we will get some proposals and it will be the end of thecrisis.''   Shamir's top aide, Avi Pazner, said Israel was awaiting thespecific list of prisoners whose freedom the Shiites seek. The listwas promised in a statement from a militant Shiite faction inBeirut on Thursday night.   After the faction, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, onThursday suspended its threat to kill U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio,Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel will examine the demands``on a positive basis.''   The ``freezing'' of the death threat came just minutes before adeadline set by the group for killing Cicippio unless Israel handedover the Shiite clergyman it kidnapped last week from his home insouth Lebanon.   Another Shiite Moslem faction that was holding Marine Lt. Col.William Higgins hostage said it killed him Monday because theclergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, was not freed by Israel.   Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying Israel was moving closer tostarting negotiations to free three captured Israeli soldiers inLebanon. Israeli said it abducted Obeid on July 28 hoping to swaphim for the three soldiers.   Israel has said it will also try to secure the release of 16Western hostages, including Cicippio and seven other Americans.   Earlier today, Shamir discussed with Rabin, Foreign MinisterMoshe Arens and Finance Minister Shimon Peres the demands made bythe Revolutionary Justice Organization, an offshoot of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Peres, who is also vice premier, was asked after a meeting withShamir whether Iran was actively involved in the process. ``I'mhopeful,'' he replied.   In its first statement, the Revolutionary Justice group demandthat Obeid be freed. After suspending the threat to kill Cicippio,it also demanded that Israel release ``a number of'' Lebanese andPalestinian prisoners.   While the statement did not mention Israel's offer to exchangeShiite prisoners for Israeli POWs and foreign hostages, Israeliofficials and commentators saw the halting of the threatenedkilling of Cicippio as a sign the Shiite radicals were ready todeal.   ``If indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposalfor prisoners exchange, we shall examine it on a positive basis,''Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem Thursday night.   Israeli officials noted the Shiite demands did not mention theIsraeli air force navigator and two soldiers believed held byHezbollah, and said Rabin's statement was meant to solicit aspecific response regarding them.   Akiva Eldar, a leading columnist for the daily Haaretz, saidIsraeli officials were not taking seriously demands to releaseprisoners from the 19-month Palestinian uprising, which couldinclude more than 8,000 detainees.   Peres told an American Jewish group that any negotiations wouldbe complicated and lengthy, and an army general who managedIsrael's last prisoner exchange said it would take ``a long timeand great patience'' to make a deal.   Maj. Gen. Moshe Nativ told Israel radio that the process wouldbegin with unreasonable Shiite demands and Israel would counterwith insistence on first seeing the three soldiers believed held byHezbollah or allied factions.   Nativ was in charge of negotiations that led to the exchange ofthree Israeli soldiers for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in a dealwith the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand in 1985.   He said any negotiations over the 16 Western hostages would bemore complicated because other countries were involved.   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
