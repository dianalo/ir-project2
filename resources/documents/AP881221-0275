At the height of its power, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bestrodethe financial world like a colossus, using its money-raising powerto finance everything from nursery school chains to corporatetakeovers.   On Wednesday, the colossus dropped to its knees, legally if notfinancially. Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six federal felonycounts and pay a record $650 million fine to settle the biggest WallStreet securities fraud case in history.   The deal requires approval of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and senior Justice Department officials.   Drexel's power came from its exploitation of an area of financethat other investment bankers had ignored, either because of lack ofimagination or lack of appetite for risk.   Drexel helped clients raise large amounts of money quickly byissuing bonds that were riskier than investment-grade securities andhence paid higher yields.   The securities quickly became known as junk bonds, to the dismayof Drexel and Michael Milken, the brilliant strategist who helpedpioneer them.   In spite of its upstart image, Drexel was not a newcomer to WallStreet. It traces its roots to the founding of Burnham andamp; Co. in1935. Drexel Firestone, which Burnham acquired in 1973, goes back tothe 1830s and once counted J.P. Morgan among its partners.   Drexel was a second-tier investment bank, though, until themid-1970s, when it came up with the concept of selling junk bonds asoriginal issues.   Until then, the only junk bonds were securities that hadoriginally been issued with a higher rating but whose issuers hadfallen on hard times.   Drexel worked both sides of the deal, lining up investors whowere attracted by the bonds' attractive yields and grateful issuerswho had never before been able to raise money in the bond market.   Frederick H. Joseph, now Drexel's chief executive, was then headof corporate finance, leading underwriting efforts.   Milken led Drexel's junk-bond trading operation and moved it toBeverly Hills, Calif., from New York in 1977.   Drexel's biggest break came in the early 1980s, when it hit onthe idea of using junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers. Thatidea vaulted it to the front ranks of investment banks andrevolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business.   Corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn, Sir James Goldsmith, SaulSteinberg and T. Boone Pickens Jr. established close relations withDrexel, as did stock speculators such as Ivan Boesky.   Among the companies taken over with the help of junk bondsfloated by Drexel were TWA Inc. and Crown Zellerbach Corp. Drexel isalso playing a major role in financing Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co.'s $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.   ``Drexel is like a god in that end of the business and a god canto anything it wants. ... They are awesome. You hate to do businessagainst them,'' Michael Boylan, the president of Macfadden Holdings,told Barron's magazine in 1986.   Drexel liked the quote so much that one of its investment bankersframed it, Connie Bruck recounts in a book published this year,``The Predators' Ball.''   Drexel earned enormous fees for underwriting and trading junkbonds and for its takeover advice.   Drexel's capital as of Dec. 31, 1987, totaled nearly $2.2billion, up from $1.8 billion the previous year and up more thantenfold from 1981. That made the privately held company the fifthlargest firm on Wall Street.   Although Drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds, themarket's rapid growth has drawn competition from other investmentbanks.   Drexel's influence in the takeover game began to diminishsomewhat amid the insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, whicherupted with the arrest of a Drexel investment banker, Dennis R.Levine, and then led to a government investigation of Drexel'stactics.   Still, Drexel has denied suggestions that the probe severelyimpaired the firm, claiming its junk bond business and its otherinvestment banking operations remained strong.   As recently as Wednesday, before Drexel's agreement to pleadguilty, Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven conveniencestores, announced it had switched its investment banking business toDrexel, dumping the prestigious investment banking firms of Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
