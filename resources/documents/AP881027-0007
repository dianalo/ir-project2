Each holds an assault rifle, but piledon the soldier's bent back are a U.S. military adviser, a humanrights monitor, and papers documenting rights abuses.   The guerrilla stands tall, unencumbered.   The drawing in the office of Col. Mauricio Vargas, chief ofoperations for the joint chiefs of staff, illustrates how humanrights are considered a burden by many Salvadoran officers.   Interviews with soldiers, diplomats and judicial authoritiessuggest that only U.S. pressure and fear of losing U.S. aid keep thearmy in line.   Abuses by the armed forces are far fewer than in the early 1980s,when death squads were killing hundreds of people every month, buttwo peasant massacres and a gang rape in recent weeks have raisedconcern.   Amnesty International said Wednesday that hundreds of suspectedgovernment opponents have been killed in the past two years by deathsquads, usually made up of troops and police.   ``We're only at the beginning of a long road toward respect forhuman rights, obviously not at the end of it,'' said Judge ReneZelaya, who is handling the rape case.   The increased death squad activity comes with President JoseNapoleon Duarte suffering from cancer and leftist leadersre-entering the country after guerrillas agreed to let theirpolitical groups participate in a March 1989 presidential election.   Duarte, a centrist, has vigorously opposed death squad activity;leftists who fled because they feared for their lives said they feltthey could return because death squad activity was down.   At the same time, politically motivated slayings by leftistguerrillas have reportedly increased.   El Salvador has received more than $3 billion in U.S. economicand military aid this decade, more than any country in the WesternHemisphere, but U.S. lawmakers have said continued aid depends ongrowing respect for civil liberties.   Officers and troops are not afraid to say they see respect forhuman rights as a burden.   ``It limits our action,'' said Lt. Ali Valdez of the elite ArceBatallion during a recent patrol of guerrilla-dominated hills innorthern Morazan province.   Cpl. Jose Antonio Lopez said thousands of civilians killed bydeath squads in the early 1980s ``deserved what they got.''   Paratrooper Sgt. Mauricio Orellana said he favored ``the 1932solution'' to defeat leftist guerrillas at war with the U.S.-backedgovernment. He was referring to the slaying, by forces ofthen-dictator Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, of up to 20,000peasants to quell a rebellion by a few hundred against landowners.   One recent massacre took place Sept. 21, when soldiers detainedmost of the residents of the hamlet of San Francisco and accusedthem of collaborating with rebels.   The soldiers took seven men and three women to a ravine, tiedthem up and killed them with grenades and rifle fire, according toneighbors and relatives of the dead.   Seven were shot in the head from less than six inches away, anautopsy showed. A judge issued arrest warrants for four soldiers,but none has been handed over to judicial authorities.   Human rights groups said they feared the investigation into themassacre _ the first mass killing of civilians in four years _ wouldmake ordinary soldiers scapegoats and not focus on the responsibleofficers.   Americas Watch, a private organization that monitors rights inthe Western Hemisphere, issued a report on El Salvador on Oct. 2.   It said killings declined between 1984 and late 1987 beforerising again and notes that no Salvadoran officer or death squadmember has been prosecuted and punished for a human rights violation.   Amnesty International said dumped bodies frequently are founddecapitated, dismembered, strangled or showing marks of rape ortorture, such as burns and machete wounds.   Amnesty International said death squads intimidate governmentopponents by publishing ``death lists'' in newspaper advertisementsand delivering coffins to the homes of intended victims.   Zelaya has been handling the case of a 20-year-old who says shewas raped by 13 soldiers in the town of Apastepeque.   Zelaya asked the commander of the cavalry regiment whose soldiersallegedly raped the woman for the names of the men on duty the dayof the attack. He received no response.   In the most recent incident, several men in army uniforms arrivedthe night of Oct. 14 in the hamlet of Tres Ceibas, 11 miles north ofSan Salvador, and pulled four young men from their homes.   Minutes later, several shots were heard. Relatives found thebodies of the four, shot in the head, about 40 yards away.   Rights groups blamed the army. The armed forces said the killerswere guerrillas masquerading as soldiers.   The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid Office has noted a sharprise in politically motivated slayings of civilians this year.Execution-style killings of civilians by the rebels are likewise upsharply.   However, the guerrillas usually take responsibility for suchslayings, which they call ``bringing to justice.''</TEXT></DOC>
