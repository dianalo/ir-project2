And he even endedthe show wishing his mother and mothers everywhere a happy Mother'sDay.   But the Dice Man, clad in black threads, a black leather jacketand smoking a filter cigarette, more resembled the star of aBrooklyn geek festival than the no-holds-barred Prince of Dirty heis said to be.   NBC, aware of his tendency to call women ``bitches,'' verballyassail gays and even use naughty words, aired Saturday's show on afive-second delay basis so it could bleep out anything obscene orworse.   Dumb move. It should have rigged the tape-delay to say ``tuba''when bleeping, or even on those occasions it let go what Clay said.   For example, during his opening monologue, a protesting couplein the studio audience shouted ``Clay, Clay, go away!'' They werequickly whisked out by guards. The startled Clay's snappy comebackwas ``shadddup.''   That figures. His routine stepped out for a short beer when witwas passed out. Things might have been better had NBC inserted``tuba'' where he got, well, crude, about one of those ejected. Youwould have heard him say:   ``That's the type a guy that hangs out in the men's room tosmell other people's tuba all day long.''   Same goes for his thoughts on the furor his appearance on theshow caused, including the boycott of the show by cast member NoraDunn and pop singer Sinead O'Connor.   Push the tuba button. You would have heard him say:   ``I mean, what do I need _ more p.r.? I couldn't get any morep.r. if I took out my tuba and wrapped it around the microphonestand.''   True, he got bleeped only five times in one skit in which heplayed himself explaining sex to his son. No doubt this was becausehe used, gosh, crude words to describe the male and femalegenitalia.   But five shots of ``tuba'' would have put him in perspective. Heworks dirty because he has no act.   The show, like its guest host, was an epic in lame, even in suchnon-Clay skits as ``The Anal Retentive Chef'' or Dennis Miller's``Weekend Update,'' on which The Annoying Man appeared and squeezeda pimple.   About the only mildly witty moment came when the funny, giftedJan Hooks told the audience she lacked the guts to protest Clay'sappearance, but had decided to protest him ``by giving a lacklusterperformance.''   The show predictably spoofed the Clay uproar right from thestart with a take-off of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' in which thedevil showed Clay what would have happened had Clay not been born.   Among other things, Frank Zappa would have appeared in his placeon the show and done a 70-minute anti-censorship rap, causing theshow's ratings to plummet and the ax to fall on ``Saturday Night''after 15 years.   That wouldn't be such a bad idea. SNL once had a first-ratecast, a sense of comic danger and inspired routines. All that nowis on Fox Broadcasting's new ``In Living Color,'' a very funny, yetcompassionate show.   Not much is left of ``Saturday Night Live'' when all it can dois call on a guy who only can talk dirty, a guy from the land ofNobody Home.</TEXT></DOC>
