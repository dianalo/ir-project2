(FallComdex)(Rumor Central) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Katt, Spencer.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>&quot;What is this, mustard?&quot; Spencer growled as he pulled his venerablepin-striped suit out of the hall closet.andP;  The suit had been with the Katt to10 Fall Comdex shows.andP;  Though it now sags a bit, the newly trim tabby wasn'tabout to leave for this year's bash without it.andM;As he penned a note on his new Atari tablet to send the jacket to thecleaners, Spencer daydreamed about his ringside seat at Caesar's.andP;  The mainevent at Comdex, proposed by the manly men of Redmond to settle theWindows-OS/2 war once and for all: a pay-per-view wrestling match between theBlue Ninja (IBM's Lee Reiswig) and the Bald Ninja (Microsoft's SteveBallmer).andP;  Winner take all.andM;Reiswig is quick, but Ballmer's got bulk.andP;  The trainers at Big Blue mustappreciate the challenge, because they've given the Ninja a couple of newmoves to bring into the ring.andP;  First, they've pushed up the release date forOS/2 2.0 to Dec.andP;  15.andM;Second, they'll include an object-oriented version of REXX, IBM's answer toMicrosoft's BASIC macro language, in OS/2 2.1.andM;Will that put Ballmer down for the count?andP;  Unh-unh, not so fast.andP;  Microsoft'sgot its own sleeper hold, the wise one knows.andP;  The Redmondians have decidedto remove support for OS/2 from C 7.0, now in beta test.andP;  These combatantsare downright crafty, the curmudgeonly Katt snarled.andM;Slam!andP;  Cal came through the front door, jarring the Katt from his reverie ofBallmer delivering a flying elbow smash to Reiswig.andP;  The kid was down andout, having just returned from consoling buddies axed at Ashton-Tate.andM;&quot;Man, Philippe just won't let up,&quot; Cal complained to his dad, who grabbed theyoungster and pinned him with a full nelson.andM;&quot;Tell me all your secrets!&quot; ordered the fistic feline.andM;Cal managed to wiggle free.andP;  &quot;It's getting weird,&quot; he said, still talkingabout A-T.andP;  &quot;Managers are distributing lists of their favorite employmentagencies, outside interviews are encouraged, and what was left of morale wassnuffed when the building in Los Gatos was appraised and put up for sale.&quot;andM;There are so many ex-Taters around that they're planning a Former Ashton-TateEmployee (FATE) party at Comdex.andP;  Spencer had already penciled the gig in forTuesday night.andP;  The location is still under wraps.andM;It's never harmonious when one company buys another, Spencer told his son.andO;Look at IBM and Metaphor.andP;  You think everything's &quot;Patriot Partner&quot; this and&quot;Big Blue Buddy&quot; that?andP;  Wrong.andM;The merger has produced &quot;a definite set of feelings among the rank and file&quot;at Metaphor, says a senior staff engineer.andP;  To illustrate their fear andloathing, some Metaphor employees designed a T-shirt that shows an IBM truck(with an Apple logo) steamrolling a Metaphor hitchhiker.andM;Metaphor may feel lost in the shuffle, but Spencer senses that the deal withApple will forge a more profitable future for the new IBM.andP;  Big Blue isanxious to keep a step ahead of the commodity PC business, and that's whatall this RISC development is about.andP;  The computer giant has even struck adeal with Georg Zipfel, a German distributor, to sell PS/2s through the mail.andO;Spencer bets the house that IBM is testing the mail-order channel for PCs soit can free its salespeople and some dealers to bang on crucial RISCaccounts.andM;What will IBM call its next generation of RISC computers?andP;  A Washington-basedtabby-tale reports that IBM's application for a trademark on PersonalSystem/3 is about to mature to registration.andP;  While the Katt continued tofantasize about the Reiswig-Ballmer grudge match, Cal logged onto E-mail forthe day's Comdex tips.andP;  He chuckled at word that WordTech will announce adBASE IV compiler at the show.andP;  Hmm, didn't they announce their Aragocompiler last year?andP;  They were supposed to ship it shortly after, but it'sstill vapor.andM;Life is strange.andP;  Take last week, when Cal logged onto Mountain Computer'sBBS and found a message about their system crashing the week before.andP;  Theregistration database was lost, so Cal had to re-enter his user info.andP;  Wait--isn't this a tape-backup company?andP;  As Wayne and Garth would say, &quot;Mountaindoes backups ...andP;  NOT.&quot;andM;Amused, Cal pictured himself on stage at the Excalibur, swashbuckling withproduct managers and unsung developers.andP;  His heart leapt at the thought.andO;.....  .FIB</TEXT></DOC>
