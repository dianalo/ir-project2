Britain went further by pulling out its entire embassystaff.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the death threatsagainst Rushdie and the publishers of ``The Satanic Verses'' forallegedly blaspheming Islam were ``unwarranted interference'' inBritain's internal affairs.   The 12 European Economic Community governments, in a sharp blowto Iran's hopes of improving relations with Western nations, decidedto recall their diplomats for consulations and suspend high-levelvisits to and from Iran.</TEXT><HEAD>Eds: Embargoed for 6:30 p.m. EST release.</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A government report released Monday calls for a``radical reshaping'' of U.S. foreign assistance programs becausecurrent aid concepts are based on a world that no longer exists.   ``The challenges of today's problems, and tomorrow's, cannot bemet with yesterday's solutions, suitable as they may have been toyesterday's problems,'' said the report, issued by the administratorof the Agency for International Development, Alan Woods.   The 158-page study said the aid program no longer seems able tofulfill its original mandate of helping poor countries achieve thetransition from dependency to self-sufficiency.   Somewhere between 1949 and the present, the concept of aid as atransitional means of helping countries become self-sufficient waslost, it said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury will be sworn in Tuesday in the trial ofOliver North, with the prosecution preparing a lineup of witnessesto testify he tried to cover up the Iran-Contra affair.   Lawyers for the fired presidential aide plan to rebut theprosecution's case by showing North had White House authorizationfor his activities. North, the key figure in the Iran-Contra affair,was indicted 11 months ago with former national security adviserJohn Poindexter and businessmen Richard Secord and Albert Hakim.   The latter three will be tried separately.   Two central charges against North, accusing him of conspiracy andtheft in diverting Iranian arms sale profits to the Nicaraguanguerrillas, were thrown out last month on national security grounds.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ranking members of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee met Monday with a government investigator who once probedthe conduct of an arms talks delegation that included John Tower asthe White House delivered to the panel the latest FBI report on thedefense secretary-designate.   Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking Republican John Warner ofVirginia interviewed Berne Indahl, a State Department securityofficer sent to Geneva in 1986 by the Arms Control and DisarmamentAgency to investigate allegations of security breaches, saidcongressional sources who requested anonymity.   On Sunday, Indahl had spoken to investigators of a Housesubcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegationsagainst Tower. At that meeting, the sources said, Indahlcorroborated a report that Tower, while in Geneva, had used hissecretaries as mistresses.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Are the spotted owls that live in the ancientforest of the Northwest really endangered or are they beingvictimized by the miniature radio transmitters that scientists useto track their movements?   Biologists now are debating that question as a result of anunexpectedly high mortality rate among young owls outfitted withradio transmitters. The scientists are also trying to determinewhether the devices interfere with adult owls' ability to reproduce.</TEXT><TEXT>   Since the early 1980s, wildlife biologists have been strappingtransmitters weighing about 20 grams, or about as heavy as twoquarters, on the backs of both juvenile and adult owls.   If the transmitters are harming the owls, then studies thatconcluded the owls may be a threatened or endangered species couldbe based on faulty data, said Hal Salwasser, deputy director ofwildlife and fisheries at the U.S. Forest Service.   ``We are very much concerned,'' said Salwasser. ``Many scientistsbelieve we may have a problem.''</TEXT><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Breathe deeply to greet the day? Not in MexicoCity. It has some of the dirtiest air in the world.   It burns the eyes and nose, hides the spectacular, snowcappedvolcanoes that gird the city, and leaves tourists with a smell morememorable than the sights seen dimly through the haze.   Doctors say the pall is a hazard for the metropolitan area's 19million residents, and the public outcry has become loud enough toforce at least some government action.   ``For all of us who live here, it is shortening our lives,'' saidHomero Aridjis, an writer of prose and poetry who speaks for theGroup of 100 Artists and Intellectuals, an environmental protectiongroup.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald Reagan's White House physician saidMonday he now believes that executive power should have beentransferred to then-Vice President George Bush after Reagan was shotin 1981.   Dr. Daniel Ruge said that in hindsight, the emergency provisionsof the 25th Amendment allowing for the transfer of authority shouldhave been invoked after the March 1981 assassination attempt.   The doctor, now living in retirement in Denver, said ``I knew allabout'' the 25th Amendment, ``but it never occurred to me'' tosuggest to Reagan's aides that it be invoked.   As White House physician, he kept a copy of the 25th Amendment inhis bag, Ruge said in a telephone interview from his home.   But in the hours after Reagan was shot in the chest by John W.Hinckley Jr. outside a Washington hotel on March 30, 1981, Ruge saidhe was preoccupied with the president's condition.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donald Trump can buy hotels, he can buy footballteams, he can buy casinos and airlines. But he can't buy respect.   Spy magazine calls him a ``short-fingered vulgarian.'' CartoonistBerke Breathed takes Trump's brain and installs it in the skull ofBill the Cat, the foul feline of ``Bloom County.'' A Daily Newscolumnist writes that when she needs cheering up, she watches``Donald Trump do something silly.''   The Stand Up New York comedy club devoted a night to ridiculingTrump. For two hours, comics drew laughter with readings from``Trump: The Art of the Deal'' and took their own potshots _suggesting, for example, that he bought a Parisian landmark andrenamed it the ``Arc de Trump.''   The 43-year-old billionaire does not believe he deserves thistidal wave of derision, which rises along with his success andprominence. But Trump _ who declined to be interviewed _ thinks heunderstands it.   ``Those who don't like me don't know me, and have never met me,''he told Time magazine. ``My guess is that they dislike me out ofjealousy.''   Not so, say Trump's detractors. They dislike him on merits.   ``He's just an everyday slob with too much money. He just doesn'thave enough taste to keep his name off of things,'' said Breathed.</TEXT></DOC>
