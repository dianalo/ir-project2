Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST EUROP JAPAN CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Nearly two weeks ago, major central banks intervened massively to prop up a falling U.S. dollar. Now, senior Japanese officials say the banks intend to do so again if needed.    In background interviews in Tokyo, several officials repeatedly emphasized that the amounts spent to keep the dollar from plunging April 14 were huge, that the intervention was carefully coordinated and that there is a clear consensus among major industrial countries -- including the U.S. -- to stabilize the dollar.    On April 14, currency traders and speculators were surprised and disappointed with the announced $13.83 billion February U.S. trade deficit. But a Japanese banking official said, &quot;That's the markets' fault.&quot; He said the subsequent central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets on behalf of the dollar was intended &quot;to remind people: Don't be crazy.&quot;    The Japanese officials indicated that their immediate concern is to prevent a sharp drop in the dollar rather than to defend a specific exchange rate. A banking official conceded that shrinking the Japanese and West German trade surpluses and Washington's big trade and budget deficits is taking longer than expected. Another said there still could be periodic speculative attacks on the U.S. currency.    The expectation in Tokyo is that the dollar's trading range will decline from its current 120-125 yen to about 115-122 yen, said Robert H. Binney, general manager of Chase Manhattan Bank's Tokyo operations. Some say the dollar could decline even further. &quot;There's a cat-and-mouse game going on between the traders and central banks,&quot; Mr. Binney said.    Nonetheless, Japanese officials are confident they can deal with any shocks. The large coordinated intervention on April 14 was a &quot;manifestation of the cooperation of the G-7 countries,&quot; a high-ranking official said. Moreover, he said, European countries other than those in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations -- which includes West Germany, France, Britain and Italy as well as the U.S., Japan and Canada -- also intervened that day, and the total amount involved was &quot;massive.&quot; He said this &quot;demonstrates the importance we assign to the stability of exchange rates.&quot;    Traders and economists are skeptical, however. They say intervention has already sent Japanese and West German domestic money growth soaring and that Japanese industry has adjusted to the strong yen and is planning for the currency to get even stronger.    In addition, they suspect that central banks may want to limit foreign-exchange losses caused by a buildup of depreciated dollar reserves. Some are also skeptical of the Reagan administration's resolve with the November U.S. elections approaching.    One Japanese official says an internal Bank of Japan analysis calculates that it will take the U.S. eight to 11 years to substantially reduce its indebtedness.    Foreign central banks &quot;hold so many dollar-denominated assets, their appetite for dollars has to have waned,&quot; said John J. McCarthy, a vice president at Irving Trust Co., New York. &quot;They have certain fiduciary responsibilities to their governments and countries.&quot;    For those reasons, Christopher Johnson, chief economic adviser for Lloyds Bank PLC, London, said he expects intervention by major central banks to decline to about $70 billion this year from an estimated $100 billion last year.    &quot;I think they feel they've accumulated as much dollar reserves as they want,&quot; he said. Because of the foreign-exchange losses already taken on central banks' dollar reserves, &quot;intervention has become a political issue,&quot; Mr. Johnson said, because central banks normally transfer their profits to their governments.    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they believe that long-term imbalances are being corrected, albeit slowly. They cited Japan's high domestic growth rate and its growing imports, along with the rise in U.S. exports and a narrowing U.S. trade deficit in volume terms.    They also said there is a consensus among the Group of Seven to try to maintain the current &quot;breathing period,&quot; in which the dollar stands at around 125 yen, Japanese long-term interest rates are at 4 1/4% to 4 1/2%, U.S. long-term rates are at 9% or slightly less, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is around 2000, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Tokyo Stock Price Index is around 2200.    The Japanese officials emphasized that they believe the U.S. is committed to stable exchange rates, particularly in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. &quot;We assume (the Americans) are very much more concerned than before&quot; Oct. 19, a senior banking official said.    Even so, the Japanese officials said they aren't prepared to intervene endlessly in the face of poor U.S. economic fundamentals and said it is up to each central bank to decide how much it is willing to spend to support the dollar. One banking official termed his country's policy &quot;a mixture of determinedness and flexibility.&quot;    Nobumitsu Kamagi, a Tokyo-based managing director at Nomura Investment Management Co., said a major concern is that Japanese exports could begin to rise again, even while Japan continues to run large current-account surpluses. If they do, he said, &quot;The yen will begin to rise largely on its own, to 115 or 110 (yen to the dollar), with practically no change between the dollar and European currencies.&quot;    That, Mr. Kamagi warned, &quot;could cause turmoil in global financial markets,&quot; particularly the U.S. bond and stock markets.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar drifted higher on meager volume as dealers squared positions ahead of the weekend and most participants began to acknowledge that a move to push the U.S. currency lower isn't in the offing despite persistent bearish sentiment.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.80 yen, compared with 124.40 late Thursday, and at 1.6745 marks, compared with 1.6695. The pound stood at $1.8860, compared with $1.8930.    In midday trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 125.00 yen.    On the week, the dollar rose from the lows it hit after the April 14 release of February's wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit. But it stayed within a narrow range, bounded by the market's bearishness on the upside and its fear of central bank intervention on the downside.    &quot;I'm surprised how well it's working&quot; for the central banks, Renato Strauss, a trader with Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., said. &quot;Especially after the last trade figures, there's every reason to sell dollars. . . . I don't know what they're doing, but they're doing it right.&quot;    Dealers generally attributed the dollar's firmness to covering of short, or oversold, positions or to international political tensions rather than to any change in market sentiment. Moreover, little or no consensus exists on what direction the dollar will take in coming weeks or even what fundamental factors will be influencing its course.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4.50 an ounce to $450.90 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, April 22, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
