Topics examined include radiation effectson optical fibers, the effect of H2 treatment and water content on therecovery of undoped core fibers after pulsed and continuous irradiation,the NATO test program for optical fibers and components, alpha-irradiationdamage to borosilicate glasses, high-reliability optical components forundersea light-wave systems, the behavior of Si optoelectronic componentsunder gamma irradiation, optical devices and sensors of special-purposefibers, and a fiber-optic microprobe for interferometric measurementsin generators.</TEXT></DOC>
