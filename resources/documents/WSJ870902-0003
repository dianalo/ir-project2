In a brief to the court -- its second, filed as a response to a Pennzoil brief -- Texaco accused Pennzoil of changing its story to fit the shifting circumstances of the appeals case. Texaco claimed that on issue after issue, Pennzoil told the trial court one thing in order to win its verdict, but now was telling the state's high court something else to defend it.    &quot;To date,&quot; Texaco's brief said, &quot;this litigation represents the grossest example of a litigant's abuse of the judicial system.&quot; Texaco, in White Plains, N.Y., also called attention to friend-of-the-court briefs filed on its behalf on certain issues by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the attorneys general of New York and Delaware.    Houston-based Pennzoil, never anxious to be outdone in the war of words, countered that Texaco's brief was the &quot;same song, second verse.&quot; Pennzoil also suggested that the briefs filed in support of Texaco could not be described as friend-of-the-court, or amicus curiae, briefs. Texaco's statements of support, Pennzoil said, are &quot;actually 'amicus Texaconis' briefs.&quot;    The Texas Supreme Court is expected to decide this fall whether to hear Texaco's appeal of the judgment. In 1985 a jury found that Pennzoil had secured a binding agreement to buy an interest in Getty Oil Co., and that Texaco had interfered with the contract by acquiring all of Getty for itself. </TEXT></DOC>
