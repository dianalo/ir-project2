Study was made tolearn what scientific effort is being made to clarify regional environmentalproblems. (1) Carbon dioxide gas and temperature rise -- there are manyproblems, such as determining the ratio between the amount of carbondioxide in fossil fuels and that in forest resources, establishing amodel of carbon dioxide variations in atmosphere, and forecasting theconcentration of carbon dioxide in the future according to the establishedmodel. These problems are being studied energetically. (2) Acid rainand its influence -- the US and Eurpean countries are eager to studyfor the monitoring of acid rain and have made a vast investment for thisstudy (2.7 million dollars in the US in 1984). Japan is also implementinga five-year project for national-wide survey on inland water, rainfall,and soil. (3) Photochemical smog and ozonosphere -- the US and Europeancounties began regional ozone measurement around 1970 and are performingregional analysis according to the measurement data.
