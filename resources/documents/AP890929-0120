(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fourteen years after a 75-year-old ``baglady'' was bludgeoned to death with a stick of firewood in herone-room shack, police using computerized fingerprints havearrested a paroled felon.   Jerry Lindley, 32, of College Park pleaded innocent Thursday tocharges of murder and armed robbery in the 1975 death of BillieFultz.   Retired Detective Jerry Fronebarger, who investigated the casein 1975, described Mrs. Fultz as an eccentric ``bag lady'' wholived alone without electricity or indoor plumbing.   Authorities, meanwhile, have called Lindley's arrest one of themost dramatic successes of the new fingerprint system since it wasinstalled at the beginning of this year.   ``It's the first one of this magnitude of this age _ where thefingerprint is 14 years old,'' said Thomas J. McGreevy, deputydirector of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.   Last week when the police technician who originally worked theslaying took fingerprints found at the 1975 crime scene to theGBI's new computer.   And on Friday the machine matched fingerprints taken whenLindley entered prison with prints lifted from Mrs. Fultz's cashboxand a kerosene lantern after the slaying.   Fronebarger said that in 1975 police manually searched withoutsuccess through more than 200 fingerprints for a match to thosefound at the scene.   Yet police said the $6 million Automated FingerprintIdentification System whizzed out a fingerprint match in just 20minutes, after starting a check through the 3.75 million prints onfile.   Fulton County police Sgt. Donald Cook said that on Wednesday,police arrested Lindley, who had been on parole after pleadingguilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 1985 death of his wife,Libby.</TEXT></DOC>
