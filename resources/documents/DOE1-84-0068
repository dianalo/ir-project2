Along with basic drawings, tables and diagrams the cost-benefitanalysis presented discusses three problems relevant to plants such asthese. Data are given on solar energy potentials (global radiation indifferent parts of the world) as well as on direct radiation for solarthermal uses. A comparative evaluation informs about the investment andoperational cost of solar power plants on one hand and coal-fired andnuclear power plants on the other hand. In addition, solar towers, parabolicmirrors, trough collectors and photovoltaic systems, which are most expensiveof all, are analysed for their investment and operational costs. A discussionof the systems' marketing prospects assumes them to be having a shareof one third in the heat market and a share of two thirds in the electricpower market. The study considers solar thermal power plants to soonbe competing with other efficient economic systems. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
