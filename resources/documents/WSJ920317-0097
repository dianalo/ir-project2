The Nikkei index of 225 stocks that trade on the firstsection of Tokyo's stock exchange fell below 20000 Monday toend at its lowest point in five years. Now, traders in Tokyoand around the world are trying to determine whether theJapanese market is on the verge of a collapse or whether its27-month decline is about over.</LP><TEXT>   Mostly, they aren't optimistic. &quot;Is the market good value?Nope,&quot; said Christian Wignall, chief investment officer at GTCapital Management Inc. in San Francisco. &quot;At about 40 timesearnings, the price-earnings multiple is still too high.&quot;Furthermore, he said, Japanese corporate earnings aredeteriorating rapidly, which makes stocks look even moreovervalued and the ratio even less appealing, particularly toinvestors looking for bargains.   &quot;Clearly there is capacity for several more cuts in the(official) discount rate, and that could bolster the market,&quot;Mr. Wignall said. &quot;But the fundamental factor is that,intrinsically, there is very little there to attract peopleto buy the market. The P-E is too high, the dividend yield at0.6% is derisory, and the profits outlook is very poor.&quot;   In the medium term, said Peter Davies, a vice president atthe U.S. subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co. in New York,&quot;There's still a lot of negative sentiment among Tokyoinvestment managers, primarily because the economy is stillshowing signs of slowing&quot; and because many companies arereducing inventories, rather than buying new items orincreasing their manufacturing capacity.   After falling steadily for most of Monday, the Nikkeiaverage finished at 19837.16, down 618.90 points, or 3.03%below Friday's close. It was the Tokyo market's lowest finishsince February 1987. Volume was an estimated 200 millionshares, slightly more than on many recent days but far lessthan Friday's 669.2 million. Declining issues overwhelmedgaining issues 763-231, while 129 issues ended unchanged. TheTokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first sectionissues, which fell 8.21 points Friday, slumped 19.14 points,or 1.31%, to 1444.86.   So far this year, the Nikkei is down 13.6%. It is astunning 49% below its record high of 38915.87, set on thelast day of trading in December 1989.   Stocks continued to fall Tuesday, with the Nikkei slippinga further 129.37 points to close the morning session at19707.79. Volume was an estimated 150 million shares, higherthan the recent average for the morning, which has been 100million or less.   &quot;We're looking at the abyss, which would be a spike downto 18000,&quot; said Guy Howard, deputy general manager at S.G.Warburg Securities (Japan.) He added that for all the sellingthere wasn't any sense of panic in the market.   Investment trusts, Japan's mutual funds, were big sellers,liquidating their holdings on expectation of investorredemptions. Foreigners were not seen as big sellers in themarket.   So gloomy is investor sentiment that even some blue-chipcompanies are trading near their book value, or net worth ona per-share basis. In one extreme case, Nissan Motor closedMonday at 565 yen ($4.23) a share, or 87% of book value.   After Japanese investors finished pummelling their ownstocks in Tokyo trading, U.S. investors traded heavily inwarrants that allow them to bet on the direction of theNikkei index. The American Stock Exchange lists two &quot;call&quot;warrants, which rise in value if stock prices in Japan rise,as well as six &quot;put&quot; warrants, which increase in value ifJapanese stock prices fall. In American Stock Exchangetrading yesterday, the puts did better.   Put warrants issued by PaineWebber were particularlyactive, with 370,500 warrants traded yesterday. They closedat $11.625, up 62.5 cents, after hitting an intraday high of$12.   But PaineWebber's calls also were actively traded, with101,700 warrants changing hands. They closed unchanged at$1.125 after being down earlier in the day, as some investorsapparently decided to speculate on a rebound in Japan.   If the Nikkei stays at Monday's closing level for long,the weak stock market will harm Japanese banks, securitieshouses and the companies that depend upon them, analystssaid. Investor psychology, already poor, will be furtherdamaged.   Yesterday's plunge came on the same day that Teikoku DataBank Ltd., a private research institution, reported thatJapanese corporate bankruptcies in February rose 56.2% from ayear earlier. It marked the 17th consecutive month thatbusiness failures were on the climb.   Far worse than the one-day 600-odd point loss, Tokyotraders said, was the effect on the public mind of a Nikkeiunder 20000, with no evident effort by regulators to shore upthe market.   &quot;Investors are going to be cool&quot; to the market, saidTakatoshi Okuyama, a general manager at Daiwa Securities Co.in Tokyo. &quot;This was an important support&quot; level. He predictedthat for the next few months, the market would be &quot;stagnant,but it won't crash.&quot;   While some people are expecting some kind ofmarket-supporting statement from either the Finance Ministryor the Bank of Japan, James Walsh, president of PrudentialSecurities (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo, said, &quot;I don't know whatthey can say.&quot;   Indeed, late Monday, Finance Minister Tsutomu Hatareportedly said the ministry isn't considering any moves tosupport the stock market.   The Japanese government has already taken some steps, sofar to little avail. &quot;For the most part, market participantsare indicating that for them to seriously re-enter the stockmarket, they are going to have to see signs of clearfundamental economic improvement, rather than signs ofJapanese government market-assistance measures,&quot; Mr. Daviesof Nomura said.   Policy makers are left with few tools to accelerate thatprocess. Analysts and traders already expect the central bankto cut its key discount interest rate, at which the centralbank lends to financial institutions, from the current 4.5%.That would be the fourth such cut since last July. Tradersalso anticipate a supplementary government budget aimed atstimulating the economy.   Indeed, the rate cut, expected to be about one-halfpercentage point, has been anticipated for so long that it islikely to have little immediate effect on the market, orpossibly on the economy.   A half percentage-point cut &quot;won't be enough,&quot; saidKenneth Courtis, first vice president at DB Capital Markets(Asia) Ltd. He said that because most companies were &quot;soconvinced (the Nikkei) wouldn't go below 20000,&quot; now theywill cut back &quot;on capital expenditure, wage concessions,inventories, even research.&quot;   Mr. Davies said that Nomura's economists generally &quot;expectto see some sort of recovery phase beginning in the fall.&quot;   Mr. Okuyama of Daiwa said that if there is furtherselling, the market's next support level is about 19350. Thatlevel would put the market under its monthly average valuesince 1982, which is 19810.   Westerners were more pessimistic. &quot;We've been underweightand will continue to be underweight in the Japanese market,particularly through the end of March, the close of the(Japanese) fiscal year,&quot; said Sheila Coco, a senior vicepresident at Fiduciary Trust Co. International in New York.Fiduciary Trust has only 10% of its overseas funds investedin the Japanese stock market, compared with a marketweighting of 47.4% for Morgan Stanley Capital International'sEurope Australia Far East index.   &quot;We still have concern about selling by the &quot;tokkin&quot; funds(Japanese corporate investment funds), the stock-relatedpolitical scandals and the related political problems ofPrime Minister (Kiichi) Miyazawa,&quot; Ms. Coco said. She alsopointed to &quot;the selling pressure within the market, plus theforeigners have stopped their buying, removing one supportfrom the market.&quot; She said that Fiduciary Trust will take afresh look at Japanese stocks after the end of the fiscalyear on March 31 or &quot;if a correction brought the market downto between 17000 and 18000 on the Nikkei.&quot;   Mr. Wignall of GT Capital believes it might take a Nikkeidrop to 15000 to tempt foreign investors back in. That is alevel that would roughly match the Japanese economy's 5%average annual growth rate since 1986, when the Tokyo stockmarket's last bull run began at about 12000 on the Nikkei.   &quot;Thus, at about just under 20000, it's still roughly 4000too high,&quot; said Mr. Wignall said.   For some companies, even a stagnant stock market spellsdisaster. Securities houses badly need an improvement intrading volume if they are to see profitability next year.This fiscal year, which ends March 31, has already beenwritten off.   For several Japanese banks, the low Nikkei, along with theweakening yen, means an erosion in asset values, which makesit hard to meet capital-adequacy ratios required by the Bankfor International Settlements. A low BIS rating could have adisastrous effect on the banks' cost of internationalborrowing, and thus on profits.   BIS valuations won't come into effect until March 1993.Long before then, however, banks are likely to grow even morecareful about their lending, to minimize loan defaults. Thatis bad news to economic planners, who are trying to pullJapan out of recession.   Banks got no cheer from the bankruptcies report, either.The 1,056 bankruptcy cases in February were valued at a totalof 457.08 billion yen ($3.42 billion), 39% more than inFebruary 1991. Mr. Courtis of DB Capital noted that bankscould feel pressure to liquidate some of their betteroverseas holdings to shore up local problems.   Monday's plunge of the Nikkei adds another measure ofdoubt in the minds of Japanese investors already coping withreports of government scandal, questionable trading practicesby some Japanese securities companies, and eroding corporateconfidence.   ---   Other Markets                                                                                                          In London, share prices ended a lackluster session lower,as the coming national election in Britain swept majorinvestment decision-makers to the sidelines. The FinancialTimes-Stock Exchange 100-share index eased 5.3 points to2470.7. The FT 30-stock index declined 4.9 points to 1930.9.Volume shrank to 363.6 million shares from 555.7 millionshares in the previous session.   London prices opened steady, though amid sparse activity,but most shares started stumbling on worries about weekendpolitical opinion polls that showed an absence of any clearwinner in the April 9 British elections. Stock prices weren'taffected by the publication of the opposition Labor Party'salternative budget or the release of the Liberal DemocraticParty's political manifesto.   In Frankfurt, prices eased across the board. The DAX30-stock index dropped 7.84 points to 1724.80, as the marketcontinued its recent consolidation. Of the DAX stocks, onlyfour advanced and 26 declined. Trading was thin.   Elsewhere in Europe, where big bourses had softperformances overall, partly in reaction to the Tokyo plunge,Milan share prices ended lower as a wave of selling, ahead ofthe early-April election in Italy, knocked a main index underits benchmark level. Paris stocks lost almost 1% on sellingat the opening following the Tokyo debacle, and the unloadingworsened when New York prices opened softer.   Among Asian and Pacific exchanges, Sydney shares startedfirmer but ended lower, cued by Tokyo's skid, which alsocaused Singapore stocks' nose dive. Hong Kong shares' slightdrop resulted from profit-taking after last week's big gains.The Taipei and Manila markets' declines each came onpolitical uncertainties.   Among corporate developments, in Frankfurt, BayerischeHypotheken- andamp; Wechselbank fell 3.30 marks to 414 marks($248.36). The bank plans a 910.8 million-mark ($546.4million) capital increase in the first half, under whichcurrent shareholders are to be offered one newly issuedshare, priced at 330 marks, for every six they already own.The new stock is to pay a dividend for 1992.   In Paris, LaFarge-Coppee slumped 8 French francs, or 2.3%,to 337 francs ($59.53). The cement and construction materialsgroup 1991 profit, after payments to minority interests, sank44% to 1.23 billion francs ($217.3 million) from a yearearlier. Lafarge said it intended to maintain the netdividend at 9 francs a share. Among other things, the companyblamed the profit decline on the drop in constructionactivity in recession-hit North America.   In Sydney, Pacific Dunlop closed unchanged at 5.14Australian dollars (US$3.88). The food, rubber anddiversified manufacturing concern's after-tax operatingprofit for the first half ended Dec. 31 fell 16% to A$107.8million (US$81.4 million). The results were in line with thecompany's previous forecast.   In Amsterdam, where share prices softened overall, Fokkergave up 0.30 guilder to 34.70 guilders ($18.50). Italy'sstate-controlled engineering group Finmeccanica, whichoperates the Alenia aeronautics unit, disclosed that it holdsa 6.02% stake in the Dutch aircraft builder. Industry sourcesspeculated that the holding could be linked to a widercollaboration agreement between the two companies ondevelopment of mid-sized planes, but Finmeccanica declined toelaborate.   Wolters declined 0.70 to 68.80. The publishing concern's1991 profit rose 24% to 214 million guilders ($114.1million). Wolters attributed the performance to growth andacquisitions in its core activities, and said it expects 1992earnings to increase.
