Though the Social Democrats are expected to win the most votes, it would take only a slight shift in voting patterns to break their majority hold on the Riksdag, or parliament. Polls show they have lost crucial support to the environmentalist Greens.    The polls predict the small Environment Party would pass the barrier of 4% of the vote and enter parliament for the first time. All established parties were worried that the Greens could gain enough leverage to tilt the balance of power.    Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, whose Social Democrats rely on the Communist Party to make up a majority, said he would rather call another election than rely on the Greens to stay in office.    The Social Democrats have 159 of the 349 Riksdag seats, and surveys suggest the Communists, with 19 seats, are in danger of being shut out for the first time since their founding in 1917.    About 100 minor parties are competing. They range from the anti-immigrant Socialist Workers' Party to the Donald Duck Party. None is expected to surmount the 4% barrier.    Sweden has a population of 8.4 million, and turnout among the 6,329,533 registered voters is projected at about 90%. The elections also include voting for 284 municipal and 24 county councils and on local issues.    With the exception of 1976-1982, when the country was governed by a center-right coalition, the Social Democrats have been at the helm of the Swedish welfare state since 1932.    Mr. Palme, the party's undisputed leader, was shot to death on Feb. 28, 1986, while walking away from a downtown movie theater. Police say they still haven't any firm clues to the killer's identity. Independent reports blamed official bungling for failure to find the gunman.    Mr. Palme's party has weathered heavy criticism since his death.    Two justice ministers have resigned under pressure during the past 11 months. One quit in connection with an unofficial investigation into the Palme killing, the other over the affair of a convicted spy who escaped while on furlough from jail.    Recent campaigning has been marked by opposition complaints about the world's highest taxes and breakdowns in health care, child care and other welfare benefits.    The three opposition parties have pledged to form a coalition if they win a majority. They are the Conservatives, who hold 76 seats, the Liberals with 51 and the Center Party with 44.    The probable prime minister of a center-right government would be Bengt Westerberg, 45 years old, who led the Liberal Party to a remarkable recovery since taking over in 1983. Mr. Westerberg wants to abolish state monopolies in areas such as health and child-care centers, and give Swedes private alternatives.    The possibility of a Greens entry, spurred by recent polls citing as much as 10% voter support, worries the opposition parties as well as the Social Democrats.    The Greens haven't said clearly who they would tend to support on given issues, and two of the three opposition parties also have ruled out forming a government with them. </TEXT></DOC>
