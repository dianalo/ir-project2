Indeed, unless the killing of innocents can bemorally justified under certain circumstances, all warfare, even themost defensive in nature, would be indefensible. The author tackles histask by developing a series of scenarios in which a person can save himselfonly by taking an action which will result in the death of an innocentbystander. As the plot thickens, it becomes clear that it makes a differencewhether the killing of the bystander is intended or merely foreseen,and so the author makes great use of what is called the Doctrine of DoubleEffect. But this doctrine will not solve the whole problem, and he supplementsand modifies it with the Doctrine of Counterforce Defense and the Doctrineof Antecedent Causation. The latter doctrine provides the author thekey to his solution: that when an agent is presented with an inescapablyperilous condition which will inevitably result in a fatal outcome tosomeone, he should not be held culpable for a choice that in effect selectsthe victims, as long as their deaths are not his aim. The moral responsibilitylies, rather, with the person who created the perilous situation in thefirst place.</TEXT></DOC>
