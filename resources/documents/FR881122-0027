Background</ITAG>The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> (``the Act'' or SMCRA), sets forth general regulatoryrequirements governing surface coal mining and the surface impacts of undergroundcoal mining. Section 701(28) of the Act is a lengthy definition of ``surfacecoal mining operations.'' Because this final rule implements an elementof that definition, and because commenters focused on the question of theproper interpretation of this definition, it is included here verbatimfrom the Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the purposes of this Act * * * ``surface coal mining operations''means_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) activities conducted on the surface of lands in connection witha surface coal mine or subject to the requirements of section 516 surfaceoperations and surface impacts incident to an underground coal mine, theproducts of which enter commerce or the operations of which directly orindirectly affect interstate commerce. Such activities include excavationfor the purpose of obtaining coal including such common methods as contour,strip, auger, mountaintop removal, box cut, open pit, and area mining,the uses of explosives and blasting, and in situ distillation or retorting,leaching or other chemical or physical processing, and the cleaning, concentrating,or other processing or preparation, loading or coal for interstate commerceat or near the mine site: <T3>Provided, however,</T3> That such activities do not include the extractionof coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal doesnot exceed 16\2/3\ per centum of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposesof commercial use of sale or coal explorations subject to section 512 ofthis Act; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) the areas upon which such activities occur or where such activitiesdisturb the natural land surface. Such areas shall also include any adjacentland the use of which is incidental to any such activities, all lands affectedby the construction of new roads or the improvement or use of existingroads to gain access to the site of such activities and for haulage, andexcavations, workings, impoundments, dams, ventilation shafts, entryways,refuse banks, dumps, stockpiles, overburden piles, spoil banks, culm banks,tailings, holes or depressions, repair areas, storage areas, processingareas, shipping areas and other areas upon which are sited structures,facilities, or other property or materials on the surface, resulting fromor incident to such activities * * *. (SMCRA section 701(28), 30 U.S.C.1291(28)).</ITAG>The processing and preparation activities mentioned in the definition areusually conducted at the mine site and are then covered by OSMRE's permittingrequirements at 30 CFR Parts 780 and 784 and also by the performance standardsat 30 CFR Parts 816 and 817. However, such activities sometimes occur ata preparation plant which is not located at a mine site but is still operating``inconnection with'' a coal mine and, thus, is subject to the requirementsof the Act. To ensure that off-site coal preparation is appropriately regulated,OSMRE established a special category of permitting requirements for coalpreparation plants not located within the permit area of a mine at 30 CFR785.21 and also established special performance requirements for such facilitiesat 30 CFR Part 827.The terms ``processing'' and ``preparation'' in the definition at section701(28) of the Act are often used interchangeably. Indeed, OSMRE is notaware of any practical difference between coal preparation and coal processing.``Coal preparation'' at 30 CFR 701.5 is defined as meaning ``chemical orphysical <T3>processing</T3> and the cleaning, concentrating, or other <T3>processing</T3> or preparation of coal'' (emphases added). AlthoughOSMRE uses the term ``preparation'' in this final rule at 30 CFR 785.21and 30 CFR Part 827 and also in the definition at 30 CFR 701.5, becauseof numerous references to ``processing'' in the Act, earlier regulations,court decisions, and comments received, OSMRE continues to refer to thesubject activity as ``processing'' as well as ``preparation'' in the preambleto this rulemaking.Final regulations published on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15317) defined a ``coalprocessing plant'' as a facility ``where run-of-the-mine coal is subjectedto chemical or physical processing <T3>and</T3> separated from its impurities'' (emphasis added). In the preambleto those definitions, OSMRE discussed the rationale for the need to reachfacilities not located at the mine site (44 FR 15292). ``Coal processingplants are usually located at the mine mouth, but frequently one centralpreparation plant may serve several mines as a focal point for coal preparationand shipment to market. The coal may be transported to this central plantwithout removal of the rock and other impurities in the run-of-mine coal.''The revised permanent program regulations of May 5, 1983, defined ``coalpreparation plant'' and added a complementary definition of ``coal preparationor coal processing.'' Both of the 1983 definitions described the activitybeing conducted as ``cleaning, concentrating, or other processing or preparation''(48 FR 20400). This definition retained the concept of separation of coalfrom its impurities as an integral element of coal preparation.Also on May 5, 1983, OSMRE made final the addition of limiting languagein andSection;andSection; 785.21 and 827.1 to exclude facilities ``at the siteof ultimate coal use.'' (48 FR 20401). In addition, OSMRE stated that itwould treat ``all facilities which handle coal as either `in connectionwith' a mine or `in connection with' an end user.'' OSMRE continues tobelieve that regulation of facilities operated by or for the end user ofcoal at the point of such use is not required under SMCRA because, by virtueof their association with the end user of the coal, such facilities arenot operated ``in connection with'' a coal mine.The 1983 definitions of ``coal preparation or coal processing'' and ``coalpreparation plant,'' and the Secretary's jurisdiction to regulate off-siteprocessing plants, were challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia in <T3>In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation II,</T3> No.79-1144 slip op. (D.D.C. July 6, 1984) (<T3>In Re: Permanent (II)</T3>). The court concluded that these definitionswere based on a misreading of the statute. The court rejected OSMRE's interpretationthat coal preparation activities necessarily involve the separation ofcoal from its impurities. <T3>In Re: Permanent II,</T3> Slip op. at 15-20. However, the court affirmedthe Secretary's jurisdiction to regulate off-site processing plants. <T3>In Re: Permanent II,</T3> Slip op. at 17, note 12.In response to the court's decision, OSMRE redefined ``coal preparation''and ``coal preparation plant'' in an interim final rule and, concurrently,in a proposed rule (July 10, 1985; (50 FR 28180)). The revised definitionsincluded ``chemical or physical processing'' and ``cleaning, concentrating,or other processing or preparation.'' Most significantly, the conditionthat coal preparation must include the separation of coal from its impuritieswas deleted from the definitions. These definitions were published as afinal rule on May 11, 1987 (52 FR 17724).On January 29, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision in <T3>In Re: Permanent (II)</T3> affirming the Secretary's jurisdiction toregulate off-site processing plants. (<T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> 829 F.2d 694, 742-745 (D.C. Cir., 1988) (``<T3>NWF</T3>'')). This decision and its effect on OSMRE's interpretationof the phrase ``in connection with'' are discussed in the following ``Discussionof Final Rule.''On June 22, 1988, OSMRE proposed to amend its permanent program regulationsat 30 CFR Parts 785 and 827 to clarify that off-site coal preparation issubject to regulation under SMCRA only when it is conducted ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine (53 FR 23526). In addition to soliciting public commentsand providing an opportunity for public hearings upon request, OSMRE provideda 45-day public comment period. OSMRE received comments from nine organizations,including State regulatory authorities, environmental groups and representativesof the coal industry. No public meeting was requested and none was held.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Final Rule </ITAG>OSMRE is amending the language in 30 CFR 785.21, the permitting requirementsfor off-site preparation plants, and 30 CFR 827.1, the performance standardsfor off-site preparation plants, to make clear that those sections applyonly to off-site coal preparation that is ``in connection with'' a coalmine. The first sentence of andSection;785.21(a), which specifies the requirementsfor permits for coal preparation plants not located within the permit areaof a mine, previously read, ``This section applies to any person who operatesor intends to operate a coal preparation plant outside the permit area,other than such plants which are located at the site of ultimate coal use.''Under this final rule, this sentence is replaced with, ``This section appliesto any person who operates or intends to operate a coal preparation plantin connection with a coal mine but outside the permit area for a specificmine.'' Further, this language differs from the proposed rule in that itincludes the clarifying phrase, ``for a specific mine.'' The second sentenceof paragraph (a) remains the same. Because the purpose of this rulemakingis to clarify that the rule applies only to coal preparation plants operatedin connection with a coal mine, and OSMRE believes that this limitationnecessarily excludes facilities at the site of ultimate use, the redundantphrase ``other than such plants which are located at the site of ultimatecoal use,'' is deleted in this final rule. Section 827.1, which specifies the performance standards for coal preparationplants not located within the permit area of a mine, previously read, ``Thispart sets forth requirements for coal preparation plants not within thepermit area for a specific mine other than those plants which are locatedat the site of ultimate coal use.'' In the final rule, this language isreplaced with, ``This part sets forth requirements for coal preparationplants operated in connection with a coal mine but outside the permit areafor a specific mine.'' As in the case of 30 CFR 785.21, this language differsfrom the proposed rule in that it includes the clarifying phrase, ``fora specific mine.'' Again, for the reasons cited above, the redundant phrase``other than those plants which are located at the site of ultimate coaluse,'' is deleted. The new definitions of ``coal preparation'' and ``coal preparation plant''promulgated on May 11, 1987 (52 FR 17724), include activities and facilitiesin addition to those that involve the separation of coal from its impurities.OSMRE's experience has been that these additional activities are not necessarilyconducted at the point of ultimate use, nor are they necessarily conducted``in connection with'' a coal mine. As a result, OSMRE can no longer treatall facilities which handle coal as either ``in connection with'' a mineor ``in connection with'' an end user as it could when the definition ofcoal preparation was based on the separation of coal from its impurities.For example, facilities such as the docks at Baltimore, MD; Hampton Roads,VA; Mobile, AL; and Long Beach, CA, that may occasionally crush or sizecoal, may conduct ``coal preparation'' under the new definition. However,OSMRE does not believe that the activities being conducted at such facilitiesare ``in connection with'' a coal mine or that the Act was intended toregulate the activities at such facilities. In light of the broadened definitions of ``coal preparation'' and ``coalpreparation plant,'' it is necessary to ensure that the performance standardsin 30 CFR Part 827 and the permitting requirements in 30 CFR 785.21 areapplied only to facilities conducting coal preparation ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine. The limitation to coal preparation conducted ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine is necessarily implied in Parts 785 and 827 becauseof the statutory and regulatory use of that phrase in the definition ofthe term ``surface coal mining operations.'' However, OSMRE believes itwould clarify the provisions if the limitation were explicitly referencedand would help to ensure that the provisions are not misconstrued.No definition of the term ``in connection with'' is included in this finalrule. Any attempt to further define this phrase in a regulation would undulyrestrict the discretion that regulatory authorities must have in orderto make valid decisions about the applicability of the performance standardsof SMCRA in individual cases. Categorical exclusions or inclusions wouldalmost certainly result in inappropriate applications of the rule in someinstances. Regulatory authorities will find ample guidance for making determinationsas to whether a coal preparation plant is being operated in connectionwith a coal mine in the language in the definitions of ``surface coal miningoperations'' in section 701(28) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 700.5, in case historiesinterpreting those definitions, and in preamble discussions in OSMRE'srelated 1979 and 1983 rules.OSMRE continutes to believe that the ability of mine operators, or coalhandlers directly servicing such operators, to have control of processingoperations is essential in establishing that a processing plant is beingoperated in connection with a coal mine. This position was set forth inan explanation of the reach of the 1979 regulation (30 CFR 785.21) whenOSMRE stated, ``OSM is only requiring regulatory authorities to extendtheir permit requirements as far into the stream of commerce as those activitiesover which mine operators and the coal handlers who directly serve them,such as coal processors, have or could have control of operations.'' (44FR 15095).In identifying the relationship necessary for coal preparation to be ``inconnection with'' a coal mine, the principle stated in the May 5, 1983,preamble to the definition of ``coal preparation of coal procesing'' shouldbe referenced. In that preamble, OSMRE cited examples of facilities whichcould be considered to be ``in connection with'' a coal mine, including``facilities which receive a significant portion of their coal from a mine;facilities which receive a significant portion of the output from a mine;facilities which have an economic relationship with a mine; or any othertype of integration that exists between a facility and a mine.'' Further,OSMRE stated that a ``facility need not be owned by a mine owner to bein connection with a mine.'' (48 FR 20393; see also discussion at 52 FR17726, May 11, 1987). This rulemaking does not alter that position.Finally, in determining the applicability of SMCRA to off-site facilities,OSMRE has considered the January 29, 1988, ruling of the court of appeals(<T3>NWF</T3>, 839 F.2d at 742-745). That decision affirmed OSMRE's interpretationthat the phrase ``at or near the mine site'' found in section 701(28)(A)of the Act did not limit the Act's regulatory jurisdiction over coal processingactivities. While acknowledging that the reasonableness of the Secretary'sreading of section 701(28)(A) of the Act concerning jurisdiction over coalprocessing activities was a close question, the court affirmed OSMRE'sauthority to regulate off-site coal processing under section 701(28)(B)of SMCRA, which extends the Secretary's authority to ``processing areas''and other areas upon which are sited structures and facilities ``resultingfrom or incident to'' activities specified in section 701(28)(A).In addition to affirming this authority, the court of appeals found thatthe phrase ``resulting from or incident to'' could be construed to connotean element of proximity. Specifically, the court of appeals stated thatthe ``phrase `resulting from or incident to' clearly suggests a causalconnection, which, while not indicating an element of geographic proximity,certainly does require some type of limiting principle of proximate causation* * *.'' (<T3>NWF</T3>, 839 F.2d at 745).Because the court affirmed the Secretary's authority to regulate offsitecoal processing under section 701(28)(B) of SMCRA, it is appropriate forOSMRE to consider the court's approval of the use of a proximity factorin determining the reach of 701(28)(B). Hence, OSMRE believes that geographicproximity, as well as the functional relationship between mines and coalpreparation plants, are proper factors to be considered by regulatory authoritieswhen identifying off-site preparation plants which operate in connectionwith a coal mine and therefore are subject to regulation under SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Response to Comments</ITAG>Jurisdiction of SMCRA over ``Coal Processing''One commenter maintained that the rule is an attempt to assert authoritybeyond the limits of SMCRA. Congress did not intend, the commenter asserted,to regulate off-site activities incidental to the loading of coal, suchas crushing or sizing.OSMRE does not agree. The question of whether Congress intended the physicalprocessing of coal, such as crushing and sizing, to be regulated underSMCRA is not at issue in this rulemaking. As discussed in the ``Background''of this preamble, OSMRE revised the definitions of ``coal preparation''and ``coal preparation plant'' (May 11, 1987; 52 FR 17724) to include physicalprocessing of coal in response to the decision in <T3>In Re: Permanent II </T3>(Slip op. at 15-20). The issue in this rulemakingis how to determine those off-site coal preparation activities which areincluded in the definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section701(28) of the Act.Another commenter suggested that the rule was an illegal attempt to curtailjurisdiction over crushing, screening, sizing, and other physical processing.The commenter maintained that OSMRE was failing to meet the intent of SMCRAto regulate <T3>all </T3>coal processing.OSMRE disagrees. Contrary to the commenter's assertion, there is nothingin the Act or its history that implies that SMCRA was meant to apply nation-wideto all industrial facilities that process coal irrespective of whetheror not they are operating in connection with a coal mine. This rule relieson the statutory standard in section 701(28)(A) of the Act that the off-sitecoal preparation must be performed ``in connection with'' a coal mine.Because the phrase ``in connection with'' is not defined in the Act, andthere is no statutory obligation to define it in regulations, OSMRE hasthe latitude to adopt it verbatim and apply it in a reasonable manner consistentwith its normal meaning.Specifically, this commenter maintained that the consideration of proximityin determining jurisdiction over off-site coal processing is illegal. Theproximity consideration authorized by the court of appeals for supportfacilities, the commenter maintained, does not apply to coal processing.The phrase in section 701(28)(B), ``resulting from or incident to,'' thecommenter asserted, modifies ``other areas upon which are sited structures,facilities, or other property or materials on the surface'' and does notmodify ``processing'' in (B).OSMRE disagrees. OSMRE's position is based in part on the decision of thecourt of appeals, which stated, ``At issue in the interpretation of section701(28)(B) is the scope of `processing areas * * * and other areas uponwhich are sited structures, facilities or other property or materials onthe surface resulting from or incident to such activities.' '' The courtcontinued, ``We agree * * * with the district court that the Secretarymay reasonably construe the meaning of `processing areas * * * resultingfrom or incident to such activities' to include processing facilities thatare not at or near the mine site.'' The court added, ``The language ofsubsection (B) is without geographic limitation; coal processing facilitiescan certainly be `incident to' surface coal mining operations without beingonsite'' (<T3>NWF</T3>, 839 F.2d at 744-745). This language supports OSMRE's conclusionthat the phrase ``resulting from or incident to'' modifies ``processingareas,'' and that OSMRE may regulate off-site coal preparation facilitiespursuant to the definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' at section701(28) of the Act.This same commenter suggested that even if it is accepted, for argument'ssake, that ``processing areas'' is modified by ``resulting from or incidentto,'' it is arbitrary to apply this to dry coal preparation and not othercoal preparation. If, the commenter maintained, the phrase does modify``coal processing,'' then it also modifies the other enumerated facilitiesin section 701(28)(B), including coal waste impoundments, dams, spoil banks,overburden piles, etc. The commenter suggested that OSMRE would be hard-pressedto argue before any court that this is the case because of the obviousenvironmental hazards that would result from such an interpretation.Contrary to this assertion, OSMRE is not interpreting the modifying phrase``resulting from or incident to'' as limited to dry coal preparation butrather interprets it to apply to all coal processing or preparation. AlthoughOSMRE is not addressing in this rulemaking the interpretation of (B) asit applies to facilities other than coal preparation plants, OMSRE mustnote that the phrase ``resulting from or incident to'' clearly does modifyall those other areas specified in section 701(28)(B) of the Act. OSMREdoes not believe that the enumeration by Congress of examples in section701(28)(B) was intended to reach such facilities not resulting from orincident to a mine. If Congress had intended to regulate these enumeratedfacilities without any consideration of whether they were resulting fromor incident to coal mine activities, then all impoundments and dams nationwidewould be subject to SMCRA regardless of whether or not they had anythingto do with a coal mine. Certainly Congress did not intend OSMRE to regulatecattle-watering agricultural impoundments or major water project impoundingstructures without any coal mining association. Congress did not intendthat ``shipping areas'' regardless of their association with coal minesbe regulated under SMCRA. It is unreasonable to assume that Congress intendedto regulate all coal processing at all industrial facilities nationwide,absent any relationship to a mine. Congress did not enumerate the examplesin section 701(28)(B) as types of facilities which will always be regulatedunder SMCRA, irrespective of whether or not they are associated with coalmines. Congress identified them as examples of facilities that will beregulated if they are ``resulting from or incident to'' activities in connectionwith a coal mine.In addition to the objection concerning OSMRE's interpretation of the languagein section 701(28)(B) of the Act, this commenter suggested that OSMRE'srule amounts to an expansion of the 1988 court of appeals decision andthat it conflicts with the 1980 and 1984 district court decisions thatparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 701(28) of the Act are independent andthat they cumulatively establish the scope of jurisdiction. OSMRE has attempted,the commenter continued, to interject a geographic proximity considerationcrafted under paragraph (B) into an interpretation of ``in connection with''which is found in paragraph (A). This, the commenter argued, is contraryto court decisions in that it makes paragraph (A) servient to the languagein paragraph (B).The commenter suggested that the court of appeals, although expressly decliningto find jurisdiction under paragraph (A), endorsed the lower court's judgmentto find authority under paragraph (B). Thus, according to the commenter,the lower court's interpretation of the relationship between paragraphs(A) and (B) must stand as the only proper interpretation consistent withrules of statutory construction and the broad intent of Congress. Again, OSMRE disagrees. First, the court of appeals found authority toregulate off-site coal processing under section 701(28)(B) of the Act.Second, the court acknowledged that the term ``processing areas'' is modifiedby the phrase ``resulting from or incident to.'' The question is whichprocessing areas are resulting from or incident to the activities in section701(28)(A) of the Act. Third, the court found the element of proximityto be a valid consideration in determining whether a facility is ``resultingfrom or incident to.'' Thus, the consideration of proximity in determiningthe reach of the regulation to ``processing areas'' is appropriate. Thecourt indicated that the Secretary may properly limit the reach of theregulation to ``facilities that are `in connection with' a surface coalmine * * *.'' Thus, the court acknowledged without objection an approachto determining what is ``coal processing * * * resulting from or incidentto'' coal mining activities, which is based on a consideration of proximityappropriate in implementing section 701(28) (B) of the Act, and which incorporatespertinent limiting language found in section 701(28) (A) of the Act_``activities* * * in connection with.''This view is also consistent with the finding of the court of appeals thatthe ``phrase `resulting from or incident to' * * * certainly does requiresome type of limiting principle of <T3>proximate</T3> causation that is familiar to the courts in tort law.Otherwise, every support facility that could be considered a `but for'result of a surface coal mining operation would be subject to SMCRA regulation''(emphasis added) (<T3>NWF,</T3> 839 F. 2d at 745). OSMRE believes that a limiting principle similar to the one found by thecourt of appeals to have merit under section 701(28) (B) of the Act canalso be reasonably applied in determining whether coal processing activitiesare ``in connection with'' a coal mine under section 701(28)(A). Thus,the element of geographic proximity, along with the element of functionalrelationship described in this preamble, are proper factors to considerin evaluating whether an off-site coal preparation plant is subject toregulation under SMCRA. Contrary to the assertion of the commenter, OSMREis interpreting the complex definition in section 701(28) of the Act ina manner wholly consistent with and supported by this latest court decision.One commenter maintained that the most straight-forward approach to regulatingoff-site coal processing would be to acknowledge what the court of appealsfound to be a ``clearly better'' reading of the statute_that ``at or nearthe mine site'' in section 701(28)(A) of the Act modifies ``cleaning, concentrating,or other processing or preparation.''OSMRE has considered this interpretation in the past but, in light of thefact that the court of appeals has upheld the Secretary's jurisdictionover coal processing under section 701(28)(B) of the Act, it is not necessaryto revisit the interpretation of the ``at or near the mine site'' languagein section 701(28)(A). The purpose of this rule is to recognize that thereare processing facilities other than those at the point of ultimate usethat are not in connection with a coal mine, and to ensure that jurisdictionis extended only to preparation plants operating in connection with a coalmine.One commenter suggested that OSMRE clarify that off-site coal loading absentchemical or physical processing is not regulated under section 701(28)(B)of the Act as ``processing areas'' or as ``other areas upon which are sitedstructures * * * resulting from or incident to'' mining. The commenterpointed to the language in (A) stipulating that the definition of ``surfacecoal mining operations'' includes loading ``for interstate commerce'' thatoccurs ``at or near the mine site,'' and suggested that this would precluderegulating coal loading that did not meet this two part criteria in (A).OSMRE interprets ``loading'' and ``processing'' in section 701(28) to bedistinct and different activities. Coal loading is not processing, andtherefore off-site loading facilities that do not process coal are notsubject to the performance standards of 30 CFR Part 827. OSMRE agrees withthe commenter that loading facilities that do not process coal are notregulated unless located at or near the mine site. OSMRE construes thespecific language of section 701(28)(A) of the Act limiting the regulationof loading facilities to those at or near the mine site to limit proximityconsiderations concerning off-site loading facilities.Applying ``In Connection With''In addition to supporting the incorporation of the phrase ``in connectionwith'' into the rule, one commenter suggested that OSMRE define the termin order to limit the rule's application.As mentioned above, there is no statutory obligation to flesh out the languagein this rule. OSMRE believes that further attempts to define the phrase``in connection with'' would unduly hamper regulatory authorities in makingvalid case-by-case determinations and would result in inappropriate applicationsof the rule. For example, in 1983, OSMRE amended the rules governing thereach of SMCRA to off-site coal processing by including all processingbut that which was conducted at the point of ultimate use. While the testwas mechanical and very easy to apply, it posed the potential for inclusionof facilities that do not operate in connection with a coal mine. To thatextent, the fleshing out of the rule was undesirable and needed to be changed.The preamble to this rule provides adequate guidance, much of which hasbeen in place for many years, on what to consider when evaluating whethera coal preparation plant is operating in connection with a coal mine. Further,the court of appeals (<T3>NWF,</T3> 839 F.2d at 745) found merit in OSMRE's ``flexible implementationof the statute that allows regulatory authorities to `consider the myriadsite specific situations that cannot be fully anticipated in writing aFederal regulation.' (48 FR 20397; 1983).''Another commenter criticized OSMRE's assertion that it can no longer treatfacilities as being either in connection with a mine or an end user. Thecommenter maintained that OSMRE has failed to identify any aspect inherentin the preparation activities newly included in the definition of ``coalpreparation'' that justifies any reconsideration of their being subjectto regulation. The commenter then went on to exclude the possibility ofbasing such a distinction on location or environmental harm because processinginvolving the separation of coal from its impurities is just as likelyto occur away from minesites as that which does not involve separationof impurities, and both types of processing involve environmental impacts.Contrary to the commenter's assertion, OSMRE's experience indicates thatfacilities separating coal from its impurities are much more apt to belocated near the mine or near the end user, while crushing, sizing, andscreening may occur at any point in the stream of commerce. Further, asdescribed earlier in this preamble, once the definition of ``coal preparation''was changed to include activities less apt to be conducted ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine, it raised the specter of the misapplication of therules to such activities. Because of the addition to the definition of``coal preparation'' of new categories of activities which in some instancesmay not be ``in connection with'' a mine or end user (e.g., crushing andsizing), OSMRE must revise the language of this rule. OSMRE wishes to appropriatelylimit and concisely state the jurisdiction provided in section 701(28)of the Act over coal preparation which results from or is incident to anactivity ``in connection with'' a coal mine. Therefore, OSMRE is revisingthe rules to incorporate the phrase ``in connection with.''Another commenter objected to the removal from existing regulations ofthe phrase ``other than such plants which are located at the site of ultimatecoal use'' and the insertion of ``in connection with,'' on the basis thatthe latter phrase is subjective and will require the regulatory authorityto make a judgment as to whether a facility is operating ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine. The commenter suggested that the determination of jurisdictionwas clearer under previous language and recommended retaining the existinglanguage in 30 CFR Parts 785 and 827.It has always been necessary for regulatory authorities to determine whethercoal preparation activities are being conducted ``in connection with''a coal mine. The incorporation of the statutory language in this rule merelyspecifically repeats the statutory requirement. Because of the amendeddefinition of ``coal preparation,'' the terms of the previous criterioncould have been interpreted to include activities and facilities whichdo not meet the statutory definition of surface coal mining operations.Therefore, this provision needed to be changed.Another commenter was concerned about the effect of the rule on a specificpreparation plant that operates in connection with an end user, a powerplant burning coal from a mine located about a mile away. Such plants werenot subject to regulation under OSMRE's previous rules at 30 CFR Parts785 and 827 because those rules explicitly excluded from jurisdiction ``suchplants which are located at the site of ultimate coal use.''As stated above, OSMRE has not changed its interpretation that operationsin connection with an end user are not operations in connection with acoal mine. Coal preparation facilities which are being operated only inconnection with another industrial facility, such as the power plant ofconcern to this commenter, do not operate in connection with a coal mineand are not subject to the rule.Another commenter maintained that this rule is a reversal of OSMRE's July10, 1985 (50 FR 28186), interim final rule which required States to revisetheir programs to ensure that every ``coal preparation plant'' under theinterim final definition would be permitted. Certain operations subjectto regulation under the interim final rule will no longer be regulatedunder the new rule, the commenter asserted.This new rule does not constitute a reversal of the referenced requirement.Although the revised definition of ``coal preparation plant'' includedfacilities not previously considered by OSMRE to be conducting coal preparation,it did not alter OSMRE's requirement that regulatory authorities extendjurisdiction only to coal preparation activities when they are ``in connectionwith'' a coal mine.One commenter emphasized that the fact that the statute is phrased in thesingular, ``in connection with <T3>a </T3>surface coal mine'' (emphasis added) means that Congress intendedthat the activity be regulated only when it is in connection with one mine,not several mines. The commenter maintained that the court of appeals supportedthis interpretation when it noted that ``the Secretary only purports toregulate facilities that are `in connection with' a surface coal mine.''Although OSMRE recognizes that the reference to ``activities * * * in connectionwith a surface coal mine'' in section 701(28)(A) of the Act is phrasedin the singular, and the singular is used in this rule, the Office doesnot interpret the language of the Act to indicate Congressional intentto limit application of the Act to activities in connection with only onemine (see, for example, 44 FR 15095 and 15292; March 13, 1979). The useof the singular ``a'' in this rule and in the guidance in this preambledoes not preclude regulatory authorities from considering the relationshipof a facility to more than one mine in determining whether that facilityis conducting activities ``in connection with'' a coal mine.This commenter also suggested that OSMRE consider whether a plant has auseful life independent of a specific mine in addition to considering thosefactors already discussed in the preamble to this rule in applying the``in connection with'' test.OSMRE believes that it is valid to consider whether a facility has a usefullife independent of the specific mine or mines which it serves, in determiningif the facility is operating in connection with a coal mine (particularlyin light of the intended effect of the Act as a reclamation statute). Afacility lacking a useful life independent of the specific mine or mineswhich it currently serves would be operating in connection with a coalmine, while a facility having a useful independent life might not. In thelatter case, regulatory authorities would have to consider the other aspectsof the relationship between the facility and any particular coal mine ormines to determine if it operates in connection with a coal mine. OSMREbelieves that this consideration is consistent with the economic and otherconsiderations set forth in the May 5, 1983, preamble to the definitionof ``coal preparation or coal processing'' (48 FR 20393) and is also consistentwith the need for a limitation noted by the court of appeals (<T3>NWF</T3>, 839 F.2d at 745).This same commenter added that the functional relationship described byexample in the preamble is subject to change over time. For example, thecommenter noted, a facility's economic relationship to a mine may changefrom year to year depending on the life of the permit and, particularly,the useful life of the facility. Consequently, the commenter maintained,a facility that meets the ``in connection with'' test one year may notmeet it under the exact same analysis the next year. The commenter suggestedthe use of a litmus test which would incorporate proximity and the ``usefullife independent of a mine'' test applied in relation to a specific mine.The commenter asserted that this will lead to the regulation of preparationplants built and operated for the life of a particular mine thus allowingfor a more appropriate application of SMCRA's post-mining land use standards.Independent facilities which operate separate from the life of a particularmine do not fit Congress' statutory scheme for post-mining land use, accordingto the commenter. Such a facility's useful life, the commenter continued,may extend beyond the life of the particular mine it serves, but the leveland frequency of activity of the facility may be associated with severalmines it serves, rather than a particular mine. The commenter further maintainedthat OSMRE has in the past insisted that a permit for an independent facilityshow that it will be dismantled and the area reclaimed once processingactivities cease, despite the owner's plans to use the facility sometimein the future for new mining anticipated in the area. It appears from legislativehistory and statutory construction, the commenter maintained, that Congressintended to regulate only those facilities directly related to a mine withno anticipated life beyond a particular mine.OSMRE agrees with the commenter that the application of the Act, with itsprimary emphasis on reclamation and post-mining land use, to industrialfacilities designed for long-term use and not operated in connection witha coal mine would be inappropriate. Because SMCRA is primarily a reclamationstatute, and any facility regulated as a surface coal mining operationmust have a reclamation plan, it is reasonable to expect that a regulatedfacility will have an estimated or prescribed life span and that reclamationwill occur following the close of operations.However, OSMRE disagrees with the commenter's assertion that SMCRA wasintended to regulate only those facilities directly related to a mine withno anticipated life beyond a particular mine. OSMRE sees no basis in SMCRAor the legislative history for the commenter's conclusion. As noted above,a facility may be subject to regulation because it is operating in connectionwith more than one coal mine.OSMRE does not expect this approach to lead to a series of situations inwhich many facilities that meet the ``in connection with'' test one yearwill not meet it under the same analysis the next year, as envisioned bythe commenter. Decisions of regulatory authorities concerning whether ornot facilities operate in connection with a coal mine are to be made consistentwith the practical considerations discussed in this rulemaking. OSMRE doesnot believe that the fundamental economic relationships that exist betweenfacilities and mines fluctuate to the extent that regulatory authoritieswould properly reverse their determinations from one year to the next.Further, OSMRE believes that the flexibility inherent in this rule doesmore to enhance the year-to-year consistency of decisions than would bethe case if the rule set forth a more mechanical approach.Issue of ``Control of Operations''One commenter criticized OSMRE for stating in the proposed rule that ``theability of the mine operators, or coal handlers directly servicing suchoperators, to have control of operations is essential in establishing thata plant is being operated in connection with a mine,'' and then allegedlycontradicting that position by stating that ``a facility need not be ownedby a mine owner to be in connection with a mine'' (53 FR 23528). Becauseof the confusion surrounding what ``control'' really is, the commentermaintained, OSMRE needs to provide more guidance here.Further the commenter maintained, OSMRE should make clear that the ``control''discussed in the preamble is different from ownership and control as definedin OSMRE's regulations. The former, the commenter suggested, does not havethe legal meaning of the latter, and really relates to function ratherthan a legal relationship.The language quoted by the commenter is from guidance provided by OSMREin 1979 and 1983. This rulemaking is not intended to alter the meaningor utility of that guidance, and the application of that guidance throughregulatory programs has not raised any significant questions regardingits utility or appropriateness. Further, OSMRE sees nothing contradictoryin that guidance. OSMRE was merely making the point that ownership of afacility is not necessary in order for the facility to be operating inconnection with a coal mine. The level of economic reliance of a particularfacility on a coal mine is a valid consideration in determining if thefacility operates in connection with that mine. OSMRE still considers thisguidance to be pertinent.The commenter's point about the use of the term ``control'' is well taken.OSMRE defines ``owns or controls'' and ``owned or controlled'' at 30 CFR773.5 (see 53 FR 38868) for purposes of implementing section 510(c) ofthe Act relative to ownership or control of a mine operation. A definitionof ``control'' did not exist in 1979 when OSMRE first used the term asguidance for resolving questions of SMCRA's jurisdiction over offsite facilities.The purpose and effect of the guidance for this rule is not intended tobe altered by OSMRE's recent definition of ``owns or controls.'' The preamblecited in this rulemaking was intended to allude to the economic or functionalrelationship or linkage that may constitute a connection between coal processingactivities and a mine under section 701(28)(A) of the Act, irrespectiveof ownership of the facilities.This commenter also suggested that OSMRE's preamble examples of the typesof relationships that constitute ``in connection with'' are vague, andthat OSMRE needs to define the terms used in the examples, such as ``significant'',``economic relationship'', or ``any type of integration'' (53 FR 23528).OSMRE does not agree that the examples are vague. When used as illustrationsin the guidance on evaluating ``connections,'' these terms have generallyunderstood meanings. OSMRE believes that defining or further fleshing outthese terms beyond their normal usage is unnecessary in order for the termsto be useful in this context. And to the extent that more detailed definitionswould alter the generally understood meanings of these terms, such definitionswould lead to inappropriate applications of the rule.Miscellaneous CommentsOne commenter asserted that OSMRE, by referencing specific harbor facilitiesin the preamble, was attempting to carve out an illegal exemption for facilitiesbased on distance from a mine.OSMRE is not proposing any class exemption. The port facilities named inthe preamble to the proposed rule were included as specific and illustrativeexamples of facilities which OSMRE believes are not conducting coal preparationin connection with a coal mine. As another commenter pointed out, thesespecific facilities are primarily freight handling facilities and, as such,are an intermediate transfer point for coal which has already entered interstateor international commerce. OSMRE does not propose that determinations aboutjurisdiction be made solely on the basis of location relative to a mineabsent any consideration of function or relationship. The approach adoptedby OSMRE, and one which the court of appeals found to have merit, is toconsider proximity as one of the factors in determining jurisdiction.One commenter noted that a misconception exists concerning blending ofcoal, where coal from different seams and of differing qualities is loadedinto the same coal carrier to achieve a composite product of specifiedquality. The commenter was concerned that this will be considered ``physicalprocessing'' under this rule because the characteristics of the blendedcoal are different from those of the constituent coals. This is particularlyobjectionable, the commenter maintained, because there is no environmentalconsequence to such blending.OSMRE does not believe that the blending of coal during loading, if allthat is involved is the loading of different types or qualities of coal,changes the status of a loading operation for purposes of regulation. Suchblending is not processing.One commenter urged that OSMRE clarify that retail sales dealers havingtheir own coal preparation facilities, where the only contact with a mineis the purchase of run-of-the-mine coal at wholesale prices, are not tobe regulated under the rule.OSMRE cannot state with certainty that the facilities of concern to thiscommenter do not operate in connection with a coal mine. Whether a particularretail sales dealer is operating in connection with a coal mine is a questionof fact, to be determined based on the facts of the particular situation.However, because coal preparation facilities operated by retail sales dealerstend to be closely linked to end users, OSMRE does not expect that regulatoryauthorities, in making case-by-case determinations, will likely find thatsuch facilities are operating in connection with a coal mine.A Federal agency reminded OSMRE of the authority of Federal land managingagencies to regulate surface mining on agency lands.This rule deals with the issue of regulation under SMCRA and thus has noeffect on regulation by other Federal agencies of lands under their jurisdictionunder other statutes.One commenter objected to the manner of promulgation of these and previousregulations dealing with off-site coal preparation, and maintained thatOSMRE violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in promulgating the1985 interim final rule defining ``coal preparation.'' The commenter maintainedthat it is difficult for operators of facilities to determine if they aresubject to regulation because of the constant changes in the status ofregulations. The commenter criticized OSMRE for proposing changes onlyto portions of the rules governing off-site coal preparation instead ofrevising all the rules for off-site preparation. OSMRE should, the commentersuggested, at least provide a reasonable effective date for this finalrule so that operators have time to determine if they are to be regulated.Questions of APA violations in other rulemakings are outside the scopeof this rulemaking. The APA and section 526(a) of SMCRA provide appropriateprocedures for any interested person who feels that a statutory requirementfor another rulemaking has not been met. OSMRE has adhered to the APA inproposing this rule, considering public comments, and promulgating thefinal rule. The rule is issued with the standard effective date of 30-daysfrom the date of publication, which OSMRE believes is a reasonable effectivedate, given the nature of the issues addressed in this rulemaking. In addition,OSMRE sees no reason to repropose all the rules dealing with off-site coalpreparation when the only question at hand is one of clarifying which preparationplants are subject to regulation under the Act's definition of ``surfacecoal mining operations.''Finally, concerning the commenter's assertion that facility operators cannottell if they are subject to the rule, OSMRE does not purport to providethe entire regulatory scheme in this rule, but rather seeks to providea reasonable framework for regulatory authorities to adopt and implementregulatory programs, including appropriate case-by-case decisions aboutjurisdiction. In this regard, OSMRE believes that it is providing sufficientregulatory guidance, and that operators of processing facilities necessarilyknow whether or not they are operating in connection with a coal mine orif they are operating a long-term industrial facility not in connectionwith any coal mine. When in doubt, they should contact the regulatory authority.Effect in Federal Program States and on Indian LandsThe rule applies through cross-referencing in those States with Federalprograms. This includes California, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan,North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington.The Federal programs for these States appear at 30 CFR Parts 905, 910,912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947 respectively. The rulealso applies through cross-referencing to Indian lands under the Federalprogram for Indian lands as provided in 30 CFR Part 750.Effect on State ProgramsOSMRE will evaluate permanent State regulatory programs approved undersection 503 of SMCRA to determine whether any changes in these programswill be necessary. If the Director determines that certain State programprovisions should be amended in order to be made no less effective thanthe revised Federal rules, the individual States will be notified in accordancewith the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
