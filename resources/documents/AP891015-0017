Black trade unions, banned at the time Sisulu, Nelson Mandelaand other African National Congress leaders received life prisonterms in 1964, now claim more than 2 million members and have thepower to cripple the biggest industries.   A network of militant anti-apartheid groups has formed in blacktownships across South Africa, linking churches, students, womenand workers in an organizational framework that was not availableto Sisulu and Mandela.   Sisulu's hometown, the vast black township of Soweto, remains anall-black ghetto providing a work force for Johannesburg, but itnow includes posh two-story homes as well as cramped matchboxhouses and shanties. More Sowetans commute to work in black-ownedtaxis than in white-owned buses.   In Johannesburg itself, several inner-city neighborhoods havebecome thoroughly multiracial, even though laws mandatingresidential segregation remain on the books.   When Sisulu went to jail, virtually every type of publicfacility in Johannesburg was segregated _ toilets, elevators,parks, libraries, theaters, restaurants. Blacks and whites waitedin separate lines at post offices.   Those segregation policies crumbled one by one, and the city'sfinal segregated amenities were opened up last month. Sisulu nowcan ride buses, swim in swimming pools and patronize recreationcenters that formerly were reserved for whites.   Segregated facilities remain in some other parts of the country,but the government has hinted that the law allowing suchsegregation may be headed for abolition.   Public hospitals and schools remain segregated, but the numberof multiracial private schools has mushroomed since 1964. Many moreblacks have moved into professional and technical jobs, includingskilled mining jobs that until two years ago were exclusively forwhites.   South Africa's international isolation has intensified steadilysince 1964. That was the first year the country was barred from theOlympics, and it now is excluded from international competition inalmost every sport. A cultural boycott also is in effect, as arenumerous trade embargoes, and South Africa has been excluded fromthe U.N. General Assembly since 1974.   Anti-apartheid activism among South African whites was rare in1964, outside a small ciricle of communist-oriented intellectualsaligned to the ANC.   There was one anti-apartheid legislator, Helen Suzman, inParliament. Now there are 34, with the anti-apartheid DemocraticParty having won 20 percent of the votes in the Sept. 6 generalelection.   Whites produce lively anti-apartheid newspapers, perform inanti-apartheid rock bands and, in increasing numbers, journeyabroad to confer with the ANC's exiled leaders.   Major changes also have taken place within the governingNational Party. In 1964, it unashamedly touted its ``grandapartheid'' policy of relocating blacks into rural tribalhomelands, theorizing that the blacks could satisfy their desirefor political rights in the homelands while whites tightenedcontrol over the other 87 percent of the country.   The homelands still exist, but the National Party nowacknowledges that the blacks in ``white'' South Africa arepermanent residents who must be given a political role.   Efforts to stem the flow of blacks into urban areas have eased,and the government abolished the so-called pass laws that requiredblacks in ``white'' areas to have permits.   The new president, F.W. de Klerk, also is different from thegovernment leaders of the 1950s and early 60s. Since taking power,he has pledged to eliminate discriminatory laws and negotiate a newconstitution within five years that would extend political rightsto blacks.   However, de Klerk, like his predecessors, opposes a one-person,one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule. Heenvisions some mechanism through which whites would maintain a vetopower over major decisions, something Sisulu and his freedcolleagues are likely to find unacceptable.</TEXT></DOC>
