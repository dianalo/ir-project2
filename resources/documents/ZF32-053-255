 Networkedmicrocomputers are approaching the power and speed of mainframesand microcomputers offer great price advantages over mainframes.andO;Sales of new and second-hand mainframes have slumped.andP;  The priceof an IBM 3090 has fallen from $3.2 million in Dec 1990 to $1.5million in Jul 1991.andP;  But consultants point out the limitations ofmicrocomputers.andP;  Choosing one machine over the other will bedetermined by the application for which it will be used.andO;Microcomputers have storage limitations.andP;

 Chairing this month's Pandamp;P Conference, Upsizing, Downsizing,Rightsizing, he showed a slide of a computer: &quot;And then we had themainframe,&quot; he said, &quot;which many of you will remember.andP;  .  .&quot;andM;It seems that downsizing is no longer just a burgeoning buzz-word.andP;  Thetransfer from mainframe technology to the new generation of client/fileserverPC networks is fast becoming a fact of life.andP;  But to all those attending theconference, who not only remember the mainframe but still run one, thepressure to downsize must have been heightened.andP;  What position do these usersfind themselves in as the downsizing screws turn?andP;  Are they risking missedopportunities?andP;  Or simply falling prey to market opportunism?andM;Networked PCs are beginning to match mainframes for power and speed, at afraction of the cost.andP;  Microsoft's Bill Gates stood up at the conference andspelt out exciting new futures for network users.andM;A basic network setup starts at 8,000 pounds, and downsizing has become aeuphemism for cost saving.andP;  Abbey National, W H Smith and MaxwellCommunications have all embraced the downsize option, purchasing hugequantities of Unix software for their systems -- companies to whom IToverhauls and lengthy payback periods are a way of life.andP;  But this might notbe a realistic option for smaller companies.andM;Mainframe manufacturers have been badly hit by market changes -- an IBM 3090mainframe computer was priced around $3.2 million in December of last year;in July the same model cost $1.5 million.andM;Companies can no longer expect good returns on second-hand mainframe systems-- systems they may still be paying for.andP;  Disposing of equipment leased underfixed-term contract might even entail a cost.andM;MPSI, a company that produces software for the oil industry, sold its IBM3083 mainframe in January and, according to Sandy Kemlo, vice president ofoperations, lost &quot;quite a lot of money&quot;.andP;  MPSI replaced the mainframe with anRS/6000 530 fileserver and six 320s, all networked with Ethernet running 34X-stations.andP;  Each server was 20,000 pounds and the X-stations totalled around120,000 pounds.andP;  The company also ran up a sizable bill for new software --including the AIX operating system, Oracle and Motis -- and training.andM;Of course, MPSI wouldn't have downsized unless it foresaw some kind ofreturn.andP;  Indeed, it's currently saving some 15,000 pounds a month on oldsystem costs, and has an estimated two-year payback period on its investment.andO;However, its outlay must be daunting for companies feeling the effects of therecession.andP;  For these companies, downsizing must seem a case of damned if youdo, damned if you don't.andM;Computer consultants are hesitant to rally to the downsizing call.andP;  &quot;Itswrong to regard downsizing as a panacea,&quot; said Graham Dwyer of BusinessComputer Developments.andP;  &quot;Mainframe platforms have steam in them for someyears yet.&quot;andP;  He concedes the long-term cost effectiveness of networks, butsees mainframes and minis as resilient and reliable.andP;  Consultant NigelBottomley feels the issue still centres on the type of application beingused.andP;  &quot;If you're printing more than 10,000 invoices, then there isn't a PCto cope,&quot; he said.andP;  Likewise, there are physical limits to data storage withPC networks: fileservers can't work effectively with over 20Gb of data.andM;Inevitably, much of the PC hype is blamed on interested parties.andP;  However,the suppliers themselves maintain a sense of perspective on the issue.andO;Oracle's Dinesh Vadhia said: &quot;It's irresponsible to bandy the term'downsizing' about.andP;  Users can't afford to throw away cash -- they mustmaximise what they've got.&quot;andM;After all, mainframes can be integrated with new PC technology.andP;  Localservers can be uploaded to the mainframe, which acts as a global server.andO;Graham Dwyer thinks many corporate users were waiting for PCs to developfurther before downsizing.andP;  Hugh Jenkins, product manager for Compaq'shigh-end systems, said: &quot;The PC industry will always be here.andP;  It isn'tlocking anybody out.&quot;andM;Indeed it will.andP;  Companies shouldn't be stampeded into scrapping systems,spooked by visions of users lumbered with yesterday's technology.andP;  It's noteven a cause of either mainframe or PC.andP;  But Bill Gates was definitelysmiling as he unrolled Microsoft's plans for the future -- and he didn'tmention 'the mainframe' once.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
