Industry officials familiar with the plans said Cray hasagreed to use Sun's Sparc architecture in futuresupercomputers, probably in machines that chain together manymicroprocessors, or &quot;brain&quot; chips, in a format often calledparallel supercomputing. Whatever machines come from thedeal, however, aren't likely to be on the market for severalyears, industry analysts said.</LP><TEXT>   A Sun spokeswoman acknowledged that Sun plans a pressconference with Cray to announce a &quot;technology-sharing andmarketing agreement,&quot; but wouldn't provide details. A Crayspokesman would only say it will announce a &quot;strategicrelationship&quot; soon.   For Cray, the Sun's Sparc chips offer a weapon againstupstart supercomputer makers, such as Intel Corp., of SantaClara, Calif., and Thinking Machines Corp., of Cambridge,Mass., which are quickly gaining market share with theirparallel machines. Thinking Machines earlier agreed to useSparc chips in future parallel machines, which are popularamong scientists and financial institutions because themachines are far less expensive than traditionalsupercomputers.   &quot;Cray needs to be in this marketplace and they know it,and the way to get there is to work with Sun,&quot; said DebraGoldfarb, an analyst at International Data Corp., a researchconcern.   Industry analysts say sales of Cray's older line machines,which can use only a few processors at once, have remainedflat for several years. Intel, by contrast, says sales of itssupercomputers, which can connect as many as 4,000 internalprocessors, have doubled every year since 1989.   Cray's endorsement of Sparc gives Sun, Mountain View,Calif., a high-profile ally in its effort to woo a wide rangeof computer makers to its architecture. Sun's Sparc has beenthe dominant chip in low-end workstation computers used byengineers, but the company is trying to penetrate higher-endmarkets.   The Cray relationship will also give Sun the technology itneeds to speed up its Sparc chip, which has been overshadowedrecently by faster chips from such companies asHewlett-Packard Co. and International Business MachinesCorp., said Ms. Goldfarb. The deal isn't likely to affect asyet unannounced plans by Cray to use a Digital EquipmentCorp. chip in some future machines, she added.   Cray's announcement of its support of Sparc comes as theMinneapolis company completes its acquisition of FloatingPoint Systems Inc., a Beaverton, Ore., supercomputer makerthat unsuccessfully attempted to extract itself fromfinancial troubles by developing parallel machines with Sparcchips.   ---   Karen Blumenthal in Dallas contributed to this article.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          DEBRA GOLDFARB, an analyst at International Data Corp.,believes Cray Research Inc.'s agreement to use SunMicrosystems Inc.'s microchips could help Cray penetrate themarket for &quot;moderately parallel&quot; supercomputers that chaintogether a number of so-called Risc chips but won'tnecessarily involve development of &quot;massively parallel&quot;machines.
