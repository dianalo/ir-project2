The 31-year-old Mr. Ntuli was general secretary of theCivic Association of the Southern Transvaal. Police said hewas murdered in his car about 11:30 a.m. Sunday last week bymen in two vehicles who riddled him with 12 rounds from anAK-47 automatic rifle.</LP><TEXT>   His assassination was no isolated incident. This year, 33people have been killed by hit squads, according to thenongovernmental Human Rights Commission. In all of 1990, thenumber was 28. These numbers don't include deaths from otherpolitical fighting.   Mr. Ntuli, who leaves a pregnant wife and a four-year-oldson, was killed just two weeks after the national peaceaccord was signed by President F.W. de Klerk and otherleaders.   Before classifying a homicide as a hit-squad death, thecommission considers the professionalism of the slaying, theweapons used and the assailant's apparent knowledge about thevictim. &quot;Sam Ntuli clearly fits into that,&quot; said Max Coleman,a commission member.   Mr. Coleman said hit squads are probably organized bythose who want the continuation of apartheid. &quot;As we've saidbefore,&quot; he said, &quot;these hit squads are in the governmentstructures.&quot;   Police Capt. Eugene Opperman said all possibilitiesconcerning the homicide are being thoroughly investigated.&quot;They want to turn it into a political thing,&quot; he said of Mr.Ntuli's supporters.   The day before his death, Mr. Ntuli met withrepresentatives of the Inkatha Freedom Party to discuss peaceefforts in this violence-plagued township southeast ofJohannesburg. A month ago, 23 IFP members were gunned downwhile marching along the same street where Mr. Ntuli waskilled. A few days later, someone lobbed a hand grenadeinside a bus, also on Kumalo Street, killing four.   Mr. Ntuli was a member of the African National Congress,the country's primary pro-democracy organization, which oftenis at odds with the government linked IFP. At least half ofthe hit squad murder victims have been ANC members, accordingto Mr. Coleman. Between 20% and 25% of the victims werecommunity activists, another 10% were trade unionists and therest fit in miscellaneous categories, he added. Communityactivists and trade unionists frequently are ANC members aswell.   &quot;The South African regime has long followed a policy ofelimination of its political opponents, both inside andoutside the country,&quot; the ANC said in a statement. &quot;It has toanswer for all the deaths occurring now.&quot;   Mr. Ntuli's car -- with the blood stained driver's seat,the bullet holes in the door and the shattered windows -- hasmarks where a white colored vehicle sideswiped his in anapparent attempt to force him off the road before he waskilled. The front of his house is covered with bullet holesfrom a February machine-gun and hand grenade attack.   He long had demanded the resignations of black townshipcouncilors, whom many residents feel are tools of theapartheid system, and he recently said banks and financialinstitutions would face mortgage boycotts unless they didmore to assist with housing and land problems. A few daysbefore his death, he discussed municipal government on a U.S.Information Service satellite television program.</TEXT></DOC>
