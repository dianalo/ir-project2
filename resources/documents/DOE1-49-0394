One design was a radiopaqueumbilical tape with a pleat secured by four 8-0 silk sutures thinly coatedwith silicone type A medical adhesive. The second was a stainless steelfatigued helix encased in a siliconized rubber shield. After a mean durationof 89 days, the bands were dilated with an intraluminal balloon dilator.In two of 11 experiments the umbilical tape band pleat released as planned.In all four experiments in which the stainless steel fatigued helix prosthesiswas employed, the helix was expanded by the intraluminal balloon dilator.</TEXT></DOC>
