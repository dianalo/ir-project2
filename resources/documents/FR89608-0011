Telephone: (202) 357-6134.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The National Diffusion Network (NDN)supports efforts to recognize and further excellence in education, includingthe nationwide dissemination of exemplary education programs. These areprograms that have been developed at the local level by classroom teachersand other practitioners with funds provided by a variety of sources includingschool districts, private businesses and foundations, colleges and universities,State educational agencies and other Federal programs. After field testingand evaluation, again at the local level, these programs have been validatedby several different procedures established by the Department. Once programshave been validated, they are considered part of the NDN. The developersof validated programs may compete for funding by the NDN to operate asDeveloper Demonstrator projects to disseminate specific exemplary educationprograms nationwide, or as Dissemination Process projects for nationwidedissemination of information, instructional materials and services aboutcontent areas, bodies of research or fields of professional development.On October 6, 1988 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for the NDN in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> at 53 FR 39406. A discussion of major issues was included in the NPRM on page 39406. TheSecretary has made several changes to certain of the selection criteriafor Developer Demonstrator and Dissemination Process projects in the finalregulations. The points assigned to the criteria ``Innovative approachof exemplary education program'' in andSection;andSection; 786.21 and 787.21have been reduced. In addition, the wording in these criteria and in thecriteria ``Accuracy of exemplary education program, in andSection;andSection;786.22 and 787. 22 has been changed to provide that the Secretary willreview, in addition to a representative sample of an exemplary educationprogram's instructional, classroom or curriculum materials, a descriptionof the exemplary education program including a description of the trainingthat would be provided to install the program in new settings. Correspondingchanges have been made to andSection;andSection; 786.10 and 787.10, ``Whatinformation and materials must an applicant submit to apply for an award?'',andSection;andSection; 786.20 and 787.20, ``How does the Secretary evaluatean application?'', and the criteria in andSection;andSection; 786.23 and 787.23,``Plan of operation''. A discussion of these changes appears in the Analysisof Comments and Changes section of this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, forty-three partiessubmitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the commentsand of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows.Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations towhich they pertain. Selection criterion_innovative approach of exemplary education program(andSection;andSection; 786.21 and 787.21) and Selection criterion_accuracyof exemplary education program (andSection;andSection; 786.22 and 787.22).<ITAG tagnum="81">Definitions of Terms in Selection Criteria </ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Some commenters suggested that several terms in theselection criteria be defined. Sections 786.21 and 787.21 provide thatthe Secretary determines the extent to which an exemplary education program'sapproach is ``innovative.'' Sections 786.22 and 787.22 provide that theSecretary determines the extent to which an exemplary education programis ``accurate'' and ``up-to-date.'' <T3>Discussion:</T3> The extent to which a program is accurate and up-to-dateand represents an innovative approach can be determined only within thecontext of the subject or content area, or the specific area of staff developmentaddressed by the program. The Secretary believes that definitions of thoseterms would have to be so broad and vague as to be useless. However, inpreparing a grant application, an applicant has an opportunity to establisha context, and provide information to assist reviewers in determining theextent to which a program uses an innovative approach and is accurate andup-to-date. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <ITAG tagnum="81">Review of Program Materials </ITAG><T3>Comments:</T3> Many commenters suggested that for both Developer Demonstratorand Dissemination Process projects, the Secretary should not review theinstructional, classroom and curriculum materials used by an exemplaryeducation program without also reviewing other components of the programsuch as a description of training provided to program participants. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary recognizes that materials are only onecomponent of an exemplary education program and that it would be appropriateto review other components of a program in determining whether the programis innovative and accurate. <T3>Changes:</T3> Sections 786.21 and 786.22, and 787.21 and 787.22 havebeen changed to provide that in addition to reviewing the instructional,classroom and curriculum materials, the Secretary reviews a descriptionof the program, including a description of the training provided. Correspondingchanges have been made to andSection;andSection; 786.10 and 787.10, ``Whatinformation and materials must an applicant submit to apply for an award?''and andSection;andSection; 786.20 and 787.20, ``How does the Secretary evaluatean application?'' The description of training formerly required under andSection;andSection;786.21 and 787.21 ``Plan of operation,'' (now redesignated andSection;andSection;786.23 and 787.23) has been deleted from those sections.<ITAG tagnum="81">Allocation of Points for Selection Criteria </ITAG><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested that undue weight was givento the new selection criteria, <T3>Innovative approach of exemplary education program </T3>(andSection;andSection;786.21 and 787.21), and <T3>Accuracy of exemplary education program </T3>(andSection;andSection; 786.22and 787.22), because the two criteria combined would equal almost one thirdof the total available points for a grant application. They suggested thatthis would place too great an emphasis on these criteria as compared toother aspects of a grant application and that the points allocated to thesesections should be reduced. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the selection criteriamandated in the Amendments should be of prime importance in reviewing grantapplications. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review </ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Education Impact </ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested commentson whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Parts 785, 786 and 787 </ITAG>Dissemination, Education, Educational research, Grant programs_education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 21, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
