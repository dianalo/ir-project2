The army meanwhile revealed that soldiers patrolling the occupiedGaza Strip have been authorized to fire with live ammunition onunarmed masked youths who refuse to stop for questioning, in a neweffort to crack down on uprising activists.   In Gaza, masked Palestinian assailants beat and stabbed to deathan Arab suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Arabreports said. The army confirmed the death and said it wasinvestigating.   Three Israeli dailies reported Egyptian plans to hold peace talksin Cairo. The reports quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as sayingPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt would soon issue invitations tosuch a session in coordination with the United States.   It would reportedly include a Palestinian delegation from theoccupied territories and an Israeli team, the Haaretz and Davarnewspapers said.   American and Soviet delegations will also to be invited, theEnglish-language Jerusalem Post reported.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud blocdismissed Mubarak's ideas in a speech in Tel Aviv, saying the plan,``is not on our agenda. ... In my opinion it cannot help us.''   Hours earlier, Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens arguedabout the proposals at a meeting with Vice Premier Shimon Peres andDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-leaning Labor Party,Israel television reported.   Peres said on TV he would support a preliminary meeting betweenIsraelis and Palestinians. ``What we have recommended is that therebe a meeting between us and the Palestinians,'' he said.   Peres also indicated support for Egypt's 10-point peace plan thatbacks Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupiedterritories but also advocates trading land for peace.   The occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank were captured by Israelfrom Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.   Labor has long supported territorial compromise with the Arabs asa basis for a peace settlement. Likud is opposed, demanding Israelicontrol over occupied territories.   Accepting the Egyptian plan would ``allow the Palestiniandelegation to enter the eve of negotiations,'' Peres said. ``We needa Palestinian side to begin negotiations.''   Rabin said on Israel radio he would favor meetings with aPalestinian delegation only if such meetings were based on theIsraeli peace initiative.   ``If there is a reason for discussions (in the government), itwill be on the possibilities of a meeting of delegations, betweenIsraelis and Palestinians, based on the Israeli peace initiative,''Rabin said.   The new gunfire orders come after Rabin said last week that thearmy needed more effective measures to combat masked Palestinianmilitants who roam streets in the disputed lands, threatening Arabswho do not obey uprising leaders.   Under previous orders troops could only shoot at masked youthscarrying weapons, such as guns, knives or axes.   Army officers blamed masked youths for a recent upsurge infirebomb and stoning attacks on army patrols and a sharp increase inthe killing of Arabs suspected of cooperating with Israeliauthorities.   At least 114 Palestinians have been killed by their brethren assuspected collaborators during the 21-month-old revolt againstIsraeli rule. The television said 84 died in the last three months.   The latest was Jibara Abu Taha, 35, of Khan Yunis in the GazaStrip, who was fatally stabbed and beaten Wednesday by maskedyouths, hospital offiicals and Arab reports said.   Troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in clashes throughout theseaside Gaza Strip, hospital officials said. The army was checkingthe reports.   At least 567 Palestinians have died in clashes with troops orIsraeli civilians during the uprising. Forty Israelis also have beenkilled.</TEXT></DOC>
