Despite their breakups, Simon called Garfunkel ``my oldest andbest friend'' more than once during his speech at the annualblack-tie dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.   While Simon and others celebrated, one inductee cried.   Hank Ballard, who wrote ``The Twist,'' said he felt alone inaccepting his award. He said his wife, who also served as hismanager, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in New York threemonths ago.   ``When she took me on four years ago, she swore she was going totake me back to the stars where I used to be,'' he said. ``It'stragic she's not here tonight with me.''   Besides Ballard, and Simon and Garfunkel, the acts inducted werethe Four Tops; the Who; Bobby Darin, who died in 1973, best knownfor ``Splish Splash'' and ``Mack the Knife''; the Four Seasons; theKinks; and the Platters.   One of the songwriting teams honored, Gerry Goffin and CaroleKing, created their first hit ``Will You Love Me Tomorrow?'' forthe Shirelles, and followed it with ``Up on the Roof,''``Loco-motion'' and ``Go Away Little Girl.''   Brothers Brian and Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier, a creativecornerstone of the Motown sound of the 1960s, were honored forwriting more than 70 Top 10 hits. Three of their 20 No. 1 hits were``(Reach Out) I'll Be There,'' ``You Keep Me Hangin' on'' and``Stop in the Name of Love.''   Three performers inducted for their early influences on rock 'n'roll were Louis Armstrong, Charlie Christian and Ma Rainey.   Armstrong, who died in 1971, was a trumpeter and singer, andconsidered by some the greatest jazz musician of all time.Christian, who died in 1942, was a jazz guitarist, the first toplay hornlike, single-string solos on electric guitar. Rainey, whodied in 1939, recorded nearly 100 blues songs after 1923 andtoured, popularizing the music.   Stevie Wonder, inducting the Four Tops, said: ``If we couldimagine ourselves as being the Four Tops and be able to cometogether with a sense of harmony and unity and make our own hits bydoing the right thing for 36 years, this country would truly bewritten in the sands of time forever.   ``Obie, Lawrence, Duke, Levi _ you truly are the sunshine of mylife.''   The irreverent Kinks wore tuxedos to be inducted.   ``Seeing everybody makes me realize rock 'n' roll has becomerespectable,'' Ray Davies said. ``What a bummer.''   Dodd Darin, only child of the late Bobby Darin, accepted theinduction of his father from Paul Anka.   ``He was very much into rock 'n' roll,'' Anka said of BobbyDarin. ``Because of him that form of music became much moreacceptable to the listening public.''   Groundbreaking for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Clevelandis planned for this year with a projected 1992 opening.   After the ceremony, about 60 musicians, including BruceSpringsteen, Roger Daltry and Peter Townshend of the Who, hopped upon stage for a jam session.   Those considered for induction had recordings released by theend of 1964. Some 200 performers, producers, writers, recordexecutives and broadcasters selected by the Rock and Roll Hall ofFame Foundation made the choices.</TEXT></DOC>
