(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, who blamed anFBI vendetta for his two years in prison, saw his politicalcomeback derailed Thursday as he ran a distant second for theDemocratic nomination to a congressional seat.   Blanton, accompanied by his tearful wife, Karen, addressed abouttwo dozen supporters in Jackson, Tenn. He said prison had made himsink into depression, but his campaign supporters had ``meant moreto me than you can imagine.''   ``Not since our forefathers signed the Declaration ofIndependence has someone that has been treated as I have, falselyaccused, imprisoned and written off not just as a politician or apublic servant but as a human being, has come back and said, `Look,I have something to offer' and had so many people embrace theidea,'' Blanton said.   ``I have been to the depths of depression when most people wouldhave said I give up,'' he said.   Blanton refused to say whether he would run for any otherpolitical office, and would not discuss any reason for his loss.   Blanton was one of four Democrats vying for the chance tosucceed retiring Rep. Ed Jones in the 8th District. Jones, a19-year House veteran, has backed state Rep. John Tanner to runagainst the winner of the three-way GOP primary.   With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, Tanner had 43,127 votes, or67 percent, of Democratic votes. Blanton had 6,809 or 11 percent.Jackson Mayor Robert Conger had 9,796 votes, or 15 percent; lawyerIvy Scarbrough had 5,051, or 8 percent.   In the Republican race, lawyer Ed Bryant of Jackson came frombehind to defeat Richard Jacobs, national chairman of the YoungRepublicans Federation, win the right to meet Tanner in November.   With 295 of 316 precincts reporting, Bryant polled 6,280 votes,or 57 percent to 3,839, or 35 percent, for Jacobs. Dan Campbell, aMemphis businessman, trailed with 810 votes or 7 percent.   For the Senate, incumbent Democrat James R. Sasser Jr., seekinghis third six-year term, had no primary opposition.   In the GOP's Senate primary, lawyer Bill Anderson, whoseKingsport law firm includes former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker as apartner, beat party activist Alice Algood and and lawyer HubertPatty for the chance to oppose Sasser in November.   With 2,223 of the state's 2,391 precincts reporting, Andersenhad 73 percent or 102,485 votes to 22 percent or 30,718 for Mrs.Algood.   ``I want to congratulate Mr. Andersen on a very energetic andsuccessful campaign and we are going to get our campaign in highgear,'' Sasser said Thursday night.   In the 2nd District, where Republican Rep. John J. Duncan diedJune 21, his son, John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville easily won thenomination for his late father's seat.   With all 190 precincts in the East Tennessee district reporting,Duncan had 32,813 votes, or 87 percent. Dr. Robert Proffitt had4,913 votes, or 13 percent.   Dudley Taylor, a former state revenue commissioner, led inDemocratic voting in the 2nd District.   With all 190 precincts, Taylor had 7,713 votes, or 41 percent,to 5,249 or 28 percent for Robert Scott, a chemical engineeringprofessor. Political unknown John Bowen, who conducted no campaign,had 5,639 votes or 30 percent.   U.S. Reps. Marilyn Lloyd of Chattanooga and Harold Ford ofMemphis won renomination as expected in Democratic primaries in the3rd and 9th districts, respectively.   With all 220 precincts reporting, Ms. Lloyd had 89 percent, or81,017 votes against newcomers Walter Ward, with 2,168 votes or 6percent, and Lamar Lasley, with 1,822 votes or 5 percent.

Ford has been indicted in federal court on bank fraud charges,but no trial date has been set. He said it has not affected hiscampaign.   In the 7th District primary contest, Democrat Lloyd Bloodworthdefeated Frances Tapp of Memphis for the right to challengeRepublican U.S. Rep. Don Sundquist in November.   With 279 of 327 precincts reporting, Bloodworth had 65 percentor 11,722 votes to 35 percent or 6,200 for Tapp.</TEXT><TEXT>   Blanton, also a former congressman, spent two years in federalprison after being convicted of conspiracy, extortion and mailfraud in a public corruption case. The mail fraud counts werevacated in line with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, and Blanton isappealing the extortion and conspiracy convictions.   The ex-governor, who left office in 1979 in a swirl ofcontroversy over the sale of pardons and liquor licenses, has saidthat he expects voters to realize that he was a victim of politicalpersecution in the FBI investigation.   ``They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said.   Five of the state's nine U.S. representatives had no primaryopposition. Two, Reps. Jim Cooper of the 4th District and BobClement of the 5th, also have no opponents in the Nov. 8 generalelection.   Others without primary opposition were Republican James Quillen,seeking his 13th two-year term from the 1st District; Democrat BartGordon of the 6th District; and Sundquis.   Democrat Sidney Smith, a retiree, was unopposed in his bid tochallenge Quillen. Chemical engineer Wallace Embry had no opponentsfor GOP nomination to take on Gordon. Hamilton County CommissionerHarold Coker faced no contest in getting the Republican nominationfor the 3rd District seat now held by Lloyd.</TEXT></DOC>
