Simulated acidrain was composed of major ion components: sulfate, nitrate and chloride,whose concentration ratio on the weight basis was 2:1:1 equivalent toan average of ambient rain samples in Japan. Frequency of rain eventwas twice a week during a growing season, duration of event was 1 hourand amount of precipitation in each event was 2.2 or 5.0 mm. When simulatedacid rain was below pH 3.0, visible symptoms such as small pale brownnecrotic spots were developed in the younger trifoliate leaves. However,any visible symptoms were not observed over pH 3.0 Tissue dry weight,trifoliate leaf area and dry seed yield were not significantly affectedby exposure of simulated acid rain over pH 3.0. Leaf areal growth, totaldry weight and dry seed yield of soybean plants exposed to simulatedacid rain at pH 2.0 during growing season, were significantly reduced.Yield reduction in one of the experiments was due to the decreased totalpod numbers per plant; that in the second experiment was due to decreasedseed mass per pod.</TEXT></DOC>
