Several types of catalysts consisting of coarse or ultrafine(andless;0.1 {mu}m) particles have been utilized in the present study. Usingprecipitated Fe catalysts, the liquid-phase FT synthesis was investigatedin a comparison with the gas-phase synthesis. In conclusion, it has beenproposed that Fe catalysts are inherently active to produce oxygenatesas primary products, however the accumulation of wax on the catalystsurface decreases the desorption of oxygenate products which are thusconverted to hydrocarbons in a later stage. In order to improve the gas-liquid-solidinterface contact, ultrafine particles (UFP) composed of Fe-Co-Ni, andpure Fe were applied. The catalytic activity of UFP was shown to be greaterthan that of the precipitated catalyst. The difference was interpretedas being caused by the different nature of surface structure betweenthese catalysts, with regards to whether they are porous or not. TheFe UFP catalyst which was promoted to higher levels of K than ordinaryFe catalysts showed extremely high catalytic activity at high temperatures(e.g. 300 degrees C). The carbon number distribution obtained was simulatedby a super-position of two Flory type distributions. 14 refs., 8 figs.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
