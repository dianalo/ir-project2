The next prime minister called on fellow Japanese to give hisscandal-plagued party a chance to ``carry out political reforms andshed our old skin.''   As expected, Kaifu, 58, was elected to head the LiberalDemocratic Party, defeating late challenges by Yoshiro Hayashi, aformer welfare minister, and Shintaro Ishihara, a novelist andformer transport minister.   A secret ballot by the conservative party's 404 members ofParliament and one delegate from each of the party's 47 statebranches resulted in 279 votes for Kaifu, 120 for Hayashi and 48for Ishihara, easily giving Kaifu the party presidency on the firstballot. There were four invalid ballots.   ``This is a crucial time for our party, so it will be a greatresponsibility,'' Kaifu, a former education minister with littlepersonal clout, told a news conference shortly after the vote.   As Japan's second new prime minister in two months, he will facethe challenge of fending off a surging opposition Socialist Partyand recovering the popularity the Liberal Democrats have lost in asuccession of scandals and a disliked tax policy.   ``I want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation basedon our deep self-reflection,'' he said, replying to a questionabout his plan to regain public trust.   He rejected the idea of holding elections immediately, as theopposition demands.   ``Through debate we hope to gain the people's understanding ofour policies'' before a general election, he said.   Kaifu will be elected Wednesday to succeed Uno on the strengthof his party's large majority in the lower house of Parliament. Healso will face the first test of the new political situation inJapan created by the party's loss of control in the upper house inthe July 23 elections.   It is likely that the upper house will refuse to confirm him asprime minister and vote instead for Socialist Party ChairwomanTakako Doi, but under the constitution the lower house chooses thehead of government, so the main effect will be to embarrass theLiberal Democrats.   Uno resigned to take responsibility for the July election loss,leaving the Liberal Democrats in their worst crisis since the partywas formed in 1955 and began enjoying uninterrupted rule.   The party's major figures were all ruled out of contention forthe premiership by involvement in the Recruit influence-buyingscandal. In June, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita stepped downbecause of links to the Recruit Co. conglomerate, but Takeshitahand-picked Uno as his successor.   Backing from Takeshita's faction was a key to Kaifu's successfulbid for party leadership.   Uno resigned last month amid allegations he kept paid mistresses.   One of Kaifu's first duties was a round of courtesy calls onfaction leaders whose opinions will count as Kaifu names a Cabinetand party leadership.   He said the party's reform plans try to tackle the problem ofthe high cost of politics, which results in part from the presentsystem of multi-seat constituencies where Liberal Democraticfactions finance candidates who run against each other.   To get away from the problem of huge corporate donations, hesaid politicians should seek money from a wide range of individualsinstead.   Large donations from Recruit angered the Japanese public andhelped send the Liberal Democrats' popularity skidding. Kaifu hasacknowledged that Recruit gave him about $110,000 over five years.The donations were legal, he said, but he regretted having receivedmoney from a company now accused of attempting to bribepoliticians, bureaucrats and business leaders.   Recruit, a publishing and information services conglomerate,sold stock at bargain prices to officials who turned around andsold the shares at a handsome profit.   Kaifu indicated he will try to persuade the public to accept adisliked 3 percent sales tax by earmarking the revenues for socialwelfare purposes.   On foreign affairs, an area where he has little experience,Kaifu pledged to maintain close security ties with the UnitedStates and said he would deal with problems in relations withWashington as they emerged.   ``But at the same time, Japan is also a part of Asia. We shoulddo whatever we can to cooperate in economic development'' withAsian nations, he said.   He also said Japan should work with Moscow to help PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's reform plans. Japan, because of a longtimeterritorial dispute with the Soviets, has had cool relations withMoscow.</TEXT></DOC>
