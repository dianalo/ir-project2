(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. advertisingagency pleaded guilty Friday to making improper payments to aJamaican businessman in its efforts to win the Jamaican governmenttourism account.   In a plea agreement, the government dropped racketeering andbribery charges against the New York-based agency and two of itsexecutives.   The company was fined $500,000 for conspiring to violate theForeign Corrupt Practices Act by paying $130,000 to Arnold FooteJr., while ``having reason to know'' that Foote might offer bribesto Eric Anthony Abrahams, the former minister of tourism inJamaica, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy.   The company had faced fines of up to $7.5 million on the briberyand racketeering charges.   U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey also placed the company onprobation for two years and said he would consider ordering theagency to perform community service.   Young andamp; Rubicam said Friday that ``some of its employees did onoccasions hear reports of alleged bribery efforts,'' but that thecompany still has no reason to believe that Foote ever bribedAbrahams.   Further, the company said, the government now agrees that Youngandamp; Rubicam won the Jamaica account fairly.   The agency pointed out that the ``reason to know'' section ofthe Corrupt Practices Act was considered controversial and wasremoved by Congress in 1988.   ``Ironically, if the case were brought today, there would havebeen no such charge,'' the company said.   The government alleged in an indictment last year that Young andamp;Rubicam made the payments of $900,000 to win and retain thelucrative Jamaican tourism account, for which it produced theaward-winning ``Come Back to Jamaica'' campaign in the early 1980s.   In the indictment, the government characterized Foote as anadviser to Abrahams and thus a public official as defined under theCorrupt Practices Act.   Until Friday, the agency denied any wrongdoing, maintaining ithired Foote to help with the account and that he was not a publicofficial.   Federal prosecutors, citing ``exculpatory evidence recentlyturned over to the government,'' dropped charges against two Youngandamp; Rubicam executives who faced racketeering charges: Executive VicePresident Arthur R. Klein and former account supervisor ThomasSpangenberg.   A third Young andamp; Rubicam employee, Steven M. McKenna, facesfederal perjury charges. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 26.   Foote and Abrahams have also been charged, but they remain inJamaica. Twardy said he has been advised by the Justice Departmentthat he cannot extradite Foote and Abrahams on racketeering chargesunder current Jamaican law.   The settlement came the day after jury selection began infederal court in the trial of the agency.</TEXT></DOC>
