Citing unidentified sources, KUNA said Tuesday that the GCCsecretariat is consulting with the oil ministers of the six nationsto finalize an exact date for the meeting at the organization'sheadquarters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.   The GCC is comprised of four members of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ Saudi Arabia,Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ along with Bahrain andOman.   The sources said the ministers were keen to find a way to driveoil prices up to the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel. A barrel isequivalent to 42 gallons.   KUNA's sources said the GCC ministers were expected to appeal tothe OPEC member states to adhere until the end of the year to theindividual production quotas to absorb the surplus on the worldmarket and thereby bolster oil prices.   Oil prices have been running about $3 a barrel below the OPECbenchmark.   The sources expect the GCC ministers to warn OPEC that furtherincreases in oil production ``could push oil prices to furtherdeterioration if the member states do not adhere to the officialdecisions agreed upon.''   The GCC meeting will await the outcome of the meeting of OPEC'sfive-member price-monitoring committee this week, KUNA said. Thecommittee, comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,Venezuela, Algeria, Indonesia and Nigeria, is scheduled to begintalks Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.   The price-monitoring committee is meeting against the backgroundof a possible end to the 8-year-old war between Iraq and Iran, bothmembers of OPEC.   The conflict had been casting shadows on the cartel, with Iraqcurrently producing almost double its assigned oil quota andinsisting on having the same quota as Iran. The Iranians have beenwidely accused of discounting oil because of the costs of the war.</TEXT></DOC>
