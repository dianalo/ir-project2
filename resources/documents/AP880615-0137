Carlucci said todayhe intends to require Pentagon contractors to provide ``a drug-freeworkplace'' for their 3.2 million employees.   The contractors would have to develop extensive anti-drugprograms, including mandatory testing of employees with securityclearances, Carlucci told the Senate and House Armed Servicescommittees.   Carlucci's announcement came as he said he is opposed to a pairof House and Senate bills providing extensive new involvement ofthe military in the fight against illegal drug shipments into theUnited States.   The hundreds of defense contractors would have to educate theirworkers about the dangers of drugs and would also have to test fordrug usage, Carlucci told the two panels.   An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts havesecurity clearances and thus would be subject to the testingprogram.   Carlucci said ``it would be my intent to issue'' the regulationrequiring the anti-drug effort, but did not say when that orderwould be made.   The two panels are working on a compromise version of a Pentagonbudget bill and some of the key proposals involve the military'srole in the anti-drug fight.   The House overwhelmingly approved a proposal essentiallyrequiring President Reagan to have the military seal the U.S.borders against drug smugglers, while the Senate easily passed ameasure giving the military new powers, including the authority toarrest drug smugglers in international waters.   ``None of the interdiction approaches, in and of themselves,will work,'' Carlucci said. ``I believe that these are notsolutions to the problem, but rather the result of our risingfrustration at our inability to find a real solution.''   ``I remain absolutely opposed to the assignment of a lawenforcement mission to the Department of Defense,'' Carlucci said.``I am even more firmly opposed to any relaxation of the possecomitatus restrictions on the use of the military to search, seizeand arrest.''   ``I have discussed this matter with the president and othersenior members of his Cabinet and I can report that these views areshared throughout this administration,'' he said.   Carlucci was referring to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 lawthat bars the military from enforcing civilian laws. Congressamended the law in 1981 to permit the military to take a limitedrole in the anti-drug effort, but the current proposals wouldprovide new exemptions to the law.   ``Our armed forces should not become a police force, nor can weafford to degrade readiness by diverting badly needed resourcesfrom their assigned missions,'' Carlucci said.   ``The military is trained and equipped to shoot everything whichcomes over the hill,'' he said in answer to a question. ``They'renot trained and equipped to distinguish the good guys from the badguys. ... they are trained and equipped with weapons of massdestruction.''</TEXT></DOC>
