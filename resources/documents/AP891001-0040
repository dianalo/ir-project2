As the weeklong conference opened in Brighton, public opinionpolls published Sunday showed Labor in its strongest position sinceit lost power to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservativesin 1979.   ``The electorate now regards the Labor Party as electable, whichit did not in 1983 or 1987,'' said Gerald Kaufman, the party'sforeign affairs spokesman, referring to Labor's last two generalelection defeats.   The policy overhaul, endorsed last spring by the party's28-member national executive committee, is virtually assured ofbeing adopted during a series of debates beginning Monday becauseof committed support from leaders of major trade unions.   Trade union bosses have the biggest say at Labor's policy-makingconferences under a controversial system that gives them huge blockvotes based on the number of union members.   Already the proposed new platform, which the Conservativesdismiss as a cosmetic exercise by an avowedly leftist party, hashelped transform Labor's fortunes.   In June, Labor trounced the Conservatives in elections for theEuropean Parliament, and has since led by 3 to 12 percentage pointsin every national opinion poll.   Five polls commissioned by Sunday newspapers put Labor betweenfive and 12 points ahead. They ranged from Market and OpinionResearch International in the pro-Tory Sunday Times of London,which put Labor at 43 percent of the vote and the Conservatives at38 percent, to Labor's 46 percent vs. the Conservatives' 34 percentin a National Opinion Poll sampling for another Tory supporter, TheMail on Sunday.   None of the three other national parties, two squabblingcentrist parties and the environmentalist Green Party, got morethan 10 percent.   The National Opinion Poll polled 989 voters on Sept. 25; Marketand Opinion Research questioned 1,739 between Sept. 21 and 26.Neither newspaper provided the margin of error.   A key point for Labor leader Neil Kinnock is that polls showsupport consistently topping 40 percent, a share that underBritain's electoral system is usually sufficient to give a party anoutright majority in the 650-member House of Commons.   After a decade of humiliation, Labor also has been boosted by asense among many voters that Thatcherism has gone too far, and bythe collapse of the center parties, which in 1983 and 1987 splitthe anti-Conservative vote.   But Labor's task remains daunting.   Mrs. Thatcher, who does not have to call an election until 1992,won last time with a huge 102-seat majority.   To regain outright power, Labor would need to win 97 new seats,including some Conservative strongholds in Britain's prosperoussouth, and achieve the biggest swing against a British governmentsince World War II.   Polls, which put Labor well ahead on issues such as health,education and welfare, also show many voters doubtful about thesocialists' ability to manage the economy.   The proposed new policy package, the result of a two-year reviewKinnock ordered after the 1987 election, has dismayed the party'svocal left wing.   It stipulates that a Labor-led government would give upBritain's nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal.   This overturns Labor's pledge, adopted in 1981 as the partylurched left after losing power, to scrap Britain'ssubmarine-launched missiles and shut down U.S. nuclear bases withinfive years of coming to power.   For Kinnock, 47, once an ardent supporter of unilateral nucleardisarmament, it represents a major personal shift after twoelectoral defeats.   Other proposed changes include dropping commitments torenationalize most of the state-owned industries sold off by Mrs.Thatcher, and retaining some of her curbs on labor unions.</TEXT></DOC>
