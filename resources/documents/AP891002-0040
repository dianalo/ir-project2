(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker didn't do his casemuch good when he repeatedly testified that he didn't rememberdetails of his ministry's finances, his lawyer says.   ``That was a pretty heavy cross-examination,'' defense attorneyGeorge Davis said of Bakker's appearance on the stand last week.``It was very damaging, very devastating.''   The 82-year-old defense lawyer added: ``It didn't have anythingto do with the issues, but ...''   Bakker, who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy,was scheduled to return to the stand today for morecross-examination.   The U.S. District Court jury could get the case by the end ofthe week.   He is accused of diverting most of the $158 million in donationshe raised to build lodging at his religious retreat and theme park,and using some of the funds to support a lavish life for himselfand his wife, Tammy.   In last week's testimony, Bakker denied defrauding anyone,repeatedly saying he had worked hard to keep the PTL dream alive.Yet he often appeared to be off-guard, particularly as prosecutorsdelved into details of PTL's offers to provide free lodging at hisHeritage U.S.A. theme park in exchange for contributions.   Under three hours of cross-examination, Bakker answered ``Idon't remember'' or its equivalent more than three dozen times.   In several instances, Bakker said he had told viewers on histelevision shows that some changes would be made in the lodgingprograms at issue in the case. But he was unable to say when he hadmade the announcements, despite having access to the samevideotapes as prosecutors.   ``There are so many dates,'' Bakker, laughing, said at one point.   In his initial testimony, Bakker told jurors that when he leftPTL in March 1987, he had built, was building or had plans foraccommodations for more than 211,000 so-called lifetime partners _the name given followers who gave $1,000 or more in return forpromises of three nights lodging each year for life.   More than 150,000 lifetime partnerships were sold betweenJanuary 1984 and May 1987, including 66,000 in the Heritage GrandHotel, where Bakker had said only 25,000 would be sold, and 74,000in the still-unfinished Towers hotel, where Bakker had said only30,000 would be sold.   Bakker attempted to show jurors a chart of the various hotels,lodges, bunkhouses, chalets and campsites he said could haveaccommodated the 211,000 partners. But prosecutors objected thatthe chart contained information that was not in evidence and wasmisleading.   Later, Bakker flatly accused former employees of either lying ormaking errors in saying he had ordered diversions of money and thedestruction of corporate records.   Even documented evidence met resistance from Bakker.   When prosecutors tried to use PTL records to show Bakker hadreopened partnerships after they had been overbooked, Bakker saidhe did not recall doing that. He also denied signing severalletters and memos, except for two on which the FBI had found hispalm print.   Shown a 1986 memo ordering bonuses to two PTL employees, Bakkersaid, ``That's what it said,'' but added, ``I did not do this.''</TEXT></DOC>
