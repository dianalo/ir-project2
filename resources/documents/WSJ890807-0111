A Victoria, Texas, physician was fined $20,000 by an administrative law judge of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. The judge found the obstetrician-gynecologist illegally ordered an ill, pregnant woman transferred to a charity hospital 170 miles away without treating her. The woman gave birth en route to a healthy child.    This is the first case testing the government's power to punish doctors under a 1986 federal law designed to keep hospitals from turning away charity patients. The law requires hospitals to treat emergency patients and women in active labor, regardless of their ability to pay. The American and Texas medical associations are helping finance the Victoria doctor's defense, hoping it will help define limits on the government's authority to second-guess physician decisions.    The administrative law judge upheld almost all of the government's claims, rejecting the physician's arguments that the patient wasn't in active labor and that a transfer to a larger, better-equipped hospital was in her best interests. The administrative judge concluded, among other things, that the doctor let his fear of a malpractice suit cloud his judgment. The doctor is expected to appeal.    &quot;The opinion is very disappointing,&quot; said Donald P. Wilcox, general counsel of the Texas Medical Association. &quot;It reads like we didn't even have a hearing.&quot;    ---   RUDOLPH GIULIANI figures he should take credit where credit is due.    So the New York City mayoral candidate and former U.S. attorney was quick with a press release last week, after six securities-firm officials were convicted in the case involving unlawful trading by Princeton/Newport L.P. The jury held that the defendants must forfeit $3.8 million of assets.    &quot;As U.S. attorney, I supervised the case which led to the indictment,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said in his statement. Then, making an election promise, he added, &quot;As mayor, I would work to strengthen the forfeiture laws so that criminals foot the bill for their own arrests and imprisonment.&quot;    But with asset forfeiture in the domain of the state and federal governments, not the city, would Mr. Giuliani have any control over the issue? &quot;He's really referring there to the drug-forfeiture laws,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;As mayor, he would push for a bill in Albany {the state capital} to make it easier for police departments to seize the assets of drug dealers.&quot;    Earlier, Mr. Giuliani irked some of his supporters by saying he wouldn't play a role in abortion-rights battles because abortion is an issue for state, not city, government. Since then, Mr. Giuliani has clarified his stand, saying that while he personally opposes abortion, he is against efforts to make abortion illegal.    Why would the state's jurisdiction keep Mr. Giuliani from the abortion battle but not the forfeiture-law battle? &quot;The two are apples and oranges,&quot; the spokesman said.    ---   STATE JUDGE OFFERS two opposing opinions for the price of one.    Legal scholars are buzzing about a 5-4 libel decision handed down in May, in which Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Phillips penned both the majority opinion and one of four dissents.    The majority concluded that, to defeat pretrial summary judgment, Texas law required libel plaintiffs to present evidence that defendants knew their allegations were false and acted with reckless disregard for the truth.    Because the court imposed a new burden on the plaintiff, Judge Phillips argued in his dissent that the plaintiff in question, Othal Brand, the mayor of McAllen, Texas, deserved a second shot so he could present his proof.    Arguing both sides of an issue is something every law school student learns. But, as a matter of custom -- and logic -- judges don't write the majority opinion and the dissent in the same case. The preferred method is to concur in part and to dissent in part.    &quot;Normally, the majority opinion would be written by someone who agreed with the entire opinion,&quot; said Mayor Brand's attorney, Donald Allee, a solo practitioner in McAllen.    But Mr. Allee isn't complaining. The substance of Judge Phillips's dissent provides the attorney with one of three arguments in his motion for rehearing.    ---   COLLECTING MONEY OWED to the defunct national law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey is growing more costly. According to a recent fee application submitted by the court-appointed trustee, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, the trustee rang up $4 million in legal fees for 34,000 hours of work in the six months through June 30. Trustee Francis H. Musselman, a partner at Milbank Tweed, said the firm is seeking bankruptcy court approval for about $3 million of fee payments. Mr. Musselman so far has recovered $34.1 million in assets that Finley Kumble is owed. This falls far short of Mr. Musselman's goal of collecting $65 million to $70 million of the $110 million owed. Mr. Musselman said he has been stymied by the need to reconstruct incomplete billing records and by former Finley Kumble partners who took clients to new law firms and now want to write off the old bills as a favor. &quot;Obviously, I'm not going to spend a dollar to collect $1.10 or 90 cents,&quot; Mr. Musselman said. &quot;But by definition, bankruptcy is expensive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
