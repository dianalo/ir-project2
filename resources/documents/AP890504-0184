Many fear the dispute pitting northern Wisconsin resort ownersand sportsmen against the Indians, who have federal court approvalto begin spear fishing before fishing season opens, will turnviolent.   Kasten and three of the state's congressmen said they wereworking with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson to restart stallednegotiations between the Chippewas and the state.   ``A large part of what we are trying to do is get both partiesback to the negotiating table,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``Theissue is whether everyone can get along.''   Obey said he called every tribe in his district to tell themabout the legislation and ask them to cease spearing. He said thetribes are spearing more fish than they need to feed their familiesand should be willing to share with hook-and-line sportsmen.   Kasten said he was concerned about possible confrontationsbetween the Indians and fishermen who say the Chippewas are robbingthe lakes of trophy size fish.   The dispute stems from a federal court decision two years agothat the Chippewas, under treaties negotiated in 1837 and 1842,were guaranteed fishing rights in the territories they gave up tothe government.   ``When the treaties were signed, Wisconsin was a wilderness,''said Obey. ``The court opinion that caused the problem was offbase.''   He and the others conceded that their proposed legislation maybe difficult to push through Congress.   The bill limits the Chippewa tribes' share of the fish from anyWisconsin lake to 10 percent of the safe harvest level, which meansthe tribes would be limited primarily to ceremonial spearing, saidthe congressmen.   The legislation would allow the Indians to go to court to seekcompensation for the amount of fish they would no longer be allowedto spear. State and federal governments would pay the costs.</TEXT></DOC>
