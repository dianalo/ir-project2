After performing inversely to stocks in the wake of the Oct. 19 crash, the huge rally in the Treasury bond market continued to run out of steam yesterday as stocks remained depressed. Prices of actively traded 30-year bonds fell about 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;We've got a (bond) market that is completely twisted,&quot; said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. &quot;Unless something is done about reducing the (U.S.) trade deficit, both the stock and bond markets will deteriorate.&quot; The deficit &quot;is a fundamental cancer.&quot;    While the dollar's plunge against the Japanese yen and West German mark sparked the initial price declines of no more than 1/2 point for government securities, their losses widened late in the day after the Treasury said it will sell $23.75 billion of new securities at its quarterly refunding next week. The financing includes $9.75 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday, $9.25 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $4.75 billion of long-term bonds with a previously issued coupon for 30 years next Thursday.    Many traders had speculated that the Treasury would avoid selling long-term bonds rather than issue such a relatively small amount. The lack of a long-term issue was perceived as a prop for the bond market, traders said.    Until yesterday, the makeup of the refunding was unclear because Congress hasn't passed legislation to increase the current $250 billion ceiling on issuance of Treasury bonds with interest rates higher than 4.25%.    &quot;I think we could now see some further price erosion,&quot; in the bond market &quot;particularly with a lower dollar,&quot; said Joseph Petri, president and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. &quot;The interest in this market has faded&quot; even as investor fear of an economic slowdown persists.    The bond market's setback continued yesterday despite signs that the Fed is determined to prevent interest rates from rising, according to many economists. The rate on federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other overnight and a closely watched barometer of the Fed's credit stance, dropped to 6.78% from 7.14% Tuesday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). Only two weeks ago, federal funds were trading as high as 7 1/2%.    &quot;The funds rate has come down quite sharply, clearly because the Fed is being very accommodative,&quot; said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank North America. &quot;Bond yields could still fall some more because the monetary accommodation will remain in force longer than perhaps expected,&quot; said Mr. Fabbri of Thomson McKinnon.    Other short-term interest rates also fell yesterday. The rate on the Treasury's new 13-week bills eased to 5.05% bid from 5.25% bid Tuesday and the 5.12% average annual rate at Monday's auction. The rate on the Treasury's new 26-week bills tumbled to 5.86% bid from 6.02% bid Tuesday and the 5.98% average annual rate ot Monday's auction. Rates on three-month and six-month bank certificates of deposit were little changed.    Although many analysts expect the stock market crash to prompt a sharp reduction in consumer spending and anemic economic growth during the current quarter and through the first two quarters next year, they don't expect 30-year bond yields to fall back to the lows of this year, about 7.40%.    &quot;The U.S. trade deficit isn't going to turn around anytime soon and that means the difference between U.S. and foreign interest will have to remain high,&quot; said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.    Yields on 30-year bonds &quot;could fall to about 8 1/2% later this year, but they won't drop below 8%. Clearly the economy has a lot of forward momentum,&quot; Mr. Moran added. &quot;Investment spending by corporations was up about 23% in the third quarter from the previous quarter and there were plenty of good reasons for&quot; the credit markets &quot;to be worried about inflation&quot; before the stock market sell-off.    Nevertheless, the bond market has received a strong boost from fears of possible defaults of securities firms stemming from the stock market collapse. That's because corporations and other big investors in the so-called repurchase agreement market have refrained from lending their own bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods. That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities, or amassing so-called short positions.    &quot;At the moment, you just can't borrow securities,&quot; said Mr. Fabbri of Thomson McKinnon. &quot;That's had the effect of keeping prices higher than they otherwise might be with such a sharp decline in the dollar.&quot;    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 97 1/4 from 98 Tuesday, as the yield rose to 9.14% from 9.07%. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 7.37 points to 1232.90. The index ranged between 1229.11 and 1241.75.    The Treasury's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to a price of 97 5/8 from 98 as the yield climbed to 8.99% from 8.93%.    In the corporate new-issue market, &quot;we are encouraging anyone who needs funds to get them now because&quot; yields on 30-year Treasurys &quot;can move anywhere between 8 1/2% and 9 1/2%,&quot; said Roger Elsas, a senior vice president in charge of corporate bond syndication at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Yesterday, underwriters led by Shearson Lehman sold $150 million of Burlington Northern Railroad Co. consolidated mortgage bonds due November 1997. The 10% bonds were priced at 99.35 to yield 10.10%, or 1.15 percentage points more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard and Poor's Corp. The railroad company is a unit of Burlington Northern Inc., a Seattle-based transportation and natural-resources concern.    Separately, IBM Credit Corp., a financing unit of International Business Machines Corp., sold $300 million of notes due November 1990. Underwriters led by First Boston Corp. priced the 8 3/8% notes at 99 3/4 to yield 8.47%, or 0.47 percentage point more than the Treasury's three-year note. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
