Traders shrugged off government reports showing a strong 1.7% increase in consumer spending and a 0.9% rise in personal income last month. The reaction to those reports &quot;was about the same as the reaction to all the other news that's come out recently -- pretty much of a yawn,&quot; said Alfred G. Roth, a managing director at Chemical Bank's capital markets group.    Once again, Treasury bond prices hovered in a very narrow range. The government's latest 30-year issue inched higher early in the day but later fell back, winding up close to where it ended Wednesday. &quot;The Treasury market has lacked direction for several weeks because the economic news has been so confusing,&quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Municipal bond prices fell while corporate bonds drifted slightly lower. Most of the attention was focused on several large new issues. For example, large issues by Union Carbide Corp., GTE Corp. and Mead Corp. dominated the corporate market, while in the municipal market, Texas and Massachusetts offered large new debt issues.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds declined 0.51 point to close at 1427.64. The high level for the day was 1431.64, while the low was 1426.18.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 slipped to 99 27/32 from 99 29/32 Wednesday, leaving the yield unchanged at about 7.51%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 100 9/32 from 100 12/32, while the yield rose to 7.21% from 7.18%.    The federal funds rate rose slightly. It averaged 6.07% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. On Wednesday, it averaged 5.97%.    The rate on the Treasury's latest three-month bills fell slightly to 5.50% bid from 5.52% Wednesday. But the rate on the Treasury's latest six-month bills rose to 5.51% from 5.48%.    The Federal Reserve yesterday reported that the nation's basic money supply, known as M1, rose $500 million in the week ended March 9. That was a much smaller increase than many analysts had expected, but bond traders ignored it anyway because the Fed appears to be paying little or no attention to M1. Fed officials have indicated that they feel the M1 measure has lost its reliability as an indicator of economic and inflation trends.    The Fed estimated that the M1 measure rose to a seasonally adjusted average of $738.7 billion from $738.2 billion the previous week. The M1 measure consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public. During the latest 13 weeks, M1 has averaged $736.2 billion, which represents a sizzling 17.7% growth rate over the like period 13 weeks earlier.    In the corporate sector, a $350 million issue of Union Carbide senior subordinated notes due in seven years was offered to investors. The 9 3/4% notes were priced at 99.24 to yield 9.90%, according to First Boston Corp., the sole underwriter. The issue is rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, GTE offered a $250 million issue of 8 1/2% debentures due in 30 years. The issue was priced after auction at 97.50 to yield 8.737%, according to UBS Securities Inc. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    Underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. offered $150 million of Mead sinking fund debentures due in 30 years. The 9% debentures were priced at par. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    Among the biggest issues in the municipal bond market yesterday were:    --$150 million of general obligation bonds by Massachusetts. The bonds were priced after auction to yield from 3.75% on bonds due 1988 to 6.50% on bonds due 2006 and 2007. Salomon Brothers Inc. was the lead underwriter.
