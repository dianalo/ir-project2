Democratic Sen. Brock Adams said the provision, which heauthored, has been approved by House and Senate negotiators tryingto iron out final details of the trade bill.   ``This amendment is designed to stop the internationalconsortium supporting Airbus Industrie from using unfair tradingpractices in the United States,'' Adams said.   Airbus, a consortium of aerospace companies in France, WestGermany, Britain, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, is theworld's second-largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes withabout 35 percent of the market.   U.S. rival Boeing Co., based in Seattle, has between 55 percentand 60 percent of the market.   Adams said his amendment would expand coverage of existing``countervailing duty laws'' to include countries such as thosesupporting Airbus.   At present, Adams said, U.S. companies can seek relief fromunfair trading practices when their competition is subsidized byjust one country, but not when the subsidies are coming from aconsortium of foreign countries.   ``Boeing can sucessfully compete with Airbus, but not if Airbusis not playing by the rules and getting huge subsidies from foreigngovernments,'' Adams said.   Airbus officials have consistently denied that the company wasreceiving government subsidies or engaged in unfair tradingpractices.   The countervailing duty laws allow domestic manufacturers to askthe U.S. government to impose a duty equal to the amount of foreignsubsidy for a product.   ``Adoption of the amendment will help ensure a fair arena forcompetition between Boeing and Airbus,'' Adams said.   ``The adoption of this important amendment by Congress alsodemonstrates once more for European governments the seriousnesswith which their subsidies are viewed by the United States,'' saidL.W. Clarkson, a senior vice president of Boeing.</TEXT></DOC>
