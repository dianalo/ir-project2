He said the latest round of attacks by the FMLN rebels caused 16civilian deaths and 108 civilian casualties. The attacks on coffeeand cotton farms, public transport, banks and other civilianproperty have put many poor Salvadorans out of work.   ``These targets have no conceivable military value,'' Bouchersaid. ``As the government has made more concessions at thebargaining table, the FMLN has stepped up violence andmilitarism.''</TEXT></DOC>
