The program, which has been likened by congressional proponentsto the 1947 Marshall Plan that rescued West Europe after World WarII, could lead to an international appeal for $10 billion over thenext five years, said the official, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   President Reagan also plans to send a high-level specialemissary to the Philippines to dramatize his concern aboutconditions in that nation, The Washington Post reported in itsSunday editions.   The newspaper said the emissary, perhaps accompanied by seniormembers of Congress, would be sent to Manila to deliver a signal oftop-level support and to consult with Aquino and her government ondetails of the program.   An American with international standing also may be picked tocoordinate the program, according to the Post. The newspaper quotedsources as saying neither the special emissary nor the coordinatorhas been chosen.   The major elements of the program, the Post said, are U.S.grants beginning in fiscal 1990, loans for development purposes,debt relief in the form of reductions in scheduled payments anddebt-equity swaps, trade preferences to encourage Philippineexports and investments from international financial institutionsand private business.   The Post, citing unidentified sources, said $10 billion in newaid over a five-year period has been discussed as the workingtarget within the administration and Congress.   Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage in March saidJapan, South Korea, Australia and possibly the major Europeanallies would be asked to help finance the plan. He said Secretaryof State George P. Shultz had met with congressional members todiscuss the plan but that no total sum or concrete initiativeemerged.   Last November, four lawmakers proposed that the United Statescreate a Marshall Plan for the Philippines to assist the nation inovercoming its severe economic problems.   The proposal to Reagan from Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., andRichard Lugar, R-Ind., and Reps. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and JackKemp, R-N.Y., was for worldwide assistance to the Philippines of $1billion yearly for five years over the amounts already being spent.   U.S. assistance to the Philippines is about $400 million a yearcurrently, of which $180 million is paid for Clark Air Base and theSubic Bay Navy Base, the two largest American military basesoutside the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
