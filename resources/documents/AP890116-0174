MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new president with an old problem, GeorgeBush knows of no swift stroke that would free the American hostagesin Lebanon _ but he also knows that a signal to Iran could help.   So the president-elect says he can visualize a day of better U.S.relations with Iran, a statement which in itself is a gesture hehopes could help produce ``keys to unlock the locks.'' Meanwhile, hepromises to pursue any path that might point toward freedom for thehostages.   Eight years after the Tehran embassy hostages were freed onPresident Reagan's inauguration day, Bush comes to the White Housewith nine Americans held captive by Lebanese kidnappers.   Their plight had not produced the air of crisis that persistedwhile 52 Americans were held in the embassy for 444 days, until thehour Reagan took office.   With smaller numbers and no identifiable villains to blame, letalone televise nightly, the case of the Lebanon hostages is anagging headache that won't go away.   Reagan did not mention the hostages in his farewell address. Athis last news conference he said the United States eventually mustnegotiate with Iran, ``because they have control of these people.''   Bush isn't so certain that Iran fully controls the situation.   ``... My view is be alert to opportunity,'' he said in aninterview. ``I think the cease fire between Iran and Iraq haspotential for amelioration of that hostage situation, but I think itwould be improper to assume that Iran controls a key to all thesehostages. I don't think we know that.''   Nevertheless, the president-elect believes improved U.S.relations with Iran could help. ``I'm one who thinks it's in ourinterest to have better relations with Iran. And I'm one who thinksthat Iran can take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they wantbetter relations with the United States.   ``And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keysto unlock the locks, that could be helpful,'' he said.   He emphasized his message to Tehran: ``They'll read this. Theyknow me ... I know their views ... I don't start off with the viewthat we always have to be at loggerheads with Iran.   ``I also don't start off with the naive view that if you havesome dramatic meeting, that's going to result in the instant releaseof hostages who are not held by Iran. . . may be held by clients ofIran.''   Meanwhile, he promised, the new administration will seek a wayout. ``We are not going to leave any rabbit trail unexplored.''   The hostage-takers in Lebanon do not directly reflect agovernment but, instead, shadowy groups of Shi'ite Moslem extremistsoperating in the turmoil of Beirut. Still, they are responsive tothe will of Iran. Three captive Americans were freed while theReagan administration was sending secret arms shipments to Iran in1985 and 1986.   Longest held of the captive Americans is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped onMarch 16, 1985 _ two months after President Reagan began the term ofoffice that ends on Friday. In addition to the nine Americans, atleast seven citizens of other nations are held hostage.   The Iranian hostage crisis was an issue in the presidentialcampaign of 1980, working to Reagan's advantage in the election thatousted Jimmy Carter. But the dilemma of freeing them never becamehis; they were released just as he took office. The kidnappings inLebanon recreated the problem in a different form, and led to theworst internal crisis of the Reagan years, the Iran-Contra scandals.   The Reagan administration found no solution, despite thepresident's early vow that ``our policy will be swift and effectiveretribution'' against hostage-takers. There was no way to makeretaliation work in Lebanon.   Since disclosure of the Iran arms-for-hostages shipments, theadministration has played down the hostage situation it could notresolve.   Bush insisted there was no decision to lower visibility and pushthe hostages down the administration agenda because of that episode.He said that wasn't a matter of policy.   But it certainly was a matter of fact.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
