(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most alligator hunters were disappointedafter the first day of Florida's month-long gator season, but byFriday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet.   Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legalalligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky _ or not-so-lucky _ 230people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses,crossbows and almost anything but a gun.   The first night of the 30-day hunt netted about 130 alligatorsin 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to theFlorida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. Thirty-eight werebagged in the Everglades, while 36 were taken in the LakeOkeechobee area, a spokesman said.   Two novice hunters, David and Jerry Navin, snaked through a DadeCounty canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyesthat give away the swimming reptiles, but the gators refused tocooperate.   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they'resupposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougherthan we thought.''   His brother Jerry called their experience ``on-the-jobtraining.''   To the north on Lake Okeechobee, one of the designated huntingareas, some gator pursuers reported better luck.   Thomas Alpern, 25, of Brooklyn, N.Y., the only northernerreceiving a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worryingbeforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when hecaptured it.   With gator hides selling for $42 a foot and meat running up to$6 a pound, Alpern and others persevered, though few expected tobag their 15-gator limit the first night.   Hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total $300 to$500.   ``We're having fun,'' said Bud Wolfe, an alligator hunter fromOakland Park. ``Where else but in Africa can you go after a500-pound animal that can kill you?''   Early success came to Carlos Donate of Miami and his guide, JayMedore of Clewiston. They snagged a 8-foot-3-inch animal only 80minutes after they started hunting on Lake Okeechobee.   Once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat, theyshot it with a ``bang stick,'' a firearm-like gadget that isallowed under the game commission rules.   ``We blew one hell of a hole in his head,'' Donate said. ``Itwas exciting.''   He then taped the gator's mouth shut.   ``It's scary putting that tape on his mouth, even with a hole inhis head,'' he said.   Doug Mackie and Steve Prater, who work for the city of PembrokePines' utilities department, bagged a 6-foot alligator and anotherthat was 8 feet or longer.   Prater showed how he hooked one just beside the alligator's leftrear leg with a large hook on a heavy-duty saltwater fishing rod.He said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult,and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod.   ``It was a deep-sea rod and it just plain snapped in two,'' hemarveled.   Alligator hunting was outlawed in Florida in 1962 becausewildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptilesmight threaten the survival of the alligator.   A small alligator industry has built up in recent years becausealligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urbanareas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets.   Estimates place the current number of alligators living inFlorida at 1 million, and game commission officials said they arenow far from an ``endangered'' species.</TEXT></DOC>
