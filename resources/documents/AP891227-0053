Also today, Western diplomats in Islamabad said the latestreports indicate the Communist government, which the Red Army leftbehind in Afghanistan in February, has arrested more than 200people in a recent coup plot.   Tens of thousands of Afghan guerrillas and their supportersburned effigies and listened to impassioned speeches at refugeecamps around the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, where severalU.S.-backed rebel groups are based.   They vowed to keep fighting for the downfall of President Najiband pledged to replace his Marxist administration with aguerrilla-run, Moslem government.   About 100,000 Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan inDecember 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another.They stayed on to help fight the insurgency that began when theAfghan Communists seized power in 1978.   Soviet forces fought the guerrillas for nine years beforecompleting a phased withdrawal Feb. 15. The Kremlin continuesmassive military supplies to the Kabul government. The Moslemrebels are supported by the United States.   The Communists still hold Afghanistan's major cities, but theguerrillas control most of the countryside.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the hard-line Hezb-i-Islamiguerrilla group, told a crowd of supporters at the Hyatabad refugeecamp near Peshawar today that his party would never enter acoalition with the Communists.   ``We believe that only the cessation of delivery of arms to thecrumbling Kabul regime will seal the fall of this disgustingregime,'' Hekmatyar said.   He also has accused the United States of interfering with hisaims.   Western diplomats in Islamabad, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistanhas arrested more than 200 people in the latest outbreak offactional infighting in Kabul.   Officials in Kabul reported only the arrest of about 100clandestine Hekmatyar supporters earlier this month. However,Western diplomats allege that it was a coup plot among members ofthe Afghan army.   In recent years, the governing ``Parcham'' wing of Najib's partyhas survived several conspiracies by the ``Khlaq'' faction, whichis dominated by the military.   An estimated 2 million Afghans have fled the civil war toneighboring Pakistan and 1 million went to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
