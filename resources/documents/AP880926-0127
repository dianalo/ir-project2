The Lebanese Shiite Moslem is chargedin the June 1985 hijacking in which Robert Stethem, 23, was killedand 39 Americans held hostage for 17 days.   Suggs testified that said Stethem was alive when the hijackersthrew the mortally wounded man on the runway at Beirut airport in1985.   ``I could hear him moaning,'' Suggs said. ``I fixed my mind onhim. I tried to hear everything I could because I was blindfoldedand couldn't see.''   The court indictment states that Stethem died of his wounds ashort time after being thrown from the airplane.   Suggs testified that before Stetham was thrown from the planeHamadi said ``let the pig suffer'' when the chief flight attendant,Uli Derickson, asked the hijackers if she could loosen Stethem'sbound hands.   Suggs and Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., had been taken to theplane's first- class section after the flight was diverted toBeirut.   ``I heard a lot of screaming to the tower in Arabic, I couldn'tunderstand it,'' he testified. ``Then I could hear Robert (Stethem)scream,'' Suggs said.   Other witnesses, including Mrs. Derickson, have said thatStethem never made a sound during beatings he received by thehijackers. But Suggs, when asked about that testimony, maintained:``I heard him scream.''   ``Then I hear a gunshot, the door open, and a second shot,''said Suggs. ``At this point I just listened for Bob, he was stillalive and I could hear him moaning.''   Although he was blindfolded at the time, Suggs said he knew whenthe door opened ``because you can feel it with the draft, and theengines were louder.''   John Testrake, the pilot of flight 847, testified earlier at thetrial that the engines were running when the hijackers shot Stethem.   Suggs said that after Stethem was shot, he heard one of thehijackers say in broken English: ``One more in five minutes.''   ``I felt I would be the next to die,'' Suggs said.   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia, who have been attendingthe trial since it opened July 5, sat quietly listening to thetestimony.   Hamadi also sat impassively during Suggs' testimony.   Later Monday, another Navy diver, Jeffrey Ingalls, 27, testifiedhe hid his military identification card from the hijackers and thathe was ``roughed up a little when they found out about it,'' justbefore he was taken off the plane in Beirut.   Asked to comment on Monday's testimony, Hamadi said in Arabicthrough his interpreter: ``I have nothing to say.''   Hamadi has acknowledged taking part in the hijacking, but deniedhaving shot Stethem. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prisonif convicted.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, aftercustoms officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.   In the week following his arrest, two West Germans werekidnapped in Beirut. Both captives have since been freed.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted by aDuesseldorf court on charges that he took part in the kidnappingsin a failed effort to pressure West Germany into releasing Mohammed.</TEXT></DOC>
