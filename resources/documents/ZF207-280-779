Patton, the GSA official in charge of WITS, said the approximately130,000 federal employees in the 34 agencies that will be served by the newnetwork will switch over to the new system agency by agency.andP;  The agencieswill be divided into three groups, one group for each year of the transition.andM;&quot;Candamp;P will provide a WITS implementation plan which we will review to seewhich agencies will first move to WITS,&quot; Patton said.andP;  The first group ofagencies will cut over to WITS in 12 months, the next group 24 months fromnow, and the last group in 36 months.andM;To facilitate the transition, GSA officials plan to set up a WITSImplementation Management Council.andP;  Patton said once GSA knows how theagencies are grouped for the transition to WITS, each will be asked to name asenior executive-level person as well as a middle-level official withtelecommunications expertise to represent the agency on the panel.andM;Bobbie Scott, acting director of GSA's telecommunications procurementdivision, said the decision to award the contract to the local Bell operatingcompany of Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. was made on a combinationof technical and cost considerations.andP;  The contract is expected to be worthbetween $221 million and $282 million over its 10-year term.andM;A spokesman for Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp., which apparently was the onlyother bidder, said his company had requested a debriefing on the selection.andO;Based on that information, the company will decide whether to challenge thecontract, he said.andM;WITS is the second major component in GSA's program for upgradingtelecommunications services provided to agencies.andM;Last month, the agency split the FTS 2000 contract between ATandamp;T Co. andKansas City, Mo.-based US Sprint Communications Co. to upgrade thegovernment's long-distance system from analog to a state-of-the-art digitalnetwork for carrying voice, data and images.andM;Under WITS, which is designed to meet agencies' local telecommunicationsneeds, federal users will get the benefit of the emerging Integrated ServicesDigital Network (ISDN) technology, though it is unclear when the transitionto ISDN actually will occur.andM;&quot;The ISDN capability will come with the cutover.andP;  It will be there for thosewho need it,&quot; said Candamp;P spokesman Larry Plumb.andM;The WITS requests for proposals required bidders to describe &quot;their currentcapabilities for providing the ISDN requirements, along with detailedinformation concerning their plans for evolving the proposed WITS into a fullISDN network.&quot;andM;The FTS 2000 contract also calls for transition to ISDN but does not specifywhen it is to occur.andM;Candamp;P officials also declined to discuss in detail some of the other featuresWITS will have.andP;  The statement said, &quot;WITS will feature its own integrated,on-line management system that agencies can use to place orders, changestations or otherwise directly manage their telecommunications services froma computer terminal.andM;&quot;Other features include a fully customized billing system that also willenable agencies to better manage their telecommunications budgets,&quot; thestatement added.andP;  Federal agencies will use the WITS to connect to the FTS2000 network and to public switched networks.andM;Candamp;P's principal subcontractor on the project is ATandamp;T Co., which will provideits digital 5ESS switches, the ISDN software and customer premises equipment.andM;GSA officials estimate that WITS will save the government more than $40million over the life of the contract while providing agencies better servicevia a digital network.andP;  Though bids for WITS were received in early March1987, GSA officials maintained that the award nearly two years later did notrepresent a delay.andM;WITS is, in essence, part of GSA's Aggregated Switch Procurement (ASP)program for providing local service to federal offices around the country.andO;However, because of its size WITS has been handled separately from the ASPprogram, which calls for providing the telecommunications services region byregion.andM;GSA had planned on making 10 ASP awards, but the program has been stymied formore than a year after two Bell operating companies protested GSA'smanagement.andP;  The companies said the way GSA had set up the geographic regionsprevented them from bidding on the contract because of the constraints of theATandamp;T divestiture agreement.andM;GSA officials have not said exactly when they expect the ASP program to geton track.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
