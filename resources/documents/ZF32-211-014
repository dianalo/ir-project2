 SNMP, which evolved from the Internet and TCP/IPworlds, is a scheme for communicating network management data overa local area network to a single site, called a Network ManagementStation.andP;  Under SNMP, each network segment must have a device,called an agent, that can monitor devices in that segment andm report the information to the Network Management Station.andP;  Devicesthat cannot speak SNMP must be linked to the Network ManagementStation via a proxy agent.andP;  The Management Information Base (MIB)is a collection of objects that the SNMP uses to send managementcommands and information over the network.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Network ManagementProtocolRemote ControlMultivendor SystemsNetwork ArchitectureTutorial.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE HARRIED ADMINISTRATOR dreams about managing the network from his chair.andO;He sits in his office, solving all network ills from the keyboard.andP;  Behindthe scenes, computers busily watch the network devices, churn statistics intomeaningful information, and instantly notify the manager of only the mostcrucial data.andM;Today, this scenario is more fitting of science fiction than reality.andP;  Mostnetwork administrators run from floor to floor, building to building, andcity to city, toting network analyzers everywhere, while their users complainabout poor performance or crashed servers.andM;The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) may be the first step inproviding the means to manage massive heterogeneous networks from a centrallocation with newfound ease and efficiency.andM;But there's a lot more to network management than simply supporting SNMP.andO;SNMP is merely the means to the end.andP;  But the means looks promising.andP;  Whilethe theory of hooking up the hardware and software to manage a network isfairly straightforward, getting a management system to work with the productsavailable today is something else.andP;  THE STANDARDS' FACTOR SNMP is a schemefor communicating useful network management information over a LAN to acentral location.andP;  SNMP is a protocol.andP;  By itself, a protocol is of littleuse.andM;SNMP grew out of the TCP/IP and Internet worlds, although it is not tied toone specific network transport type.andP;  Not only is SNMP here today, but alsoit is fairly widely used.andP;  The Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP)is an OSI protocol with essentially the same purposes as SNMP's.andP;  And likeOSI itself, CMIP is not quite ready for &quot;prime time.&quot; However, CMIP has apotentially wide acceptance, after OSI becomes entrenched (and only if OSIbecomes entrenched).andM;Confusion over &quot;standards&quot; will only increase in the coming months and years.andO;Many vendors of network devices that can be managed plan to include supportfor both SNMP and CMIP.andP;  However, the vast majority of today's managementsystems are SNMP-compliant.andM;A recent Datapro Research  Delran, NJ) survey concluded that only threepercent of all respondents would move to CMIP in two years or less.andP;  Thestudy found that 30 percent had no plans at all to move to CMIP.andP;  Themarketplace appears to be determining the standards of the day: SNMP is hereand TCP/IP is here; OSI and CMIP are not.andP;  GOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Managing alarge heterogeneous network means maintaining a view into every network nookand cranny.andP;  The network administrator must be able to watch the activity oneach segment and compare it to predefined performance standards.andP;  It meansforewarning of impending network failures.andP;  It means monitoring network loadsto determine the optimal expansion scenarios.andP;  It means performing correctiveaction remotely, whenever possible.andP;  A good SNMP management system must beable to perform these functions and more.andM;To accomplish these goals, each segment must have a device that can read&quot; thenetwork and report its findings to a central location.andP;  That device is theSNMP agent and it is the first piece of the SNMP puzzle.andM;If the device itself cannot speak SNMP, it must be connected to a genuineSNMP agent.andP;  The agent communicates with the central management location; theother, nonSNMP device reads the segment data.andP;  The device is called a proxyagent, since it provides network information by proxy to the agent forcommunication with the central management location.andP;  The agent may be apassive device whose sole purpose is to read the network or it may be anactive device with another function, such as a bridge, router, or intelligenthub.andP;  The proxy agent is usually designed to speak to a device or segmentthat is managed by a protocol that is not SNMP-compliant.andP;  The centralmanagement location is called a Network Management Station (NMS).andP;  Itcommunicates with the SNMP agents and provides a venue (usually graphical)for the user to interact with the agents.andP;  The NMS provides the informationdisplay, communication with agents, information filtering, and controlcapabilities.andP;  Generally, it is a powerful, standalone workstation or PC.andO;The agents and their appropriate information are displayed in a graphicalformat, often against a network map.andP;  Network technicians and administratorscan query the agents and read the responses on the NMS display.andP;  The NMS alsoperiodically polls the agents and searches for anomalies.andP;  Detection of ananomaly results in an alarm at the network management station.andM;The last piece in the SNMP puzzle is the Management Information Base (MIB).andO;SNMP uses a collection of objects in a MIB to transfer management informationand commands over the network.andP;  The network itself usually is the medium forcarrying the information between the NMS and the agents.andP;  SNMP packages theseobjects, or standard information strings, into predefined SNMP data packets.andM;The Internet Activities Board (IAB) defines the basic MIB contents in twodocuments: RFC 1156 and RFC 1157.andP;  The MIB structure, called the Structure ofManagement Information, is defined in RFC 1155.andP;  The SNMP protocol itself isdefined in RFC 1157.andP;  These RFCS, or Request For Comments, give theappearance of a standard, but like many &quot;industry&quot; standards, they don't seemto go quite far enough.andM;Manufacturers of SNMP-compliant products have added extensions to the SNMPMIB to take advantage of their products' features.andP;  So like standard&quot; SQL,&quot;standard&quot; SNMP is not particularly consistent over all implementations.andO;Lack of a true standard is one of the stickiest aspects to  practicalimplementation  of SNMP-based network management.andP;  AROUND THE LIMITATIONSLet's clarify the standard vs.andP;  nonstandard MIB issue.andP;  The MIB is the heartof the effective SNMP management system.andP;  The core of an SNMP-compliant MIBis generally consistent; there is a predictable set of SNMP objects.andP;  About100 objects form the core of the IAB's standard SNMP MIB; however, mostdevelopers of SNMP products have added extensions where they can provideadditional capability when used with their products.andP;  The problem is thatunless other SNMP manufacturers support those extensions, they have nomeaning to other products, SNMPcompliant or not.andM;The lack of standardization inherent in the manufacturer-specific extensionsto the basic MIB is a major problem.andP;  The Datapro survey reported that thenumber one problem with SNMP was &quot;the difficulty in supporting private MIBextensions.&quot;andM;Some experts predict that 1991 will be the shakeout of the SNMPbased networkmanagement systems.andP;  In this scenario, because of resource constraints, manyvendors will choose not to design their own management system, but rather,buy and repackage a manager from another manufacturer.andP;  This is both good andbad.andP;  Although the number of choices would be reduced, the market isn'tnecessarily left with the best products to choose from.andM;Maximum use of most SNMPbased management systems is limited to the productsthat fully support the individual developer's extensions to the standard SNMPMIB.andP;  In simple terms, you have a very few choices in finding an effectiveSNMP manager.andM;Your first option is to use a network management station that is consistentwith the SNMP MIB implementation on your network.andP;  To do so, you must limitthe agents in the system to those that &quot;speak&quot; the MIB your networkmanagement station uses.andP;  You will have to stay with a single manufacturer ofwiring hubs, bridges, and routers.andP;  Choosing hubs, bridges, and routers fortheir manageability, however, is not always an effective solution, becausemaking a device manageable doesn't necessarily make it a good productoverall.andP;  Managed bridges or routers may be less efficient than theirunmanaged counterparts.andP;  Managed hubs may be nonstandard.andP;  Interconnectionsto external systems may be difficult.andP;  Any number of headaches may surface.andM;The second and most common problem is that you rarely have the luxury ofimplementing a network from the ground up.andP;  In most cases, you are buildingonto an existing system or collection of subsystems, which means that youprobably won't have much-if any-consistency in devices or manufacturers.andM;Your second option is to &quot;best fit&quot; the system.andP;  Buy a management system thatcovers as much of the network as possible, with the hope that its extracapabilities can be molded to your network's components and idiosyncrasies.andO;This is difficult, but often possible.andP;  If you chose this approach, you willneed either some high-powered experts inhouse or a high-level consultant.andM;For example, Novell's (Sunnyvale, CA) LANtern network analysis and managementsystem can be made reasonably universal.andP;  The LANtern's MIB is extensive, andthe combination of the LANtern agent and the LANtern NMS is quite powerful.andO;(The LANtern agent resides on each segment and reports the state of thatsegment to the LANtern Services Manager.)andM;The up side of this approach is that the LANtern monitor provides a greatdeal of information to the network management station.andP;  The down side is thatsevere limitations may be placed on the other agents the NMS can manage.andO;Thus in general, specific management of bridges and routers may be difficult,if not impossible.andP;  (Although the LANtern reports its information across suchboundaries to the LANtern Services Manager without difficulty.) While theresults of bridging and routing can be read, the interpretation of thoseresults is left to the operator.andP;  It is better if the actual bridges,routers, and hubs could be read and controlled directly instead of byinference.andM;The third and best solution is a universal network management system whichsupports a broad range of available MIB objects from a wide array ofSNMP-compliant products, but still allows simple customization to becomecompliant with virtually any network device or protocol.andP;  The universalnetwork management system is is the new generation, and so far examples arerare.andP;  Even within this venue, more than one approach can be taken.andM;Using the proxy agent to build a universal management system is typical ofsystems, such as from Hughes LAN Systems (Mountain View, CA).andP;  Hughes'product supports a wide variety of vendors and protocols and allows itself tobe configured as a proxy agent for indirect SNMP support.andP;  Proxy agents workvery well when supporting a completely dissimilar protocol system such asIBM's SNA.andP;  Rather that writing an SNMP agent for SNA, it is easier to writea proxy agent that speaks SNA on one side and SNMP on the other, enablingentire SNA segments to be managed as easily as if they were directlySNMP-compliant.andM;The second approach is direct protocol support where possible.andP;  Themanagement system directly supports SNMP management where SNMP is available,directly supports CMIP management where CMIP is the protocol of choice, anddirectly manages any other protocol suite.andP;  This is the basis for Cabletron's(Rochester, NH) Spectrum.andP;  Spectrum is configurable to directly support anydevice or protocol that can be specifically defined.andP;  There is no requirementfor SNMP standardization or proxies.andP;  Spectrum individually views eachprotocol or network device and provides you with all of the tools required tocustomize its capabilities to your network's parameters.andM;Spectrum does recognize a large number of manufacturers and protocols rightout of the box, including SNMP, and soon CMIP.andP;  It can use agents, such assmart bridges, routers, hubs, and monitoring devices such as the LANtern orNetwork General's Sniffer.andP;  FITTING THE PIECES TOGETHER The centerpiece ofany network management system is the network management station.andP;  Under itshood is the MIB as well as the monitors and other agents on the network thatcommunicate with the NMS.andP;  A good network management station has severalrequirements.andM;A network management station should be graphical.andP;  It is far easier to dealwith a mouse and icons than to type endless commands at a prompt or movelight bars up and down limitless hierarchical menus.andP;  Management systemsoften use maps and floor plans to pinpoint an offending node's location in asegment experiencing trouble.andM;The NMS is a standalone computer that attaches to the enterprise LAN, likeany other segment or device.andP;  Although its purpose is somewhat different fromother segments and nodes, its method of acting as part of the network issimilar.andP;  The NMS must be able to communicate over the network using standardhigh and low-level communications protocols.andP;  For example, Novell's LANternsupports most common low-level protocols and uses the User Datagram Protocolas a high-level communications protocol.andP;  Management information is containedin SNMP packets.andP;  Spectrum, which runs on a Unix workstation, uses TCP/IP asits communication protocol.andM;The next step is data acquisition.andP;  The network must have agents that cancommunicate management information to and from the NMS.andP;  Consider the dataset available in the MIB.andP;  If you will use an integrated approach, such asLANtern, you should begin by placing LANtern monitors in the segments youwish to control.andP;  If you use the LANtern Services Manager, you can beconfident that you can at least communicate effectively between the NMS andthe LANterns on the network.andM;At a minimum, the following services should be provided: * Automatic networkconfigurationandM;(on the NMS) *  Real-time network status display *  Real-time trapping *Real-time performance monitoring *  Historical trend analysis *  Connectivitytesting *  Duplicate IP address detection *  Ethernet cable testing * Network traffic monitoring *  Station traffic monitoring *  Stationconversation trafficandM;monitoring *  Alarm generationandM;As mentioned earlier, the LANtern system works along with othervendors'systems.andP;  These other SNMP management station suppliers- 14 atcurrent count-have embraced Novell's MIB extensions.andM;In a system such as the LANtern, these functions are performed by themonitors and reported to the NMS.andP;  If, for example, connectivity to a node isto be tested, the LANtern performs the test under instruction from the NMS,then it reports the results to the NMS.andP;  The drawback is that the operator isleft to decipher the test results.andP;  Fault analysis is left to people, whilecomputers test and gather the data.andM;Spectrum, on the other hand, allows various devices to be tested directly andaids in the interpretation of the results.andP;  Interpretation is aided by whatthe company calls a virtual network machine.andP;  The virtual network machine isa model of the real network, except all devices are imbued with intelligence.andO;The system analyzes the physical network, compares its findings with thevirtual network machine, and using inference, suggests possible causes offaults.andP;  In Spectrum, the management system assists the operator in faultisolation and correction.andM;A network management system that allows virtually unlimited extensibilityacross nearly any platform, protocol, or device, and provides intelligentfault analysis is most desirable.andP;  However, such a system is not trivial toimplement and expand, nor is it inexpensive.andP;  A critical piece of the networkmanagement puzzle is the tradeoff between cost an performance.andP;  GET YOURMONEY'S WORTH Getting your money's worth is often the most difficult part ofthe network management battle.andP;  What is the cost of poor performance? Whatdoes it cost to have system outages? What is the price of expanding thenetwork by the seat of your pants instead of by careful planning and solidhistorical data? Correlating the efficiency of management systems to harddollar savings is difficult, especially in times of tight economy.andM;Unfortunately, rules have not been cast in concrete.andP;  But in general, mostadministrators agree that as soon as you have more than one segment, you havea network management challenge.andP;  Depending upon the nature of the LAN, even asingle segment may require special tools.andM;If you have the luxury of planning the network from scratch, instead ofbuilding onto existing LANS, you can save a lot of money by designing networkmanagement from the outset.andP;  You probably will save some money by stayingclose to management systems that are compatible with the agents they need tomanage.andP;  For example, if you are installing a large number of 1OBaseTEthernet segments, you would do well to use a network that supportsintelligent 1OBaseT hubs and a management system that can control them.andP;  Suchproducts are available from companies such as SynOptics (Santa Clara, CA) andCabletron.andM;A second scenario is where you have a few existing segments and are adding alarge number of new segments to the enterprise.andP;  This is a bit moredifficult.andP;  The best approach is similar to the one just described, plus theaddition of a monitor, such as LANtern.andP;  Under the right circumstances, thecombination can be made to work.andM;Note the phrases &quot;under the right circumstances&quot; and &quot;made to work.&quot; We arenot necessarily steering you toward the best solution.andP;  In this mix, parts ofthe system will work quite well (specifically, the LANtern segments), andsome won't.andP;  If the system uses SNMP, you can get a fair amount ofinformation from throughout the network, but the MIB shortcomings will beginto show up.andM;The tradeoff is that you often will need to run more than one networkmanagement system, even though the entire network is SNMP-compliant.andP;  Thesegments that can be managed via a proprietary system, such as SynOptics'LattisNet Network Management System, will give somewhat less information onthe non-SynOptics agents.andP;  You will get some information, you just won't getthe full power of the management system.andM;On the other hand, the LANtern gives you a great deal of enterprise typeinformation, while somewhat limiting the device-specific data that you wouldtypically get from the SynOptics manager.andP;  The non-SynOptics devices mayexhibit very little useful data in this scenario.andM;You can get all of the data from some of the devices, or some of the datafrom all of the devices, but you can't get all of the management data youwant from all of the devices.andM;&quot;But that still sounds pretty good,&quot; you say.andP;  While it's true that intoday's huge heterogeneous networks (and some not-so-huge networks) anyinformation can be extremely useful, the network management's goal should beto involve the administrator as little as possible in fault isolation.andO;Today's networks are simply too big.andP;  There are too many levels ofadministration.andP;  The network management system of the  90s must do more thantake readings across a network; it must assist the network administrator ininterpreting those readings.andM;More than a simple management protocol is needed.andP;  The next generation ofnetwork management stations will resemble Spectrum more than the othersystems that are currently available.andP;  It won't be long before most seriousmanagement systems begin to exhibit Spectrum's extensibility andintelligence.andP;  (For more on Cabletron's Spectrum, see &quot;Pot of Gold,&quot; on page8 5 in the January 1991 issue.) HOW TO CHOOSE A MANAGER When deciding whatnetwork management system to buy, first evaluate the system, including whereit is today and where it's going.andP;  Intelligent expansion is based uponintelligent forecasting of needs.andP;  Intelligent forecasting is based upon goodhistorical data.andM;Second, evaluate the tradeoffs.andP;  How much power can you really afford (orafford to be without)? Can you afford to have redundant management systems totake into account a variety of proprietary protocols? Or would you be betteroff to start with a scaled-down version of a system such as Spectrum whichgives you a bit more than you need today, but will be just right tomorrow?andM;Look at how much inconsistency your enterprise network contains.andP;  It may makesense to replace isolated portions of the network with segments that bettermeet the users' needs and are more manageable.andM;Examine your administrative setup.andP;  How many levels of administrators do youhave? Is administration all done from a central location, or are you set upregionally? If you have a regionalized network, you may be better off withseveral management systems, each tailored to the region they administer.andM;When designing a network, consider management.andP;  If the network cannot bemanaged, it won't matter how sophisticated it is.andP;  It won't serve you as itwas meant to.andM;A network management station is simply a viewport into a maze ofinterconnected networks.andP;  If you can't see everything you need to seethroughout the network, you'll never navigate the maze.andP;  This is the finalcriteria you must apply to any network management system, regardless of thetechnology that it is constructed from.andP;  2</TEXT></DOC>
