Linkageis difficult because of he institutional differences between force plannerson the one hand, and arms controllers on the other. Aggravating the problemis the lack of a unifying framework by which outcomes in both areas canbe assessed. The authors outline a three-step process for designing aunified concept for defense and arms control planning, describe the long-termcoordination of the process, and identify principles that should guideNATO's conventional arms control planning.</TEXT></DOC>
