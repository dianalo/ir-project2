Nujoma, who heads the South-West Africa People's Organization,said he had met with campaign managers who promised him a meetingwith the two Democratic candidates within the coming week. GOPcontender George Bush has not responded to a similar request for ameeting, Nujoma said in an interview Tuesday.   Nujoma, 58, said that despite claims to the contrary, SouthAfrica is trying to strengthen its hold over the mineral-richterritory which it rules in defiance of a 1978 U.N. resolutioncalling for Namibian independence.   Nujoma, who lives in exile in Angola, accused South Africantroops of arson and bombing attacks against Namibia's 1.5 millionresidents, including the burning of 14 church-run schools lastmonth.   South Africa has denied the charges, accusing SWAPO of theattacks.   South African President P.W. Botha paid a rare visit to theterritory on April 8, and proposed increased powers for his chiefrepresentative there. The proposal would weaken the``transitional'' government established by South Africa in 1985with a view to eventual independence for Namibia.   ``South Africa has no intention whatsoever to leave Namibia,''said Nujoma. The South Africans will have to be ``forced out by thecombined resistance of the Namibian people and internationalpressure.''   He called on the next U.S. administration to pursue stepssimilar to the trade sanctions legislated by Congress in 1986against South Africa.   Nujoma said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz but had not received any response. A StateDepartment official confirmed Nujoma had asked for a meeting, andsaid Shultz had yet to reply.   Shultz has been criticized by conservative members of Congress,such as Rep. Patrick Swindall, R-Ga., for allowing Nujoma into thecountry in view of his organization's guerrilla activities andsupport from the Soviet Union. In a letter to Shultz, Swindallcalled Nujoma a ``terrorist and Soviet puppet.''   The United States supports a South African pullout and anindependent Namibia, but its contacts with SWAPO have been limited.   U.S. representatives are taking part in two days of talks inLondon with representatives from Angola, Cuba and South Africa on aplan for the pullout of South African forces from Namibia and Cubantroops from Angola.   Cuba has an estimated 37,000 soldiers in Angola. Estimates forthe South African military presence in Namibia range from 40,000 to100,000.   Nujoma said he was sure Angola would protect his group'sinterests at the talks and press its demands for Namibianindependence. ``It will be a package, I am assured of this by theAngolan government,'' he said.   If an agreement is worked out, SWAPO will stop its attacksagainst South African troops, he said. SWAPO says it killed morethan 90 South Africans this year, but its claims cannot be verified.   Nujoma conceded that SWAPO gets most of its arms and trainingfrom the Soviet Union, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Angola and several othermembers of the Organization of African Unity.   But he added that if the United States wants to supply SWAPOwith weapons, ``we will certainly accept it with great pleasure.''   Nujoma is on a three-week visit to the United States to attendseveral U.N.-sponsored seminars on Namibia and to highlight hisorganization's demands.</TEXT></DOC>
