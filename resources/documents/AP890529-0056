Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno is now expected to replace PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita who will resign soon because of theRecruit Co. scandal.   Also today, prosecutors charged four aides to senior politicianswith illegal handling of money in the Recruit scandal. Theprosecutors said their charges marked the end of the investigationinto political donations and stock dealings of the informationservices conglomerate at the heart of the scandal.   Nakasone, who headed the Liberal Democratic faction to which Unobelongs, resigned from the party but refused opposition demands tostep down from his seat in Parliament because of the scandal.   ``I made the decision (to leave the party) the day beforeyesterday, which was my birthday,'' Nakasone told reporters today.   The decision came after Nakasone acknowledged before Parliamenton Thursday that he had accepted $322,000 in political donationsfrom the Recruit Co.   But he denied any wrongdoing in the scandal, which occurredmainly during his 1982-87 term as prime minister.   Nakasone met Takeshita today and conveyed his decision to resignfrom the party to take responsibility for his link to the Recruitscandal.   Those charged today were Tsuneo Hattori, an aide to formerFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa; Fumio Shimizu, a aide to LiberalDemocratic Secretary General Shintaro Abe; and Kikuo Katayama andMasayoshi Sakamaki, aides to former Agriculture Minister MutsukiKato.   The four allegedly violated the Political Fund Restrictions Lawby failing to report Recruit donations in excess of $10,500. Eachof the four could face a fine up to $1,400.   Prosecutors have charged 17 people, including two politiciansand four political aides, with bribery and violations of laws onsecurities and political funds.   The charges marked the end of the inquiry into the Recruitscandal, said Yusuke Yoshinaga, head of the Tokyo District PublicProsecutors' Office.   ``This will cap our probe, which stretched some 260 days long,''Yoshinaga said. In the Recruit scandal, top politicians escapedwithout charges, though many careers were ruined and a close aideto Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita committed suicide the day afterTakeshita decided to resign.   Takeshita today met with party elders to push Uno as hissuccessor. He told reporters Saturday that he hopes to appoint anew prime minister by Friday and hinted that he and his Cabinetwill resign on Thursday.   Uno, 66, a veteran legislator who was first elected to the Houseof Representatives in 1960, has been Minister of InternationalTrade and Industry and director-general of the Defense Agency.   He is particularly favored by party leaders because he isbelieved untainted by the Recruit scandal and has experience inforeign affairs.   Some party members point out that Uno lacks experience indealing with party affairs, which is viewed as indispensable tocarry out painstaking reforms needed to salvage the party'splunging popularity.   However, Uno's main liability has been membership in theNakasone faction.   For more than a month, the governing party has beem unable tofind a candidate to replace Takeshita because most senior leadershave been implicated in the scandal.   The Recruit Co. is accused of trying to influence governmentpolicy by doling out millions of dollars in political donations andselling underpriced, unlisted stock shares to business andpolitical leaders in 1986.   The stock quickly rose in price when placed on the market, andthose who received the unlisted shares reaped tens of thousands ofdollars in profits.</TEXT></DOC>
