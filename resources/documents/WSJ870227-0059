Last month, Mr. Sprinkel paid a visit to the offices of Rep. Jack Kemp, the supply-side Republican who has publicly opposed the economist for the Fed chairmanship. Two weeks later, Mr. Sprinkel invited Jude Wanniski -- a supply-side pundit who several years ago called for &quot;a public flogging of Beryl Sprinkel&quot; -- to dine with him at the White House.    Mr. Sprinkel's courting of his critics, who have complained of his history of strict monetarism, is just one sign of the quiet but intense campaign now under way for the Fed chairmanship. While presidential hopefuls are fighting for acceptance in the cornfields of Iowa and the hills of New Hampshire, candidates for the Fed chairmanship are waging a more subtle battle in Washington and on Wall Street for the second-most-powerful post in America.    Mr. Volcker's second four-year term as Fed chairman expires in August, and administration officials say President Reagan is likely to nominate a chairman by late spring or early summer, in order to allow time for Congress to hold confirmation hearings. But Mr. Volcker isn't out of the picture.    Critical to the president's choice of a Fed chairman is the fate of White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan. Mr. Regan is determined to get rid of Mr. Volcker, and is said to favor the nomination of Mr. Sprinkel, who has served him loyally for six years. But if Mr. Regan is forced to resign as a result of the Iran-Contra arms scandal -- as is widely expected -- Mr. Sprinkel's chances for the post will plummet, while the possibility of Mr. Volcker's reappointment, widely hoped for in the financial community, will increase substantially.    Other candidates wait in the wings. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, grabbed headlines last month when he unveiled a sweeping plan to restructure the nation's financial-services industry. Mr. Corrigan is a confidant of Mr. Volcker and is said to be the chairman's choice as a successor; his lead position on the financial industry issue was widely interpreted as an effort to raise his public profile and make him more attractive to the Reagan administration.    Another possible contender is the current Fed vice chairman, Manuel Johnson. As a Treasury official, Mr. Johnson managed to please both Secretary James Baker and the former Treasury secretary, Mr. Regan, two men who don't always see eye to eye. Moreover, Mr. Johnson has garnered considerable respect at the Fed for his intelligence and diligence.    &quot;Within the Fed, he has become highly respected,&quot; says David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Langston andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;I certainly wouldn't rule him out.&quot;    White House officials also mention New York-based economic consultant Alan Greenspan and former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston as potential nominees. But few of the potential candidates are willing to openly profess a desire for the post. As one Fed official put it, &quot;The worst way to go about getting a job like this is to campaign for it.&quot;    Mr. Sprinkel's recent activities have been an attempt to convince supply-siders, who carry sway within the Reagan administration, that he shares their views. The economist has been criticized by supply-siders and others for his dogmatic adherence to monetarism, a school of thought that attaches great importance to the slow, steady growth of the money supply. Recently, however, he has deviated from traditional monetarist thought. Moreover, as his supporters point out, he has always been a strong and enthusiastic supporter of cuts in tax rates, which are the centerpiece of supply-side doctrine.    &quot;He's always been very good on fiscal policy,&quot; admits Mr. Wanniski, who says his meeting with Mr. Sprinkel reduced the savageness of his opposition but didn't eliminate it.    Rep. Kemp's response is similar. &quot;The meeting they had was cordial,&quot; says Kemp spokesman John Buckley, &quot;but it's Jack's firm feeling that the chairman of the Fed should not be someone who is as rigid a monetarist as Beryl is.&quot;    While the president may nominate whomever he chooses, the financial community is likely to have a say in the matter. A choice that's unpopular with the financial markets could cause interest rates to rise or the dollar to fall. Faced with such unpleasant prospects, Mr. Reagan might feel compelled to switch to a candidate more acceptable to Wall Street.    A survey of money managers late last year by Richard Hoey, chief economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., found that among the candidates mentioned to succeed Mr. Volcker for the Fed post, Mr. Corrigan won the most plaudits. He was chosen by 26.2% as the person in whom they had the &quot;most confidence.&quot; Also ranking high was Mr. Greenspan, supported by 18.4%. Mr. Sprinkel had 3.9%.    &quot;On Wall Street, the only person he (Sprinkel) would finish ahead of is Harold Stassen,&quot; quips Mr. Wanniski.    But if market participants really had their pick, they'd choose Mr. Volcker, whose victory over inflation has won him the lasting respect of most of the international financial community. A survey among 28 economists in a Fed-watching group called the Monetary Policy Forum, which opposes the emphasis of monetarists on the money supply, found unanimous support for Mr. Volcker's reappointment.    The Fed chairman has told some associates flatly that he won't accept reappointment, and his wife is known to be anxious for him to leave. But if Mr. Regan departs, many analysts believe the markets will ultimately force the president to ask Mr. Volcker to stay. And people who know the chairman well tend to believe that if the president asks, he will stay.    &quot;I think the decision will come down to what kind of shape the economy is in,&quot; says former Fed Vice Chairman Frederick Schultz. &quot;If indeed we have some fragility or some budding crises,&quot; then the chances for Mr. Volcker's reappointment will increase considerably, he says.    &quot;If I had to make a bet now, I'd say that Volcker is going to stay,&quot; agrees A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based consultant.    ---   Fed Choices   Responses by money managers to the question: &quot;In whom do you have the most confidence&quot; to replace Paul Volcker?
