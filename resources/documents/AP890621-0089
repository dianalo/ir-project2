Others, led by our current president,George the Kind and Gentle Spy, and his drug czar, want the right toopen fire on anyone decreed to be a ``drug trafficker.''   We elect a government to govern, not to run around killing peoplewithout trial, ceremony or second thought.   Besides, murder is wrong, just as wrong for a bunch of``pro-active'' pinheads who claim truth and justice is on their sideas it is for you and me.   It is especially wrong for a country like ours that claims to beabove official murder, one that believes in trials and freedom andall the other things that are beautiful about this country.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 16   The Hemet (Calif.) News on the minimum wage bill veto:   President Bush's veto of the minimum-wage increase _ which theHouse failed to override _ accomplished two things.   First, it prevented congressional demagogues from destroyinghundreds of thousands of jobs for poor people in the name of``compassion.'' But more important, it showed the Bush is willing tounleash one of his office's most powerful weapons. ...   Was this particular veto justified? Absolutely. By hiking theminimum wage more than one-third _ to $4.55 an hour _ thecongressional bill would have effectively prevented employers fromhiring many first-time or poorly-prepared workers. Instead oflow-paying jobs, many low-skilled youths from the inner cities wouldhave found themselves with no jobs at all. ...   His own proposal would have raised the minimum wage from thecurrent $3.35 per hour to $4.25, but would have allowed employers topay a lower amount during a worker's first six months on the job.The congressional bill would have restricted the training wage to amere 60 days.   Predictably, the unions' allies on Capitol Hill are denouncingBush's veto as anti-worker. But if the president wants to do goodrather than just look good, holding firm on such issues is the bestcourse for him to take.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 16   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on the tax increase proposal:   Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are determined toincrease the federal tax burden on Americans.   A House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee approved a measurelast week that would raise the tax that finances unemploymentinsurance.   The additional tax would cost employers $4 per worker annuallybeginning in 1992 and is expected to add $10.6 billion to federalcoffers during the next five years.   People are getting disgusted with national leaders who think theywere elected to devise more ways to spend the public's money.   Most of us are looking for elected officials to come up with waysto reduce the tax burden on individual Americans and privatebusinesses.   The more Congress taxes, the more Congress spends. That's why ournational debt is expected to reach $2.8 trillion this summer.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 16   The Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on El Salvador:   On ... the last day of a three-day swing through Central America,Vice President Dan Quayle asked Salvadoran rightists not to doanything of an embarrassing nature.   By that, the vice president meant for members of the rightistArena Party in San Salvador to abstain from political torture andkilling. Give newly elected President Alfredo Cristiani a chance totry his ``moderate approach,'' Quayle advised.   The U.S. assessment of conflicts in El Salvador and other partsof Central America has never been what people familiar with theregion would call clear-headed. But Quayle's remarks suggest acomplete break with reality.   Cristiani, a millionaire businessman hand-picked by the extremeright, is a moderate only in his approach to the U.S. officials whohave a say in sustaining U.S. support for the Salvadoran military.He is just a new, articulate front man for the same old rightistcoalition of military leaders, wealthy businessmen and landowners....   The same right-wing forces responsible for the campaign of terrorin the early 1980s came back to power with the election ofCristiani. Expect the same murderous tactics. This is all the Arenacrowd knows.   It is a tragedy for the Salvadoran people who suffered terriblythrough 10 long years of civil war. ...   Their return also amounts to a defeat of U.S. policies aimed atcultivating a moderate, centrist government in El Salvador thatcould end the war and move the country toward democratic reform.   That is hard to swallow, no question. But ignoring it, as Quayleand other U.S. policy makers seem to be doing, will not make iteasier.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
