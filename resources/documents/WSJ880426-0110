Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will sit with several non-OPEC oil producers, and, depending on what happens, oil prices could climb.    Analysts, tired of calling this blockbuster an &quot;OPEC/non-OPEC&quot; meeting, are fishing for something catchier.    First, what to call the non-OPEC countries? NOPEC is a popular choice. (As in an Oppenheimer andamp; Co. report: &quot;Key OPEC ministers . . . met with NOPEC ministers.&quot;) Yet analyst John O'Dea of Dean Witter Reynolds protests that OPEC itself should be called NOPEC, because it no longer gets anything done.    If the meeting eventually leads to the formation of a new cartel combining OPEC and non-OPEC nations, some analysts envision SOPEC (Super Organization of . . .). Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney favors &quot;the Grand OPEC.&quot; And since the Texas Railroad Commission has sent a representative, a new cartel might end up being called TEX-PEC.    Cynics, perhaps worried about their own gasoline bills, favor World Oil Exporters, or WOE -- or even WOPEC.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of the MidEast Report newsletter, suggests the group be called OPECalypse -- as in &quot;OPECalypse Now&quot; -- which also could serve as a movie title about the adventures in Vienna.    Some of the suggested names are X-rated. &quot;What we call them around here cannot be printed,&quot; says Peter Gignoux, London-based analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Funnier than the suggested names, however, is the fact that the meeting is being held at all, he adds.    Mr. Mizrahi says the jokes reflect how hard it is for analysts to take OPEC seriously these days. &quot;If 13 OPEC people can't come to an agreement, do you really think these 13 can get together with seven more and come to an agreement?&quot; he says. &quot;It is a joke.&quot;    At least one analyst isn't laughing so hard, though. Paul Mlotok of Salomon Brothers, a veteran of four OPEC meetings, cautions that it's dangerous to be too glib about what OPEC can accomplish. For his part, Mr. Mlotok recommends calling a possible OPEC/non-OPEC combination the Global Supra Cartel.    &quot;A cartel that goes beyond that which has been before,&quot; he explains. </TEXT></DOC>
