The government vowed tough action to stop a waveof student-led protests.   Later, about 1,500 university students braved heavy rain andgathered for a fourth day in Tiananmen Square, the symbolicpolitical center of China, which is near party headquarters.   On the march to the square, one group carried a wreath and aportrait of Hu Yaobang, the reform-minded Communist Party chiefwhose death Saturday has served as the rallying point for thedemonstrations. Two police cars followed close behind.   Protesters have demanded the party reassess Hu and honor him formaking contributions to reform.   ``We are the civilized revolutionaries of society. The blood ofour classmates will not be shed in vain!'' student leaders shouted.More than 1,000 onlookers gathered around.   Because of the rain, turnout was much lower than for previousdays' activities.   Marches also were reported in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Hefei,and Nanjing. The unrest, which began Monday, is the largest andmost widespread student unrest since marches in the winter of1986-87.   Hu was ousted in 1987 on charges of being too soft on studentswho led those demonstrations.   Beijing municipal authorities issued a statement todayexpressing support for activities to mourn Hu, but they condemnedthe protests and said demonstrators will be ``dealt with severelyaccording to the law.''   The nationally televised evening news issued a similar warning,the first acknowledgement to the nation of the unrest. The lengthyand unusual television statement was a clear indication China'sleaders regard the protests as a serious threat.   Today's student speakers said they were demanding thatofficially controlled student unions be disbanded and replaced withdemocratic organizations.   They also repeated chants of earlier days denouncingdictatorship and corruption and demanding free speech, free press,more money for education and disclosure by officials of theirincomes and bank accounts.   The pre-dawn clash outside Communist Party headquarters todaycame as thousands of students massed outside the Zhongnanhaicompound, where China's leaders work and have homes. The protestersdemanded to see the officials.   ``Fascists, dogs!'' the demonstrators shouted as police rushedthe crowd of about 3,000. ``Hoodlums and bandits!''   The official Xinhua News Agency said four officers were hurt byflying bottles and bricks. Students claimed plainclothes policehurled the objects.   Students claimed police beat about 200 people and that 30 wereinjured. Reporters saw a few dozen beatings.   The students said more than 40 students were in police custody,including four or five leaders. There were no official reports ofarrests.   One student from the China University of Politics and Law wasinjured by police. Students this morning hung his bloody clothesoutside a building on the campus. His condition was not known.   All afternoon Wednesday, protesters rallied in Tiananmen Squareand were watched and sometimes cheered by a crowd that grew toabout 20,000 people.   Police presence around the square today was light, with groupsof fewer than a dozen scattered around the square and at nearbyintersections.   Most students left after several hours, leaving about 200 in thesquare still holding political discussions in small groups, writingessays and poems on democracy and reading them to the crowd.   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students set out today from NanjingUniversity toward the Jiangsu provincial government offices, saidan American teacher at the school, who spoke by telephone oncondition of anonymity.   It was not clear if they reached the offices. The teacher said asimilar number of students marched Wednesday night through citystreets for about four hours, carrying banners and chanting, ``Downwith bureaucracy! Down with autocracy! Down with dictatorship!''</TEXT></DOC>
