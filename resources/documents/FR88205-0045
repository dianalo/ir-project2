(AISC) on behalf of U.S.producers of fabricated structural steel. In compliance with the filingrequirements of 19 CFR 353.36, petitioner alleges that imports of fabricatedstructural steel from Canada are being, or are likely to be, sold in theUnited States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these importsmaterially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price and Foreign Market Value</ITAG>United States price was based on the winning bid made by Canadian fabricators.Petitioner deducted, where appropriate, the cost of erection and any extras,U.S. Customs duties, inland freight, city taxes, and erection and portbonds.Petitioner based foreign market value on the constructed value of Canadianfabricated structural steel which was derived form U.S. fabricated structuralsteel industry cost experience with adjustments for differences in inputs.Based upon a comparison of United States price and foreign market value,petitioner alleges dumping margins of between 12.00 percent and 19.2 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 732(c) of the Act, we must determine, within 20 days aftera petition is filed, whether it sets forth the allegations necessary forthe initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether it containsinformation reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations.We examined the petition on fabricated structural steel from Canada andfound that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore,in accordance with section 732 of the Act, we are initiating an antidumpingduty investigation to determine whether imports of fabricated structuralsteel from Canada are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United Statesat less than fair value. If our investigation proceeds normally, we willmake our preliminary determination by June 20, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. Congressis considering legislation to convert the United States to this HarmonizedSystem (HS). In view of this, we will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item numbersand the appropriate HS item numbers with our product descriptions on atest basis, pending Congressional approval. As with the TSUSA, the HS itemnumbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The writtendescription remains dispositive.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all new petitions filed with theDepartment. A reference copy of the proposed HS schedule is available forconsultation at the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Department ofCommerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.Additionally, all Customs officers have reference copies and petitionersmay contact the Import Specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.The product covered by this investigation is fabricated structural steelcurently provided for under TSUSA items numbers 609.8400, 609.8600, 652.9400,652.9500, 652.9600, and 653.0000. and currently classifiable under HS itemnumbers 7216.90.0000, 7222.40.6000, 7228.70.6000, 7301.20.1000, 7301.20.5000,7308.90.3000, 7308.90.6000, 7308.90.9090.Fabricated structural steel (FSS) consists of steel plates, angles, beamsand related steel mill products that have been fabricated into articlessuitable for erection or assembly into buildings which include industrial,utility, commercial, office, parking decks, assembly, multi-residential,medical, public and transportation facilities. Types of steel productsinclude, but are not limited to, columns (vertical support), beams (floorsupport), girders (connect beams), base plates (laid over a concrete foundationto assist in distributing a building's load), and trusses (a series ofwelded or bolted steel sections used in place of conventional beams tospan large areas such as lobbies or atriums). FSS also includes entiretiesor ``kits'' of fabricated structural shapes. This investigation does notinclude FSS that is used in the construction of bridges, fabricated reinforcingbars, bar joists, fabricated metal buildings, steel flooring or roof decks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notification of ITC</ITAG>Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this actionand to provide it with the information we used to arrive at this determination.We will notify the ITC and make available to it all nonprivileged and nonproprietaryinformation.
