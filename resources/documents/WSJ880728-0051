The approval won't immediately make the sweetener, generically named acesulfame-K, a competitor in the chief product categories of the other two synthetic sweeteners on the U.S. market, aspartame and saccharin. But the approval, which is the first in the U.S. for the Hoechst Celanese product, gives it a toehold in the $1 billion U.S. market for sugar substitutes.    Hoechst Celanese, a subsidiary of Hoechst AG of Frankfurt, West Germany, received approval of its sweetener as a table-top sugar substitute and as an ingredient in chewing gum, dry beverage mixes, instant coffee, instant tea, gelatins, puddings and non-dairy creamers.    The FDA deferred action on the company's request for approval of the sweetener, which has the trade name Sunette in the U.S., as an ingredient in confections including hard and soft candy.    Hoechst Celanese said it will also seek FDA approval for Sunette's use in baked goods and in liquids, such as soft drinks. Industry sources say that uses in liquids alone now account for about 70% of the U.S. market.    Hoechst Celanese describes Sunette as having a &quot;clean, quickly perceptible, sweet taste that does not linger.&quot; The product already is on the market in 20 other countries and is used in such products as Weight Watchers' Yogurt Muesli in Switzerland and Coca-Cola Light in France.    Because the product isn't easily broken down by heat, the company calls it a natural for use in making baked goods and candies. In the U.S., it won't have to carry any warning labels under the approval given by the FDA.    &quot;It could be real head-to-head competition,&quot; said Gordon McCullough, the general manager of PMC Specialties Group, which sells saccharin under the brand name Syncal. PMC is a unit of PMC Inc., a privately held company based in Sun Valley, Calif.    But NutraSweet Co., which sells U.S. market leader aspartame under the brand name of NutraSweet, quickly dismissed the new competition as having an aftertaste. &quot;We feel it won't be a competitor, based on taste,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the company, which is a unit of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.    She added that NutraSweet, which dominates the soft-drink market in the U.S., can now be made in another form to be used in baked goods and hard candy. Those uses, though, are still subject to FDA approval.    Hoechst Celanese didn't disclose international sales figures for its sweetener. But some analysts said the product hasn't hurt NutraSweet badly outside the U.S. &quot;It's a very minor threat to NutraSweet's position with soft-drink makers,&quot; said James Wilbur, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Monsanto closed at $85.875, down $1.125.    The competition could grow keener if the FDA clears still other sweeteners it is now reviewing. Pfizer Inc. and McNeil Specialty Products Co., a unit of Johnson andamp; Johnson, are seeking approval for new sweeteners, and Abbott Laboratories has asked the FDA to reconsider cyclamate, which was removed from the market in 1970 because of health concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
