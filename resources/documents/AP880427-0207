By a 17-9 vote, the Merchant Marine subcommittee on fisheriesand wildlife conservation and the environment approved legislationto authorize the Interior Department to sell oil leases on the 1.5million acre coastal plain of the refuge in northeastern Alaska.   The issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th Congressbetween enviromentalists, who want no drilling in the refuge, andthe administration and oil industry, who say the plain'spotentially large reserves are needed to stem a growing nationaldependence on imported oil.   An Interior Department study says development can be carried outin an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rivalthe Prudhoe Bay complex about 70 miles to the west. Prudhoe Bayaccounts for about 20 percent of U.S. production.   The victory in the subcommittee was the second straight fordrilling advocates and is expected to be duplicated next week whenthe full Merchant Marine Committee considers the proposal by itschairman, Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C.   Earlier this year, the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee voted 11-8 to allow oil rigs onto the refuge, whereopponents say development would spoil its pristine character anddamage wildlife habitat. The Senate bill is awaiting floor debate.   Jones' plan would allow phased leasing, with the first sale tooccur no sooner than 21 months after enactment. No more than300,000 acres could be leased at sales occurring no more frequentlythan every two years.   The bill would bar surface development in a 260,000 acre areathat contains about 90 percent of the land used for calving by the180,000-head Porcupine caribou herd, which migrates between Alaskaand Canada.   The Refuge Administration Act of 1966 requires that developmentin such enclaves be compatible with the basic purpose of a refuge:preserving wildlife habitat.   It is up to developers to convince officials of compatibility.Jones' bill, however, would force opponents of developing thecoastal plain to prove that such activity would have significantand adverse long-term effects on habitat.   The bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted fromthe coastal plain and would require any ocean transport of this oilto be done on ships registered in the United States.   The legislation also would create a new 23.5 million-acreTeshekpuk-Utukok National Wildlife Refuge to the west of PrudhoeBay and place a five-year moratorium on any petroleum leasing inthe new refuge.   Drilling opponents repeatedly failed in attempts to amend thebill.   The Merchant Marine Committee is only the first hurdle drillinglegislation faces in the House. At least one other committee,Interior, has jurisdiction over the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
