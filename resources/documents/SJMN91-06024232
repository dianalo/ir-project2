Hiswife, &quot;Laurie&quot; was a faithful caregiver and we loved her for it. After&quot;John's&quot; death we thanked her for being so wonderful to our son. She has neveracknowledged our financial help, which was considerable, and stills livesrent-free in a house we own.;    Less than a year after John died, Lauriestarted to date an older married man. He is now divorced and has moved in withher and our two granddaughters. This man has brought nothing to therelationship except a hearty appetite and a pickup truck.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MERRY WIDOW'S ANTICS SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     One of our granddaughters is 15 and knows what is going on. We are nothappy about the example their mother is setting. We also feel that Laurie istaking advantage of us by living in our home rent-free although we don't needthe money. Do we have any right to say or do something?;    -- Worried In-Lawsin Kansas;    DEAR KANSAS -- I can understand why you disapprove of Laurie'slifestyle. I wouldn't be crazy about it either. But she is under no obligationto answer to you.;    You were generous to allow her to live rent-free in yourhome. I hope that you will continue to do so, if not for her sake, for yourson's children. They need you in their lives. If you have a confrontation withtheir mother she could cut you out, and that would be a tragedy. So, swallowhard, dear, and close one eye. It's in your own best interest.;    DEAR ANN --I'm an old fogie in my 50s and was never concerned about the effect rockgroups had on kids until my &quot;new to me&quot; 1987 Cadillac Seville hood and trunkornaments were stolen. The replacements will cost more than $100.;    I'vesince learned that the kids here, in a suburb of Grand Rapids, have caught onto wearing these ornaments upside-down as necklaces or belt buckles, as asymbol against the establishment, just like certain rock groups do.;    I hopeall mothers who read this will check their kids' jewelry and dresser drawers.If they find these ornaments it's a cinch the kid is up to no good. You shouldwaste no time finding out exactly where the stuff came from, when they wereacquired and why.;    I grew up in this town and there was none of thisgarbage going on when I was a kid. Please, Ann, print this letter and give mea hand. Things are changing too fast for me.;    -- Life is Less Grand inGrand Rapids;    DEAR LIFE -- The changes you refer to are taking place farbeyond the city limits of Grand Rapids. It's happening all over.;    Accordingto Marion Jelks at Grossinger's Village Cadillac in Chicago, stealing crestemblems is very common. Cadillacs and Mercedes are the prime targets. Kids usethem on belt buckles, walking canes, gym bag zippers, necklaces and even asearrings. Whoever said, &quot;There's nothing new under the sun,&quot; ought to checkaround.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  512  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 24, 199100024232,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
