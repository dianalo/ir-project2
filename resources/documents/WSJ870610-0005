Finance ministers of the seven countries yesterday put the finishing touches on the economic coordination plan that they have been developing for a year. Under the new process, the finance ministers would meet regularly to review their countries' economic performance as measured by a specified set of economic indicators. If a nation's economy failed to meet its targets, the plan provides for non-binding &quot;consultations&quot; to consider &quot;remedial measures.&quot;    The seven-nation summit, in its final communique today, is also expected to set a target of next September for agreement on an international plan to &quot;recycle&quot; trade surpluses to partially ease the $46 billion debt burden of the poorest nations, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa. These debts are owed mainly to governments and official organizations. The plan wouldn't address the much-larger debt of Latin American countries, most of which is owed to commercial banks.    The communique is also expected to endorse an agreement, reached last month at a meeting of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that would commit the nations to negotiate an end to agricultural subsidies.    In addition, the communique will, as predicted, reaffirm the agreement reached in Paris in February calling for efforts to maintain the stability of exchange rates, a senior U.S. official said.    The summit nations can be expected to hail these and other economic measures as signs of innovation and unity. But all of these initiatives were being developed in other forums prior to the meeting here. And fissures have opened up among the nations on many of them.    On economic coordination, for instance, Treasury Secretary James Baker had to agree to keep secret both the details of the agreement itself and the periodic economic forecasts it will produce. Britain and Germany fear publicity about the forecasts would create undue pressure at home and abroad for economic action. On the debt plan, the U.S. and Japan last night were resisting efforts by Britain to build in language calling for reducing interest rates on the African loans.    And on agriculture, Germany was arguing as of yesterday against language calling for speed in the removal of farm subsidies. That issue hasn't been resolved yet.    The summit communique will probably contain only vague language on how to jump-start the sagging world economy, because the three major countries don't agree. The U.S. wanted Japan and West Germany to stimulate their economies, and those two countries wanted firmer action on cutting the U.S. budget deficit, perhaps with tax increases. The communique will probably reaffirm previous summit language that the correct policies just need to be implemented.    A senior Reagan administration official expressed hope yesterday that Germany would repeat its pledge of last month to consider added economic stimulus if its growth rate this year seemed likely to fall short of 2%. But a West German spokesman yesterday firmly rebuffed all calls for extra stimulus, saying his country &quot;has gone as far as we can&quot; to spur growth without reigniting inflation.    Meanwhile Japanese spokesmen, basking in qualified praise for their government's recent $43 billion economic package, expressed &quot;concern&quot; about the U.S. budget deficit. But U.S. officials defended the progress in reducing the deficit, and repeated statements by President Reagan threatening to veto any new taxes.    Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said that at the beginning of each year the countries would forecast &quot;over the next three or four months&quot; the movements of seven key economic indicators, which include growth rates, trade and budget balances, and exchange rates. These forecasts would then be discussed within the group, to assure that they are &quot;reasonable,&quot; Mr. Lawson said.    The group would then review the actual movements of the indicators for each country throughout the year, and if a country wasn't meeting its predications, the group would &quot;consult&quot; on what policies are needed to remedy the situation.    The indicators &quot;are a useful framework for the international cooperation we've all resolved to continue and intensify,&quot; Mr. Lawson said.    The finance ministers of the seven nations, known as the G-7 group, would meet three times a year to carry out the coordination plan. Additional meetings would be called if needed.    The countries have agreed to use indicators kept by the International Monetary Fund as the basis of the plan, and the unreleased agreement apparently provides a complicated set of rules and procedures for the coordination system.    The senior U.S. official said that, even though the coordination doesn't mandate economic policy changes, it is important because it establishes &quot;a political process to make it work.&quot;    The debt initiative has been pushed by the French, British and Japanese. Under various plans being discussed, the Japanese would contribute as much as $3 billion toward a tripling of the IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility to $9 billion. The Germans have also agreed to pump extra money into the IMF, and have already forgiven 4.2 billion West German marks ($2.33 billion) in interest and principal repayments from these poorest countries.    The ministers said they attempted to draw together the varying ideas on easing these debts, including possibly stretching out interest-payment schedules and reducing interest rates, in time for endorsement by the IMF next fall. While the interest-rate subsidies are still being resisted by the U.S., &quot;the bullet needs to be bitten,&quot; said Chancellor Lawson.    For the &quot;middle-income&quot; debtor nations, whose debt is mainly owed to commercial banks, the senior U.S. official predicted the summit would reaffirm Mr. Baker's debt-management plan. The Baker plan calls for the countries to adopt growth-oriented private sector reforms, in return for added capital from the commercial lenders and the World Bank.    &quot;There's a growing agreement that there are two distinct debt problems, those of middle-income developing countries, who have the prospect of repaying it if proper policies are followed, and these poorest countries who will never be able to repay it,&quot; Mr. Lawson said.    The officials gathered here are keenly aware that it will take years of hard bargaining at the ongoing trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, to carry out the goal to be adopted here of dropping all farm subsidies. But they are anxious to start the process with a strong endorsement by the world leaders. </TEXT></DOC>
