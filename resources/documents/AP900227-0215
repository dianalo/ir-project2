(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With a handshake and the passing of a set ofkeys, Ford Motor Co. marked a change of leadership and theintroduction of a new Escort that the company says is a prototypeof its global manufacturing strategy.   Chairman Donald Petersen sat at the wheel and his designatedsuccessor, Vice Chairman Harold ``Red'' Poling, rode alongside asthe nation's No. 2 automaker on Monday rolled the first productionmodel of its 1991 Escort, a bright red two-door, off the line atits Wayne assembly plant.   The car, Poling said, ``is a sign of Ford's commitment tobuilding small cars here in the United States.''   With the closing earlier this month of No. 3 Chrysler Corp.'sJefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit, Ford became the onlyone of the Big Three that makes subcompacts in the United States.Sales leader General Motors Corp. gets its small cars, mostlygrouped under the Geo nameplate, from Japanese makers or jointventures in the United States and Canada.   Nevertheless, Ford's new subcompact relies heavily on Japaneseknow-how. Mazda Motor Corp., which is 25-percent owned by Ford,designed the car and has helped Ford gear up its Escort plant usingJapanese production techniques and equipment.   Monday's ceremony took place in the newly renovated WayneAssembly Plant. It's loaded with Japanese influences ranging fromthe obvious _ huge Komatsu stamping presses _ to the not-so-obvious_ a method of manufacturing strikingly similar to that used atMazda's assembly plant in Flat Rock, south of Detroit.   Petersen and Poling, who will take over as chairman whenPetersen retires Thursday after more than 40 years with thecompany, said the Escort project shows how Ford is integrating itsworldwide manufacturing business in Asia, Europe and North America.   Ford is investing $2 billion into the project, code-named CT-20,which also involves production of the Mercury Tracer at thecompany's plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.   Part of the project involves the 900 or so Wayne stamping andbody assembly employees who work under what's called a modernoperating agreement _ a manufacturing method using small teams ofworkers with the ability to perform several tasks.   It is Ford's only such agreement in operation. GM and Chryslerhave similar programs at a variety of their operations.   The Ford agreement was patterned after programs at Japaneseplants, including Mazda's Flat Rock factory, which makes the FordProbe.   As at Mazda's only U.S. assembly plant, workers at Ford's Waynestamping plant wear identical uniforms and coordinate their jobsthrough the use of teams.   Automakers said the concept improves contact between managementand employees and helps productivity by encouraging employees tosuggest how a job can be performed better.   ``Perhaps this will be a new way of doing business,'' said KevinMcGuinness, an industrial engineer who now works in the newstamping operation linked to the main assembly plant.   The United Auto Workers union has said there is a danger in theteam concept eroding the traditional labor-management relationship.   Although Poling said the Escort itself would be unprofitable,Ford is pinning a lot on the subcompact.   The company needs the vehicle to help it meet government fueleconomy standards, which sets average mileage standards that eachautomaker's fleet must meet. The more Escorts it sells, the morelow-mileage, high-profit mid-and full-size cars Ford can sellwithout incurring any government penalties.</TEXT></DOC>
