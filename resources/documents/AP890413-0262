GPA, one of the world's largest and fastest growing aircraftleasing companies, said Wednesday it would announce details of thedeal in simultaneous announcements Tuesday in New York, London andParis.   The company's chief operating officer, James M. King, said he isordering a mix of airplane models manufactured by Boeing Co. andMcDonnell Douglas Corp. of the United States and the Europeanconsortium Airbus Industrie.   ``The manufacturers tell us this would make it the biggestaircraft order in aviation history,'' King said.   King said the aircraft that GPA will buy include wide-bodied andnarrow-bodied planes and engines.   The order includes engines supplied by Pratt and Whitney of theUnited States; Britain's General Electric Co., which has no linkswith General Electric of the United States; and Rolls-Royce PLC ofBritain. It also includes engines supplied by the InternationalAero Engines Consortium, which includes Japanese companies, and theFranco-U.S. CFM International group of engine-makers.   Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes andwould be worth almost $20 billion.   Asked about these figures, King said, ``While I cannot confirm aprecise number to you, the suggestion is substantially correct.It's in the region of 200 aircraft.''   King indicated that a figure somewhere between $11 billion and$20 billion would be nearer the total value of the GPA order.   The largest previous such order was by Delta Airlines of theUnited States last September. Delta placed an order worth $10.5billion with options for a total of 225 Boeing andMcDonnell-Douglas aircraft.   The Engineer magazine reported that Rolls-Royce will supplyengines for 50 Boeing 757s likely to feature in the GPA order.   British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s andA320s which may also be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, themagazine said. GPA has already ordered 40 A320s.   McDonnell Douglas could also win orders for MD-11 and MD-80aircraft and the former may also carry Rolls-Royce engines, themagazine said.   Tony Ryan, the head of GPA, said the deal would leave thecompany three times larger than its nearest competitors in theaircraft leasing field.   GPA _ formerly called Guinness Peat Aviation _ currently owns orleases 172 aircraft with a net value of about three billion dollarsoperating with 64 carriers in 32 countries.   GPA, founded by Ryan in the mid-1970s, is privately owned.   A recent report by London-based investment bankers SalomonBrothers International Ltd. valued GPA at more more than $1billion. The company's net profits for 1988-89 are expected tototal $150 million against $101 million for 1987-88.   GPA has indicated it was considering going public. Ryan holds 10percent of GPA's shares. Other big shareholders include Air Canada,the Irish airline Aer Lingus, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking ofJapan, and the Prudential Insurance Co. of the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
