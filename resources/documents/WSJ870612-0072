For more than a half-century, paper has been made mainly by immersing wood chips in water and chemicals such as sodium sulfite.    This mixture is &quot;cooked&quot; in massive vats, called digesters. The cooking makes pulp of the chips and dissolves their lignin, a glue-like substance that bonds cellulose fibers in wood. Then, as the cellulose pulp dries, the hydrogen in its molecules bonds, forming paper.    But now a Canadian company, Stake Technology Ltd., thinks it has found a better way to make paper. If Stake's process passes muster, it could &quot;revolutionize the pulp industry,&quot; says Gary Palmero, paper and forest products analyst for Oppenheimer andamp; Co.    Mr. Palmero says that, among other things, Stake's process could make papermaking a profitable enterprise for many U.S. companies whose land holdings heretofore have been considered too small to be commercially exploited. In addition, Stake might make papermaking economically feasible in many Third World countries that today depend on imports -- a development that would shake up the global paper industry.    STILL, AS STAKE'S CHAIRMAN, J.M. Kendall, is quick to acknowledge, &quot;The paper industry is very conservative. You're not going to convince anybody that you've got a better process until you build a plant.&quot; Stake is now doing just that.    But the American Paper Institute, the industry's New York-based trade group, doubts that it will succeed. Ronald Slinn, API's vice president for pulp, materials and technology, says one API member firm that worked with Stake-made paper found it to be of such poor quality that its commercial value, at least in the U.S., may be nil. But given the generally lower quality of paper in Third World countries, Mr. Slinn adds, the Stake process could be of value in underdeveloped lands.    Stake's process bypasses the cooking, a step that generally takes several hours. Rather, in a Stake digester, which is only a fraction of the size of a traditional digester, the chips are &quot;exploded&quot; under high steam pressure in one to four minutes. Thus, Stake says, its pulping process can save 50% of the energy it takes to cook wood chips.    There is a catch, however. While the explosion process breaks the lignin bonds, it doesn't dissolve the lignin. And, the API says, paper with lignin still present &quot;discolors after exposure to heat and moisture in a relatively short period of time.&quot;    TO BE SURE, more paper can be had from a tree if the lignin is left in. That not only makes papermaking more economical but also means that a smaller forest is needed to supply a given mill. In fact, about 9% of paper now made in the U.S. is made by various mechanical processes that simply break the lignin bonds through a grinding action.    But for its process to catch on, Stake knows it must deal with the discoloration problem -- and with tearing and other problems associated with paper containing lignin. Thus, Stake, working with Bohuslav V. Kokta, a University of Quebec professor, has devised a chemical &quot;pre-treatment&quot; for the wood chips. Simply put, Stake sprays the chips with sodium sulfite before feeding them into the digester. Unlike in the chemical process, the sulfite doesn't act to dissolve the lignin, Dr. Kokta says. Rather, the sulfite enhances the hydrogen bonding process in the cellulose molecules, he says. Better bonding means better resistance to tearing and discoloration.    Some scientists agree -- to a point. Salmon Aziz, a paper chemist, says Stake-made paper appears superior to mechanically made, high-yield paper in brightness and resistance to tearing. He says that while Stake-made paper may discolor too much to be used for letter and other high-quality grades, it could prove useful for, among other things, paperboard, newsprint, and filler for tissue and other paper products.    But despite successful tear tests by Mr. Kokta, Mr. Aziz cautions that it remains to be seen how well Stake paper will roll up on a papermaking machine.    IN STARKVILLE, MISS., Tor Schultz, a Mississippi State steam-explosion expert, has similar qualms. He says Stake's process runs at such high temperatures that it reduces the length of the cellulose fibers, increasing the chance of tearing. Mr. Schultz is impressed, though, that Stake's process seems to work not just on hardwoods but also softwoods, which contain more lignin and have resisted mechanical high-yield methods.    The Stake process is attractive to analysts like Mr. Palmero for reasons beyond the prospect of energy savings and increased yield. Because the process is feasible on a much smaller scale than conventional papermaking, it could require much lower capital outlays. With its small digester, a Stake &quot;minimill&quot; would cost an estimated $20 million and take nine months to build, compared with some $550 million and three years for a conventional mill.    Such advantages could turn any number of Third World countries -- and also developed nations such as France, which has smallish forests -- into papermaking countries. It could also open up smaller forests in the U.S. and Canada. One Canadian company, Nortek Energy Corp., has signed a letter of intent to operate minimills in western Canada under license from Stake. Nortek, in turn, hopes to acquire an option to exploit the timberland of another, undisclosed Canadian company. </TEXT></DOC>
