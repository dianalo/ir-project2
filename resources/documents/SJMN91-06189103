It seems at the factory a worker didn'trealize she was using toy-leopard material when she made Ruby.;    But Ruby'san optimistic bear. The &quot;S&quot; stamped on her paw stands for &quot;Special,&quot; shethinks. Not so. It stands for &quot;Second,&quot; and it means Ruby's being sent to thetrash, not the toy store. But Ruby's also a feisty bear, proud of beingdifferent.;    In Maggie Glen's heartwarming book, Ruby stands for all ourdifferences.
