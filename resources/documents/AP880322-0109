But Reagan would not say whether he expects Noriega to do that.   Asked by reporters if he would be satisfied should Noriega stepdown but not leave his Central American country, Reagan said, ``Wefeel Noriega should leave Panama.''   Reagan, questioned as he arrived at the Capitol for talks on thepossibility of resuming U.S. aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,was asked if he expected Noriega to agree to leave his nation.   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' the president replied.   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said that thePanamanian people clearly have not been deceived by Noriega'sconditional offer to step down by May 1989.   Redman said Panamanians regard the offer as a ``ploy to buytime,'' a view shared by the United States.   ``The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of Panama,Noriega should leave,'' Redman said.   ``His presence is the root cause of continued political andeconomic instability,'' Redman added. ``The ongoing general strikeis only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelmingopposition from all segments of Panamanian society to Noriega'scontinued rule.''   On Monday, shortly after Panama's chief of state, Manuel SolisPalma, told Panamanians of Noriega's offer, State Department pressofficer Anita Stockman said, ``We stand by our previous view thatNoriega should go, and the sooner the better for Panama.''   Solis Palma said Noriega had given his word ``as an officer anda gentleman'' to step down before Panamanian elections scheduledfor May 1989 if his conditions _ which include talks withopposition leaders _ are met.   William G. Walker, deputy assistant secretary of state forinter-American affairs, said Noriega's offer ``totally ignores thereality of the situation.''   ``Almost everyone in Panama wants him out tomorrow and wants himout of the country,'' said Walker, who was in Panama last week todiscusss terms under which Noriega might step down.   A State Department statement released by Stockman said:   ``We believe the offer is little more than one, a ploy toattempt to legitimize the illegal Solis Palma regime by calling fornegotiations between it and opposition groups and two, an effort onthe part of Noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of thePanamanian Defense Forces.''   Noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in Florida.The United States has dried up the flow of money to Panama, whichuses the U.S. dollar as its currency, in the effort to force himout, and the economy is near collapse.   ``Noriega is the problem, and his preoccupation with remainingon the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will onlyinsure continued economic and political instability there,'' theState Department said.   Noriega put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last weekand rejected a U.S. plan for him to leave Panama and live in Spain.   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was dismissed bythe legislature after he tried to fire Noriega. Delvalle, who ishiding in Panama, is still recognized by the United States asPanama's president.</TEXT></DOC>
