Gorbachev.   High seas and gale-force winds forced a change in the site oftoday's U.S.-Soviet talks to the Maxim Gorky, a Soviet cruise shipanchored off Malta, and cancellation of the opening summitceremonies. But the talks began as scheduled.   Bush took the admiral's barge from the USS Belknap, his summitresidence, to the Maxim Gorky, where he was met by Gorbachev. Thetwo leaders shook hands, and Bush told Gorbachev, ``Let's go towork.''   He told reporters he was ``feeling pretty good'' and that heslept ``fine, just fine ... piece of cake.''   White House officials said Bush awoke at 7 a.m. this morningand, at a breakfast meeting, was given a detailed report on thesituation in the Philippines by Secretary of State James A. BakerIII, White House chief of staff John Sununu and Brent Scowcroft,the national security adviser.   In Manila, renewed fighting was reported today as governmentwarplanes and helicopters hit remaining rebel positions. Rebelswere reported still holding an air base in the central Philippines,and hundreds were gathered outside armed forces headquarters inManila and in the city's financial district. But the Aquinogovernment said the coup attempt had been defeated.   Since arriving in Malta early Friday, Bush has divided his timebetween preparations for his meetings with Gorbachev and updates onthe attempt by rebel military officials to topple the government ofCorazon Aquino. Bush, at the request of Mrs. Aquino, ordered U.S.fighter jets Friday to provide air cover and help the governmentdefend against the coup attempt.   Bush was already over the Atlantic Ocean on his way to Maltawhen Mrs. Aquino asked for U.S. air cover to halt rebel air attacksand keep the mutineers pinned down in two air bases theycontrolled. A few hours earlier, the rebels had bombed thepresidential palace in the most serious effort to bring down Mrs.Aquino since she came to power in 1986.   The president approved the request from aboard Air Force One at12:30 p.m. Manila time (11:30 p.m. EDT), and the decision wasrelayed to Mrs. Aquino an hour later from Washington by VicePresident Dan Quayle, said Roman Popadiuk, deputy press secretary.   ``The process went well under very difficult circumstances,''Popadiuk said, noting that the request came late at night whileBush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were both in flight.   In addition to the Air Force F-4 Phantom jets providing aircover, 100 Marines were sent from a U.S. base to protect the U.S.Embassy in Manila, Popadiuk said.   ``There are no reports of any injuries to Americans, or anyattacks on Americans,'' he said.   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said no U.S.planes had ``fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft.''   Even limited U.S. military intervention could give Gorbachev arejoinder to complaints Bush planned to lodge about Soviet militaryinvolvement in Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua and elsewhere.   Arkady Maslennikov, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet,criticized Bush's decision.   ``Any interference in internal developments, especially byoutside powers, is destructive and leads to deterioration of thesituation,'' he said. ``In any event, the best thing is to allowthe Filipinos themselves to sort it out.''   Popadiuk said Bush's motive was twofold: ``A democraticgovernment has asked for assistance; we have American lives toprotect.''</TEXT></DOC>
