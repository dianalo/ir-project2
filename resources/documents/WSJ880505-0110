Our own Albert Hunt has proposed the Senator for Vice President-Secretary of State, while columnists Evans and Novak propose Vice President-Secretary of Defense.    Part of the idea is that Senator Nunn could carry the South, but needs some extra tempting to take the vice presidency. Another part is that vice presidential nominee Nunn, who favors a lot of weapons systems, would offset presidential nominee Dukakis, who opposes them. The politics of this we leave to the adept, but we have one warning to Senator Nunn. We note that the Senator has been arguing with State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer over the interpretation of the ABM treaty. It turns out that to deal with the constitutional problems of such a dual appointment, the Senator would have to abandon a narrow interpretation and adopt a broad one.    The main problem comes in something called the incompatibility clause. This says, &quot;no Person holding any Office under the United States shall be a Member of either House during his continuance in Office.&quot; Clearly this means no Congressman can also serve in the cabinet. And the Constitution also says &quot;The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate,&quot; and gives him the power to break tie votes. So the constitutional issue is whether this makes the Vice President a member of the legislative branch, and hence ineligible for a cabinet post.    The current fashion is the broad interpretation, which assumes that despite his legislative duties the Vice President is obviously a member of the executive branch. But if you consult the negotiating record, you find a lot of support for the narrow interpretation, that the Vice President is certainly his own man, and at least in part a legislative creature subject to the incompatibility clause.    Incoming Vice President Thomas Jefferson, for example, corresponded with James Madison in 1787 about proper relations with incoming President John Adams. &quot;As to participating in the administration, if by that he meant the Executive Cabinet, both duty and inclination will shut that door to me,&quot; Jefferson wrote. &quot;As to duty, the Constitution will know me only as the member of a Legislative body; and its principle is, that of a separation of Legislative, Executive and Judiciary functions, except in cases specified. If this principle be not expressed in direct terms, yet it is clearly the spirit of the Constitution, and it ought to be so commented and acted on by every friend to free government.&quot;    Jefferson's narrow interpretation has prevailed throughout most of our history, even in recent presidencies. At ceremonial occasions such as the World Disarmament Conference, for example, Vice President Coolidge sat with the Senate, not with the cabinet. Truman wrote that the Vice President &quot;is not an officer of the executive branch.&quot; Eisenhower agreed that Vice Presidents are &quot;not legally a part of the executive branch and is not subject to direction by the President.&quot; His Vice President, Richard Nixon, recalls that he got executive-branch tasks informally, after Eisenhower would &quot;wonder aloud if I might like to take over this or that project.&quot;    The recent trend, of course, has been toward the broad interpretation. In 1957, scholar Edward Corwin, in his book &quot;The President,&quot; wrote that Mr. Nixon could say &quot;that he regards his executive role as higher in obligation and importance than his legislative role.&quot; Even today, though, Vice President Bush keeps a set of offices in the Capitol and has aides there. And as is often true, the Founders' views, in this case the narrow interpretation, carry sound procedural logic.    &quot;Any plan to institutionalize a meaningful role for the Vice President encounters a fatal objection,&quot; writes Joel Goldstein, author of &quot;The Modern American Vice Presidency,&quot; published in 1982. To wit, a President cannot fire his Vice President, and would look pretty silly firing him from a cabinet post while keeping him as next in line for the presidency.    In short, who would really run foreign or defense policy, Mr. Dukakis or Mr. Nunn? Still, in the heat of a political convention, strange ideas do surface, like Spiro Agnew, Thomas Eagleton and Geraldine Ferraro. And until cooler heads prevailed in 1980, Ronald Reagan was tempted to offer Gerald Ford a position much like that envisioned for Senator Nunn.    It would be inconvenient if, say, the orders of a Secretary of Defense were contested in court on the ground that he held the office unconstitutionally. So sometime between now and Wednesday of the Democratic Convention, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Nunn ought to seek some constitutional advice on the broad and narrow interpretation of the incompatability clause. Perhaps Judge Sofaer would oblige. </TEXT></DOC>
