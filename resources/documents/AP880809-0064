Under the treaty, the inspectors may spend up to 24 hours ateach site, with a possible eight-hour extension.   The inspections are part of the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty, under which the United States and the Soviet Uhionare to destroy within three years all medium-range nuclear missileswith ranges of between 300 and 3,400 miles. The treaty gives eachparty on-site inspection rights for 13 years.   Under a 1979 NATO agreement, 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missileswere to be deployed in five European nations.
