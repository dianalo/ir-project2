Mrs. Nickell described Bruce Nickell, 52, as a loving,good-natured husband with a sense of humor. She denied tellingfamily members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring sincethey both stopped drinking in 1979.   ``I believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger'' after thedrinking stopped, the 44-year-old Mrs. Nickell said. ``We got alonga lot better.''   She acknowledged periodic financial problems and stress,including filing for bankruptcy in 1983, but denied that moneyarguments had threatened the marriage or that she saw collecting onNickell's life insurance as an easy solution.   The trial is the first in the nation involving a person chargedwith causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine.   Defense attorney Tom Hillier gently led his client through anemotional recounting of her husband's collapse in 1986. She sobbedearlier in the day as a pathologist described Nickell's autopsy.   On the night of his death, he took four Excedrin, she said. WhenHillier asked her why, she quoted her husband as saying, ``Becausethat's what I need.''   A few moments later, she said, he told her he felt like he wasabout to pass out.   ``He squatted down ... shook his head. He wouldn't answer me. Hestood up ... put his hands on the couch to brace himself, andcollapsed,'' she said.   Mrs. Nickell denied the testimony of her daughter, CindyHamilton, that she had discussed several possible ways to kill herhusband.   Mrs. Nickell said she researched cyanide only after Nickell'sdeath because ``I wanted to know what it was that killed myhusband.''   Asked about testimony by an FBI specialist that 84 of herfingerprints were found on a book on poisonous plants called``Deadly Harvest,'' Mrs. Nickell said she was trying to learn aboutsuch plants to protect her granddaughter and children she babysatfrom any dangers around her suburban Auburn home.   She acknowledged she signed her husband's insurance forms,saying he ``despised paperwork.'' She said she thought he had$25,000 in life insurance.   Prosecutors, who are expected to cross-examine Mrs. Nickell onThursday, contend she hoped to collect on as much as $176,000 ininsurance.   They contend she put cyanide in other over-the-counter painrelievers in order to make her husband's death appear the work of arandom killer.   She is also accused in the death of Sue Katherine Snow, 40, ofAuburn, who died after swallowing an Excedrin capsule containingcyanide in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
