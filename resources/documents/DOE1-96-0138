<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-0138 </DOCNO><TEXT>In conjunction with Applied-B ion diode focusing experiments on PBFA II,we are beginning lithium ion source experiments with a solid lithiumfluoride ``field-enhanced'' source and a liquid electrohydrodynamic (EHD)source. In addition to the conventional electrical measurements, particlediagnostics include a Thomson parabola ion analyzer, nuclear activation,and an ion pinhole camera to measure lithium ion beam energy, purity,and transport. With the accelerator at one-half energy, 9.7 TW of powerand 350 kJ of energy has been coupled into ions from the LiF source,with 80% ion current efficiency at peak power. Nuclear activation diagnosticsindicate that over two-thirds of this ion beam energy was acceleratedas singly-ionized lithium. 11 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
