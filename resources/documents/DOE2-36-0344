The orders of the spherical harmonicexpansions are varied from region to region, according to the physicalcharacteristics of the regions, so that the massive calculations inherentwith high-order expansions can be confined to the regions for which theyare essential. The transitions from low- to high-order expansions aremade at the interfaces of elements. The K/sup +-/ boundary-free maximumprinciple provides a convenient means of optimizing a composite approximatesolution for the angular flux. The way in which penalty weighting ofinterfaces is used to optimize composite solutions is investigated theoreticallyand numerically. The method is illustrated by solutions of two benchmarkproblems. An estimate for penalty weightings is obtained by derivinga central difference analogue of the even-parity transport equation.This provides also a demonstration of the use of admissible, wildly nonconformingelements in a maximum principle.</TEXT></DOC>
