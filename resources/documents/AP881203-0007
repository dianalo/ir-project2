Like the roughly 200 military satellites already deployed inspace by the United States and Soviet Union, the $500 millionLacrosse satellite reportedly aboard the space shuttle Atlantis isnot armed. It is a surveillance satellite, carrying a sophisticatedradar that can look down from space, piercing even cloud cover toreveal what's happening on the ground.   ``As military satellites become more directly applicable toactual combat, they become much more attractive targets fordestruction,'' said John Pike, an expert on space systems with theFederation of American Scientists here.   ``Lacrosse provides a good example of that,'' he said. ``It'sgoing up there to find targets for the new stealth bomber and tolook for long-range targets deep behind the lines in the WarsawPact. Now, if I've got all that riding on my satellites, the Sovietswould be crazy not to try to shoot them down.''   ``Space is already militarized,'' agreed William Arkin, anauthority on nuclear weaponry with the Institute for Policy Studies,a liberal think tank in Washington. ``The question is whether we'regoing to avoid the weaponization of space.''   The United States now has approximately 75 to 80 militarysatellites in space, while roughly 125 of the 150-plus Russiansatellites now in orbit are thought to have some military use. Thenumbers are approximate, because neither government talks about thematter.   The Pentagon, for example, considers the Atlantis launch aclassified military mission for which no information will beprovided. It will neither confirm nor deny that the cargo is aradar-imaging satellite.   As approximate as the tallies are, they demonstrate the growingreliance of the two superpowers on military space systems. It wasonly three decades ago _ in 1957 with Russia's Sputnik _ thatmankind developed the ability to put a manmade object into orbit.   Now, military satellites are in orbit spying on facilities andforces, scanning the radio waves as electronic ferrets, watching fornuclear explosions or missile launches and mapping the Earth'ssurface.   Even the seemingly mundane tasks in space have become importantfor war-fighting. Communications is an obvious example, but thereare others.   For example, the latest generation of navigation satellites helpprovide the pinpoint accuracy now claimed for nuclear missiles likethe giant MX. Among other functions, these satellites allow themilitary to synchronize its watches down to billionths of a second.   And scrutinizing the weather becomes essential in the event of awar. Both the United States and Soviet Union are operating advancedmeteorological satellites to aid low-level bombers, detect solarflares and find holes in cloud cover for reconnaissance work.   The United States now has 20 military satellites of various typeswaiting to go into orbit _ victims of the launch hiatus forced bythe Challenger disaster and unrelated problems with unmanned Titanboosters.   As that backlog is slowly erased, Arkin, Pike and others suggestthe Pentagon _ and perhaps the Kremlin _ will face other problemswith their satellite hardware besides protecting them as temptingtargets.   ``The expense of these new types of satellites is not to bebelieved,'' says Arkin.   ``We're going to have to look at a single satellite the way welook at an aircraft carrier. These satellites alone are costing $250million and up.''   Such complaints don't bother Pentagon officials, because they seeno alternative.   As outgoing Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridgeobserved recently: ``We must put a large part of our investment ...into the satellites which meet mission needs today and tomorrow.Simply stated, we must be able to conduct operations in space, atall times, in any environment _ peace or war.''</TEXT></DOC>
