(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Larry Hagman, who has played the connivingJ.R. Ewing on CBS-TV's ``Dallas,'' for 11 years, says real-lifebusinessmen trust J.R.'s judgment and see the Texas oil man as arole model.   Writing in the Feb. 11 issue of TV Guide magazine, based inRadnor, Hagman says ``J.R. Ewing is the man who America secretlyemulates.''   Hagman writes that people would ``be amazed how many fans I meetwho view him as a real human being and me, I guess, as a kind oforacle who can give them the J.R. they want. On flights, troubledbusinessmen have come to me and asked for advice on how to addressproblems they're having with oil ventures.''   ``Because, for a lot of these people, J.R. isn't evil at all;he's just another executive taking care of business in a tough worldwhere all too often the talk from moralists is cheap andhypocritical.''   Hagman says the admiration of Ewing doesn't surprise him: ``Thinkabout it: Who are the good guys nowadays? The people who aspire topublic service? There is corruption in government everywhere. Ourfinancial leaders? Heck, there are a lot of mini-Ivan Boesky's outthere who, if not breaking the law, are sure bending it until itlooks like a pretzel.''</TEXT><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Coleman Young's lawyers, in their firstcomment on a paternity lawsuit against the 70-year-old politician,blasted a woman's ``media battle'' over the claim.
