SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The last two years have been the warmest inthis country in more than three decades, the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration reported Tuesday.   Both 1986 and 1987 recorded average temperatures for the year of54.0 degres Fahrenheit over the 48 contiguous states, the agencysaid.   These were the warmest years since 1953, which averaged 54.7 totie with 1934 for the warmest year in this century.   By contrast, records going back to 1895 show the normal annualaverage temperature for the 48 states is 52.5 degrees. The coldestyear was 1917, which averaged 50.7.   Tom Karl of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,N.C., said the combination of the position of the jet stream upperair currents and the high pressure center located over Bermuda werecontributing factors in the recent warm years.   ``The more basic thing is why they were in those positions, andthat's more difficult to answer,'' Karl said.   ``The concern everyone has in the back of their mind is if it'spart of the greenhouse gas effect'' that has been reported on, hesaid.   The greenhouse effect is a prediction of computer models, whichsay increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases in theatmosphere could act much like the glass in a greenhouse, trappingheat and raising the temperature of the Earth.   ``It's not clear yet,'' if that is a factor in the warmth of1986 and 1987, ``but it bears watching,'' Karl said.   Until 1986 the average temperature of the United States had beenrunning at or slightly below normal in the 1980s, Karl said, eventhough worldwide temperatures seemed to be on the increase.   In 1986, he said, the spring was particularly warm across thecountry. The winter of 1986-87 and the spring of 1987 also wereunusually warm, particularly in the north-central region.</TEXT></DOC>
