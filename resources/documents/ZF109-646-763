 Tel: (081) 330 7166andM;* DESCRIPTION Relational database.andM;* PRICE 295 poundsandM;* PC USER VERDICT Definitely the one to buy if you're a Windows user and ifyou have lots of hard disk space to spare.andM;* EXCELLENTandM;On 17 November 1941 Sir Max Beerbohm suggested in a letter to The Times thatthe word 'Mister' was &quot;a gross survival from an era which men of good willcan hardly mention without embarrassment and shame&quot;.andP;  To which letter, fourdays later, Osbert Sitwell replied that this suggestion did not go farenough.andP;  &quot;We are still left with our surnames, and this is undemocratic.andP;  Idemand that we should all be called by the same name, as plain a one aspossible.&quot;andM;This idea, almost 40 years before the invention of the PC, hasn't yet beentaken up.andP;  If it had been, our ability to address personal communications tohundreds or thousands of people would have made the use of databases for thepurpose unnecessary.andP;  A simple 'Dear Jill' to ladies, or a 'Dear Jack' togentlemen would have sufficed!andM;Direct mail marketing is just one of the useful purposes to which databasesoftware can be put.andP;  A database is like a magnifying glass, enabling peopleto manage and manipulate far more data than could ever be handled by thebrain.andP;  It's a storehouse for information, that, unlike our minds, can supplyan accurate, organised recall of that information on demand.andM;To be useful, data must first be captured.andP;  Database software will allowinformation to be entered through the keyboard, or else imported from othersources such as text files or other database files.andM;After capture comes retrieval.andP;  This is normally achieved by giving anexample of the data required, and having the software search for patterns ofdata which match the search example.andM;Much is being written about Structured Query Language (SQL).andP;  Although SQL isnow becoming available in PC products, it's not strictly necessary unless thePC database is likely to be used in a distributed application where mainframeor minicomputer SQL queries will be run against data stored on a PC database.andO;All the products reviewed here are capable of finding subsets of records andnone of them uses SQL!andM;As well as permitting direct access to information, database products oftencome with a programming language.andP;  Unlike ordinary ones such as Pascal orBasic these include functions targeted at list management.andP;  These languages,or 4GLs, allow programmers to write an application -- payroll, stock control,or bank cash machine for example -- without having to code or declare all the'primitive' functions required in a database: sorting and indexingalgorithms, for example.andM;Not all of our review products have full applications languages, but some dohave a macro capability, so frequently used sets of actions can be automated.andM;We've chosen a selection of PC databases to examine in the mini-reviews thatfollow.andP;  All are entry-level products, aimed at less sophisticated usersrequiring an easy-to-use database with a modest price tag.andM;SuperBase 2 WindowsandM;Precision Software's SuperBase 2 uses Microsoft Windows to provide agraphical user interface (GUI) for the database.andP;  This is very useful as theprogram can include graphics files as fields in the database, and underWindows 3.0 multi-tasking and use of expanded memory is possible.andM;SuperBase 2 Windows (SB2W for short) is function-rick and capable of quitesophisticated multi-file operations.andP;  At the same time, by way of a series ofcontrol buttons marked like those on a video recorder, it allows first-timeusers to access records instinctively.andM;As with all these reviews, the first job was to get some data into theprogram.andP;  Surprisingly, given its GUI SB2W gives no indication of importprogress being made.andP;  The screen is totally dead while the import takes place-- not even a record counter clicking away -- a very bad use of the graphicalabilities of Windows.andM;Once the data was in, it became clear that SB2W can manipulate data extremelywell.andP;  The creation of composite indexes (based on the concatenation ofseveral fields, or parts of fields) are easily achieved thanks to theexcellent functions built in to the product.andM;Although the programming language available to SuperBase 4 users (DML, orData Management Language) isn't supplied with SuperBase 2, the latter can runall SuperBase 4 applications.andP;  And SuperBase 2 users can use the predefinedFunctions within formula they create in SuperBase 2 fields: formulae aretyped into Filter, validation or calculation fields and strings within thefield definition function of the database.andM;As you'd expect of a Windows product, form design is via an excellentscreen-painter, run as an external program with the full complement ofpainting program tools and options.andM;Perhaps the only drawback that potential SB2W users need to consider is theresources that you'll need to run the program: no less than 5.5Mb of harddisk space (Windows 3.0, not included!).andP;  Compared to the 120Kb of CardboxPlus, this is certainly overkill!andM;Rapid FileandM;Ashton-Tate's Rapid file is a 'Let's get down to business' product with aclear purpose.andP;  Rapid File aims to allow you to use a flat-file list asswiftly as possible to produce mailings and labels.andP;  To that end it has aquite sophisticated built-in word processor, complete with spelling checkerand thesaurus.andM;Rapid File doesn't mess about with fancy graphics -- users have a choice ofLotus-style command menus or pull-down menus.andP;  Because this isn't arelational database, much of the complexity of such products is missing,making for a very quick time-to-efficiency curve for users.andM;Sensibly, Rapid File imports an ASCII comma delimited file without askingusers to create a file definition beforehand, as with Cardbox Plus, ProDataand Professional File.andM;Data can be displayed in a default Table or Form view, or users can definetheir own display format.andP;  Subsets of a file can be saved as snapshots toavoid having to re-run selections over again, which can be time consuming onlarge files.andM;XTree users will appreciate the ability to tag individual records that can'tbe selected by a common criterion.andP;  Unlike SB2W, Rapid File automaticallydisplays a record number with each record (In SB2W you have to create anextra field and program the record number in).andP;  Automatic mailing labelcreation is a particularly nice feature of Rapid File, given the problemsfound in trying to define a mailing label in some other database packages!andO;Label sizes can be picked off a menu and it's a simple job to pop therequired fields from the list supplied.andM;Rapid File also has a moderately comprehensive set of functions forcalculated fields, taking it out of the mailing-management only class ofdatabase.andP;  But you won't want to use it for very large problems, sincethere's a limit of 10Mb on the size of file Rapid File can handle.andP;  However,it's efficient in the way it stores data: my test file occupied just 1.1Mb ofdisk space, compared to 11Mb in Cardbox Plus.andM;SPC Professional FileandM;An update of a somewhat dated product, SPC Professional File 2.0 (PF forshort) makes a good effort at being relational, yet it doesn't quite comeoff.andP;  Table lookups on field will validate and enter related data, but userscan't fill in a field by selecting a value from a true Lookup table.andM;If you're used to slapping a disk in drive A: and typing Install, beware:this product makes you create your own sub-directory (as does Cardbox Plus)and manually copy the files.andP;  Once up and running, you create your databasein an open plan work area, ending field names with a colon.andP;  I find thisapproach less than satisfactory.andP;  In fact, when I tried it the first time, Iforgot the colons and made an utter mess of importing my ASCII records.andM;Also to import data, (unless importing from a dBase file) you have to createa database first with the same structure as the file you're importing beforeyou can issue the import instruction.andP;  This isn't a very intelligentapproach.andM;Although it doesn't have a programming language as such, Professional FGilecan save up to 40 sets of instructions (macros) with each data file, whichcan be replayed at will.andP;  These can be used for regular printing, sorting,searching and import and export functions.andP;  Additionally, using Auto Pilotyou can develop limited applications which can be run by other ProfessionalFile users (there's no compiler, or run-time version of the product currentlyavailable).andM;Composite Indexes can't be built in Professional file, so indexes are usedfor searching rather than creating unique record keys.andP;  The Lookup functionis rather complicated and requires close reading of the manual; fields mustbe assigned identifiers other than their names if they're to be used incalculations of validations, because field names themselves are just placemarkers rather than real objects within the database.andM;On balance, Professioanl File falls between two stools.andP;  Although it'srelatively recent -- 1988 -- it's too complex to be of interest to flat-fileusers, and not rich enough for serious applications developers.andM;Cardbox PlusandM;In today's PC environment, Cardbox Plus is an anachronism, with a fearsome,idiosyncratic interface, which nonetheless continues to evolve.andP;  As it's froma well-established, long-lived UK company, support is always available.andM;It has to be said that Cardbox Plus deserves to perish ignominiously.andP;  Itsdatabase design and layout screens are pure torture.andP;  The authors obviouslydid their work at a time when anything was better than having to do batchwork on a mainframe (1982).andM;The term ASCII comma delimited doesn't even appear in the manual and it tookme some time to work out the differences between Import, Internal and Basicfile formats.andP;  Before a database can exist, a format file must be created.andO;Not only are the instructions not clear, when you actually work out how to doit you almost drop dead in disbelief that such a tortuous procedure is reallynecessary.andM;This old-age pensioner of a database shows its years by using an acronym(EPS) that has long-since beeadopted by the industry to mean somethingcompletely different: EPS here stands for Extended Printer Support (notEncapsulated Postscript -- but I wonder if Business Simultations registeredthe acronym and could claim royalties!)andM;By the time I'd worked out how to use Cardbox Plus, nearly all the time I hadavailable to review it had been used up.andP;  Since it's so very much moredifficult to get started with than any of the other products, there doesn'tseem any point in considering as a contender for today's PC market until theauthors have brought it up to date.andM;Arnor ProDataandM;Despite having a very high opinion of itself (&quot;Prodata contains a number ofunusual and useful features rarely, if ever, found in other databases&quot;),Prodata turns out to be quite a useful database tool.andP;  The user interface isalmost good, although it does slip into Cardbox-Plus-like screen clutter atlower menu levels.andM;Our review of Arnor's ProData got off to a bad start as soon as we tried toimport the test data and crashed out with the helpful(!) message &quot;c-treefatal error #222&quot;.andM;I was inclined to leave it at that, until, when importing the same file intoCardbox Plus, a message told me that a record was in a bad format (an extraquote mark, with the comma delimited boundaries).andP;  Having corrected theproblem, I went back and tried ProData again -- and this time it worked.andP;  Theauthors should try some more intelligible error messages.andM;As a product which is also available on Atari and Amiga computers, ProDataignores the PC's function keys and instead defines its own combinations usingthe Alt and Control keys.andP;  PC users will find this most irritating.andM;Once past the somewhat unorthodox interface, however, users will find thatProData does have significant functionality.andP;  Composite indexes can becreated, custom forms and reports designed and calculated fields plannedusing user-created variables and a decent set of functions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
