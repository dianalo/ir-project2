In classic weasel-word style, the statement avoids any implicationthat the two companies have agreed on any of the issues.andM;Blow-by-Blow DetailsandM;The two companies have not come easily to this point.andP;  After Judge Bunton'sMarch 29 decision enjoining sale of the H8/532 and 68030, Motorolaimmediately filed a motion for stay of injunction pending appeal, which JudgeBunton granted.andP;  On April 5, Hitachi filed a motion to vacate the stay, butthe judge said that he would not rule on that motion until June 18.andM;On June 18, Judge Bunton granted the motion to vacate, reinstating theinjunction prohibiting the sale of both Motorola's 68030 and Hitachi'sHandamp;/532.andP;  The judge's order notes that the injunction had been in place fortwo-and-one-half months, giving the companies ample time to reach asettlement.andP;  He writes,  The parties have chosen not to forge a settlement inthe interim and this Court is not inclined to continue its indulgence.'andM;The reinstatement of the injunction created a flurry of media interest as itappeared that once again shipments of Macintosh computers, HP/Apolloworkstations, NEXT computers, and other products could be halted.andP;  In an oddtwist, HP issued a press release saying that they would not be affected inany case because they have a patent cross-license agreement with Hitachi thatallowed them to make, and to have made for them, products using Hitachi'spatents.andM;Also on June 18, the judge denied Motorola's motion to reopen the casebecause of prior art that Motorola claims invalidates the patent that Hitachiasserts against the 68030.andP;  The following day, Judge Bunton ruled againstMotorola again, denying their motion for reconsideration.andM;Appeals and More AppealsandM;The injunction did not last long, however.andP;  The day after the injunction wasreinstated, Motorola filed an emergency motion for a temporary stay with theU.S.andP;  Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, which was promptly granted,suspending the injunction for up to a week to allow Motorola to file theirappeal of the lifting of the stay of the injunction.andP;  At the end of the week,Motorola did so.andM;Motorola's motion for stay pending appeal tears Judge Bunton's March 29opinion apart, piece by piece, and strongly criticizes the judge's decision.andO;The District Court's March 29 Opinion,' the motion states,  like the trialitself, is notable for its brevity.andP;  Its discussion of infringement is notonly unsound but also ignores the guidelines of this Court.' The motion notesthat 'the Court revealed its distaste for patent suits,' and points outseveral issues that the judge did not address at all, or very briefly, in thedecision.andP;  The impression created by Motorola's motion is that Judge Buntonshot from the hip, based on his gut feel about what should happen, instead ofsticking to the letter of the law.andM;Motorola's motion outlines a multipoint argument for why the 68030 does notviolate Hitachi's intellectual property rights.andP;  These arguments were alsopresented to Judge Bunton, some during the trial and some in post-trialmotions.andP;  The judge denied Motorola any relief, leading to Motorola's appealto the federal courts.andM;Motorola asserts that the 68030 does not infringe Hitachi's patent because itdoes not operate as described in Hitachi's claims.andP;  Furthermore Motorolaclaims that it is licensed to use Hitachi's patent, eliminating any questionof infringement.andP;  Hitachi granted Motorola a license to use all of Hitachi'ssemiconductor patents except for  microprocessor patents.' Hitachi views thepatent at issue as a microprocessor patent, since it is used in amicroprocessor.andP;  Motorola, on the other hand, asserts that it is, in fact, amemory patent, since it is used in the memory management unit and can beindependent of a microprocessor chip.andM;Finally, Motorola asserts that Hitachi's patent is not valid because of priorart, including three prior patents.andP;  Motorola has requested and been granteda re-examination of the patent by the Patent and Trademark Office based onthis prior art.andM;Before the Court of Appeals could rule on Motorola's motion, Hitachi andMotorola issued a statement saying that they were jointly seeking the stay ofthe injunction pending appeal, and had reached an 'agreement in principlethat will serve as a framework for reaching an end to the ...andP;  disputes.&quot;andM;Hitachi isn't any happier with Judge Bunton's decision than is Motorola,since he ruled that the H8 was infringed Motorola's patents.andP;  In theirappeal, Hitachi argues that the judge failed to understand the operation ofthe processor, and thus ruled erroneously that the H8 was a Motorola&quot;microprocessor family product.' The judge ruled that the H8 'executessubstantially the same instruction set' as Motorola's 6800 family processorsbecause the assembly language instructions perform equivalent functions.andP;  Itappears that the judge failed to grasp the significance of machine language;in the judge's interpretation, essentially all microprocessors ever producedare part of one family.andM;What Is Going On Here?andM;This case is not really about patents.andP;  Motorola's 68030 had been on themarket for over two years, yet Hitachi did not make any patent infringementclaims until they were sued by Motorola over the H8.andP;  This case is about along relationship between two companies that went sour.andP;  Hitachi was analternate source for the 6800, 68000, and 6805 family, but Motorola declinedto license Hitachi to produce the 68HC11, 68010, 68020, or 68030.andP;  Th providea growth path for their customer base, Hitachi decided to go their own wayand develop the H8 architecture.andP;  The current litigation is essentially theproperty settlement for this bitter divorce.andM;Motorola apparently felt that Hitachi was making unfair use of knowledgegained from Motorola.andP;  The H8 architecture is clearly not a copy of anyMotorola architecture, however, and the patents Motorola asserts against theH8/532 cover implementation details, not architectural features.andP;  (The sameis true for Hitachi's patent asserted against the 68030.)andM;Motorola was quite threatened by the H8/532, since it is a 16-bit processorand is significantly faster than the 68HC11.andP;  Motorola lost a key design winat Canon to Hitachi, and this apparently provoked their decision to attack.andO;Motorola went looking for weapons against the H8, and the most readilyavailable ones were their patents.andP;  By suing Hitachi, Motorola apparentlyhoped to delay the H8 until Motorola could launch their own 16-bitmicrocontroller, which is due to be introduced later this year.andP;  Hitachidecided to counterattack, and managed to dig up a patent that Motorola'sflagship product, the 68030, could be argued to violate.andM;Sooner or later, the two companies will surely end up with some sort ofpatent cross-license agreement.andP;  How broad the agreement will be, and whetherthere will be any cash or technology changing hands, is impossible to say.andM;Even if we give the companies and their attorneys the benefit of the doubtand assume that a genuine agreement will be reached before the case goes toappeal, we have to question why it has taken so long.andP;  Many millions ofdollars have been spent on legal fees; executives at Apple, HP, NEXT, andelsewhere have endured sleepless nights wondering if their supply of 68030smight stop; and some of the top experts in the country - including the lateBob Noyce - took some of their valuable time to testify in court.andP;  Yet in theend, it seems unlikely that the agreement the two companies eventually reachwill be dramatically different from one they should have reached before thisever went to court.andP;  Whatever the outcome, Motorola will have succeeded incrippling Hitachi's H8 marketing efforts in the U.S., just as Intel succeededin stunting NEC's V20 and V30 sales.andP;  Once again, litigation as a marketingtool has reared its ugly head.andM;Hitachi's'271 PatentandM;Hitachi's case against the 68030 is based on their patent number 4,646,271,titled  Content Addressable Memory Having Dual Access Modes,' applied for on12/19/84 and granted on 2/24/87.andP;  This patent covers a specific circuitdesign technique for implementing cache memory.andM;The invention applies to fully associative caches, which include acontent-addressable memory (CAM) for the tags and a RAM for the data.andO;Hitachi asserts that the address translation cache (commonly called the TLB)in the 68030 violates this patent.andP;  Since instruction and data caches arerarely fully associative, the patent does not apply to them.andM;In a fully associative cache, the 'coincidence&quot; lines from the CAM array,which indicate a match, drive the word selection lines of the RAM array toaddress the appropriate cache line.andP;  The so-called innovation of this patentis to add a multiplexer on the word selection lines, allowing the CAM and RAMarrays to be addressed as a standard RAM.andM;Motorola argues that it is licensed to use Hitachi's patent, but that in anycase, the 68030 does not infringe.andP;  When Hitachi first applied for thispatent, it was denied because of prior art.andP;  To convince the patent officethat there was something new here, Hitachi's attorney emphasized in hiscorrespondence with the patent office (which Motorola's attorneyssubsequently obtained) that the unique aspect of the invention was that thekey (tag) and the data can be stored simultaneously.andP;  Motorola's Motion forStay Pending Appeal quotes testimony from Hitachi's own expert witness, Dr.andO;Pooch, as saying that the CAM and RAM arrays cannot be accessedsimultaneously in the 68030.andP;  This appears to be a potent challenge to theclaim of infringement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
