The shelling was directed at an area inside eastern Thailand'sTrat province, a border area where the guerrillas have herded about7,000 refugees from the U.N.-aided camp of Ta Luan.   The communist Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla gruop opposingthe Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, apparently plan to use therefugees to populate areas of Cambodia from which Vietnamese forceshave withdrawn.   The shelling peaked in mid-November in the most intensecross-border bombardment since 1985. On Tuesday, an aid official whovisited Ta Luan and the nearby Sok Sann camp said he heard ``oneshell a minute'' crashing into the forested hills.   Sok Sann camp is controlled by the the Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front, one of two non-communist guerrilla groups alliedwith the Khmer Rouge. Many of the hundreds of wounded rebels weretaken to Camp 85, a major Khmer Rouge military complex, according toan aid official who quoted sources at Site 8, the largest of fourKhmer Rouge border camps to which the United Nations has access.   The shelling has driven about 3,000 of the refugees from theborder back to Ta Luan, but no information was available on how theshelling affected the refugees.   At the border, the refugees had pitched platic tents while theybuilt huts made of bamboo or papaya trees. The Khmer Rouge told therefugees they must return to the border area after the shellingends, acccording to officials of the U.N. Border Relief Operationand the International Committee of the Red Cross.   The officials repeatedly have asked Thai authorities for accessto refugees who may have been wounded in the gunfire.   Shepard Lowman, president of the agency Refugees International,said Thursday the U.S. government should urge the Thai government torestrain the Khmer Rouge. The Thai military has so far cooperatedwith the guerrillas.   ``We should encourage the Thais, though, to increasingly pressfor greater access to those camps to ensure the people are treatedin a humanitarian way, not carried into Cambodia or forced to servethe Khmer Rouge against their will,'' Lowman said.   Relief officials said most of the shelling now appears to haveshifted to the area around Borai, a Khmer Rouge-run camp of 5,500refugees not far north of Ta Luan.   Sporadic shelling also continued along the northernThai-Cambodian border, where the Khmer Rouge moved 5,000 or morerefugees from another U.N.-assisted camp, O'Trao, located in thenortheastern Sisaket province.   Officials said the guerrillas moved the refugees to at least fourborder locations from which they were planning to move them toCambodian territory as Vietnam carries out the withdrawal of anestimated 120,000 troops.   The Khmer Rouge slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people whenit ruled Cambodia in 1975-78.   Officials of the United Nations, which provides humanitarian aidto the more than 300,000 Cambodian refugees stationed at the Thaiborder camps, said they believe the 7,000 Cambodians alleged to havedisappeared were marched into the Cambodian interior transportingarms to the Khmer Rouge.   About 70,000 Cambodian refugees live in Khmer Rouge-controlledcamps but their fate is largely unknown; the guerrillas generallyrefuse access to outsiders.</TEXT></DOC>
