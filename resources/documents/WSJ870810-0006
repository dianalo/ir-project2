The White House and Pentagon issued statements that the companies named in the report aren't implicated in any illegal diversions, as the newspaper had reported. The statements were issued after the Japanese Foreign Ministry protested the &quot;premature&quot; release by U.S. officials of names of companies that could be merely suspected of such crimes.    Mainichi Shimbun attributed to &quot;Capitol Hill sources&quot; its report that NEC Corp., and one of two other concerns are being investigated by Japanese authorities.    In an unusual move, Stephen Bryen, the Pentagon's outspoken technology-security chief, said in a statement that he had spoken to a Mainichi reporter, but the resulting story &quot;distorted&quot; his views regarding the Japanese government's actions. A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mainichi based part of its story on Mr. Bryen's reference to a call he made on Japanese authorities in December with Fred Ikle, undersecretary of defense for policy. &quot;They discussed several cases, but none of them involved NEC or the other companies mentioned by Mainichi,&quot; the spokeswoman said.    Mainichi's Washington bureau said it won't comment on the Pentagon statement nor disclose the sources for its story. NEC has denied it is under investigation.    The Mainichi story last week sent NEC's stock plummeting in both Tokyo and the U.S. In national over-the-counter trading Friday, NEC closed at $61.375 a share, down 87.5 cents.    Mr. Bryen's and the White House statements praised Japan's &quot;exemplary&quot; actions to guard against further losses of sensitive technology to the Soviet bloc.    The conciliatory gesture, though, didn't totally clear Japan's high-technology industry of suspicions of lax export-control observance. The White House statement also said there are &quot;tentative indications&quot; that companies other than Toshiba Machine Co. of Japan, a unit of Toshiba Corp., and Kongsberg Trading Corp. of Norway &quot;have been involved in illegal diversions.&quot; The statement didn't name any other companies. </TEXT></DOC>
