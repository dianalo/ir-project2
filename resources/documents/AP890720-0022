Eight farmers in Arizona got $132,836 from the AgricultureDepartment under last year's drought aid program, an average ofabout $16,600 apiece.   Most payments, however, averaged far less than those examples,according to financial reports released by the department'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.   Nationally, a routine ASCS report showed recently, approximately$3.78 billion was paid to 789,707 farmers under the DisasterAssistance Act of 1988. Payments by state were listed but thenumbers of farmers in each state were not.   The agency provided supplemental information, including abreakdown of the number of farmers by state, at the request of TheAssociated Press. A sampling of state averages, including the topfive states, was computed by the AP.   Karen Kostoff of the agency's information resources managementdivision said Wednesday the numbers of farmers listed by state wouldnot add up to the national total.   That is because if a farmer has property in two states, forexample, each will show up in the state figures, she said.Nationally, however, the farms under the same ownership are countedas a single unit.   Most of the producers nationally _ 709,222 as of June 30 _benefited because of crop losses due to last year's drought, withsome also collecting under other provisions of the program, such aslivestock feed benefits.   The national figures showed that more than $3.3 billion of the$3.78 billion paid out so far was for crop losses.   On an overall basis of total benefits, North Dakota led thenation with about $407 million received by 49,144 farmers, anaverage of $8,280 each.   Wisconsin was second with nearly $396 million going to 52,285producers who averaged $7,490 each.   Third was Illinois where 98,775 farmers averaged $3,830 each fora total of $378.8 million.   Iowa was fourth overall at $326.5 million, an average of $4,520to each of 72,169 farmers.   Minnesota was fifth with more than $311 million, averaging $5,450among 57,083 recipients.   In all, farmers in the five states collected about $1.82 billionunder the 1988 drought program, accounting for 48 percent of thetotal.   The state with the smallest number of drought aid recipients wasAlaska, where the report showed one farmer collecting $6,640 fromthe government. Rhode Island showed two farmers, but they got only$4,282, an average of $2,141.   California, traditionally the leader in terms of agriculturalsales value, got about $20.8 million in drought assistance, anaverage of $7,260 among 2,864 farmers.   In some of the smaller eastern states, where farms often producehigh-value specialty crops, the averages were relatively high. InConnecticut, for example, 58 farmers averaged $11,453 each for atotal of $664,300.   Kansas, where winter wheat farmers suffered greatly this year asthe 1988 drought lingered, got $61.4 million in aid, an average of$1,740 for each of the 35,255 farmers who got benefits.   Here are the 1988 drought payments as of June 30, by state, asreported by the department's Agricultural Stabilization andConservation Service. State payment averages, however, were notincluded.   The first column of figures is the number of producers for eachstate. The second column, rounded in thousands of dollars, is thetotal amount paid. Hawaii was omitted by the agency.</TEXT><TEXT>   Alabama        9,618  41,767Alaska         1    6Arizona        8    133Arkansas       13,351  44,927California     2,864  20,791Colorado       1,920  8,892Connecticut    58    664 Delaware       316   2,060Florida        1,711  15,790Georgia        11,388  72,139Hawaii         Idaho          5,074  37,032Illinois       98,775  378,792Indiana        43,349  129,379Iowa           72,169  326,535Kansas         35,255  61,418Kentucky       21,183  54,505Louisiana      4,243  34,525Maine          78    559Maryland       2,356  11,886Massachusetts  147   1,900Michigan       23,553  141,580Minnesota      57,082  311,189Mississippi    8,876  42,067Missouri       42,049  120,115Montana        18,775  213,710Nebraska       21,778  33,446Nevada         338   4,991New Hampshire  12    38 New Jersey     905   17,128New Mexico     1,098  5,675New York       3,942  26,821North Carolina 4,426  18,977North Dakota  49,144  406,999Ohio           38,404  116,750Oklahoma       17,573  61,733Oregon         885   6,326Pennsylvania   8,663  39,691Rhode Island   k2    4South Carolina 3,326  18,916South Dakota   35,959  209,958Tennessee      18,334  54,809Texas          47,996  221,510Utah           1,653  11,120Vermont        282   1,277Virginia       3,515  12,959Washington     2,592  16,040West Virginia  3,722  8,478Wisconsin      52,285  395,990Wyoming        1,915  14,101</TEXT></DOC>
