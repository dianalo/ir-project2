Slice-of-life dramas tend to take place in kitchens and living rooms; occasionally, you'll see a gathering place such as a bar or steam bath on the stage. Some computer somewhere must know exactly how many stage scenes have been set in law offices; there can't be many.    So Joe Cacaci's &quot;Self Defense&quot; would be unusual simply by dint of its hero: Mickey Reisman, public defense attorney. As it happens, it also boasts above-average writing, a decent production (originally mounted by New Haven's Long Wharf and now at the Joyce Theater here as part of the American Theater Exchange series) and, best of all, something noteworthy to say.    Instead of following the tried-and-true path of courtroom drama, Mr. Cacaci concentrates on Mickey's professional life outside the courtroom -- in the jails, offices and corridors where his cases take shape. Instead of showing how Mickey wins -- or loses -- them, Mr. Cacaci zeroes in on how Mickey's clients -- accused burglars, child molesters, all the &quot;vermin&quot; of the Bronx -- affect him.    Played with brooding earnestness by Michael Wikes, Mickey is caught in a career crisis that many former idealists will identify with: After seven years, he does his job superbly, but the values that once made it seem worth doing are being overtaken by a cynicism born of the daily grind, the daily, soul-killing concessions to pragmatism.    The case that finally cracks him is the one Charles Cioffi's sardonic district attorney refers to as &quot;the four-year-old and the sailor.&quot; Battle-ready Mickey has a hard time believing what the sailor, nicely played by Jose Santana, and the DA both know and accept -- that in the courtroom, there are three kinds of people: &quot;guilty, innocent and minorities.&quot;    But don't get the idea that this play is just another preachy manifesto about the injustices of our justice system. Mr. Cacaci is too good a playwright for that. His concern is not with hectoring a captive audience, but with delineating the characters he's brought to life.    There's an obnoxious, sleazeball burglar, played to the hilt by Steven Marcus, who has the effrontery to demand that Mickey get him off, even though his unsolicited jail-cell confession has been overheard by two policemen. There's a boozy, hardened defense attorney, acted by Paul Austin, who takes real pride in having got a &quot;murdering SOB&quot; off on a technicality. There's an eager young law student played by Kevin Nova Davis, who learns the hard way about the demands of a legal career. And there's a brilliant woman prosecutor, played by Julia Newton. She is, to the author's everlasting credit, nobody's girlfriend. Indeed, the only character who doesn't quite hold our interest is Eddie Reisman, Mickey's storekeeper brother. Despite Lewis Black's valiant performance, the character exists only to reveal Mickey's neglect of his family, a point that might be conveyed more effectively by a telephone call.    If Mr. Cacaci's characters ring true, so does his tough, zingy dialogue. And the care that has gone into these portraits of people who make their livings in crime and punishment ends, as it must, in making the play more than an on-the-job soap. &quot;Self Defense&quot; is about the big, crucial question of justice, and how it applies in mean, confusing, imperfect places such as the Bronx. But it lets you figure that out for yourself.    My first impulse on leaving the Joyce was to call all the lawyers I know and tell them to get on over there before &quot;Self Defense&quot; closes on Saturday night. But lawyers are probably the very ones to whom the characters and dilemmas in this play are most familiar. They're also the ones most likely to pick up on the little gaffes -- and maybe some big ones -- that always inhabit such plays.    Just being a New Yorker, for example, allows you to notice that the repeated references to the Public Defender's office make no sense, since there's no such thing here; indigent defendants are represented by lawyers from the Legal Aid Society. Similarly, my companion, wise in the ways of New York politics, pointed out that there isn't a district attorney on the planet as reluctant to pose for the news cameras as Mr. Cacaci's is. But even the most nitpicking of lawyers will, I suspect, forgive Mr. Cacaci his factual lapses, given the mitigating circumstances: He's written a fine play.    If the coming offerings of the American Theater Exchange maintain this level of craftsmanship, New York will be fortunate indeed. This is the Exchange's second season of bringing selected regional theater productions here. The inaugural effort last summer was just that -- an effort. &quot;Self Defense&quot; has given this year's series a high standard to continue. </TEXT></DOC>
