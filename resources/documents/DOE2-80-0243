For example, by frequency analyzing the detection signal in gasinsulation switchgear and charge distinguishing the extremely weak partialdischarge in the switchgear from the simultaneously cogenerated partialdischarge in the atmosphere, the detection is possibly expected to beconsiderably heightened in precision. In an example where the on-linefacilities surveillance and diagnostic system was adopted to the aerialinsulation type substation, 9 categories and 158 items of sensed informationabout the main machinery constituting the substation are taken in, digetalsignalized and optically transfered. The site pannel fulfuls the flexiblefunction by the micro-computer and self-diagnostically detects the accident.In the AI applying transformer malfunction diagnosis system (prototype),the symptomatic phenomenon of malfunction inside the transformer canbe diagnosed by the basic input of total quantity of combustible gasand composition of respective gas constituents.
