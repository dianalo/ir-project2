BoonePickens Jr.'s hostile takeover bid for the oil giant.   Unocal Exploration would be merged into Unocal's Union OilCo. of California subsidiary, with Unocal Exploration holdersswapping each share they hold for 0.54 share of Unocal commonstock. Union Oil holds all but 10 million of UnocalExploration's 252 million shares outstanding.</LP><TEXT>   Unocal said the merger is subject to the usual terms andconditions, and is expected to be completed by May 2.Unocal's stock was quoted at $21, down 62.5 cents in latetrading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, whileUnocal Exploration was quoted at $11.375, up $1.50.   In 1985, Unocal formed Union Exploration Partners as amaster limited partnership as part of its effort to fend offMr. Pickens. Mr. Pickens lost his bid for control, but Unocalpaid dearly for its independence by swelling its long-termdebt to $5.3 billion to buy back stock and take other steps.   The limited partnership held about 45% of Unocal'sdomestic oil and natural gas reserves, includingsubstantially all its exploration and production business inthe Gulf of Mexico. Those partnerships, touted by Mr. Pickensand others, had become popular in the industry as anefficient way to pay out cash flow to investors and takeadvantage of tax loopholes.   In 1990, the partnership was converted to a Delawarecorporation and changed names to Unocal Exploration, withholders receiving one share for each partnership unit held.Unocal attributed the conversion to changes in tax laws and ashifting climate for oil and gas exploration.   Several investors filed suits over the change, allegingamong other things that investors lost income and substantialtax benefits. Those cases are pending in federal court, aUnocal spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
