In addition, the Secretary is required to conduct, within 30 daysafter proclamation of such national marketing quotas, a referendum of farmersengaged in the 1988 production of this kind of tobacco to determine whetherthey favor or oppose marketing quotas for such years. For Virginia sun-curedtobacco the 1988-89 marketing year is the last year of the three consecutivemarketing years for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will bein effect for this kind of tobacco.The Secretary is also required: (1) To determine and announce the amountsof the national marketing quotas with respect to fire-cured (type 21),fire-cured (types 22-23), dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured,and cigar-filler and cigar-binder (types 42-44, 53-55) tobaccos for the1989-90 marketing year; (2) to convert such marketing quotas into nationalacreage allotments and announce the allotments; (3) to apportion such allotments,less reserves of not to exceed 1 percent of each kind of tobacco respectively,through county ASCS committees among old farms; and (4) to apportion thereserves for use in (a) establishing acreage allotments for new farms and(b) making corrections and adjusting inequities in old farm allotments.The five kinds of tobacco to which this notice applies account for approximately3 percent of the total U.S. tobacco production.Section 312(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1312(b)) provides that the Secretaryshall determine and announce, not later than the first day of March 1989,with respect to kinds of tobacco specified in this notice of proposed determination,the amount of the national marketing quota which will be in effect forthe 1989-90 marketing year in terms of the total quantity of tobacco whichmay be marketed which will make available during such marketing year asupply of each kind of tobacco equal to the reserve supply level.

Theaggregate total supply for the 1988-89 marketing year is 212 million poundsbased on carryover of 172 million and production of 40 million pounds.Section 312(c) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1312(c)) provides that, within 30 daysafter a national marketing quota is proclaimed in accordance with section312(a) of the Act for a kind of tobacco, the Secretary shall conduct areferendum of farmers engaged in the production of the crop of such kindof tobacco harvested immediately prior to the holding of the referendumto determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to such quotasfor the next three succeeding marketing years.
