Richard Fowler, a former midlevel Boeing marketing official, was accused by an Alexandria, Va., grand jury of gaining unauthorized access to 100 classified Pentagon documents from 1979 to 1985.    Mr. Fowler's indictment earlier this week on theft, fraud and conspiracy charges could be a major breakthrough in the government's almost five-year-old drive to stamp out illicit trafficking of classified Pentagon budget and planning documents among defense contractors.    This alleged black market for secret documents could &quot;provide a competitive edge to anyone in the business of supplying the {military services} with tactical and strategic weaponry,&quot; according to June Brown, the Defense Department's inspector general.    In addition to Boeing, investigators have said they are looking at a number of other major defense companies suspected of trafficking in secret government documents.    Mr. Fowler has declined to tell the government or the company who supplied him with the documents. Prosecutors clearly hope that by charging Mr. Fowler, they can persuade him or others in the industry to begin cooperating with the grand-jury probe, according to government and industry officials familiar with the case.    At the same time, investigators are stepping up efforts to identify senior Pentagon officials suspected of methodically supplying Mr. Fowler with secret materials, including three National Security Council decision documents signed by former President Reagan or his national security adviser. So-called NSC decision directives are among the most closely guarded documents in the entire government.    Boeing officials didn't have any immediate comment; Mr. Fowler declined to comment.    Boeing fired Mr. Fowler after investigators began looking into Boeing's activities, and the company has provided the Justice Department with large numbers of documents and agreed to have several current officials testify.    The grand jury, among other things, charged Mr. Fowler with improperly passing on to Boeing officials and other contractors copies of classified memos and detailed budget materials prepared for the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top military leaders.    Mr. Fowler wasn't authorized to handle such sensitive documents, according to the indictment. The government also contends he didn't have authority to include the documents in unclassified reports he sent to superiors.    In some instances, according to the indictment, Mr. Fowler obtained documents specifically requested by officials at Boeing or other contractors. And prosecutors contend he removed the &quot;secret&quot; classification stamp from some of the documents before sharing them with others.    The indictment indicates that all three NSC documents dealt with a proposed space-based anti-missile shield, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.    For Boeing, which generally has avoided criminal charges that have bedeviled some of its competitors, the latest developments could mean big trouble. At the very least, the aerospace giant faces the expense and visibility of months of further investigation by the grand jury.    Moreover, the indictment charges that some of those involved in the alleged conspiracy with Mr. Fowler created bogus files and kept &quot;a separate set of log books&quot; to hide the existence of the secret documents from Pentagon officials. But it doesn't identify any other individuals under investigation.    Boeing has told prosecutors that Mr. Fowler corrupted its security procedures, and that Pentagon officials failed to follow up early warnings that there weren't mandatory receipts for some documents found in the company's files.    The Boeing investigation began, and is being pursued, independently of the massive Pentagon bribery and influence-peddling probe code-named &quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot;    The on-again, off-again grand-jury probe of widespread document-swapping first garnered public attention in 1985, when a GTE Corp. unit pleaded guilty to charges that it conspired with a consultant and others to illegally obtain classified electronic-warfare documents from the Pentagon. But many of the other charges collapsed, and the grand-jury investigation remained largely dormant until early this year.    Pentagon officials, for instance, relied on administrative rather than criminal proceedings to downgrade Mr. Fowler's security clearance from top secret to secret before it was finally revoked after he left Boeing. But in the face of congressional criticism and new orders from top Justice Department prosecutors, the probe was revived in the past few months and additional subpoenas were issued for Boeing documents.    ---   Rick Wartzman in Los Angeles contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
