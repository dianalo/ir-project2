We've written frequently that reducing the top marginal rates on taxable income creates an incentive for high-income producers to stop wasting their time and money chasing tax shelters, produce more income and expose more of that income to direct taxation.    A few weeks ago, the Treasury Department released two printed pages showing that the share of tax payments by the top 1% had climbed from 18.1% in 1981 to 26.1% in 1986, the period of the Reagan tax cuts. And that there was a 21% increase in their share of payments from 1985 to 1986.    These numbers caused the opposition army to get out its crossbows and start firing off cavils and qualifications, lest the dreaded supply-siders hold any patch of ground for more than a day.    Fred Greenstein of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington (actually, all the cavilers are in Washington): &quot;In fact, they are paying a smaller percentage of their income than before, but their incomes have gone up so much that they still wind up paying a larger percentage of the total tax take.&quot;    Joseph Minarik of the Urban Institute: &quot;To the extent that you add taxpayers at the bottom who aren't paying much, you expand all the percentiles and tend to increase the share of the highest percentile.&quot;    Last week, the ever-clever Michael Kinsley in the Washington Post forged stream after stream of income data to plant his flag: &quot;Affluent people, far from shouldering an ever-greater share of the tax burden, aren't even keeping up with their rising share of the nation's income.&quot;    We look forward to rolling around in the percentiles and percentages with these tireless soldiers for years to come. But we believe the debate has arrived at a point where it doesn't have much of anything to do with what the numbers said. It has to do with &quot;the rich.&quot;    For instance, a writer for the Guardian of London wasted little time on the data recently in commenting on Nigel Lawson's dramatically reduced British tax rates. This decision, he succinctly noted, marks the passing of &quot;the last vestiges of the postwar consensus,&quot; namely &quot;that the very rich deserve to be clobbered a great deal harder than persons of standard means.&quot;    This clarity of position has found its way to the American tax debate. In an article titled &quot;The Populist Tax Act of 1989,&quot; published in the Nation magazine, popular Washington tax guru Robert McIntyre builds his case around a recurrent theme, which we've boiled down here to its essential elements:   &quot;Stop coddling the rich . . . the rich . . . the rich . . . this elite group . . . the richest 1% . . . that golden group . . . the rich have got much richer . . . the richest 5% . . . the wealthiest 1% . . . the richest percentile . . . the richest 1% . . . the rich had grabbed . . . tax cuts for the rich . . . the richest five million American families . . . bonanza for the wealthy . . . tax giveaways . . . the richest 5% of the population . . . tax cuts for the wealthy . . . the rich . . . the rich . . . the rich . . . the very rich . . . the wealthy . . . truly rich people . . . the richest 5% . . . the super-rich . . . the wealthiest 1% . . . taxing the rich . . . the wealthy . . . the richest 1% . . . the richest 20% . . . those who can most easily afford to pay more . . . begin with the rich . . . those who have been enriched the most.&quot;    We'd say it is a sign of progress in the never-ending dispute over the efficacy of supply-side tax cuts to know that the data attacks are a diversion. For the opposition, the primary purpose of taxation is to ensure that some percentage of the American population is being sufficiently and consistently clobbered. </TEXT></DOC>
