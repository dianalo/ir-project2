The object: to guess how many outraged feminists, indignant mothers of 12-year-old boys and overwrought librarians will write in to deep-six their subscriptions after seeing the swimsuit issue.    This year for the first time, senior editor Julie Campbell participated in the pool, putting $1 on 11 cancellations and $1 on 36. It's a nice little two-piece irony, since she's been in charge of producing the controversial and hot-selling issue from its inception in 1964.    &quot;Twenty-four years ago there wasn't a Super Bowl,&quot; explains Ms. Campbell, who is in her early 50s. &quot;The last football game was on New Year's Day and the January issues were very skinny. So the managing editor asked how I'd like to go out and do a resort story with a pretty girl on the cover. That was three pages. We're at 36 now.&quot;    Last year, for example, Sports Illustrated's average weekly circulation was just over 3.15 million. The swimsuit edition with model Elle MacPherson on the cover (she did the honors again this year to the chagrin of impassioned fans of model Kathy Ireland) sold a record 4.57 million copies. SI business staffers are expecting an even bigger sale this year.    &quot;I can't tell you what the mystique is,&quot; said Ms. Campbell. &quot;What makes it unique is that we do it once a year and that it's in a sports magazine. I hope we always do it in good taste. Maybe that's the drawing card.&quot; Or perhaps the drawing card is that Elle et al. have, if you'll pardon the expression, a &quot;girl next door&quot; quality.    But those wholesome looks aren't the only requirement. &quot;I don't hire anyone who I know is going to give me trouble,&quot; says Ms. Campbell, who conducts three-to-four-hour screening interviews with prospective models. &quot;We talk about anything. Cooking, boyfriends, travel, clothes,&quot; she says. &quot;I look to see if she's animated or if she's moody, if she has a quiet personality. I see how she relates to me, if she likes women, if she can take direction. I'll give up a little beauty for character and animation any time. I know I'll get a better picture.&quot;    In addition, Ms. Campbell will ask a candidate to try on a bikini or maillot if she doesn't already have a swimsuit photo in her portfolio. But such vigilance doesn't necessarily prevent surprises. &quot;The first time I saw Kelly Emberg and Carol Alt they were very young,&quot; recalls Ms. Campbell, who brings some 500 bathing suits on location. &quot;And we got down to Florida and they had such slim hips they looked like little boys from the back so we could only photograph them from the side.&quot; She adds, &quot;Christie Brinkley had the best hips in the business. Women don't like hips but men do.&quot;    Ms. Campbell, probably more than a lot of women, knows what men want, but she doesn't always give it to them. &quot;If you're guided by what the audience wants all the pictures would be the same. If I made every picture look like a pinup I'm sure our audience would like it but it would be boring. Ultimately, I try to please my managing editor. He's the boss,&quot; says Ms. Campbell, who comes home from a shoot with some 17,000 pictures and winnows them down to about 140 for final consideration. &quot;Some managing editors like more skin than others, some look for action shots, some look for moody pictures.&quot;    What Ms. Campbell looks for is the great picture, a task that becomes harder every year. After all, whether in Florida, California, Hawaii, Virgin Gorda, Australia, Kenya or Thailand (the site of this year's portfolio), she's working with the same basic elements: beach, water, sky, swimsuit and model.    &quot;The most harrowing time is when it rains, and this year it rained every single day except for two days in six weeks. We stayed on schedule,&quot; she says. &quot;We got up at 4 a.m. to get to the location by dawn and hope the sun would come out.    &quot;You're wringing your hands. You've got a model for seven days and she has to tan for two and do her fittings. So she could go off and you won't have a single picture of her.&quot;    No, it's not all a tropical delight putting together the swimsuit issue. On James Michener's favorite beach in Hawaii, a model suffered a splintered shinbone and thereafter had to be photographed from the knee up. Ms. Campbell broke her toe in Virgin Gorda, was bitten by a dog in Mexico, had her purse stolen in Kenya, came distressingly close to a deadly King Brown snake in the Australian outback, and watched model Paulina Porizkova breathe into a paper bag after one too many poses in freezing weather.    On the plus side, models are much more toned up and more shapely than in the late '60s and early '70s, so Ms. Campbell doesn't need to bring falsies on location any more.    Then, there are the changes in Ms. Campbell herself. On location, she used to work in a bikini, then a two-piece bathing suit, then a one-piece, then a racing suit. &quot;And in the last few years I've worked in Bermuda shorts,&quot; she says. &quot;The models will all say 'I want my picture taken with Julie,' and you feel like Beauty and the Beast.&quot;    After the shoots are finished and The Issue hits the stands in mid-February, SI braces for the letters. They come with proposals of marriage for the models and inquiries about where to purchase the suits featured. (Johnny Carson's office reportedly called one year requesting one of every suit in the issue.) They come, with photos, from actresses, female weight lifters, body builders, women ranging in age from 14 to 60 who want to be the SI cover girl. &quot;This one doesn't look to be naturally well-endowed,&quot; says Ms. Campbell, studying one such picture with horse trader's eyes.    It is difficult to know how the cancellation pool will deal with the letter from the man who explained he was writing from the post office to renew the subscription &quot;while my wife is at home canceling it.&quot; The wife of Ms. Campbell's own dentist doesn't allow the issue in the waiting room.    When people complain to Ms. Campbell about the amount of skin in the issue, she is at pains to remind them that the anatomy lesson is not compulsory. &quot;I say you don't have to read it; you don't have to buy it.&quot;    But Ms. Campbell doesn't believe that absolutely anything goes. &quot;I don't want to make the issue too sexy because I don't want to paint myself into a corner. Every few years I'll pull back,&quot; she says. &quot;And I'm always next to the photographer, and if I see a shot that's very provocative I sometimes accidentally step in front of the camera or go fix something on the model and I tell her to turn.&quot;    Now it's all over for this year. Ms. Campbell has the cancellation pool to look forward to, but mostly she wants to go to the beach. &quot;A lonely beach,&quot; she adds. Not that she's tired of her job, but, she says, &quot;sometimes I wish I could photograph something that doesn't talk back, that I could just arrange in a nice composition. Something like ski boots.&quot;    ---   Ms. Kaufman is a New York free-lance writer who swims every day. </TEXT></DOC>
