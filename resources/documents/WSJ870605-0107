The 10-minute program, titled, simply, &quot;Kinnock,&quot; worked so well that Mr. Kinnock's personal approval rating shot up 19 points and has held steady. Labor played it again last night on all four British television channels.    &quot;The response to it has been unprecedented in this country,&quot; says Tony Beeton, the Labor Party's chief broadcasting officer. &quot;We are broadcasting it again because thousands of people have requested it. It's a first. We've never seen anything like it.&quot;    The program was put together by director Hugh Hudson and writer Colin Welland, whose previous credits include the movie &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot; They have completed a second program, portraying Mr. Kinnock as a statesman &quot;and the next prime minister,&quot; to be shown Monday night. About 30 million Britons go to the polls next Thursday.    Labor strategists figure 20 million people saw &quot;Kinnock&quot; the first time. Millions more watched it last night.    In the most recent public-opinion polls, Labor is closing the gap with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's front-running Conservatives. The Gallup poll puts the Tories at 40.5%, with Labor second at 36.5% and the Alliance of the Social Democrats and Liberals beginning to come awake at 21.5%. A poll in today's Guardian gives the Conservatives a 10-point lead over Labor, but that is down from a 12-point gap a week ago.    &quot;Kinnock&quot; is a very American kind of commercial, which is no accident because the people who made it have studied American political broadcasting.    It opens with a shot of a jet fighter streaking across open countryside. The plane dissolves into a dove as strains from Brahms and Beethoven replace the whine of the jet's engine. It is the only part of the presentation suggesting that Labor has a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament.    The camera moves in closely on Mr. Kinnock's youthful, smiling face, his bald crown ringed in flaming red hair. &quot;I think that the real privilege of being strong is the power that it gives you to help people who are not so strong,&quot; he says.    The program is barely under way, and Mr. Kinnock has shown he is young, masculine and compassionate. He is 45 years old; Mrs. Thatcher is 61. Polls suggest voters don't think Mrs. Thatcher cares enough.    Mrs. Thatcher and her advisers are clearly rattled by Labor's unexpected surge. They have been holding emergency strategy sessions late into the night in which there has been talk of dumping their advertising agency, Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, to compete against the socialists' campaign. But time is running out, and the &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; team is ready to strike again.    Mr. Kinnock continues to campaign with vigor and humor, appearing to be very much the same man the voters saw in the TV biography. Mrs. Thatcher, on the other hand, seems tired and perhaps a little worried -- though she should benefit from TV coverage of her short participation at the Venice economic summit.    The &quot;Kinnock&quot; show is good enough to have had an impact under almost any circumstances. But the circumstances under which it was broadcast were so special that it came to set the tone for the entire campaign. It is difficult to think of any other TV commercial, British or American, that can make such a claim.    First of all, Labor wasn't supposed to know how to run a media campaign. Four years ago, Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, on behalf of the Tories, easily outmaneuvered an inept Labor campaign. So Labor's professionalism this time came as a surprise to both the Conservatives and the Alliance.    Second, there was Mr. Kinnock himself. His strategists and poll takers have long known that most British voters have only a fuzzy idea of what kind of man he is. Part of his problem was Mrs. Thatcher, whose powerful personality has dominated the stage for almost a decade. People generally respect Mrs. Thatcher, but not many really like her.    Opportunity, then, beckoned.    &quot;It was back before Christmas when we began thinking what we would do with our media,&quot; says Labor's Mr. Beeton. The Labor strategists didn't know then when Mrs. Thatcher would call the election -- she could have waited until next June -- but guessed it would be sooner rather than later.    &quot;We figured we wanted to produce a Kinnock biography to fill this void about him in the minds of the voters,&quot; Mr. Beeton says. The only debate was whether to kick the campaign off with it or wait for a ripe moment later on. The decision: Use it as the kickoff.    Mr. Beeton and his colleague, Tony Robinson, vividly remember when Hugh Hudson brought the finished tape into party headquarters for a screening.    &quot;We just sat there,&quot; Mr. Beeton says, &quot;and when it was over and the lights went on, nobody said anything. There was complete silence for maybe 20 seconds. We all knew we had something very special.&quot;    Adds Mr. Robinson: &quot;It simply left us speechless.&quot;    The program is officially a party election broadcast, not a commercial. There aren't any paid TV commercials in British elections, but each party is given free time on all four channels for as many as five of these programs. Most are inexpressibly dull.    In &quot;Kinnock,&quot; after the candidate quickly puts across his youth, masculinity and compassion, his aunt, Sadie Jones, comes swimming into focus to reminisce about young Neil. She is followed by his Uncle Bill. They are all Welsh, and this is very down-home Welsh. Mr. Kinnock talks about his wife, Glenys. &quot;I am married to a woman of high intelligence and great independence and immense warmth,&quot; he says. Cut to Neil and Glenys, hand in hand, walking across spectacular Welsh countryside, faces sometimes turned, windblown, to the sea.    He is saying here to people who haven't known much about him that he is a good family man, with a strong wife and supportive children. They appear, too. (Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis, fairly or not, usually is portrayed as a comic figure. Their son, Mark, has sometimes been a problem.)    But is Neil Kinnock too young, too inexperienced?    Sir James Callaghan, the former Labor prime minister, handles that one deftly in the program. He notes that people complained William Pitt was too young when he became prime minister at age 25. &quot;And his reply was, 'Yes, I know I am young and inexperienced, but it is a fault I am remedying every day.'&quot; Perfect, and the Labor strategists say it wasn't even scripted.    There's more, with more Beethoven and Brahms, more gorgeous scenery. It all ends with a single word on the screen: Kinnock.    It is a classic, and, for now at least, it has turned this election into a horse race instead of a coronation. </TEXT></DOC>
