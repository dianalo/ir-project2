(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advanced navigation satellitecircled Earth today, boosted into orbit on the inaugural liftoff ofthe Delta 2, the first of the post-Challenger space rocketsdeveloped to launch vital military payloads.   ``It was in every way a picture perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, said after Tuesday'ssuccessful liftoff. ``The satellite came up very strong and we'rereceiving a good signal.''   The Delta 2 is the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets thePentagon is ordering in a $14 billion program to launch much-neededreconnaissance, navigation, communications and other nationalsecurity satellites.   About 40 of these payloads have been grounded for lack of alaunch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded three yearsago, killing seven astronauts.   As a result of the accident, the Air Force decided it was amistake to abandon unmanned rockets and to use the shuttle for soleaccess to space. It ordered three new rocket systems, themedium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the large, more powerful Titan 4.   The Delta 2 was the first to fly. On its debut, it carried intoorbit the $65 million Navstar Global Positioning satellite, thefirst payload removed from the shuttle manifest to a throwawayrocket.   The satellite entered an initial elliptical orbit ranging fromabout 100 to 11,000 miles above Earth. On Thursday, an on-boardmotor will be fired to shift the satellite into a circular orbit ofabout 11,000 miles high.   The 3,675-pound satellite is an advanced version of of sevenearlier model Navstars currently in orbit. It will enable U.S. andallied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks tolocate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the AirForce plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, givinganyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioninginformation.   The original plan was to launch all 21 on NASA's space shuttlefleet. But that idea was scrapped after the Challenger explosion.Now, only two remain scheduled on the shuttle.   The Air Force has ordered 20 Delta 2s from McDonnell Douglas, 23Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and 11 Atlas 2s from General Dynamics.It is negotiating for 26 more Titan 4s.   The Titan 4 is scheduled to make its first flight next month. TheAtlas 2 debut is set for next year.</TEXT></DOC>
