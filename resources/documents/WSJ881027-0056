The company, which had said it would report a decline in third-quarter earnings, has seen its profit margins squeezed by rising manufacturing and advertising costs.    Sales for the quarter were $539.4 million, compared with $408.4 million. In the year-ago quarter, the maker of athletic shoes posted profit of $49.7 million, or 44 cents a share.    The performance was in line with analysts' expectations. Alice Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, said she still expects the company to earn $1.40 to $1.45 a share for the year, compared with $1.49 for 1987.    Reebok's shares rose 12.5 cents to $11.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    &quot;We are by no means satisfied with these results and are continuing to take those actions we consider necessary for improvement,&quot; said Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer.    Paul Duncan, chief financial officer, said Reebok has been looking for ways to restrain operating costs. Mr. Duncan also said Reebok has been diversifying its manufacturing sources to help offset rising costs associated with the appreciation of the South Korean currency. About 90% of Reebok-brand shoes were made in South Korea two years ago; that proportion will be down to around 60% by year end because of expanded production in Thailand and in China, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
