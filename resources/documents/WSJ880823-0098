Within days, new President Corazon Aquino created the Presidential Commission on Good Government to hunt for the missing fortune. The panel was armed with sweeping powers to investigate and to take suspects to court.    Expectations were high. The commission's original chairman, Jovito Salonga, now president of the Senate, initially suggested $5 billion to $10 billion could be recovered. Politicians and the press proposed ways of spending the anticipated bonanza on everything from land reform to fighting communists.    More than two years later, only about $162 million in assets, less than half in cash, has been recovered, mainly from a few negotiated settlements with alleged cronies. Nothing has been obtained from the Marcos family.    The complexity of the alleged abuses has proved too much for the country's creaky legal system. Partly because of ambivalence about whether Manila wants Mr. Marcos to return from his Hawaii exile to stand trial, no criminal charges have been filed. (Last week, a Philippine court said Mr. Marcos had the right to come home in November to be present during testimony of a former government minister scheduled to give a deposition against him. Both Mrs. Aquino and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said they would respect the decision.)    Meantime, allegations are flying that the Good Government Commission itself has gone bad. The attacks led last month to the resignation of the commission's chairman, Ramon Diaz, and prompted a round of investigations of the old investigators. Legislators have refused to renew the panel's power to sequester assets, and some congressmen have called for its abolition. Public disillusionment has grown.    &quot;We are considered downright disreputable,&quot; says Jose Laureta, one of five commissioners on the presidential panel.    Even if a revamp comes, many lawyers and political analysts believe the best bet for recouping substantial wealth quickly is through negotiated settlements with Marcos associates, or even Mr. Marcos himself. &quot;If they choose the legal route, we'll all be dead before it's settled,&quot; says Victor Africa, a lawyer embroiled in a dispute with the commission.    But the settlement approach is sure to draw fire from Filipinos who view it as a cynical capitulation. The commission's travails illustrate the difficulty of disentangling the web of favoritism and corruption that characterized business and politics during the 20-year Marcos regime. They also demonstrate how well-intended plans can bog down in the rivalries and bureaucratic turf wars that permeate public affairs in the Philippines.    The intrigues reached a climax last month. First, the country's outspoken solicitor general, Francisco Chavez -- who had been working with the commission to prosecute cases -- accused it of &quot;incompetence and corruption&quot; and demanded that its chairman, Mr. Diaz, and three other commissioners resign.    Mr. Diaz, a founding member of the commission, rejected the allegations and suggested that Mr. Chavez quit. Mrs. Aquino ordered both men to shut up and take 60-day leaves. Mr. Diaz angrily resigned. He then withdrew his resignation. Then he resigned again and flew to India for a vacation.    A few days ago, Mrs. Aquino replaced him, but by then the commission's reputation was in tatters. Congressman Emigdio Tanjuatco, a leading critic of the panel, complains that the members &quot;got too busy trying to manage companies rather than filing evidence and prosecuting cases.&quot;    Part of the commission's current problems can be traced to the haste with which its officers were selected in the Aquino government's chaotic early days. With only a few full-time investigators and lawyers, the panel faced a huge task. Abroad, it had to ferret out secret bank accounts and an array of property often hidden behind nominees and proxies, and prove that these belonged to the Marcoses and their cronies.    In Switzerland, nothing approaching the billions once said to be tucked away in secret accounts has surfaced. A commission official says the &quot;best-educated guess&quot; of Swiss lawyers involved is that $600 million to $650 million may be stashed in Marcos-related accounts.    The commission says the Marcoses have properties valued at $400 million to $450 million in the U.S. Since the assets are mortgaged for more than $300 million, the most Manila hopes to get is $150 million -- and that only after legal battles.    At home, the commission's job was more difficult. It had to throw a net over scores of companies, thousands of acres of land and assorted properties accumulated by the Marcos-era elite. These include a stable full of Mr. Marcos's Arabian stallions at the Manila Polo Club, 28 aircraft, several yachts, 15 fur coats and a vault full of Mrs. Marcos's jewelry.    Critics, including Mr. Chavez, say some officers in charge have botched the job. Attorney Sergio Apostol complains he can't find a client's ship that was sequestered by the commission.    So far, the panel has filed 39 civil cases involving more than 300 defendants. But in most cases, hearings can't proceed until all the defendants have been served summonses and brought within the Philippines' legal jurisdiction.    No criminal cases have been brought to court, although the commission is trying to prepare several, if only as a whip to drive cronies to the bargaining table. Some lawyers think negotiated settlements with alleged Marcos cronies may be the most practical way for the commission to complete its task.    &quot;There's this impression that the hidden wealth is somewhere out there and all the government needs to do is reach out and grab it for its use,&quot; says Mr. Laureta. &quot;That, unfortunately, isn't the case.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
