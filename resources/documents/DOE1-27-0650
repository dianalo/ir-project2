This report is the outline of the research. As demonstrationtests, independent loaded operations and system interconnection operationswere conducted with good results. A battery controller was installedand with it, the battery was charged from the relatively low voltagedsolar cells through a compilation process to the extent that the highvoltage necessary for the input power of the inverter was obtained successfully.In addition, a AC switch was provided on the inverter system side sothat the above small scale solar system might be separated from the powersupply system at the time of paralleling off the latter, thus providingan additional function to be operated as an uninterruptive power supplyfor the intrasystem load and obtained good results. Furthermore, it wasarranged that the battery could also be charged from the power supplysystem. (7 figs, 3 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
