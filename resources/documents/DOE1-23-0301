However, the flexibilityof the language and its multitudinous options can both intimidate andconfuse a casual user of SAS. How can the full power of SAS be integratedin such a way that end-users with limited training can perform theirown analyses without sacrificing flexibility? This paper describes howSAS has been integrated into a menu-driven system which can be adaptedto an extensible set of SAS procedures in a dynamic data environment.The system operates under VMS and utilizes the DIGITAL FMS Forms ManagementSystem. 1 ref., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
