(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bill to require registration ofsemiautomatic assault rifles was killed Wednesday, and Louisianalawmakers said it was unlikely the ``Sportsman's Paradise'' wouldadopt any gun legislation this year.   Gun control proponents said rural legislators had failed toappreciate the problems of violent crime in New Orleans and othermetropolitan areas.   The House Committee on Criminal Justice deferred action on thebill, effectively killing it.   Sponsor Rep C.R. Jones said he at least wanted to get theattention of the committee ``that something needs to be done.''   Rep. Diana Bajoie gave up earlier on her bill to prohibit thesale and possession of assault weapons.   ``I sense the mood of this committee but sooner or later we'regoing to have to keep these weapons out of the hands of people whouse them for the wrong reasons,'' Bajoie said.   Backers of bills to set waiting periods for handgun buyers saidthey expect no better luck when their measures are consideredThursday.   What gun control advocates failed to consider is that Louisiana,where license plates read ``Sportsman's Paradise,'' is a largelyrural state where hunting and owning guns are ways of life, saidRep. Ed Scogin.   ``You outlaw guns and only the outlaws will own them,'' saidScogin.   Jones said that a few months ago, a teen-ager in New Orleansstole a shipment of Israeli-made Uzi assault weapons from a boxcar.   ``He was selling them in the projects for $80 apiece,'' saidJones. ``A 16-year-old has been charged with killing someone withan Uzi.''</TEXT></DOC>
