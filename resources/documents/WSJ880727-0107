The National Republican Senatorial Committee, joined by GOP Senate candidate Rep. Beau Boulter of Texas, had asked that the funds be held up. They argued that the Democrats were getting an unfair financial advantage because of the dual campaign of Mr. Dukakis's running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who is simultaneously running for vice president and for re-election to the Senate. Sen. Bentsen is expected to spend $10 million or more on his Senate campaign.    Lawrence Noble, FEC general counsel, found the GOP complaint lacking, however. &quot;Nothing in the campaign finance statutes or regulations requires Senator Bentsen to withdraw from the Senate race or prohibits him from using private contributions to further his senatorial campaign,&quot; Mr. Noble wrote, adding that only clear evidence of fraud could justify a delay in paying the federal funds.    The three Republicans and three Democrats on the FEC approved payment. The GOP senatorial committee said it will appeal the case today in federal court here. </TEXT></DOC>
