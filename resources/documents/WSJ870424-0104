Until 35, the magazine explained, you were considered young. From 35 to 55 was middle age. And then, the real big chill: old age.    Evelyn Havens laughs about that, because this is 1987 and she is 70 and she was just getting ready to go to Dallas to run in her 26th marathon.    Mrs. Havens calls herself &quot;the ancient marathoner.&quot; Besides running, she does gymnastics and swims, and takes vitamins -- &quot;a carload, to increase my stamina.&quot; She is bright-eyed, animated and humorous, and in great shape.    The growing number of busy, vigorous people in their 60s, 70s and 80s -- Mrs. Havens has a jogging buddy, Max Popper, who is 83 -- are poking large holes in the stereotypes about old age. But a lot of the population doesn't seem to notice. &quot;Younger people treat you as though you're a child,&quot; Mrs. Havens says tolerantly. &quot;They raise their voices when they talk to you; they think you're stone deaf.&quot;    In 1987 the definitions of what &quot;old&quot; means and who is old have grown much more complicated. And that complicates the expensive and difficult job of making public policy for the elderly. Bernice Neugarten, a professor of sociology and education at Northwestern University, believes new terms of discussion -- such as &quot;young old&quot; and &quot;old old&quot; -- are needed.    &quot;Age shouldn't be the basis (for deciding policy),&quot; she says. &quot;Age is a proxy for the characteristics you're really trying to address. Age is a very poor predictor these days.&quot; Older people, she says, are &quot;the most heterogeneous age group.&quot;    When the American republic began, life expectancy was 35. Now it is 75, and bizarre disparities result. Lots of today's older people have bodies that physically test out at several decades less than their ages. Robert Butler, head of the department of geriatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, recalls a family in which a healthy 85-year-old woman cares for an ailing 65-year-old, her child.    &quot;More than 50% of 85-year-olds are going concerns,&quot; says Dr. Butler. But many 65-year-olds are ready for the rocking chair. Clearly genetic factors figure in these disparate patterns of aging; diseases that strike some people at 60 leave others (and their progeny) untouched until 80 or later. Science strains to learn what parts of the aging process are programmed. And it wonders about the effect of psychological factors on the process.    Nathan Billig, a psychiatrist and author of a new book on depression in the elderly, argues that &quot;something is wrong&quot; when older people are more or less &quot;given permission&quot; to be depressed because their lives are difficult. That, he says, is a &quot;prevailing stereotype&quot; that actually may lead to the illness -- yet another affliction for the old person. &quot;Depression shouldn't be equated with old age,&quot; he says.    Marion Perlmutter, a psychologist and gerontologist at the University of Michigan, notes some &quot;inevitable loss of muscle strength&quot; and &quot;some reordering of knowledge&quot; as people age, but says older people with exercise programs maintain their health. And she suggests that compensatory skills are developed in body and mind to make up for loss of quickness or dexterity.    Whatever the problems of categorizing the old, their numbers and variety are increasing swiftly. People 65 and older, who now number about 12% of the population, will be a solid 20% by the turn of the century, according to Census Bureau projections. The numbers of those 85 or over, now 1% of the population, are growing three or four times as fast as any other age group. And the Census Bureau thinks there will be more than 100,000 centenarians by the turn of the century.    -- Stay Alert, Stay Alive   Liver, and please for heaven's sake no more bickering about it, has been stricken from the menu at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan.    This is gerontocracy in action: hard work, but worth it. Sylvia Shaub is satisfied. The residents' council, of which she is chairman, heard the anti-liver perorations from numerous residents, considered the pro-liver minority and came to a decision: Out with liver. Management acquiesced.    The issue seemed minor, like others that Mrs. Shaub, 76, and the council discuss at the regular meetings: where people should be allowed to smoke, items disappearing in the laundry, which lights should be turned on or off at night, whether a nurse's aide has been a little brisk, et cetera.    But Thomas Spicuzza, chief social worker at the home, explains that these in fact are crucial matters. Old people in an institution, just like everybody else, want control over their lives, down to what they eat and wear, how they are treated by the people around them and how their rooms are decorated.    Control, autonomy and a sense of responsibility; those are prime purposes of the council. In the wheelchair confines of a nursing home -- or outside it -- those things have much to do with the health, happiness and probably the longevity of older people, say psychologists and psychiatrists.    &quot;I'm interested; I like people,&quot; Mrs. Shaub says in explanation of her role on the council. One of the things she gets to do is tell residents in the mornings what the menus and planned activities are for the day. &quot;I always finish up by saying, 'Have a good appetite and have a pleasant day,'&quot; she relates.    Judith Rodin of Yale University and Ellen Langer of Harvard studied two nursing-home groups; one was managed conventionally, the other was prompted to make choices and take on responsibilities. The latter group, the researchers reported, showed improved mood, sociability and vigor. A follow-up indicated that members of the group lived longer, too.    The goal, says Ms. Langer, is to promote &quot;mindfulness&quot; in nursing homes. It isn't easy. Staff and inmates tend to slip into institutional habits. One study found that 22% of the remarks made to residents by staff qualified as &quot;baby talk.&quot;    But only 5% of the aged population is in nursing homes. The problem is just as challenging for the other 95%. Prof. Perlmutter notes a theory among child psychologists: the Pygmalion effect. A child perceives the high expectations of his elders, and lives up to them.    &quot;It seems to be true with old people, too,&quot; she says. But when the old people have &quot;negative images&quot; of themselves, this Pygmalion effect can't occur. The solution, says this researcher: Older people should have challenges.    For example, exercise. The older person who feels that he is just waiting for the end likely won't be motivated to get out and be active. But science still is counting the benefits for those who are. Indeed, many of the maladies of aging can be reversed, as with osteoporosis, the loss of bone strength that particularly plagues older women. Studies show a gain in bone mass among older people in exercise programs.    High morale seems to go hand-in-hand with a strong immunity system, and that may have powerful consequences for dealing with cancer, heart disease and other mortal maladies. Stress studies among recent widows and widowers suggest that low morale is closely related to disease susceptibility.    If this is what they call an attitudinal problem, Mrs. Havens, the ancient marathoner, has it solved. &quot;I'm so happy to be alive when I wake up every morning, it sets me up for the whole day,&quot; she says.    --Why Do We Get Old?    The messy eventuality of death seemingly is programmed into the genes at birth. The upper limit of human life is stuck, in any case, at around 112 years. But there are mysteries galore to be unraveled about the biology of aging.    What causes the machinery to degenerate? And can science intervene to delay or reverse the process? Fountains of youth aren't on the medical agenda. But other benefits are. An extension of life expectancy -- already a steadily rising curve -- for an increasing number of people is a continuing goal. And research into the biology of aging automatically involves learning more about many diseases, such as cancer, that become more common with advancing age. (Several groups of researchers reported recently that they had identified a gene linked to the brain abnormalities characteristic of Alzheimer's; it was a big step towards understanding that so-far incurable disease).    Many researchers would agree with Stanford University biologist Philip C. Hanawalt, who told a conference on aging not long ago of his &quot;intuition and basic point of view&quot; that &quot;aging is controlled by genes and programmed into the developmental pattern of an organism. Thus, life itself may be considered a terminal 'disease' to which we are all committed long before birth.&quot;    The notion of programmed or &quot;deterministic&quot; aging is a major area of study, explains Mount Sinai's Dr. Butler. The orderly switching on and off of genes controls the development of the human organism, so maybe aging also is programmed into the genetic matter.    It may be that entire organ systems are involved. Two chief candidates for the role of &quot;pacemaker&quot; are the hormonal, or endocrine, system; and the immune system. Roy Walford of the UCLA medical school notes that the immune system declines with age to less than 30% of its peak functioning in youth. So aging could reflect a self-destructive process permitted by a failing immune system.    A second major category of research, says Dr. Butler, explores so-called random events that produce accumulating damage to cells and organs, leading eventually to crucial failures. The best-known theory is of damage caused by &quot;free radicals&quot; -- highly reactive oxidants that are a result of taking in oxygen. It may be that the free radicals damage DNA. Researchers have noted that creatures consuming a lot of oxygen in proportion to their size -- mice, for instance -- have short life spans.    J. Fred Dice of Tufts University is experimenting with notions that the cellular system of &quot;trash disposal,&quot; as Dr. Butler puts it, becomes deficient, that aging cells make mistakes in disposing of some proteins and letting others remain. It is hoped that recombinant DNA techniques might correct the flaws.    Stanford's Dr. Hanawalt and others are focusing on DNA damage and repair as a major determinant of aging. He hopes to learn about the &quot;pattern of gene regulation in programmed aging&quot; and maybe to probe the mechanisms of cancer and genetic diseases. The goal: &quot;To eventually help more of us attain the full potential life span of our species.&quot;    Dr. Butler says: &quot;The field of aging (studies) really just started. This is relatively new territory.&quot;    -- America the Elderly   Date: around the year 2000. Scene: the political arena. Combatants: retirees clamoring for their Social Security and Medicare benefits vs. Baby Boomers (going gray themselves) who are reluctant to foot the bill.    A couple of decades later, the conflict gets much stranger. The Baby Boomers have reached retirement age, and the following generation -- a much smaller one, the Baby Busters -- is even less interested in paying the truly huge bills for its elders.    These scenarios of strife may be far-fetched. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) says its polls show younger people strongly in support of programs for the elderly, and older people concerned about not being a burden to their children. The U.S. political system has proved resourceful and equal to the challenge in such crises before.    But the demographic projections and other extrapolations are scary. In 1985, by Census Bureau calculations, there were almost five Americans of working age to provide support for each person over 65. By 2030, that ratio will be less than 3 to 1, and could be as low as 2.2 to 1. Planners already talk about Medicare going bankrupt by the end of the century. The cost of medical care is rising much more swiftly than inflation.    The notion of Baby Boomers as affluent Yuppies with BMWs is askew. A huge proportion of them are downwardly mobile, holding service jobs, paying a steadily increasing proportion of their income for housing -- in short, unlikely to welcome sharply rising tax payments for their elders.    &quot;A broad wave of anxiety is going to sweep across our institutions&quot; as the outlook becomes clearer, predicts Paul Hewitt, president of Americans for Generational Equity, a Washington lobbying group.    Planning and programs to deal with the crisis already should be well-advanced. But they aren't; Americans aren't good at focusing on long-range problems. &quot;It's a hard issue for people to get hold of,&quot; says Daniel Callahan, director of the Hastings Center, a research group that studies ethical issues in the life sciences.    Mr. Callahan, noting &quot;horrifying&quot; projections for Social Security and Medicare, calls himself a pessimist on the issue. &quot;We will begin squeezing people,&quot; he predicts. &quot;The young will end up squeezing the elderly. We'll probably have to ration health care in some way.&quot; He sees the recent sharp increase in Medicare deductibles as an early sign of that.    Elaine Brody, director of human services at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, worries about friction on the issue. &quot;The well-being of the generations is interlinked,&quot; she says. John Rother, legislative director for the AARP, says that if younger people seem uninterested in acting on the problem now, they will warm to the issue as they age themselves and self-interest becomes a factor.    &quot;Bold imaginative leaps&quot; are needed, warns Mount Sinai's Dr. Butler. There is some agreement among gerontologists that the catastrophic-care program now on the agenda in Washington isn't the answer. &quot;The basic problem for old people is long-term care, day-to-day help,&quot; says Mrs. Brody. &quot;Chronicity is the name of the game now. The whole system needs to make this shift.&quot;    ---   Mr. Northrup is a former Wall Street Journal staff reporter.    ---                     Living Longer in America               Life expectancy (at year of birth)                                Male              Female    1900                        46.3 years        48.3 years    1905                        47.3              50.2    1910                        48.4              51.8    1915                        52.5              56.8    1920                        53.6              54.6    1925                        57.6              60.0    1930                        58.1              61.6    1935                        59.9              63.9    1940                        60.8              65.2    1945                        63.6              67.9    1950                        65.6              71.1    1955                        66.7              72.8    1960                        66.6              73.1    1965                        66.8              73.8    1970                        67.1              74.7    1975                        68.8              76.6    1980                        70.6              77.4    1985*                       71.2              78.1   *Estimated   Sources: National Center for Health Statistics;Metropolitan Life Insurance                        The Older Worker   11% of people over age 65 still work; their numbers, byoccupation:    Service                             531,000    Sales                               464,000    Administrative support     (clerical)                         388,000    Executive, administrative,     managerial                         348,000    Professional                        339,000    Farming, forestry, fishing          319,000   Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1986                Living Arrangements After Age 75                                Male              Female    Living with spouse          62%               20%    Living with someone     other than spouse          13                43    Living alone                18                43    Living in an institution     (such as a nursing     home or hospital)           8                13   Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 1985</TEXT></DOC>
