Background</ITAG>Questions were raised concerning the need to define ``relatively insignificant''as it is used in 42.708, and to provide more guidance concerning the quick-closeoutprocedure. The phrase ``relatively insignificant'' is defined through theuse of two parameters: (1) The unsettled indirect costs applicable to anysingle contract cannot exceed $500,000.00 and (2) unless otherwise providedin agency regulations, the cumulative unsettled indirect costs to be allocatedto one or more contracts for a single fiscal year cannot exceed 15 percentof the total estimated unsettled indirect costs allocable to cost-typecontracts for that fiscal year.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because it does nothing more thanclarify existing coverage. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has,therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businessesand other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning theaffected FAR section will also be considered in accordance with section610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 89-610(FAR Case 89-40) in correspondence.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changesto the FAR do not impose recordkeeping information collection requirementsor collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members ofthe public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et.seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 42</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.
