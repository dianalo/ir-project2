Photothermal ionization spectroscopy under uniaxialstress reveals that the complexes A(H,C), A(H,Si), A(Be,H), and A(Zn,H)have trigonal (C{sub 3}/sub v/) symmetry. Each has two (1s)-like acceptorlevels which shift, but do not split, under stress. In the fourfold basisfor a {Gamma}3((T/sub d/) level, simultaneous diagonalization of theperturbations of applied stress, and of a trigonal lowering of symmetry,yields theoretical piezo- spectroscopic behavior in quantitative agreementwith all available experimental data. This procedure has been extendedto predict the stress-induced shifts of (1s)-like shallow acceptor levelsassociated with tetragonal (D{sub 2}/sub d/) and rhombic-I (C{sub 2}/subv/) complexes in germanium, should these ever be observed experimentally.The four trigonal complexes in germanium are to be contrasted with A(Be,H)in silicon, in which the rapid tunneling of hydrogen leads to recoveryof tetrahedral symmetry and a much more complicated energy-level structure.</TEXT></DOC>
