DPR-80 and DPR-82,issued to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operationof the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Units Nos. 1 and 2, located inSan Luis Obispo County, California.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS)by revising the surveillance test frequency of the turbine stop valves,the governor valves and the intercept valves associated with the turbineoverspeed protection. Specifically, the proposed amendments would reviseTS 3/4.3.4, ``Turbine Overspeed Protection,'' to (1) change the frequencyof stroke testing of the main turbine valves from weekly to quarterly and(2) change the frequency of the direct observation of valve movement fromevery 31 days to quarterly. The amendments would also delete a footnoteto TS 3/4.3.4 that is no longer applicable.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendments dated January 22, 1988.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed revision to the TS is required to: (1) Reduce the number ofthermal and pressure cycles on the plant; (2) reduce the amount of liquidand solid radioactive waste that results in a reduction in personnel exposure;and (3) reduce the potential for inadvertent reactor scrams.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe TS. Since the evaluation demonstrates that the operating parametersare not affected, the proposed revision does not increase the probabilityor consequences of any accidents, no changes are being made in the typesof any effluents and the change would reduce the amount of effluents thatmay be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowableindividual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed revisionto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendments.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 18, 1988 (53 FR 17806). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the Diablo Canyon NuclearPower Plant dated May 1973, and its Addendum, dated May 1976.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmentalassessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendments dated January 22, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the California Polytechnic State University Library, GovernmentDocuments and Maps Department, San Luis Obispo, California 93407.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of April, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George W.
