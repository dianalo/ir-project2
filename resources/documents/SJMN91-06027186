CoronerGeorge McCormick, a forensic pathologist who performed autopsies on theShreveport victims, also said Florida officials had not requested his reporton the Nov. 4, 1989, deaths. He said it was premature to conclude that a casehad been made because of promising evidence. Officials last week named DannyHarold Rolling, 36, a Shreveport man, who is already wanted for trying to killhis father, as the suspect in the students' stabbing deaths in August.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PATHOLOGIST SEES HASTE IN GAINESVILLE ARREST  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  114  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
