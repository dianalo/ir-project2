 The products selected for this report exemplify the recentadvances in interconnection technology, ranging from management features, tomulti-protocol capability, to significant price/performance improvements.andO;The products are discussed in alphabetical order by vendor name.andM;ACC Unveils Local Ethernet Bridge/RouterandM;Advanced Computer Communications (ACC) announced the addition of IP routingto the ACS 2100 Local Ethernet Bridge at INTEROP '90, held in San Jose, CA,Oct. 8-12.andP;  The enhancement means the ACS 2100 will support simultaneousbridging and routing between local Ethernet segments.andP;  According to ACC, theACS 2100 lets users build integrated multi-protocol networks and at the sametime use IP routing.andM;ACC says that when network traffic reaches a point where segmentation isrequired, the ACS 2100 will partition the network.andP;  For network connectionsthat require both bridging and routing, the ACS 2100 enhancement combines thefeatures of MAC-layer bridging and IP routing.andP;  TCP/IP packets are routedbetween Ethernets, while all other network protocols are bridged.andP;  For thosepackets that are bridged, address tables are automatically teamed.andP;  Routingtables are built and maintained using dynamic routing protocols.andM;The ACS 2100 is targeted for small- to medium-sized networks typically foundin departments or divisions.andP;  The ACS 2100 works as a local compliment toACC's Series 4000 line of remote bridge/router products to form large,integrated networks.andM;The ACS 2100, list-priced at $3,250, provides a sustained throughput rate of12,500 packets/second and supports such industry-standard protocols asstandard or thin-wire Ethernet connections, the Simple Network ManagementProtocol, and the IEEE 802.1 Spanning Tree Algorithm.andM;Information:  Marianne McCarthy, Public Relations, Advanced ComputerCommunications, 720 Santa Barbara Street, Santa Barbara, California 93101;(805) 963-9431.andM;ACC Adds Support For IPX And XNS Routing ProtocolsandM;Expanding the options for users of its bridge/router products, ACC alsoannounced at INTEROP 90 that it has enhanced its Series 4000 bridge/routerproducts to support the Ungermann-Bass and Xerox Corporation XNSimplementations and Novell, Inc.'s IPX protocol.andP;  Targeted for multi-protocolenvironments, the company's Series 4000 line of internetworking productsalready routes TCP/IP and DECnet packets and bridges all other protocols.andM;Packaged on a single diskette, all software is included with each device,allowing users to employ those bridging and routing functions needed.andP;  As aremote bridge only, the Series 4000 automatically learns network addresses.andO;For multi-protocol environments, users can also implement routing protocols(IP, DECnet, IPX, and XNS) to complement the bridging function.andM;Series 4000 XNS implementation supports Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP),Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Error Protocol, and Echo Protocol.andP;  Thebridge/router's implementation of IPX supports Novell NetWare LANs runningthe Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) and RIP.andP;  The ACS 4100 platform offerstwo WAN and one LAN port for $5,500; the ACS 4400 provides up to eight WANand four LAN connections and  ranges in price from $6,500 to $18,500,depending on configuration.andP;  All Series 4000 products support industrystandards such as the IEEE 802.1 Spanning Tree Protocol, the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP), IEEE 802.3 standard Ethernet (10BASE5), IEEE802.3 Thin Wire Ethernet (l0BASE2), and IEEE 802.3 Unshielded-Twisted-Pair(10BASE-T).andM;BBN Introduces New T/20 Internet Packet RouterandM;BBN Communications has announced the T/20 Internet Packet Router (IPR), agateway/router that interconnects multiple networks using DDN X.25, Ethernet,token-ring, Tl/El, or X.25 protocols.andM;The T/20 is the standard platform used by BBN to customize router productsfor specific government applications.andP;  It is the platform which BBN is usingas:andM;-    Gateways for the US Air Force under contact to Rome AirandM;Development Center and DARPA (this program is known asandM;SNIPE/RIG SDI Network Interface ProcessingandM;Element/DARPA Research Internet Gateway)andM;-    Routers in the Integrated Tactical-Strategic DataandM;Network (ITDN) Demonstration for the ITDN SteeringandM;GroupandM;The T/20 IPR can be configured based on a variety of features, including thesource and destination addresses, the user protocol field, the networkinterfaces which the packet arrived on and will exit from, and the transportlevel &quot;port&quot; field.andM;The T/20 provides IP service to local-area or campus-area networks runningover wide-area networks such as the DDN and private X.25 networks.andP;  It alsohas the capability to form an internet backbone when connected with trunklines to other T/20 IPRS.andP;  It is certified by the Defense CommunicationsAgency for connection to the Defense Data Network.andM;BBN Communications also markets the T/200 IPR as part of its internetworkproduct portfolio.andP;  The T/200 is a multi-protocol, multi-media router thatsupports such protocols as TCP/IP, DECnet, XNS, IPX, AppleTalk, and X.25 inaddition to Spanning Tree bridging.andP;  BBN markets this product to itsgovernment customers as well as to the commercial marketplace.andP;  The T/20 andT/200 IPRs are a family of products which can be used in the same network orinternetwork.andM;The T/20 IPR dynamically routes Internet traffic over the best available path(defined as the path with the lowest cost) and provides transparent alternaterouting.andP;  Two types of routing are supported:  interior and exterior.andP;  Thecombination of these algorithms permits a collection of T/20 IPRs to bemanaged as a separate autonomous system and also allows the exchange ofrouting information with other systems of gateways to facilitate inter-systemcommunication.andM;The T/20 IPR provides regular status, performance, and fault information viathe SNMP protocol to BBN Communications-supplied and/or -operated NetworkOperation Centers (NOC) or any SNMP client configured to monitor the T/20internet.andP;  The NOC acts as the overall reporting, access, and controlfacility for the T/20 IPR.andP;  It requires no central resource for real-timeoperation.andM;The product architecture is based on an MC68020-based processor called theB14, which was designed and developed by BBN.andP;  The basic configurationconsists of an enclosure which contains a power system, disk subsystem, andone B14 processor board with communications adapter cards.andM;Standard features of the T/20 include:andM;-    Interior routing among T/20 IPRs using an adaptedandM;version of BBN's SPF (Shortest Path First) or ENAPandM;(External Network Advertising Protocol) routingandM;algorithmsandM;-    Exterior routing using EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)andM;to exchange routing information with other systems ofandM;gatewaysandM;-    Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)andM;-    Support for high-speed trunks between T/20 IPRs whichandM;can run at speeds up to 2.0 Mbps (Tl/El rates)andM;-    Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 (w/ARP)andM;-    4-Mbps token-ring/IEEE 802.5andM;-    DDN standard X.25 interfaceandM;-    RS-232, V.35, RS-449/422/423, Mil.andP;

(617) 873-2479.andM;New Internet Router From cisco Makes Major Price BreakthroughandM;A single-board, two-port internetwork router said to make high- performancerouting as cost-effective as traditionally less expensive bridging has beenintroduced by cisco Systems, Inc.andM;The Integrated Gateway Server (IGS), priced starting at less than $5,000, issaid to offer the same software functionality of cisco's high-end routers,including routing support for 15 communication protocols.andP;  Options includeconcurrent bridging capability and support for the emerging frame-relaydata-transmission standard.andM;The IGS comes in two versions:  a &quot;local&quot; version with two Ethernet portsthat either connects two adjacent Ethernet LANs or segments an Ethernetbackbone (e.g., isolating a departmental network from a corporate network),and a &quot;remote&quot; version with one Ethernet port and one high-speed (up to 7Mbps) serial port that can serve as a link between remote satellite officesand corporate headquarters, or between two LANs across a city or country.andM;The IGS provides filtering speed of 19,000 packets per second and forwardingspeed of 6,000 packets per second.andP;  The IGS board is housed in a compactchassis measuring 13 by 14 by 4 inches.andP;  It includes a 16-Mhz MotorolaMC68020 processor serving as the main system controller; 1 Mbyte of systemmemory (expandable to 4.5 Mbytes using SIMMs); eight 32-pin sockets for theROMs from which IGS software directly runs; and 16 Kbytes of non-volatilememory for on-board storage of network configuration information.andM;The remote IGS version has a generic 50-pin connector that interchangeablyaccepts modem interface cables supporting RS-232, RS-449, or V.35 interfaces.andM;The IGS/L (local version) is priced at $4,995 and the IGS/R (remote version)at $5,495, each with 1 Mbyte of on-board memory.andP;  Concurrent bridgingsoftware is priced at $450 for either version.andP;  X.25/packet switch software(supporting Frame Relay) for the remote version is $750.andP;  Both versions willbe available in November.andM;Information:  Jeff Paine, cisco Systems, Inc., 1525 O'Brien Drive, MenloPark, CA 94025; (415) 326-1941.andM;Priority Queuing Feature Implemented On cisco RoutersandM;In another note, cisco Systems has added to its internetwork router/bridges asoftware feature that lets users assign priorities to classes of data sentover a network, said to maximize service on low-bandwidth congested serialinterfaces.andM;Cisco's new &quot;priority output queuing&quot; feature is a mechanism for prioritizingdatagrams, typically classified by protocol (e.g., TCP, DECnet, AppleTalk,bridging) or sub-protocol (Telnet, FTP, LAT, electronic mail) type.andP;  It isdesigned as a way to let the user specify the data types most important tohis/her application (e.g., TCP/IP over DECnet, terminal traffic over filetransfer) and ensure that those types are transmitted first over aninterface.andM;According to cisco, priority output queuing addresses the problem of heavilyloaded, low-bandwidth serial interfaces, generally 56 Kbps or slower.andP;  Ciscoalso noted that priority queuing is especially useful in internationalnetworks, where bandwidth is often most expensive.andM;Priority output queuing works by classifying datagrams according to variouscriteria and queuing them on one of four output queues.andP;  When the router isready to transmit a datagram, it scans the priority queues in order, fromhighest to lowest, to find the highest-priority datagram.andP;  When that datagramhas been transmitted, the queues are scanned again.andM;Priority output queuing will be available as a standard feature (no extracost) with cisco routers shipped beginning in November.andP;  Existing units canbe upgraded under cisco's software maintenance program.andM;Hughes LAN Systems Spans Protocols With ProBridgesandM;Hughes LAN Systems (HLS) recently announced the availability of the ProBridgefamily of LAN bridges, consisting of five new internetworking products whichoffer Ethernet, token-ring, and broadband bridging with SNMP networkmanagement.andM;Included in the family is the ProBridge 8033 Ethernet/Ethernet bridge, theProBridge 8133 Remote Ethernet Bridge, the ProBridge 8032Broadband-to-Ethernet Bridge, the ProBridge 8233 Ethernet- to-BroadbandBackbone Bridge, and the ProBridge 8235 Token Ring- to-Broadband BackboneBridge.andP;  This new family replaces and enhances Hughes's LocalNet 8000 seriesof bridges.andM;A standard feature of the Intel 386-based ProBridge family is Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP) network management.andP;  The SNMP capability allowsusers to manage ProBridge products by any standard SNMP manager, includingHLS' NetDirector 9100 Network Management Center.andM;ProBridge can be custom-configured by the user to filter any protocol oraddress.andP;  The most common protocols have predefined filters.andM;The ProBridge 8033 Ethernet/Ethernet bridge is capable of filtering orforwarding the full 10-Mbps Ethernet bandwidth.andP;  The 8033 also includessource and address destination filtering.andP;  ProBridge 8033 is priced at$2,995.andM;To link geographically separate networks, HLS offers the ProBridge 8133Remote Ethernet Bridge.andP;  ProBridge 8133 supports speeds up to 2.048 Mbps,including T-1 service.andP;  List price for the ProBridge 8133 is $3,995.andM;Also new are the ProBridge 8233 and 8235 Backbone Bridges, using IEEEstandard token bus.andP;  ProBridge 8233 ($9,995) provides a backbone connectionfor Ethernet subnets over broadband.andP;  A companion to the 8233, the ProBridge8235 ($9,995) offers users token-ring over broadband internetworking usingIEEE-compliant networks.andP;  The ProBridge 8235 can support 4- or 16-Mbps token-ring subnetworks, as well as shielded- and unshielded-twisted- pair cablesystems.andP;  The ProBridge 8235 can also act as a source routing bridge in IBMnetworks, or as a transparent learning bridge in non-source routedenvironments.andM;Information:  Becky Hettema, Hughes LAN Systems, (415) 966-7460.andM;New NAT Local And Remote Ethernet Bridges Offer SNMPandM;Network Application Technology (NAT) has introduced the LANB/100P, a localEthernet bridge, and LANB/200P, a remote Ethernet bridge, that give networkadministrators a choice of using SNMP management or NAT's proprietary networkmanagement protocols.andM;The LANB/100P can be managed by SNMP-based network management systems or byNAT's NMS/100 Network Management System.andP;  NAT's network management featuresinclude support for spanning tree protocol, custom filtering, and themonitoring of bridge status and traffic statistics through NAT's NetworkManagement Station.andP;  Access security and node grouping is provided by customfiltering, which blocks or passes LAN packets through the LANB/100P Bridge onthe basis of address, header, or other fixed packet contents.andM;The LANB/100P Bridge uses an automatic self-learning algorithm to buildtables of local active LAN addresses.andP;  In the SNMP mode, the Bridge filterstraffic at 9,500 pps (packets-per-second) and forwards at 7,000 pps on eachport and uses its database of Ethernet addresses to forward only thosepackets addressed to another LAN segment or subnetwork.andM;Because the bridge operates at the data link layer, the operation of theLANB/100P is transparent to higher-level protocols such as TCP/IP, DECnet,XNS, and ISO.andP;  It is compatible with network systems from Novell, 3Com,Ungermann-Bass, Banyan, and other systems that adhere to Ethernet and IEEE802.3 standards.andM;The LAN/100P is available now as either a PC AT-compatible bridge-on-a-board($2,795) or as a stand-alone unit ($2,995).andP;  It normally comes with twoEthernet interfaces which connect physically separate Ethernet networks usingthe standard Ethernet AUI interface.andP;  The AUI is used with an externalEthernet transceiver connected to a coaxial Ethernet segment.andP;  A thinEthernet connection option is also available that uses BNC connectors.andM;NAT's LANB/200P Remote Ethernet Bridge also offers network administrators achoice between using SNMP management or NAT's proprietary network managementprotocols.andP;  As a stand-alone remote bridge, the LANB/200P provides a linkbetween Ethernet LANs using telecommunication links, including 1.544-Mbps T1,fractional T1, and 2.048-Mbit European E1 data links, as well as lower-speedsynchronous data links.andP;  The LANB/200P extends the features and functions ofa LAN across wide-area networks.andM;The LANB/200P can also be managed by SNMP-based network management systems orby NAT's NMS/100 Network Management System.andP;  Access security and nodegrouping is provided by custom filtering.andM;The LANB/200P filters the traffic on the network, forwarding only thosepackets addressed to another LAN segment or subnetwork.andP;  For mostapplications, the throughput of the LANB/200P is said to be more than 90% ofthe link speed.andM;Available now as a stand-alone unit at $3,295, the LANB/200P comes with anEthernet interface which connects to the local LAN segment and a data linkinterface which connects to another LANB/200P attached to the remote LANsegment.andP;  The bridge is available with an RS-232, RS-449/442, or V.35 linkinterfaces.andP;  A double-height enclosure, available for an additional $150, isrequired for the RS-449/442 or V.35 link interfaces.andP;  A thin Ethernetconnection option is also available that uses BNC connectors.andM;Information:  Homer Jamison, Network Application Technology, 21040 HomesteadRoad, Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 733-4530.andM;Network Systems Announces FDDI-To-T3 RouterandM;At INTEROP 90, Network Systems Corporation announced the FE648, adual-attached FDDI-to-T3 router.andP;

 Proteon went on to say thatit will introduce its first bridging routers based on the AMD 29000 RISCprocessor in the first quarter of 1991.andM;Proteon's internetworking strategy is founded on its Transportable SoftwareArchitecture (TSA) and the selection of processor technologies it deemsbest-suited to meet the specific price/performance requirements of thecommercial market.andM;Proteon demonstrated the throughput potential of this TSA-RISC technologycombination at INTEROP with its experimental bridging router prototype, theXP20000.andP;  Proteon ported its Transportable Software Architecture onto thebridging router, which was developed under contract and is currently in useby a federal customer.andP;  In a recent multi-vendor internetworking analysisconducted by Harvard University, the XP20000 demonstrated 20,000packets-per-second throughput.andM;Proteon's internetworking strategy is based on the hierarchical wiringstructure that consists of departmental LANs using unshielded-twisted-pair(UTP) or shielded-twisted-pair (STP) cabling that are linked to thebuilding's fiber backbone by bridging routers on each floor.andP;  Distribution ofrouter access points across the network eliminates single points of failure.andM;Proteon has selected two industry platforms for its product designs.andP;  Thep4100+ Bridging Router uses the Intel 80386 processor to deliver 16-Mbpsbackbone data transmission, while AMD's 29000 RISC chip will serve inhigh-speed bandwidth applications such as T3 and FDDI.andP;  Together, theseproducts complement Proteon's p4200 FDDI Router, which is based on theMotorola 68020 chip.andM;Information:  Maureen MacGregor, Proteon, Inc., Two Technology Drive,Westborough, MA 01581;
