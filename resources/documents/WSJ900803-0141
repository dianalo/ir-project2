MoammarGadhafi &quot;our friend.&quot; The U.S. State Department, thoughcritical of Libya's involvement, says no apparent direct linkexists between the terrorists and Libya.   That is surprising. A 1986 State Department report chargedthat &quot;Libya has also actively recruited members of . . .leftist leaders from Antigua, Barbados, the DominicanRepublic, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the FrenchDepartments {who are} invited to Libya for seminars at whichthey are urged to undertake violent action rather thanpeacefully participate in the political process.&quot; The reportconcluded that &quot;Libyan activities should be a matter ofserious concern for the entire hemisphere.&quot; Since then,Libyan involvement in the Caribbean has continued if notincreased. Moreover, it appears Col. Gadhafi has enlistedterrorist groups from the Middle East and Europe with closeties to Libya.</LP><TEXT>   In April 1987, Venezuela expelled a Libyan diplomat &quot;forallegedly being involved in activities incompatible with hisdiplomatic status&quot; -- a euphemism for spying or terrorism.The &quot;diplomat,&quot; Abdul Salim Ashur, was later arrested. In hispossession authorities found evidence of a &quot;huge terroristoperation directed against the Lesser Antilles&quot;: readTrinidad. The Arab Press Service reported that Mr. Ashur'splans called for Libya's financing and arming of radicalgroups in French Guiana, Suriname, Haiti, Jamaica and, yes,Trinidad and Tobago (as well as other Caribbean islands).   Throughout the region, Libya has set up &quot;People's Bureaus&quot;and Islamic schools and centers that act as frontorganizations to conceal Libya's active recruitment andfinancing of regional subversives. Since 1986, delegates fromleftist Caribbean organizations have attended the&quot;International Center for Combating Imperialism&quot; conferenceheld every year in Tripoli. Through these instruments, Libyahas succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with awell-trained cadre of terrorists.   Two months ago, 15 pro-Libyan terrorists were indicted inCosta Rica for various terrorist acts, including threebombings of U.S. offices in Costa Rica between 1986 and 1988.The group, the Santamaria Patriotic Organization, was formedin 1986 following the U.S. bombing of Libya in April. One ofthe terrorists, Domingo Solis Solis, was reported to havejoined the El Salvadoran communist FMLN guerrillas in theirmilitary offensive last November.   Middle Eastern radicals operate in South America as well.In May 1987, Venezuelan authorities arrested Mahmoud AbedAtta, reportedly a senior agent of terrorist Abu Nidal, andhad him deported. Another man with reported Abu Nidal links,Hussein Bouzildi was arrested by Peruvian authorities twomonths after the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement bombed aU.S. Information Service Center to mark the anniversary ofthe April 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli.   Besides Tupac Amaru, other Latin American radical groupsreceive Libyan support, including Ecuador's Alfaro Lives,Carajo], Colombia's 19th of April Movement and Chile'sMovement of the Revolutionary Left. All have sent guerrillasto training camps in Libya and received financial supportfrom Col. Gadhafi.   Perhaps the most disturbing terrorist event in thehemisphere with possible Libyan connections is the bombing bythe Medellin cocaine cartel of a Colombian Avianca plane lastNovember in which 107 people were killed. Though no evidencedirectly implicates Libya, major aspects of the case suggestan indirect role.   Interpol informed Colombian authorities that guerrillas ofthe Basque separatist group, ETA, carried out the bombing forthe Medellin cartel. The subsequent investigation revealedthe guerrillas used Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made explosivethat cannot be detected by airport security checkpoints. TheETA receives financial support from Libya and many of itsmembers go there for training. Moreover, Czechoslovakia'sPresident Vaclav Havel disclosed in March that the previouscommunist government sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex. Quotingfrom government sources, the Bogota-based newspaper ElTiempo, reported that &quot;the same detonator was used to blow upthe Pan Am plane on a flight from Britain to the UnitedStates in December 1988.&quot; Libya has been directly linked tothat bombing as well.   The coup attempt in Trinidad is the tip of the iceberg.The social dislocation and resentment accompanying economicrestructuring have weakened already fragile Caribbeandemocracies and simultaneously created an unstable politicalenvironment susceptible to exploitation by radical groups. Weshould expect more terrorism traced backed to Libya.   ----   Mr. Primorac is senior research fellow at theWashington-based Council for InterAmerican Security.</TEXT></DOC>
