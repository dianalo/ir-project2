Once, the White House said racial turmoil there was largely Soviet inspired; now, Secretary of State George Shultz plans to meet with the leader of a black opposition group that is heavily supported by Moscow.    Mr. Shultz is scheduled to meet here this month with Oliver Tambo, the head of the African National Congress, which South Africa has outlawed as a communist-backed terrorist group.    The meeting marks the failure of an old policy, not the beginning of a new one. Economic sanctions imposed last year by Congress, and Pretoria's harsh reaction to pressure for change have destroyed the administration's six-year effort to quietly prod the white-minority government toward reform.    The new approach of opening high-level diplomatic lines to black groups is an attempt to find a way to influence events in South Africa, but it comes too late to bring a foreign policy success to the beleaguered Reagan administration. Pretoria, which last spring tightened the lid on dissent, isn't in any mood for negotiations, and the Democratic-controlled Congress, in any case, already is thinking about further sanctions.    &quot;I don't think very much will come out of all this,&quot; concludes John de St. Jorre, a writer who is editing a report on South Africa for the Ford Foundation. &quot;The ANC is pleased because they get greater international recognition, but this won't help them defeat the South African government. And Pretoria is more wary of Washington than ever before.&quot;    The administration lost control of South Africa policy to Congress in 1985, and never caught up. President Reagan, who opposes punitive economic measures, was forced to impose executive sanctions in September 1985 to head off a congressional effort. Last fall, with no progress on the negotiating front, the administration was unable to rally enough GOP support to block sanctions.    Domestic pressure has forced the administration to alter its policy of trying to persuade South Africa's white minority to negotiate their nation's future with the black majority. That policy not only failed, it alienated South Africa's blacks, who perceived the administration as siding with the whites. Indeed, though the policy's architect, Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, remains in government, his influence is greatly diminished and the term he coined for the policy, &quot;constructive engagement,&quot; is rarely uttered by officials anymore.    Now the U.S. is reaching out to black opposition leaders as it searches for a new way to press for change. The meeting with the ANC, says Secretary Shultz, is &quot;part of this effort to broaden American access to all parties in South Africa.&quot;    The new administration initiative can't be isolated from the sanctions Congress imposed in October. The measures haven't had a strong impact on South Africa's economy. Many of the U.S. companies that withdrew maximized the gain from selling their assets by also selling licensing or technical agreements. Economic links remain after the companies have gone.    But sanctions have had a short-term political impact. They have created a backlash among many whites in South Africa who support the government's refusal to dismantle apartheid. Whites will vote this spring in a national election that will feature a heavy anti-American component -- political leaders already are saying that the U.S. is more dangerous to South Africa than the Marxists. As a result, &quot;It's clear that prior to the election there is going to be no possibility of forward movement,&quot; says a senior State Department official.    Such defiance is prompting liberals in Congress to consider further economic penalties, which would make negotiations between Pretoria and the black majority even less likely. But U.S. legislators believe that at some point Pretoria will respond to the pressure.    &quot;The white minority wants to maintain the fantasy that it can continue to rule without paying any economic cost. Everything we do to encourage that view is destructive. It prolongs the struggle,&quot; says Rep. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.    Though time is running out for the Reagan administration to achieve diplomatic success in South Africa, the seeds of success may have been planted for the next administration.    The efforts to communicate at a high level with black opposition leaders can restore their confidence in the U.S.'s ability to mediate in the conflict. The economic bite of sanctions will increase over time, as the measures will discourage investment in future projects.    The Shultz-Tambo meeting is &quot;one more brick in a structure of resistance to the policy there. At some point, more moderate forces in South Africa will speak up,&quot; says Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa. </TEXT></DOC>
