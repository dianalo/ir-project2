Regulators maintain that the line is critical to thefinancial stability of the casino. Failure to meet thedeadline could threaten its license.</LP><TEXT>   The Casino Control Commission said on Wednesday that itwants the credit line in place before the casino makes a $38million bond payment next Friday. Although the casino alreadyhas sufficient cash to meet the payment, regulators areconcerned that the payment will leave the casinoundercapitalized.   The credit line &quot;gives the Taj Mahal a cushion were thecash level to drop to a low level, and working capital forone-time expenditures,&quot; said Thomas Aurienna, deputy attorneygeneral at the Division of Gaming Enforcement.   Trump Organization officials had secured a $25 millionworking capital credit line from Foothill Capital Corp., alender in Los Angeles. But Foothill agreed to provide theline only if the casino would give three business daysadvance notice to draw any amount up to $5 million, and 10days for amounts of more than $5 million.   &quot;We intend to close the working line of credit withFoothill by Nov. 14,&quot; said Nicholas Ribis, chief executiveofficer of Trump's Atlantic City properties. &quot;We don't expectany problem with any portion of the commission's ruling.&quot;   The casino had approached the commission for permission tosecure only $25 million of the $100 million in credit calledfor in the restructuring of the casino, which emerged fromChapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 4.   Trump officials maintain that the additional $75 millionin credit line is not currently needed. Mr. Aurienna andbondholder representatives agree. One of the lines, for $50million, would have been earmarked for meeting interestpayments on the bonds. The other, for $25 million, was to betriggered if there was a change in management.   Foothill had insisted that borrowing could exceed $20million only if the Taj met a predetermined ratio of cashflow to debt payments. Foothill officials couldn't be reachedfor comment.   &quot;What the commission wants is an unrestricted $25 millionline of credit,&quot; said Mr. Aurienna. Commissioners directedthe Taj to secure $20 million by Thursday, and another $5million by Dec. 4.</TEXT></DOC>
