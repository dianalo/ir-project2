The aim is to maximise the deflectionof the magnetically stronger component of the feed to facilitate itsseparation from the particle stream round the magnet. Materials (e.g.CuSO/sub 4/, MnO/sub 2/) with chi/rho- ratios of the order of 7 x 10/sup-8/ m/sup 3//kg have been deflected. The applicability of dry magneticseparation has thus been considerably extended since up to now the separationof such materials has been restricted to High Gradient Magnetic Separation.The dependence of the separation efficiency upon the method of feedingand the influence of the residence time are studied in order to establishthe optimum parameters for the recovery of the desired fraction. Theexperimental results are compared with predictions of a theory that isbased upon novel approximative calculations of magnetic fields in whichthe use of elliptic integrals is avoided.</TEXT></DOC>
