Under the same conditions, twonew synthetic derivatives of chlorpromazine, i.e., a N-benzoyloxymethylchlorpromazineand a N-pivaloyloxymethylchlorpromazine, induce no more than a 20% inhibition.On the other hand, when the different chlorpromazines are entrapped inliposomes and subsequently irradiated with near-UV light, they act asphotosensitizing agents giving rise to lipid peroxidation. The latteris quite extensive in the presence of chlorpromazine or N-pivaloyloxymethylchlorpromazine,whereas it is drastically lower in the presence of N-benzoyloxymethylchlopromazine.The N-benzoyloxymethylchlorpromazine molecule, despite its low photodynamiceffect, retains its neuroleptic properties. The possible mechanisms ofthe antioxidant and prooxidant actions of these compounds are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
