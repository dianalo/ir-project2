Thespanking new complex is part of Marriott's sharplyscaled-back blueprint for its housing-for-the-elderlybusiness.   The latest strategy calls for the Washington hotel andfood services company to have 100 retirement communities bythe year 2000. That's down from an aggressive target setthree years ago, when Marriott announced that it would build150 communities by 1994 at a cost of $1 billion. And whilethe company had envisioned building the retirementcommunities and then, as it does with its hotels, sellingthem to investors but retaining management, Marriott nowhopes to enlist outside developers right from the outset.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We were very bullish back in the late 1980s. We weren'tgood economic forecasters,&quot; says Paul E. Johnson, who tookover as general manager of the senior living servicesdivision last November.   The division's plans, like those of Marriott's mainbusinesses, have been set back by the company's heavy debtload and the downturn in the real estate market. Marriott,which has been selling assets to cut debt, has slashedcapital spending this year to $300 million, from $500 millionin 1991 and $1.2 billion two years ago. This week it sold a420-room Dallas hotel that it bought in 1986.   Moreover, after a boom in building in the 1980s, bankshave gotten more cautious about funding senior housingprojects in general because of &quot;examples of properties acrossthe U.S. that have just not performed well at all,&quot; saysDavid Schless, director of senior housing of the NationalMulti Housing Council, a trade organization. But Mr. Schlesssays Marriott's communities have done well because they offera variety of options and services.   Marriott opened its first retirement community in 1988 andcurrently manages 15 complexes, 13 of which it built oracquired. The remaining two were developed and are owned byother parties. Apart from seeking development partners fornew projects, Mr. Johnson also hopes to find buyers for abouteight of its retirement communities. He says the time isright because the communities now have a track record.   Mr. Johnson wouldn't disclose operating profit or revenuefor the division, but did confirm that senior living servicesrecorded its first profitable year in 1991. John J. Rohs, ananalyst with Wertheim Schroder, expects the division toremain profitable as more of the facilities underconstruction are opened and occupancy goes up. He predictsthe division will have 1992 operating profit of $7 million onrevenue of $69 million, up from what he estimates was profitof $3 million on revenue of $50 million last year.   Occupancy was about 85% last year, says Mr. Johnson. Buthe adds that 1990 comparisons aren't available because manyof the facilities hadn't been open a full year then.   The new community in Palm Harbor, Fla., called StratfordCourt, is designed primarily for retirees who don't neednursing care or assistance in their daily routines. It has220 one-bedroom, two-bedroom and studio apartments.   To provide &quot;a full continuum of care,&quot; Mr. Johnson saysthe community also has 40 apartments for those who do needassistance and a 60-bed nursing center. Stratford Courtopened with 40% of its units already reserved, the companysaid. Marriott is building a second Stratford Court in BocaRaton, Fla. Monthly rents range from $1,000 to $2,300 andinclude daily meals, local transportation and recreationalactivities.   Marriott offers another type of facility for those whorequire more nursing care. Called Brighton Gardens, thismodel consists of a two-story apartment building around acourt with common dining and living areas. It also has anursing wing.   Marriott currently operates four Brighton Gardenscomplexes, which were built for around $10 million each.Rents are about $1,000. Mr. Johnson, who describes the targetmarket as retirees 75 years old and over with an annualincome of at least $25,000, says Marriott intends to buildtwo Brighton Gardens for every one Stratford Court. They'recheaper to build and there's a greater demand for assistedcare, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
