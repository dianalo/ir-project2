In an hourlong interview at the house of the governor of Punjab here, President Zia, wearing a light-brown pajama suit and a dark-brown woolly vest, appeared confident and relaxed.    He said the Soviets privately have begun to show interest in the idea of convening a grand national assembly in Afghanistan, bringing together representatives of Afghan rebels, refugees and the present Soviet-supported communist regime to decide on an interim government after the Soviet troops withdraw.    And, he said, the Soviets are beginning to talk of a faster timetable for a pullout if a peace accord is reached. Pakistan, which is home to three million Afghan refugees who conceivably would return home if the Soviets left, has insisted on a deadline of six to eight months, while Moscow has talked of a 12-month period.    The Soviets will go, he said, only if they receive assurances that their friends in Afghanistan won't be massacred, and that requires accommodation. &quot;The three main components -- the freedom fighters, the refugees and the present party in power -- should form the government,&quot; he said. &quot;An international peacekeeping force under the U.N. could keep law and order while the Soviets leave. The interim government must have a person or persons at its head who enjoy the confidence of all three groups, and it must be formed not by Pakistan or the Soviet Union, but the people of Afghanistan must evolve a system,&quot; Mr. Zia said.    At next week's superpower summit, Mr. Zia said, President Reagan should renew his demand for a Soviet withdrawal. &quot;And if the U.S. says a bit more firmly that it has no interest in Afghanistan, then I think we can resolve this,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a lot of expectations (that) the two leaders at the summit will resolve that the people of Afghanistan should be left on their own.&quot;    In the interview, Mr. Zia also:    --Accused the U.S. Commerce Department of &quot;conspiracy&quot; and engaging in &quot;a cooked-up case&quot; against a Pakistani currently awaiting trial in Philadelphia on charges of illegally attempting to export to Pakistan steel that could be used in the country's controversial nuclear program.    --Said that any permanent cutoff of U.S. aid to Pakistan, which has been stopped since Sept. 30 because of U.S. concern that Pakistan continues to develop a nuclear weapon, would &quot;send the wrong signal to the Soviet Union&quot; as well as damage the Afghan negotiations.    --Strongly denied again that Pakistan possessed a nuclear weapon and reiterated statements that the country has neither &quot;the capability nor the intention&quot; to produce one.    --Said the U.S. should move carefully in the Persian Gulf so as to not permanently alienate Iran, which he called &quot;a future potential ally&quot; of the U.S.    --Said Pakistan still would like to buy U.S. Awacs or Hawkeye airborne radar planes, despite expected congressional opposition and a lessening of Soviet air incursions into Pakistan since the summer. &quot;Our request is very much alive, but it is a question of money. Our priorities right now, with our limited resources, won't let us buy the Awacs,&quot; he said.    The president's strongest comments came in discussing Pakistan's relations with Congress, which will vote this month on a proposed six-year, $4.02 billion economic- and military-aid program for Pakistan. Before the assistance can be granted, Congress must waive provisions of a nuclear non-proliferation law that bars aid to countries thought to be developing nuclear weapons.    Western analysts have long believed that Pakistan is at least close to possessing the necessary materials and knowledge to build and test a bomb. The country has refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty unless rival India, which exploded its first nuclear device in 1974, does so. Pakistan has proposed various non-proliferation controls on its program, but only if India agrees to the same controls.    Asked the status of Pakistan's program, the president said levelly: &quot;Pakistan has acquired nuclear technology for peacful purposes. We are running a nuclear power plant (about 20 miles from Islamabad). We have also acquired the capacity to enrich uranium&quot; to guarantee the country's energy needs.    If the proposed U.S. aid program is stopped or slashed, the president said, U.S.-Pakistan relations would suffer a setback. &quot;The champions of democracy are pressurizing a democratically elected government,&quot; he said. &quot;How do I explain this when the voices in the neighborhood say America is unreliable, America doesn't stand by its commitments?&quot;    The president became visibly angry when discussing the case of Arshad Pervez, a Pakistani living in Canada who is charged with trying to export &quot;miraging steel,&quot; which can be used in centrifuges that enrich nuclear materials, either for use in power plants or in weapons. President Zia denied that Mr. Pervez was acting for the Pakistan government, saying, &quot;we didn't even need this steel at that time.&quot;    &quot;When a government goes all out to embarrass another government, or when a friend stabs you in the back -- I am sorry I am using strong words, but I want to make a point -- what can you do?&quot; he asked, his voice rising. &quot;Mr. Pervez was caught 'red handed' with a fake export voucher issued by the U.S. Commerce Department. . . . This is a cooked-up case. It's a conspiracy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
