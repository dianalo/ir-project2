Reed, president of SEMI.andM;Reed explained that the SEMI proposal was developed in response to higherthan expected levels of technology found in Eastern Europe and becausegovernments were not acting quickly enough to revise export controlregulations.andM;&quot;SEMI's proposal is a simple concept and would be easy to implement.andP;  Itobviates the need to reconcile many different governmental positions,&quot; headded.andM;The SEMI proposal provides a natural, dynamic indexing mechnanism, linkingthe level of manufacturing products decontrolled to the level of devices.andM;Copies of the proposal were sent to all 16 nations making up CoCom.andP;  CoCom isa multinational organization, based in Paris, that regulates export controlson strategic products.andM;SEMI is an international organization representing the $20 billionsemiconductor equipment and materials industry.andP;  Headquartered in MountainView, California, SEMI has offices in Brussels, Belgium; London; Seoul,Korea; Tokyo and Washington.andM;SEMI export control proposal:  How it would workandM;EXAMPLE:  The end product decontrolled is a computer.andM;End ProductandM;Decontrolled             Devices              EquipmentandM;------------             -----------          --------------------PC/AT                    Intel 80286          SemiconductorandM;equipment capable ofandM;2.7 micron resolutionandM;IBM PS-2                 Intel 80386          SemiconductorandM;Motorola 68030       equipment capable ofandM;1.8 - 2.0 micronandM;resolutionandM;Minicomputers,           Intel 80386          SemiconductorandM;e.g.andP;  DEC PDP 11,         Motorola 68030       equipment capableandM;Microvax, DEC 8500                            of 1.8 - 2.0 micronandM;Series, IBM 4341,                             resolutionandM;4361, 4381andM;1 Mbit DRAMs         SemiconductorandM;equipment capable ofandM;1.0 - 1.25 micronandM;resolutionandM;4 Mbit DRAMs         SemiconductorandM;equipment capable ofandM;.7 - .8 micronandM;resolutionandM;Resolution of the Board of Directors The board of directors of SemiconductorEquipment and Materials International recommends to CoCom that the level ofexport control restrictions on semiconductor equipment and materials becoupled to the availability of the most advanced semiconductor devicescontained in decontrolled end products.andP;  Unanimously adopted on July 24,1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
