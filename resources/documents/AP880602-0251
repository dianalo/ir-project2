(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal jury convicted a Britishnobleman and two British gamekeepers Thursday of conspiring to killprotected hawks on a billionaire's game preserve.   Sir Richard Musgrave, manager of the Albemarle County preserveof John Kluge, and his gamekeepers, Paul Shardlow and David Amoswere convicted on the misdemeanor conspiracy charge.   Musgrave, 66, also was convicted on three misdemeanor counts ofaiding and abetting the killing of hawks. Shardlow, 25, also wasconvicted on three misdemeanor counts of killing migratory birdsand on one misdemeanor count of possessing a migratory bird. Amos,20, was convicted only on the conspiracy count.   The jury deliberated for about 4{ hours in the six-day trial.   Musgrave faces a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a$20,000 fine. Shardlow could be sentenced to 2{ years in prison anda $25,000 fine and Amos could receive up to six months in prisonand a $5,000 fine.   U.S. District Judge J. Harry Michael Jr. did not immediately seta sentencing date. Defense attorneys said they planned to appeal.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Bondurant Jr. said in closingarguments that the three defendants killed hawks ``from the firstday they stepped on the shoot till the bust.''   Shardlow's lawyer, Frederick W. Payne, said predators werekilled to protect the imported pheasants and other game birdsstocked for Kluge's guests to hunt.   Kluge, 73, is chief owner of Metromedia, a telecommunicationsand technology holding company. Last fall, Forbes magazine listedhim as the second-richest man in America, putting his worth at $3billion.   He and his wife were not charged.   Payne dismissed the government's key witness, Brian Heath, as a``ne'er-do-well'' who went to federal authorities in hope ofgetting a job as a wildlife law enforcement officer.   Heath was fired from his job as a gamekeeper at the preserve inFebruary. Agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uncoveredthe remains of hundreds of hawks and other animals during a searchof the estate in late March.   Musgrave, whose Agricultural Sporting Consultants Ltd. ran theshooting preserve for Kluge, said he assumed his gamekeepers wouldshoot hawks to protect the stock of pheasants.   Musgrave carries the title ``Sir'' because he is a baronet, ahereditary title in British nobility.   Heath testified as many as 400 hawks were killed at theAlbemarle Farms preserve over two years. Shardlow and Amos eachadmitted killing about two dozen of the birds.</TEXT></DOC>
