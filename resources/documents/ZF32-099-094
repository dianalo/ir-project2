Gordon routledge, HatfieldandM;A Sending an escape sequences to your printer from dBase III Plus is quitecomplicated.andP;  This is because dBase is written in C, and in this language thecharacter for 0 in 8 bits is the signal for the terminator of a string.andP;  0 isthe character the printer needs to receive in order to make things work.andP;  Youhave to fool the printer into believing it's a 7-bit printer.andM;Nevertheless, HP says that all you have to do is the following:andM;1 Press Esc, then write in andamp;170PandM;This sets the number of lines per page to 70 (A4 size).andM;2 Press Esc, then write in andamp;164FandM;This sets the number of lines on the page in which you actually write text,and leaves three blank spaces at the top and bottom.andP;  If a character wants toprint to the unprintable area on a LaserJet III, the top half of thecharacter will print but not the bottom half.andP;  For example, the stem of ywouldn't come out.andP;  With a LaserJet IIP, if any characters fall into theunprintable area, then they won't print at all.andM;If you need further detail about how the sequences (and everything else onyour printer) work, you should refer to the technical reference manuals forthe printers.andP;  These are available from HP on (0344) 369333.andP;  For theLaserJet III, you need the PCL5 technical reference manual, part number33481-90969.andP;  This will cost 25 pounds.andP;  For the LaserJet IIP series, youneed the technical refeence manual, part number 33471-90905, which costs11.60 pounds.andM;By the way, if you get dBase IV, you won't have to worry about escapesequences, as it has built-in drivers for the HP printers.andM;Q Thank you for an eminently readable and fact-filled magazine.andP;  Can I posean impossible question?andP;  I have a Tandon 386/25 with a 40Mb hard disk and aVGA screen, Ventura Publisher, a JVC GR45 camcorder and a Fisher VCR withordinary UHF inputs, separate video in and video out sockets and a jackremote socket.andP;  Is there any way in which I can use Ventura to developstoryboards, credit lists, fancy work and so on, and download this tovideotape?andM;I've just videoed my younger brother's wedding and feel that it's in definiteneed of enhancement.andP;  I've come across several different deices fortransferring from videotape to PC/desktop publishing packages, but can I dothe reverse?andP;  Please bear in mind the fact that I have a highly limitedbudget.andP;  James Martin, South YorkshireandM;A The cheapest solution -- and there are some answers to this problem thatcould cost as much as a sports car -- is Digitburst's Microeye card, whichcosts 595 pounds.andM;You should put this card into your PC and then plug theinput cable into theVCR which is playing the videotape, or even straight into the camcorder.andP;  Youthen plug the output cable into the VCR which is recording what you do.andP;  Now,as you play the video, you can pause and start recording pre-prepared effectsmade on packages such as Autodesk Animator, Harvard Graphics andPC-Paintbrush onto the video.andP;  This is a process called overlay.andM;If you want to find out more about manipulating PC text and graphics withyour video, then the European Multimedia Centre (EMC) is bound to have somenews for you.andP;  It's also having some open days, where you can take a closelook at the machines involved and get some expert advice.andM;August's open days are on the 6th and 7th.andP;  For further details anddates forother open days, contact the EMC on (071) 387 2233.andM;Q I've recently bought a Texa Instruments PS35 laser printer.andP;  The HPIIemulation and PostScript now work very well  SuperCalc 5, thanks to somesplendid support from Computer Associates.andP;  However, when I try to print fromWordStar 5 with PostScript and the correct PDF file, I get the followingerror message: 'Can't store results.andP;  Disk full or file type error'.andP;  I canprint with no problems using LaserJet II emulation, but can you possibly tellme how I can link WordStar 5 to PostScript?andP;  I've tested the printer and it'sworking correctly.andP;  Dr Gregory, LondonandM;A According to WordStar, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to printto PostScript, but the company suggested that you should check a couple ofthings first.andM;1 Make sure that the PostScript program has been copied over to the WordStarsub-directory, /WS5.andM;2 Check that your CONFIG.SYS file contains a statement that tells your PC howmany files it can open at once.andP;  This should read Filesandequals;30 (you can choosethe number you want, but it's best for this to be at least 30).andM;3 Your disk may well be full.andP;  If the program was installed into your rootdirectory, you might even have reached the limit DOS imposes on the number offiles installed here.andM;Wordstar support for PostScript is better in version 6, where all internalPostScript fonts are supported as scalable fonts.andP;  The upgrade will cost you99 pounds.andM;Getting word processing packages to support PostScript is generally not thatdifficult -- you just have to check that they have the right driver.andP;  Ifyou're running a package under Windows 3.0, you should have little or noproblems, asthis has a PostScript driver of its own.andM;Interestingly, windows 3.1 will use the TrueType font package.andP;  TrueType willlet you print PostScript fonts to any printer -- PostScript or not.andP;  Ifyou're worried about PostScript support with an ordinary DOS package, you'ddo well to look at WordPerfect, as it has an exhaustive set of drivers.andM;Q I have three questions about Amstrads.andP;  The first two apply to PC1640s, andthe last one applies to 3086s.andM;1 The first question concerns the clock.andP;  The time on this isn't maintainedfrom the real-time clock, so it's completely out of synchronisation.andM;2 The second question is about my keyboard.andP;  The Enter key next to thenumeric keypad doesn't work when you install the UK driver.andM;3 There seems to be no way of getting this machine to drive may Erikssondotmatrix printer (a rebadged Facit 4512).andP;  The printer works fine on otherPCs, but I just can't get it to do anything on the 3086.andP;  Mike Cohen,LiverpoolandM;A The clock problem is a very common one.andP;  What causes it is the fact thatthe Amstrad mouse speeds up the clock to make it run smoothly.andP;  The PC1640compensates for this increase in speed by taking out one second in three.andO;things fall out of synchronisation when you use a program which is createdwith any Microsoft programming language.andP;  What happens is that these programsalso speed up the clock, without realising that the Amstrad mouse has alreadydone this.andP;  If you know that you'll be using such programs, then you shoulddisable the clock speed-up on the mouse.andP;  Just type Mouse /S when you'reloading it and everything should be OK.andM;The second problem occurs every time you use a version of DOS that isn't theAmstrad DOS which came with the machine.andP;  Unfortunately, there's nothing youcan do about that.andM;Regarding the printer problem, we're afraid that there's no obvious cause.andO;We suggest that you check the parallel port, in case it's faulty in some way.andM;Q I've recently upgraded the memory of my Amstrad PC2286/40 from 1Mb to 2Mb,using two 1Mb SIMMS.andP;  I followed the instructions from amstrad on how toremove the existing DRAMs, install the SIMMS and change the size optionlinks.andP;  I've run the Setup program to change the amounts of memory allocatedto base memory and extended memory, but I can't get the computer to recognisemore than 640Kb of base memory.andP;  As a result, I still can't run either Excelor Freelance, which is what I'd planned to do once the memory upgrade wascomplete.andM;How do I reconfigure my computer to allow sufficient base memory to runsoftware such as Excel and Freelance?andP;  I have the following memory-relatedfiles, all of which operate under DOS 4.0: MEMM.SYS, HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.SYS,RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRIV.SYS, SMA2EMS.SYS, MEM.EXE and FASTOPEN.EXE.andP;  Pleasetell me where I'm going wrong.andP;  RD Whitby, Woking, SurreyandM;A There's no problem here with your Amstrad, but the fact is you're trying todo something impossible.andP;  A PC just physically can't have more than 640Kbbase memory.andP;  What can take you beyond this barrier is extended or highmemory.andP;  If you're using DOS 4.01, which takes up a lot of memory, thenperhaps you should consider switching to DOS 5.0 or DOS 3.30, which both takeup much less room.andM;Q Someone (whose life is no longer worth living) ran the DOS Recover commandon my PC and now everything has been renamed.andP;  What can I do to reverse thiscatastrophe?andP;  I have a Tandon XT running DOS 2.1.andP;  Please help me.andP;  PaulAtkinson, BerkshireandM;A The DOS Recover command attempts to reconstruct files from a disk which hasdamaged sectors or a damaged directory.andP;  It renames the recovered filesFILEnnnn.REC, where nnnn is a sequence number that starts with 0001.andP;  Filesrecovered from subdirectors are placed in the root directory of the disk,rather than in the sub-directory in which they were originally saved.andM;Recovered files may or may not be complete and may or may not be usable by anapplication program.andP;  For further help, try using PC Tools or NortonUtilities to view and restore the files.andM;Q I can't get Microsoft Works to go into overtype mode.andP;  I've tried pressingAlt-O for the options menu and then selecting Y, which should give me 'typingreplaces selection', but I can't get it to work.andP;  Please can you suggest whatI might be doing wrong?andP;  I'm using a Compaq DeskPro 386s/20.andP;  Also, my HPLaserJet IIIP won't print a pounds sign.andP;  Jennifer Leach, wimbledonandM;A Works word processor won't support overtyping.andP;  If you made a mistake asyou're typing, you can use the Backspace key to delete the mistake and thencontinue typing.andP;  You can also select any text and delete it or type over it.andO;If you morthe cursor to a new location, any text you type is inserted beforeany existing text.andM;If the Typing Replaces Selection command is turned on, you'll always replaceany selected text with any new text you type.andP;  If you don't want toautomatically replace selected text, you should choose the Typing ReplacesSelection command again to turn it off.andM;Works only has support for two internal symbol sets out of the 25 availableon the LaserJet III series, so the pounds symbol will only be available tofonts that print symbols for the Roman 8 Symbol set.andP;  The second setsupported by Works is the PC-8 Code Page 437 Symbol set, which doesn'tsupport the pounds symbol.andP;  Therefore, only fonts that use the Roman 8 setwill support pounds symbols.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
