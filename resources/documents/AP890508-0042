Police officials announced the arrest of Lee Chang-bok, a leaderof the nation's main dissident alliance, the United NationalDemocratic Movement, on charges of violating national security laws.   Officials said Lee had supported communist North Korea andorganized strikes and violent demonstrations.   The arrest is part of a crackdown that follows the deaths lastweek of six riot troopers in a clash with radical students in thesouthern port of Pusan. Lee was the fourth alliance leader to bearrested along with dozens of other suspected extremists.   President Roh Tae-woo warned May 3 that he would invokeemergency measures to halt a wave of violent protests and strikes.He charged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftistrevolution under the control of rival communist North Korea.   Roh was to hold a Cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss furthermeasures to curb protests and break up anti-government groups,officials said.   The Defense Ministry warned today it would use ``strongcountermeasures'' to keep strategic industries running if they arehit by strikes. It did not specify any action, but officials havesaid troops could be used to keep defense and other importantindustries running.   Defense officials, who declined to be named, said strikes indefense industries are illegal and warned anyone organizing laborunrest would be ``severely punished.''   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes. The government has warned that effortsby radicals to build an alliance with workers could threatenpolitical and economic stability.   The government says strikes have cost the economy almost $4billion in lost production so far this year.   South Korean newspapers reported today that Roh would removesome Cabinet ministers for failing to handle violent protests andlabor unrest. Government officials indicated a shakeup wasexpected, but declined to provide details.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called over the weekend for theentire Cabinet to resign to accept responsibility for the politicalsituation. Top officials in Korea traditionally resign to acceptmoral responsibility for problems or failures even if it is nottheir fault.   The main opposition parties, which generally do not support thedissidents, have called for curbs on violent protest but alsocharged the government is trying to use the unrest as an excuse tocrack down on all opponents.   Education Ministry officials said today that they would closeuniversity student newspapers and other publications that publishleftist or pro-North Korean articles.   The officials, who also declined to be named, said they wereconsidering allowing riot police to raid college campuses to endprotests or to halt manufacture of firebombs and other weapons.   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups havelittle support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrowof Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers andfarmers.   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in late 1987after rival opposition candidates split the anti-government vote.He has helped introduce democratic reforms but many Koreansdistrust the government because of its ties to the authoritarianregime of former President Chun Doo-hwan.</TEXT></DOC>
