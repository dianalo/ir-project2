(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Activists said they canceled apro-independence rally Tuesday after authorities told them it couldspark a repeat of the bloody confrontation with soldiers in which20 people died.   ``There is a danger the tanks will charge again, and thesoldiers will shoot. So we postponed the meeting,'' said DavidNadiradze, a lawyer who advocates the secession of the republic ofGeorgia from the Soviet Union.   Nadiradze said independence activists received the warning fromsympathetic police officers, and political leaders advised that thecurfew and state of emergency that brought Soviet soldiers into thecity could be reinstated.   About 5,000 people appeared at the flower-covered square infront of Government House on Tuesday. Young people holding flowers,candles or black flags of mourning guarded a shrine at the crash tothe victims of the April 9 clash.   But no one stood up to address the group.   Irakli Shengalaya, head of the Society of National Justice, aninformal political group, said he and other activists decided topostpone the demonstration after Georgian Interior Minister ShotaGorgodze warned earlier Tuesday that the curfew and state ofemergency that brought Soviet soldiers and tanks into therepublic's capital on April 7 could be reinstated.   The soldiers and armor were withdrawn from the city last week,but activist Tengiz Ordzhonikidze said they have been seen inrecent days at nearby lakes and in suburbs.   Shengelaya and other activists said the interior minister'sstatement, which was carried on local TV, appeared to be friendlyadvice rather than a threat.   Georgian Communist Party chief Givi Gumbaridze, when askedMonday how he would react to future demonstrations, said: ``Whathappened on April 9 can't happen again.''   Gumbaridze on Monday confirmed accusations by activists thatsome of the 20 deaths were caused by poison gas used by thesoldiers.   In Washington, the United States on Tuesday condemned ``the useof any chemical agents that cause serious injury or death when usedagainst peaceful protesters.''   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler urged the Sovietgovernment to ``investigate fully and openly what happened on April9.''   In Moscow, Georgy P. Razumovsky, a candidate member of theruling Communist Party Politburo who visited Tbilisi after theviolence, said the decision to break up the protest with force wasmade ``by local authorities.''   Razumovsky, at a news conference, criticized Georgian officialsfor a ``constant lack of dialogue'' with young people and theintelligentsia on the republic's problems.   Activists said the demonstration, which had been planned for theyard of the Kashveti Church, a 13th-century stone building acrossthe street from Government House, was postponed to May 21.   Tiblisi Police Chief Roman Zvensadze said he had personallysuggested to activists that ``holding a demonstration during thetraditional 40 days of mourning would be unseemly.''   The demonstration had been called to demand the release of sevenactivists arrested hours after the April 9 clash and to ``demandpunishment of the murderers,'' said Nadiradze.   They also sought were seeking annulment of a Kremlin decreemaking it illegal to ``insult or discredit'' the government.   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesterscriticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazianminority to break away because of alleged discrimination byGeorgians.   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the SovietUnion because of alleged interference from the central government.   The republic's senior party official, Dzhumber Patiashvili, tookresponsibility for the April 9 attack and resigned.</TEXT></DOC>
