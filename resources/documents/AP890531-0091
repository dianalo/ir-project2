The rally in Huangcun, 20 miles south of Beijing, came asCommunist authorities pressed ahead with tactics aimed atintimidating and discrediting the 10,000 students occupying centralTiananmen Square.   Several people said officials forced them to participate in the40-minute rally in support of Premier Li Peng's hard-line policies.   Also today, about 3,000 pro-democracy students marched fromTiananmen Square to city police headquarters, where they held asit-in to protest the arrests of three labor leaders.   They also demanded the resignations of senior leader DengXiaoping and Li, who imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 andordered a crackdown on workers pressing for a freer China.   Zhao Pinglu, head of the independent trade union to which theworkers belonged, said they were released late this afternoon afterbeing questioned for a day about the new union's activities.   China's communist government bans all but the official All ChinaFederation of Trade Unions.   ``Down with kidnapping!'' the students shouted. It was thesecond straight day of protests in front of the police office.   At the government-sponsored rally, demonstrators marched to anoutdoor stadium carying banners reading: ``We support Li Peng'' and``We oppose the small group causing turmoil.''   The event lacked enthusiasm of the demonstrations in Beijing,where hundreds of thousands of people have marched to demanddemocratic reforms and an end to official corruption.   Rally leaders burned an effigy of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, anoutspoken proponent of democracy, but they failed to stir the crowd.   Few joined leaders in shouting slogans such as ``Long live theCommunist Party!'' and ``Down with Fang Lizhi!'' Students respondedto the slogans with giggles.   ``They told me to come, so I've come,'' said one 27-year-oldpeasant in the crowd.   ``To tell you the truth, we were forced to come,'' said an18-year-old high school student. Some participants said they didnot understand the purpose of the demonstration.   The Beijing Foreign Affairs Office informed foreign journalistsof the march and of several others in suburban sections of thecapital.   Martial law regulations, which have been widely ignored, forbidforeign reporters from covering student demonstrations.   At Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic center of political power,about 10,000 die-hard student protesters entered the 18th day of asit-in, resisting government demands they disperse.   ``We are now basically waiting for the government to take theinitiative,'' student leader Mo Bin said. ``Things are pretty calmwith us. It's the government who's nervous.''   More than a dozen military motorcycle convoys followed by jeepssped down the main arteries of the capital, the latest warning thatgovernment tolerance was nearing an end.   A military source said 200,000 troops surrounding Beijing havebeen told to ``prepare for winter,'' meaning hardliners are diggingin for a long battle with Communist Party moderates who sympathizewith some goals of the students.   Wan Li, a reformer and head of the National People's Congress,or parliament, returned to Beijing today a week after reportedlybeing stopped in Shanghai on his way back from a trip to the UnitedStates.   Chinese sources said Wan, who made statements in support of thestudents while in the United States, was put under house arrest inShanghai. But after several days there he was quoted as giving fullbacking to the government.   The government said Wan stopped in Shanghai for medicaltreatment. He was shown on the television news being helped off theairplane by a flight attendant, but otherwise he looked healthy.   A government propaganda campaign against the students continuedto center on a replica of the Statue of Liberty, called the``Goddess of Democracy,'' unveiled on Tiananmen Square on Tuesday.The statue faces the portrait of communist Chinese founder MaoTse-tung.   The Beijing Daily, a conservative party paper, was filled witharticles and letters incensed about the 33-foot statue.   ``We believe our sincere patriotic enthusiasm has been greatlymocked, and our good image tarnished,'' said a letter from fiveunidentified Beijing University students.   State Radio Beijing gave prominent play to divisions in thestudent movement in an interview with Li Lu, a Beijing studentleader who accused non-Beijing students of ``power grabbing.''</TEXT></DOC>
