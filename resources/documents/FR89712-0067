Program regulationsapplicable to these grants are in Part 87, ``National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health Research and Demonstration Grants,'' of Title 42, Codeof Federal Regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Eligible Applicants </ITAG>Eligible applicants include non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thusuniversities, colleges, research institutions and other public and privateorganizations including State and local governments and small, minorityand/or woman-owned businesses are eligible for these research and demonstrationgrants. <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds </ITAG>There is $6,149,000 available in Fiscal Year 1989 to fund research projectgrants, demonstration grants, Special Emphasis Research Career Award (SERCA)grants, small grants, and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants.For research project grants, it is expected that 27 continuation grantswill be awarded totaling approximately $3.490 million and that about 12new and competing renewal grants will be awarded totaling approximately$1.574 million and ranging from approximately $50,000 to $250,000 withthe average award being approximately $140,000. For SERCA grants, it isexpected that approximately $227,000 will be awarded for seven continuationgrants and $259,000 for eight new grants. For small grants, it is expected that approximately $129,000 will be awardedfor six continuation grants and $270,000 for twelve new grants. For SBIRgrants, it is expected that approximately $200,000 will be awarded forone phase II continuation grant and that no new phase I or II grants willbe awarded. Grants are usually funded for 12 months in project periodsof up to 5 years for research project and demonstration grants, 3 yearsfor SERCA grants, and 2 years for small grants. Continuation awards withinthe project period are made on the basis of satisfactory progress and onthe availability of funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose </ITAG>The purpose of this program is to award funds to eligible institutionsor agencies to establish, discover, elucidate, or confirm information relatingto occupational safety and health, including innovative methods, techniques,and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Requirements </ITAG>1. Research Project Grants A research project grant application should be intended and designed toestablish, discover, develop, elucidate, or confirm information relatingto occupational safety and health, including innovative methods, techniques,and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.These studies may generate information that is readily available to solveproblems or contribute to a better understanding of underlying causes andmechanisms. 2. Demonstration Grants A demonstration grant application should address, either on a pilot orfull-scale basis, the technical or economic feasibility or applicationof: (a) A new or improved occupational safety or health procedure, method,technique, or system, or (b) an innovative method, technique, or approachfor preventing occupational safety or health problems. 3. Special Emphasis Research Career Award (SERCA) Grants The SERCA is designed to enhance the research capability of individualsin the formative stages of their careers who have demonstrated outstandingpotential for contributing as independent investigators to health-relatedresearch. Candidates must have had 2 or more years of relevant post-doctoralexperience prior to the submission date. The application must documentaccomplishments in this period that demonstrate research potential; itmust also present a plan for additional experience in a productive scientificenvironment at domestic institutions that will foster development of acareer of independent research in the area of occupational safety and health.The SERCA is not intended for untried investigators, or for productive,independent investigators with significant numbers of publications of highquality, or for persons of senior academic rank (above associate professoror tenured). Moreover, the award is not intended to substitute one sourceof salary support for another for an individual who is already conductingfull-time research, nor is it intended to be a mechanism for providinginstitutional support. The application must demonstrate that the awardwill make a difference in and enhance the candidate's development as anindependent investigator. Candidates must indicate a commitment of at least 60 percent time (notnecessarily 60 percent salary) devoted to research under the SERCA grant,although full-time is desirable. Other work in the area of occupationalsafety and health will enhance the candidate's qualifications but is nota substitute for this requirement. While working closely with one or moreadvisers, the awardee is expected to develop capabilities in fundamental,applied, and/or clinical research in one of the areas listed under ``FUNDINGPRIORITIES.'' At the end of the award period, evidence of independent investigative capabilityshould be present such that the individual is better able to compete intraditional NIOSH research grant activities. The total grant award may comprise direct costs of up to $30,000 per yearand up to 8 percent additional indirect costs. Direct costs may includesalary plus fringe benefits, technical assistance, equipment, supplies,consultant costs, domestic travel, publication, and other costs. If theawardee already holds a small grant on the same research topic, the amountof the SERCA may be reduced up to the amount of the small grant. Awardsmay be up to 3 years and will not be renewable.4. Small Grants A small grant application is intended to provide financial support to carryout exploratory or pilot studies, to develop or test new techniques ormethods, or to analyze data previously collected. This small grant programis intended for predoctoral graduate students, post-doctoral researchers(within 3 years following completion of doctoral degree or completion ofresidency or public health training) and junior faculty members (no higherthan assistant professor). If university policy requires that a more seniorperson be listed as principal investigator, the application should specifythat the funds are for the use of a particular student or junior-levelperson and should include appropriate justification for this arrangement.Though biographical sketches are required only for the person actuallydoing the work, the application should indicate who would be supervisingthe research. Small grant applications should be identified as such onthe application form. The total small grant award may comprise direct costs of up to $15,000per year and additional indirect costs, as appropriate. The grants maybe awarded for up to 2 years and are thereafter continuable by competitiverenewal as a regular research grant. Salary of the principal investigatoras well as that of the junior investigator, if university policy requiresa senior person to be listed as the principal investigator, will not beallowed on a small grant, though salaries can be requested for necessarysupport staff such as laboratory technicians, interviewers, etc. 5. Program Project Grants NIOSH will also accept applications for program project grants, but onlyafter discussion with the individuals listed in this announcement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation Criteria </ITAG>Applications will be evaluated by a dual review process.
