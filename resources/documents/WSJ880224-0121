Procedures being discussed with the Reagan administration call for the Japan Defense Agency to be the confidential repository of such U.S. patents filed in Japan to protect the owners' commercial rights. Japanese officials say they are ready to start the system by the end of April.    Such an undertaking would release U.S. high-technology companies from a legal bind. The 1951 Invention Secrecy Act deters them from registering patents with Pentagon classification in countries that don't have laws to enforce patent secrecy. In 1959, Japan signed a treaty with the U.S. to provide such protection but never changed its laws to comply with it.    &quot;The opposition parties and our scientific community have a big hangup about this,&quot; a Tokyo official admits. &quot;They think that official secrecy would lead us down the road to militarism again.&quot;    The Japanese proposal wouldn't disturb existing laws, which provide for full public access to patents filed with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI. Instead, the plan would authorize the Japan Defense Agency to hold the U.S. patents and keep them secret until the Pentagon lifts their classification. Presumably, U.S. patents filed with the agency would be accorded the same protection as those registered with MITI.    The Japanese offer is a response to pressure from both the U.S. government and U.S. industrial patent-holders. American companies fear that current Japanese law denies them patent protection for some innovations that the Japanese are also trying to develop and commercialize. At the same time, Japan sees advantages in removing a legal impediment to cooperation with the U.S. on leading-edge technology.    The Japanese proposal is generally acceptable to the U.S. except for the April startup. &quot;We're paying a high price for the delay,&quot; a U.S. negotiator complains. Under Japanese patent law, U.S. companies can't protect innovations unless they register them within one year of the day they file for patent protection in the U.S. A number of key patents obtained here last winter by Raytheon Co., United Technologies Corp. and other U.S. companies could lose protection unless they can be registered in Japan before late April, the official says.    Administration sources say some of these patents involve superconductivity, a field in which U.S. and Japanese scientists are competing intensely. The Pentagon has reported that superconductors have military applications such as anti-submarine warfare and special devices for launching objects in space.    Raytheon won't discuss its patent situation in Japan, but United Technologies acknowledges that the secrecy factor has barred it from registering patents on jet-engine materials there. &quot;This problem doesn't exist in any NATO country,&quot; says the company's patent attorney, Charles Sohl. &quot;It's only in Japan.&quot; As a result, Japanese concerns could get patents in Japan for innovations U.S. companies make earlier.    Similarly, Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. subsidiary, concedes it can't sell technology on communications satellites and advanced missiles to Japan unless the secrecy snag is overcome. &quot;You can't even talk about this technology to a buyer unless the State Department says it's OK,&quot; says Hughes Aircraft's patent specialist, Anthony Karambelas.    Roger Benjamin, the former patent counsel for Stauffer Chemical Co., says the company recently lost protection in Japan for one of its U.S. patents because it missed the one-year filing deadline.    The problem affects only a small proportion of U.S. patent applications. But unless resolved, it could block U.S.-Japanese cooperation in Strategic Defense Initiative, or &quot;Star Wars,&quot; research, or U.S. sales of new weapons systems including Hughes's advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, or Amraam.    U.S. patent-holders are less concerned about losing technological secrets to the Soviet bloc than they are about being beaten by the Japanese in commercializing this know-how. There are few known cases of Japanese leaks of U.S. technology to the Soviets. But U.S. courts have been kept busy by U.S. manufacturers defending their patent rights against Japanese competitors.    Tokyo says waiting until April before changing the rules is just a parliamentary tactic. The ruling party doesn't want to give the opposition an issue with which to stall the defense budget. But by April, the large defense outlays sought by the Takeshita government would be safely out of the budget committee.    ---   Japanese Steel Exports Fall   Special to The Wall Street Journal   TOKYO -- Overall Japanese steel exports declined in December and the full year, but shipments to the U.S. rose during both periods, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.    In December, the federation said, total exports fell 16% from a year earlier, to 2.5 million metric tons. In all of 1987, exports declined 15%, to 25.7 million tons.    Exports to the U.S. increased 16% in December, to 546,000 tons, and 9.9% in the year, to 4.3 million tons.    Overall steel exports have been falling since September 1986, hurt by the strong yen, which makes Japanese goods more expensive in terms of other currencies, and by stiff competition from steelmakers elsewhere in Asia.    During the year, a federation spokesman said, exports of basic steel items, such as bar products, declined, while shipments of steel goods requiring more-sophisticated production methods, such as electronic plate and surface-treated plate, increased. That reflected the sizable cost advantages that the newly industrialized countries have in making basic products, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
