At this year's event, the third since the festival got under way in 1985, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold prize of $143,000 for &quot;Yaaba&quot; (&quot;Old Woman&quot;). By comparison, Cannes now gives $39,000 to the winner of its young director's award.    Says director George Miller (&quot;Mad Max&quot;): &quot;I think the Tokyo festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition.&quot;    There are drawbacks. Vincent Tolentino, a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama, says of the recently ended Tokyo festival: &quot;No one makes deals . . . and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals.&quot;    BELGIAN SECURITIES    Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs (about $2.60) for each transaction, bringing the total fee to 200 francs. While no figures exist, it is thought that many small investors in Belgium store securities privately, in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes. The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks, who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors. HELPING EASTERN EUROPE    Japan is considering giving aid to Hungary and Poland to support their recent political reforms, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. &quot;This is the first time, if we decide to do so, for Japan to extend aid of this kind to Eastern European countries,&quot; the spokesman said. He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January.    FRANCO-SPANISH MEETING    Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President Francois Mitterrand and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. &quot;I demand the utmost severity in the fight against drug traffickers,&quot; President Mitterrand said after the meeting in Valladolid, Spain. He added: &quot;Banks must open their books.&quot; The leaders' talks coincided with a meeting in Madrid of anti-drug experts from the U.S., France, Italy, Spain, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. That conference, which began yesterday, was expected to cover such matters as police training and extradition agreements, Spanish officials said.    IRANIAN COMINGS AND GOINGS    Three Soviet government officials -- the ministers of railroads, of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building -- will visit Tehran next month for talks, Iran's official news agency reported. Under an agreement signed last June, the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration and other areas in return for exports of Iranian natural gas. And in Paris, Mahmoud Vaezi, Iran's vice minister of foreign affairs, began a five-day visit to discuss such matters as compensation to French enterprises for contracts broken by the Khomeini regime.    JAPANESE INGENUITY    Toto Co., a Japanese ceramics maker, has developed a toilet that can check the user's health. A Toto spokesman said the toilet not only tests blood pressure, pulse and urine, it also stores the data for up to 130 days. Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. and Omron Tateisi Electronics are involved with Toto's new product, which will go on the market in about two years time. &quot;It will be very expensive,&quot; the spokesman warned. &quot;The price cannot be less than $7,000.&quot;    FIGHTING CORRUPTION IN MEXICO    Since Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office last December, special agents have arrested more than 6,000 federal employees on charges ranging from extortion to tax evasion.    Hector Castaneda Jimenez, chief prosecutor at the Attorney General's Office, said that an estimated $82.8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the campaign to root out official corruption.    Mr. Castaneda's office will reportedly issue warrants during the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federal employees. Those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $376.8 million, the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the Excelsior news service. He added that federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount.    &quot;The rest will probably not be recoverable either because the statute of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money,&quot; the prosecutor said.    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    The United Nations, which is distributing farm tools to returning refugees in Namibia, is rethinking a plan to hand out machetes because of the tense political climate during preparations for independence from South Africa. &quot;The decision to distribute machetes at this time, which could be used as weapons, is under review,&quot; said a U.N. spokesman. . . . Sources close to the family of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said she is expecting a second child, probably early next year. </TEXT></DOC>
