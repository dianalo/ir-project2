(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parents of a 14-year-old say theywill keep their daughter at home despite the threat of jail forviolating a local ban on children under 15.   ``I can't shoot her. It's as simple as that,'' Beverly Elmer saidin response to a judge's threat last week to jail her and herhusband for 10 days if daughter Staci Lynn isn't out of theirdouble-wide mobile home by Jan. 20.   ``They don't like me,'' Staci said of the subdivision residentswho sued the Elmers. ``They're just mean. They don't like anychildren.''   The case mirrors one in Margate, Fla., where directors of anadults-only condominium have been trying to evict 9-year-old JamieSwartz, who moved in with her father while her mother was dying ofcancer.   The condominium directors voted last week to allow Jamie to stayuntil March, when a housing law goes into effect that could nullifychild-exclusion deeds.   In the Zephyrhills case, Circuit Judge Wayne L. Cobb said he hadno choice but to enforce the order.   ``It's incomprehensible, a bunch of people who don't wantyoungsters around,'' Cobb said. ``I don't understand why anybody,period, would want to live in a place that didn't allow kids.''   Mrs. Elmer said she and her husband, Thomas, don't have money torent another house while they try to sell their home, situated about15 miles from Tampa. They say their mortgage doesn't permit them torent the home if they move.</TEXT></DOC>
