Tuesday became the first company to announce a Small ComputerSystems Interface (SCSI) host adapter to support Insite Peripherals' newhigh-capacity 21Mbyte Floptical drives, debuting next week.andM;Adaptec's AHA-1520 AT-to-SCSI host adapter, with Floptical drive supportbuilt into its BIOS, enables Floptical drives to be integrated seamlesslyinto AT-class microcomputers.andM;A working demonstration of the AHA-1520 with an Insite Peripherals Flopticaldrive will be demonstrated June 25-27 at PC Expo, Booth 5555, Javits Center,New York.andM;With the advent of high-capacity floppy drives and the introduction of thecompetitively priced AHA-1520 with Floptical support, PC manufacturers andcomputer resellers can now offer their customers powerful and versatilefloppy drive solutions.andP;  Capacity of each 3.5-inch Floptical diskette --21Mbytes -- is comparable to many disk and tape drives.andP;  (The high capacityin Floptical drives is achieved by merging optical and magnetic recordingtechnologies) Additionally, the Floptical drives support standard 720Kbyteand 1.44Mbyte floppy diskettes, assuring backward compatibility withlower-capacity media.andM;Typical applications of the AHA-1520 and Floptical drive combination includestandard floppy use, data backup and archiving, data transfer between PCs andas an alternative to hard disk storage in small-footprint systems.andM;The AHA-1520, which delivers high data transfer rates, and Floptical drivescombine to create an intelligent, high-capacity storage subsystem -- analternative to tape backup systems and low-end hard disks.andP;  Like tape andhard disk drives, Floptical drives connect to the PCs via the AHA-1520, whichresides in the computer.andM;Adaptec is a member of the Floptical Technology Association (FTA), analliance founded by Insite Peripherals, Iomega Corp., Hitachi Maxell Ltd., 3MCorp. and other companies dedicated to advancing standards in Flopticaltechnology.andP;  In continuing its support of industry standards, Adaptecrepresents the FTA on the SCSI committee of the American National StandardsInstitute.andM;&quot;The AHA-1520 and the Floptical drives serve as yet another example of howSCSI solves the issue of connecting new types of peripherals to PCs,&quot; said AlWilhelm, senior applications engineer with Adaptec's System ProductsOperation and who sits on the SCSI committee.andM;&quot;The combination of SCSI and Floptical is logical; SCSI is a high-performanceinterface standard, while Floptical is emerging as the high-capacity floppystandard.&quot;andM;The AHA-1520 with Floptical support will be available in Q3 through ArrowElectronics for a suggested retail price of $110.andM;Adaptec is a leading supplier of high-performance I/O solutions.andP;  Productofferings include a broad line of SCSI- and ESDI-based controller boards andSCSI host adapters for personal computers, proprietary VLSI circuits, afamily of SCSI development and test systems, and laser printer controllers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
