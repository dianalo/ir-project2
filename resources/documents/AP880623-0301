He saidsome information ``has already been obtained.''   According to other sources, Gaines, whose office was searchedlast week, is believed to be one of several people who passedprocurement information to Pentagon official-turned-consultantMelvyn Paisley.   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that Paisley copied thedocuments with the aid of his wife.   Paisley allegedly passed the sensitive information along to hismajor client, McDonnell Douglas Corp., said the sources.   Paisley and Gaines worked together at the Boeing Co. in Seattlein the 1970s.   An attorney for the Paisleys, Lawrence Barcella, rejected theaccounts of the Paisleys' alleged activities and criticized thegovernment for leaking information about the investigation. He saidit is ironic that leaks are occurring ``in a case in which thegovernment is alleging improper disclosure of sensitiveinformation.''   Meanwhile, a former Boeing Co. executive, James Durst, said hepassed along information to the government more than six years agothat Paisley had bragged of committing a felony wiretappingoperation and of conducting bribery internationally on militaryprojects.   Durst's information was contained in a Feb. 4, 1982 letter toformer Idaho Republican Gov. Don Samuelson, who gave it to Sen.Paul Laxalt of Nevada, President Reagan's close friend, Durst saidin a telephone interview Thursday night. Laxalt said in an April21, 1982 letter to Samuelson that the matter had been referred tothe Defense Department, said Durst, who said he has a copy of theletter. ABC News reported Thursday on Durst's allegations and theexchange of letters.   Barcella called Durst's accusations ``unfounded'' and said theFBI had conducted a full background check on Paisley before he wasappointed to the Pentagon post he left last year.   At the heart of the investigation are allegations that defensecontractors and consultants, many of them former military men,bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could bevital in winning contracts. Prosecutor Henry Hudson toldcongressmen Wednesday he is looking into 75 to 100 contracts worth``tens of billions of dollars.''   While Gaines is talking with prosecutors, another Pentagonofficial whose office was searched, Victor Cohen, is negotiatingwith the government on whether to do the same, the sources said.   Both Gaines and Cohen had key procurement jobs in the Pentagon.Gaines was deputy assistant Navy secretary for acquisitionmanagement while Cohen was a top aide to the deputy assistant AirForce secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control,communications and computer systems. Both men have been reassignedsince the investigation became public.   At the White House, President Reagan told reporters Thursday hehas arranged for a report on the present status of theinvestigation.   Responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visitingAustralian Prime Minister Robert Hawke, Reagan said, ``I am asking,and have arranged _ they are coming over to give me a fullreport.'' He said the report would deal with the question of``where are we now and how much do we know already?''   In an interview with The Associated Press, Richard P. Godwin,who was brought into the Pentagon as an undersecretary to reformits procurement system, said former Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger is ``100 percent wrong'' in defending the way theDefense Department spends $160 billion a year on purchases ofweapons and other goods and services.   ``We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said Godwin, who,like Weinberger, had been an executive at the Bechtel Group, a vastconstruction conglomerate.   Godwin said he quit in frustration last fall after 18 months atthe Pentagon, where he was supposed to carry out reformsrecommended by a commission headed by California industrialistDavid Packard.   Weinberger told The AP on Wednesday he thought procurementprocedures in effect at the Pentagon ``are proper.''   The FBI, meanwhile, said Thursday that it had searched severalmore sites in the last two weeks that it had not revealedpreviously, including Kane Paper Co. of Baldwin, N.Y., which wassearched this week.   Last week, investigators searched the home and office of DennisMitchell of Poquott, N.Y., who works in the surveillance and firecontrol division of Unisys Corp.'s Great Neck, N.Y. plant, the FBIsaid. The FBI had announced last week that it had searched thatUnisys plant as well as the Malverne, N.Y., home of CharlesGardner, a former Unisys vice president.   In addition, the FBI revealed Thursday that it had served searchwarrants on Scott Lamberth of Farmington, Ark., who works withWhittaker Corp., a defense electronics firm which had been searchedlast week, and James Neal of Oakton, Va. It could not be determinedimmediately if the agents had searched their homes or offices orboth.   Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Defense Secretary FrankC. Carlucci held his first meeting with Hudson on Wednesday.Carlucci, like Reagan and like Weinberger, was not briefed aboutthe affair until just before it became public knowledge.   Howard declined to discuss the substance of the briefingreceived by Carlucci from Hudson, the U.S. attorney for easternVirginia, or say how frequently the defense secretary expected tobe updated on the matter.   The spokesman also acknowledged the Pentagon has not taken stepsyet to inhibit the business dealings of defense consultants whosenames have surfaced in the FBI probe.   Earlier this week, Carlucci ordered Gaines, Cohen and four otherPentagon officials identified in the investigation temporarilyreassigned to other jobs.   ``We simply cannot take an action on the basis of pressreports,'' Howard said. ``Now, we have asked the Department ofJustice to inform us of the names of individuals who may beinvolved in the investigation. The Department of Justice hasprovided us with no names beyond the limited number in thisbuilding.   ``And until and unless we are given such information, we cannottake any action. We will take appropriate steps at the appropriatetime. But we are in a kind of limbo here at the moment until thisinvestigation proceeds further,'' Howard said.   Defense Department Inspector General June Gibbs Brown toldreporters she didn't consider the Pentagon a ``soft touch'' when itcame to contract fraud and thought the department was getting themessage across to industry that white-collar crime doesn't pay.   The number of contractor suspensions and debarments has soaredfrom roughly 80 a year in 1981 to about 900 a year now and criminalprosecutions also have climbed significantly, she said.   ``I think we're doing a very aggressive job in this area,'' shesaid, adding that the current probe ``is a perfect example of howthe system is working.''   Prosecutor Hudson, meantime, dropped plans to release by Fridaythe affidavits filed by FBI agents in support of requests forsearch warrants. He had said earlier this week he hoped to unsealthem.   Sharon Dibbley, a spokeswoman for Hudson, said ``we reallyhaven't set a time for releasing the search warrants andaffidavits.''   ``Once the search warrants are returned, they are usuallyopened,'' she noted. ``They will be, but not right now.''   Asked the reason for the delay, she said, ``We don't feel itwould be beneficial to have them opened at this time.''   Navy Secretary William Ball discussed the case Thursday with theSenate Armed Services Committee and several other senators andchairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., later announced that hearings will beheld after Congress' July 4 recess on the military's contractingsystem ``to find whether there are a few rotten apples or manyrotten applies or basic flaws in the procurement system.''   The House Armed Services Committee tentatively scheduledhearings for next week on the procurement system.</TEXT></DOC>
