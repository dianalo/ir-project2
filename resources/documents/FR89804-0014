See 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978) and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978).Consistent with the applicable provisions of section 107(d), these areadesignations may be revised whenever the data warrant. On January 27, 1983, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)submitted a request for Kane and DuPage Counties to be redesignated asattaining the ozone NAAQS. This request was based on a lack of monitoredozone standard violations. USEPA's June 12, 1984 (48 FR 46082), final rulemakingrejected the State's request to redesignate Kane and DuPage Counties. IEPAand the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce disagreed with USEPA's finalrulemaking action and jointly petitioned for review of USEPA's action beforethe Seventh Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. In its November4, 1985, decision, <T3>Illinois State Chamber of Commerce </T3>v. <T3>USEPA,</T3> 775 F.2d 1141 (7th Cir. 1985), the Court remanded the rulemakingto USEPA, calling for a clarification of USEPA's ozone designation policyand the rationale for its application to the attainment status for Kaneand DuPage Counties. A May 23, 1986, technical support document (TSD) thoroughly reviewed USEPA'sozone redesignation policy memoranda and available studies supporting USEPA'sviews on ozone formation and transport and the assignment of ozone precursorsource culpability for the purposes of ozone nonattainment designations.On December 29, 1988 (53 FR 52727), the USEPA proposed revised rulemakingon the redesignation request for Kane and DuPage Counties. This proposalsummarized the discussions contained in the May 23, 1986, TSD and proposedto again disapprove the redesignation of Kane and DuPage Counties. A number of public comments were received in response to USEPA's proposeddenial of the State's redesignation request. These comments and USEPA'sresponse are summarized below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment No. 1. </T3>USEPA has failed to comply with its mandatory dutyto respond to State-submitted redesignation requests within sixty (60)days of submittal. <T3>Response. </T3>Section 107(d) of the Act does not impose a sixty (60)day time frame for responding to a redesignation request. The commentorapparently derives the 60-day time frame from section 107(d)(2). 42 U.S.C.7407(d)(2). The time frame for USEPA action set forth in section 107(d)(2)applies only to the ``list under paragraph 1 of this subsection.'' Id.The ``paragraph 1'' referred to deals only with the initial promulgationof attainment status designations for air quality control regions. Thesubsequent redesignation of those regions is addressed by section 107(d)(5),which is silent as to any deadline for USEPA action. Had Congress intendedto impose the 60-day time frame on subsequent redesignations, it wouldhave included the limit in subsection (d)(5). This interpretation is consistent within the context of the 1977 amendments,which introduced the concept of nonattainment areas to the Act. See, generally,<T3>Chevron U.S.A. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837, 847-848. Sections107 (d)(1) and (d)(2) were part of an expeditious schedule designed byCongress to address the perceived failures of the pre-1977 Act. The Stateshad 120 days to initially designate each air quality control region, andUSEPA had 60 days to promulgate the States' list with whatever modificationsUSEPA deemed necessary. This tight time frame was essential if the Stateswere to comply with the Act's new requirement that all nonattainment areassubmit a revised State Implementation Plan (SIP) by January 1, 1979. (See42 U.S.C. 7502.) Once this initial planning was completed, the need forexpedited action diminished. In this context, USEPA does not have a duty to respond to a State's redesignationrequest within 60 days. Moreover, even if USEPA had such a duty, the passageof 60 days since submittal of the redesignation request would not haveprecluded USEPA from acting now on the request. <T3>Comment No. 2. </T3>USEPA still has not developed any coherent rationalewhich addresses the Court's mandate. USEPA continues to rely on two separatetheories which the court found internally inconsistent and concluded that``until USEPA has done one or the other, its action will appear to be arbitraryand rational review by this court will be impossible.'' See <T3>Illinois State Chamber of Commerce </T3>v. <T3>USEPA, </T3>775 F.2d 1141, 1147 (7th Cir. 1985). <T3>Response. </T3>In concluding that review was impossible, the SeventhCircuit concluded that USEPA had either changed its policy without givinga reasoned analysis to support the change or if no policy change were involved,USEPA had failed to explain how disapproval was consistent with past policy.In its proper context, the language quoted by the commentor was used bythe court to require USEPA to explain either why the policy was changedor how current policy was consistent with past policy. The court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">If it has changed its policy, it must explain how and why; if it hasnot, it must articulate an explanation that will account for both the earlierand most recent actions it has taken. Until it has done one or the other,its actions will appear arbitrary, and rational review in this court willbe impossible.</ITAG>Id. at 1147. In the December 29, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 52727), USEPA explained in greatdetail how the proposed disapproval of the Kane and DuPage Counties redesignationrequest was consistent with past actions. Therefore, USEPA has compliedwith the Seventh Circuit's mandate.<T3>Comment No. 3. </T3>USEPA relies upon two mutually inconsistent nonattainmentdesignation theories. First, USEPA states that a nonattainment area mustinclude all of the sources that contribute to pollution in that area. Second,the USEPA states that an urban ozone nonattainment area must include theentire urbanized area. USEPA must choose between one or the other theory.USEPA's designation theory is internally inconsistent because no attemptwas made to draw up the nonattainment boundaries for the Chicago area insuch a way as to track the movement of the ozone away from the precursorsources (nor has this been done for New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia,Detroit, San Francisco, Boston, or Washington, DC). Moreover the controlsavailable to the USEPA from nonattainment designations could be appliedto areas that suffer from but do not produce the pollution. The leveragefrom such controls should only be available where it will be useful. USEPA's designation theory is also irrational because USEPA has not identifiedhow the attainment status of an urban area is to be changed and where themonitoring for evaluating the attainment status will take place, nor hasUSEPA explained why it has chosen to use urban area as defined by the census.<T3>Response. </T3>USEPA does not rely upon two mutually exclusive designationtheories, but as articulated in the December 29, 1988 notice, relies upona single, internally consistent, nonattainment designation theory. USEPA'sapproach is predicated upon the initial nonattainment designation decisionbeing only the first step in the ozone control process; the important subsequentstep is the implementation of planning and control obligations upon nonattainmentareas in order to achieve attainment. Nevertheless, the nonattainment designationis crucial; it determines what sort of planning or control obligationsan area will have. Obviously the control obligations implemented by thestate for a nonattainment area will differ according to the area's ozonecontribution. Thus, a nonattainment area emitting substantial ozone precursorswould normally have more strict controls placed upon it than a nonattainmentarea emitting fewer precursors. The nonattainment designation is the thresholddecision to control an area's ozone emissions in order to successfullyachieve compliance with the standard. As an initial starting point in the nonattainment designation process,all areas_urban or rural_experiencing ozone exceedances, are, by definition,nonattainment areas. If an area does not have clean air, then it probablyneeds controls to bring it into attainment or to prevent further violationsdownwind; thus, it should be labelled nonattainment. If violations occur within an urbanized area (as defined by the Bureauof the Census), then the entire urbanized area is designated as ``nonattainment.''This is done because of the simple fact that an ozone exceedance cannotgenerally be attributed to any particular source, and instead results fromemissions from numerous stationary, mobile, and area sources. USEPA willthen examine the areas immediately surrounding the urbanized area experiencingthe violations. If adjacent areas have significant ozone precursor sourcesbecause of population, growth potential, or significant existing stationarysources, then these ``fringe'' areas will also be designated as nonattainmentbecause of their current and/or future contribution to the ozone problemin and near the urbanized areas experiencing the violations. Rural areas may also experience ozone violations because they are downwindof an area emitting ozone precursors or they, themselves, have significantprecursor emissions. If violations have occurred in an isolated rural areadue either to the downwind drift of ozone from another area or locallygenerated ozone, then it too must be designated as nonattainment becausecontrols may be necessary to reduce the ozone in this area or to preventthe propagation of ozone violations further downwind. The manner in which the areas surrounding the violations of the ozone standardhave been divided has been left to the individual States. Of course oneState may not include another State's territory within its nonattainmentareas. Many States, like Illinois, chose to identify the nonattainmentand attainment areas on a county by county basis. Because USEPA did notdraw the States' nonattainment boundaries, it could not draw them specificallyto track the movement of ozone precursors. Nevertheless in designatingthe polluted and fringe areas as nonattainment, USEPA has identified thoseareas that are emitting ozone precursors or experiencing violations, andthus has performed the functional equivalent of defining the boundariesto track ozone precursors. USEPA has utilized the same designation theoryfor all areas across the country. In this particular case, USEPA has continued to use its nonattainment designationapproach in a consistent manner. Illinois chose to break the Chicago areainto counties for ozone designation purposes. Since the Chicago urbanizedarea experiences ozone violations, the fringe areas surrounding Chicagomust also be designated as nonattainment because of their contributionto the ozone problem. Because Kane and DuPage counties qualify as fringeareas,\1\<NOTE/> they must retain their nonattainment designation despitethe lack of monitored ozone exceedances. The downwind areas in Wisconsinexperiencing violations of the ozone standard have also been labelled nonattainment.Thus while it may make sense to group all of these areas together for planningpurposes, the designation of these areas was performed on a State-by-Statebasis utilizing the articulated designation theory. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Portions of DuPage County are within the Chicago and AuroraUrbanized Areas and portions of Kane County are within the Elgin and AuroraUrbanized Areas. Both counties contain significant populations (Kane County_299,000,DuPage County_716,000) and emissions (Kane County_97.5 tons of VOC perday (TPD), DuPage County_189.2 TPD). Emissions from both counties havean impact on or are within the Chicago area. (Population Source_1985 estimate,Bureau of the Census data, Emissions Source_Summary of VOC Emissions, 1988,Table 1-A, Appendix A, Emissions Inventory Documentation for Chicago AreaFederal Implementation Plan (FIP)_Draft Report) The concern that leverage be applied where it is needed is precisely thereason USEPA includes fringe areas of development within the designatednonattainment area. If USEPA designated the fringe areas as attainment,then these areas could not be required to control their ozone precursorsas stringently as if they had been designated nonattainment and would continueto add to the nearby area's ozone problem. Similarly, as explained furtherin response to Comment Number 16, if downwind areas experiencing violationsdo not control their emissions, the ozone problems will be exacerbatedand ozone will continue to move and form downwind. The concerns about sanctionsplaced upon an area, however, are planning and control, not designation,issues. The designation decision is based upon whether an area is violatingthe standard or contributing to ozone exceedances. Any USEPA decision onthe adequacy of a State or Federal plan to solve an area's ozone problemwould be subject to a public rulemaking process (and ultimately judicialreview) to insure that the controls imposed are not arbitrary or capricious.The comments directed at how the attainment status of an area is changedand why the USEPA uses the urbanized area are addressed elsewhere in theresponses. Also, the comments on why USEPA has chosen to use urban areasas defined by the Bureau of the Census is addressed in the response toComment No. 17. <T3>Comment No. 4. </T3>USEPA's procedure in making the proposal availablefor public comment is objectionable. In particular, USEPA relied upon unpublishedmemoranda and used only selected references on the ozone transport issue.USEPA has failed to include in the record the unpublished memoranda andthe references on ozone transport. The official ``record'' of the Chambercase listed some documents that USEPA did not list in the December 29,1988 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. <T3>Response. </T3>USEPA is not required to publish all of its policy statementsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, as this commentor apparently suggests. To doso is not only unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act, butwould also impose a huge paperwork burden on the Agency and general public.Contrary to the commentor's contention, all of these memoranda are listedin the May 23, 1986, technical support document and are a part of the recordof this rulemaking.The commentor correctly notes that USEPA has not included every study ofthe ozone transport issue. The Agency has listed only those studies uponwhich it relied on in deciding to disapprove the Kane and DuPage redesignationrequest. The Agency is not obligated to include every scintilla of informationregardless of whether or not the Agency relied upon it. During the publiccomment period, the public is free to submit additional information forthe Agency's consideration. In this case, the commentor has submitted someadditional information which the Agency has evaluated and is respondingto elsewhere in this rulemaking.Finally, the commentor contends that the certified record supporting theJune 12, 1984, denial of redesignation refers to documents which are notincluded in the present record. USEPA believes that its May 23, 1986, TSDdoes include all relevant policy documents. Additionally, the TSD refersto all ozone transport studies which USEPA relied upon in the instant rulemaking.Assuming that there are discrepancies, the commentor has not explainedwhy any such discrepancies are significant. Moreover, the Agency is notbound to the 1984 record.<T3>Comment No. 5. </T3>Significant economic sanctions can be imposed bythe USEPA on areas classified as nonattainment for an air quality standard.The growth sanctions included in the Clean Air Act are directed at stationarysources. Illinois, however, has already imposed reasonably available controltechnology requirements (RACT) on stationary facilities. The USEPA cannotassume that such sources are causing or contributing to exceedances ofthe ambient air quality standard.Designating Kane and DuPage Counties as nonattainment for ozone will imposea ban on construction of new or modified VOC sources in these counties.This will either have an adverse effect upon the Chicago area in termsof impeding economic efficiency or by causing stationary sources to locatefurther to the west or to the south of the Chicago area. If the lattergrowth indeed occurs, it will increase vehicular traffic to allow workersto reach the new ``greenfield'' locations.USEPA should consider the practical effect that can result from its decisionas to what constitutes a ``non attainment area.'' Improved highways maybe necessary to avoid over-burdened highway systems in Kane and DuPagecounties, and discouraging improved inland highway systems could have theeffect of increasing traffic load in the central Chicago and Cook Countyarea. Since the urban Chicago traffic source is most often the cause ofthe ozone exeedance, the USEPA's decision to keep Kane and DuPage countiesas nonattainment may worsen the Chicago area's ozone problem.<T3>Response. </T3>All of the comments made are planning and control concerns,not designation concerns. The nonattainment designation, as discussed earlier,is determined by an area's role in ozone exceedances. If an area is importantin bringing ozone levels under control, then the area must be designatednonattainment. In this case Kane and DuPage counties are critical in addressingthe Chicago area ozone problem, and, for this reason alone, Kane and DuPagecounties are designated as nonattainment. In short, these control concernsare irrelevant to the designation determination. Notwithstanding theirirrelevance, USEPA will address the commentor's concerns.Although the State of Illinois has imposed RACT requirements on certainstationary sources in Kane and DuPage Counties (or elsewhere in the Chicagononattainment area), these sources may still be emitting VOC's and contributingto downwind ozone impacts. The controls applied are not 100 percent effectiveat eliminating emissions. Therefore, the stationary sources, though underRACT requirements, might require additional controls, and these controlswill further lower area VOC emissions.Several points concerning the construction ban concern should be discussed.First, the effectiveness of a construction ban is irrelevant to its imposition.Congress has chosen to statutorily require a construction ban in nonattainmentareas if the State has failed to produce an adequate plan. Therefore, thesimple act of designating Kane and DuPage Counties as nonattainment forozone does not automatically result in the imposition of a ban on the constructionof new or modified sources of VOCs. The supposed economic effects of aconstruction ban are purely speculative on the part of the commentor.With regard to the argument on the potential for increased vehicular traffic(and thus more ozone pollution), several points should be discussed. Ozonecontrol plans must address the potential for the increase in emissionsfrom all source categories including those from mobile sources. If a significantincrease in mobile source emissions is expected, additional emission controlswill have to be found for either mobile sources or stationary sources withinthe Chicago ozone demonstration area, which includes all of the Chicagoozone nonattainment area. Like the effectiveness of the construction ban;the asserted potential increase of mobile emissions due to a nonattainmentdesignation is purely speculative. Because USEPA has disapproved Illinois' 1982 ozone plan the existing banon major new VOC source growth in Kane and DuPage Counties and other portionsof the Chicago nonattainment area will continue in effect until the Statesubmits an adequate ozone SIP for the entire area. However, the ban doesnot prohibit all growth. Rather, new major sources in a nonattainment areawould need to meet more stringent emission requirements than in an attainmentarea. The new source growth ban is statutorily mandated in areas that havedisapproved Part D SIPs and is intended to prevent unrestrained sourcegrowth and exacerbation of the present ozone nonattainment problem whilethe SIP is revised or a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) is prepared (theUSEPA is presently pursuing the latter as the result of a January 18, 1989,Court order issued in <T3>State of Wisconsin </T3>v. <T3>United States Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>No. 87-C-395, (E.D.Wisc.). USEPA is aware of the potential for ozone impacts within a nonattainmentarea due to precursor emissions originating outside of the nonattainmentarea. Major sources locating in such areas must be addressed in new sourcereviews which must include an assessment of their air quality impacts ondownwind areas, including the nonattainment area.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ USEPA proposed on June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20722), to expandozone nonattainment areas to include all of the areas within MetropolitanStatistical Areas (MSAs) or, where such exist, Consolidated MetropolitanStatistical Areas (CMSAs). If that rulemaking is finalized, as proposed,it would add Will, Kendall, Grundy, and McHenry Counties in Illinois andKenosha County in Wisconsin to the Chicago urban nonattainment area. UnderUSEPA's proposed post-1987 ozone attainment policy, future ozone attainmentdemonstration analyses would include the emissions from major sources locatedwithin 25 miles of the MSAs or CMSAs. (Analyses of emissions for the Chicagoarea Federal Implementation Plan cover the Chicago CMSA and neighboringmajor sources.) These proposals reflect USEPA's growing concern (in partbased on recent long range ozone transport studies) over the impacts ofemissions occurring or expected outside of existing ozone nonattainmentareas. <T3>Comment No. 6. </T3>Air parcel trajectories performed for the year1985 (air parcel trajectories for 1985 were included in the commentor'sset of comments) confirm the observation that sources located in WesternDuPage County and Kane County cannot be associated with any ozone standardexceedances. <T3>Response. </T3>The referenced trajectory analysis for 1985 was reviewed.The analysis is apparently based on ground level wind data and/or pressuregradients for a single height (the documentation lacked specificity withregard to the actual nature and source(s) of the input data), and onlyconsiders horizontal transport. By failing to account for three dimensionalpollutant/parcel transport and pollutant dispersion, the study's analysishas a significant shortcoming; thus its conclusions are incorrect. Ozone concentrations are measured over 1 hour averaging periods. Duringsuch periods, air parcels covering a range of trajectories and representingvaried histories of vertical and horizontal transport (the gusty natureof wind represents this variety of air parcel trajectories and transporthistories) arrive at a given monitoring site. Single line trajectories(isolated straight-line trajectories), in the study of air pollution transportare of limited use and are misleading, particularly when pollutant transportoccurs over longer time periods, as in the case of ozone formation andtransport. If one were to account approximately for pollutant dispersionand varied air parcel trajectories in a backward trajectory analysis, onewould predict an ever broadening source areas as one moves back throughtime. Over the period of time apparently involved in ozone formation inthe Chicago area (because most exceedance peaks do not generally occuruntil early afternoon and can occur as late as the early evening hours,transport times of 6 or more hours are likely in the Chicago area), thesource area would take on the dimensions of the urban area. Even if one were to consider the single line trajectories submitted bythe commentor, it should be noted that several of the straight line trajectoriespresented by the commentor pass near if not over Kane and DuPage Countiesparticularly prior to 8 a.m. Given the effects of varied air parcel trajectoriesand pollutant dispersion, emissions (and the resultant ozone) from Kaneand DuPage Counties could arrive at the high ozone sites on the days discussedfor 1985. <T3>Comment No. 7. </T3>While the proposed rulemaking discusses generalwind directions in many instances, USEPA does not actually attempt to correlateemissions from Kane or DuPage Counties with any exceedance of the ozonestandard in the Chicago area. This lack of any causal connection made byUSEPA between emissions from Kane and DuPage Counties and monitored exceedancesis not surprising; trajectory analyses for 1985 as well as studies citedby USEPA, including those being relied upon by USEPA to deny the redesignationsuggest that an inland source from Kane County will not become involvedin the ``lake breeze phenomenon'' and, hence, will not contribute to ozoneexceedances in the Chicago region. While the rationale in support of theproposed rulemaking relies upon wind direction, it does so only in themost generalized manner. No attempt is made to relate wind direction ondays of ozone exceedances to Kane and DuPage emissions. Further, the noticementions the ``lake breeze'' phenomenon, but does not relate that phenomenonto inland sources, such as VOCs emitted from Kane and DuPage Counties.The lack of any such association is disturbing in light of the technicalliterature cited by USEPA. That literature shows a pronounced lake breezeeffect, and boundaries of various lake breeze phenomenon. For example,Lyons and Cole (1976) reviewed air parcel trajectories. This paper indicatedthat an emission from an inland source, apparently in Kane County, couldnot enter into the lake breeze phenomenon and, therefore, could not bepart of the urban Chicago area contributing to ``high'' ozone levels alongthe lake shore in Illinois or Wisconsin. <T3>Response. </T3>A number of points are appropriate in response to thiscomment. First, a recent ozone standard violation at the DesPlaines monitordoes imply that emissions from Kane and DuPage County may contribute toozone standard violations in the Chicago area. The DesPlaines monitor,located in the northwestern portion of Cook County, is generally downwindof the sources in DuPage and Kane Counties. (DesPlaines is located nearthe northeast corner of DuPage County.) The location of DesPlaines relativeto these Counties is such that high ozone concentration impacts from Kaneand DuPage emissions could be found here (the presence of local VOC andoxides of nitrogen emissions near DesPlaines would act to push peak ozoneimpacts even further downwind). Second, none of the studies cited by USEPA suggests that Kane and DuPageCounty emissions cannot contribute to the ozone precursor concentrationscarried in the ``lake breeze'' transport often found associated with highozone concentrations observed near Lake Michigan downwind of Chicago. Thevery Lyons and Cole article cited by the commentor was reviewed as partof the May 23, 1986, TSD. This article presented possible two dimensionaltrajectories but made no attempt to present specific subarea culpabilitywith respect to downwind ozone impacts. The article did not state thatemissions from Kane and DuPage Counties could not contribute to high downwindozone concentrations. In fact, the article stated that the Chicago urbanarea (which includes DuPage County) is the logical source for the highozone concentrations observed in southeastern Wisconsin. The article didnot differentiate the impacts from the various portions of the Chicagoarea. Third, the Lyons and Cole article cited by the commenter, as well as otherarticles and publications, described mechanisms by which emissions fromthroughout the urban area, including emissions from Kane and DuPage Counties,can be included in the lake breeze transport process. The Lyons and Colepaper implies that prior to the onset of lake breeze fronts, which usuallyoccurs between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. or later, emissions from throughout theurban area can be advected in the surface mixing layer out over Lake Michigan.These pollutants above Lake Michigan may then participate in ozone formationin the lake breeze transport process. A second mechanism is shown in apaper by Lyons and Keen (Lyons, W.A. and Keen, C.S., 1978: ``Lake/LandBreeze Circulations on the Western Shore of Lake Michigan'', Journal ofApplied Meteorology, 17(12), 1843-1855). In this mechanism, emissions fromthe urban area are transported above the subsidence inversion at the topof the lake breeze circulation cell. At the furthest offshore extent ofthe lake breeze cell, the pollutants transported above subsidence inversioncan be entrained into the downward flow within the lake breeze cell andreturned to the lake shore. Fourth, the May 23, 1986, TSD document did reference and consider a priorstudy of resultant wind directions (effective wind directions vectoriallyadded during the hours of peak ozone formation and transport) and highozone days in the Chicago and southeastern Wisconsin areas. The study foundthat high downwind ozone concentrations were predominately associated withresultant winds ranging from east-southeast through west-southwest. Consideringthe time of the peak ozone concentrations (generally in the late afternoonin southeastern Wisconsin), one could conclude that emissions from mostof the Chicago urban area were responsible for the observed high ozoneconcentrations. Finally, even if the commenter were correct in the assertion that KaneCounty emissions were physically prevented from interacting with emissionsfrom other portions of the Chicago urban area, it should be noted thatthe existing ozone monitoring system would not be well suited for detectingthe peak ozone impacts of the emissions from Kane County. There are few``inland'' monitors north or near-northeast of Kane County. Most downwindozone monitors are concentrated near Lake Michigan. Past ozone formationand transport observations made by USEPA in other than urban areas wouldimply that significant, non-monitored ozone impacts could be occurringdownwind of Kane County. <T3>Comment No. 8. </T3>The proposal is not based on any modeling conductedfor the area or on any trajectory analyses. <T3>Response. </T3>It is true that USEPA has not relied on modeling forits proposed rulemaking. As noted in responses to other comments herein,however, the USEPA has based its proposed rulemaking on prior observationsin the Chicago area and in other urban areas with high ozone concentrations.These observations indicate that emissions from throughout urban areasmay contribute to high ozone concentrations observed downwind. The observationssupport a policy which requires that an entire urban area and its fringeareas of development and or significant precursor sources, at a minimum,be included in an urban ozone nonattainment area. DuPage County includesa portion of the Chicago urban area and fringe areas of development, andKane County contains a significant fringe area of development. Furthermore, none of the commentors has applied conclusive modeling datato prove that DuPage and Kane County emissions do not contribute to ozonestandard violations in the Chicago area and its downwind environs. <T3>Comment No. 9. </T3>USEPA's proposed rulemaking cannot be defendedbased on the language of the statute, which requires that the attainmentstatus of an area be based upon monitoring. <T3>Response. </T3>Section 171(2) of the Act defines the term ``nonattainmentarea'' as ``* * * for any air pollutant an area which is shown by monitoreddata on which is calculated by air quality modeling (or other methods determinedby the Administrator to be reliable) to exceed any national ambient airquality standard (NAAQS) for such pollutant.'' The Act, thus, explicitlyauthorizes the Administrator to use monitoring, modeling or other reliablemethods in determining an area's attainment status. In this case, the Administratorrelies on monitored exceedance within the Chicago urban area. USEPA believesthat sections 107 and 171 provide it with the authority to deny the Kaneand DuPage redesignation request, based upon monitored exceedances withinthe Chicago urban area, even though there were no monitored exceedancesin Kane and DuPage Counties. The Seventh Circuit did not rule out the designation of an area as nonattainmentif the area produces but does not suffer from ozone pollution. <T3>Illinois State Chamber of Commerce </T3>v. <T3>USEPA, </T3>775 F.2d 1141, 1150 (7th Cir. 1985). In addition two otherCircuit Courts have explicitly endorsed such an approach. The Sixth Circuitstated that the Administrator may ``deny redesignation with respect toa component of a nonattainment area which produces a substantial portionof the area's pollutant even though the air within that component testsat an acceptable level.'' <T3>State of Ohio </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>776 F.2d 1333, 1340 (6th Cir. 1985). Likewise, theAdministrator may designate downwind portions of an area as nonattainmenteven though the air within that portion satisfies the NAAQS. <T3>Western Oil and Gas Association </T3>v. <T3>USEPA, </T3>767 F.2d 603 (9th Cir. 1985).USEPA has based its denial of the Kane and DuPage redesignation requeston (a) monitored exceedances in the Chicago urban area; (b) the observationof ozone formation and transport processes in a number of urban areas;(c) the desire to require ozone precursor emission controls in the areaswhere they will be most effective in reducing local and downwind ozoneviolations; and (d) the desire to prevent further propagation of ozonestandard violations in locations other than the monitored sites. The ozonedesignation policy discussed in the proposed rulemaking (53 FR 51730),in the May 23, 1986, TSD, and in the policy memoranda discussed in theproposed rulemaking and TSD supports USEPA's denial of this redesignationrequest. <T3>Comment No. 10. </T3>The proposed rulemaking is not based upon monitoringdata taken from within Kane and DuPage Counties. While USEPA notes theDesPlaines ozone monitor which recorded a recent ozone standard violationis located in Cook County near the northeastern corner of DuPage County,it does not apply the same rationale to the Elgin monitor in Kane County.Application of USEPA's rationale to the Elgin monitor would indicate thatKane County is not associated with any monitored standard violations. <T3>Response.</T3> The ozone standard violation at the DesPlaines monitorwas discussed in USEPA's rationale to show that existing data imply thatDuPage County might be experiencing a violation of the ozone standard.The DesPlaines monitor violation, however, is also significant becauseit supports USEPA's main argument for retaining the nonattainment designationfor DuPage County. USEPA continues to assert that DuPage County shouldretain its nonattainment designation because it is reasonable to concludethat through its ozone precursor emissions, DuPage County, as both a portionof the Chicago Urbanized area and a fringe area adjacent to the Chicagourban area, contributes to the ozone standard violations monitored in theChicago area and its downwind environs. The DesPlaines monitor violationsubstantiates the theory that the areas outside of the Chicago urbanizedarea have significant ozone precursors which are contributing to the entirearea's ozone problem. The DesPlaines monitor violation is certainly notnecessary to the logic of retaining Kane and DuPage Counties as nonattainmentareas because if DesPlaines had no monitored violation, Kane and DuPageCounties would nevertheless be considered fringe areas of development (ora portion of the Chicago Urbanized Area) and subject to the nonattainmentdesignation. Thus, USEPA is applying the same logic to both Kane and DuPageCounties with regard to the monitoring that is taking place at DesPlainesand Elgin. <T3>Comment No. 11. </T3>Has silo dust been considered for its role inozone formation? <T3>Response. </T3>Silo dust is not considered to be a VOC and, therefore,has not been considered in the ozone formation process. Silo dust may bea source of nitrogen dioxide, but USEPA's current Illinois emission inventoriesdo not include nitrogen dioxide emissions from this source category. Thisomission shows how insignificant this source category is of ozone precursoremissions relative to other source categories. <T3>Comment No. 12. </T3>Is it possible to consider the impact of jet engineemissions at O'Hare International Airport in the study of the ozone problemin the Chicago area? <T3>Response.</T3> VOC emissions from jet engines at the airports in theChicago area have been considered in the ozone control plans for the Chicagoarea. <T3>Comment No. 13. </T3>USEPA's criteria for determining air quality planning/nonattainment boundaries are neither rational nor internally consistent.The current criteria approach the arbitrary and capricious level by affordingthe USEPA too much discretion in drawing boundaries. The following areexamples of the arbitrary manner in which USEPA can establish boundaries:(a) USEPA can treat a downwind area experiencing monitored ozone standardviolations as its own isolated area for the purpose of developing an attainmentdemonstration; (b) USEPA can assign the downwind area to the upwind nonattainment area;(c) USEPA can assign the downwind area to a different, neighboring urbannonattainment area; and (d) USEPA can designate a nonattainment area to include the urbanized areaand its adjacent fringe areas of development containing significant precursorsources. USEPA has not adequately clarified the basis for selecting one of the aboveoptions for any given nonattainment area and, therefore, has not respondedto the Order of the Court. <T3>Response.</T3> For the purpose of emissions control strategy selectionand ozone standard attainment demonstrations, USEPA's policy allows forvarious types of assignment of downwind monitored nonattainment areas toupwind, associated urban precursor source areas. The assignment is doneon a case-by-case basis, based on such factors as the general wind directionon the days of the monitored ozone standard violations, the timing of theozone standard exceedances, the distribution of precursor emissions (currentand future), and USEPA's overall understanding of the ozone formation andtransport process (based on data from many urban areas). For a downwindarea experiencing ozone standard violations, USEPA could recommend or chooseany one of options (a) through (c) above. Only one of the options wouldbe selected for a given area. As long as the option selected is appropriateto the situation, it is not arbitrary or capricious. The fact that theselection process has multiple options is indicative of the complexityof the ozone formation/transport process and the selection of the mosteffective emissions control strategies, particularly in areas affectedby multiple source areas and the assignment of precursor emission controlrequirements. As discussed in USEPA's proposal, USEPA policy has long held that, regardlessof the source area responsible for a monitored downwind violation, thearea in which a violation is recorded should itself be designated as nonattainmentfor ozone. It is appropriate to apply some emission controls in this areato prevent propagation of the ozone problem further downwind. The decisionamong options (a) through (c) has no relevance to whether upwind areascontributing to the violations in the downwind area should themselves bedesignated nonattainment for the purpose of addressing that contribution.As discussed earlier, planning and control decisions are distinct and separatefrom the nonattainment designation decision. It should be noted that the comment is not relevant to the case at hand.The USEPA has not argued that Kane and DuPage Counties are downwind ofthe Chicago source area, but rather are part of the source area. <T3>Comment No. 14. </T3>The USEPA did not show in 1985 that emissionsfrom Kane and DuPage Counties actually contributed to ozone problems inthe urbanized Chicago area or downwind. The USEPA states that it has notconducted area specific modeling to determine the impacts of precursoremissions that impact these downwind areas. <T3>Response. </T3>As documented in the May 23, 1986, TSD for the proposedrulemaking, the USEPA has reviewed a number of ozone monitoring studiesin the vicinities of major urban areas and has developed a view of theozone formation and transport process for major urban areas. The availabledata indicate that high ozone concentrations result from ozone precursor(VOC and oxides of nitrogen_NO<T2>x</T2>) emissions from large source areas. It is difficult, if notimpossible, to distinguish which subarea(s) are culpable for high ozoneconcentrations occurring hours later downwind. The use of photochemicaldispersion models for a finite set of days at best provides a rudimentaryand incomplete picture of subarea culpability. Without considering allpossible meteorological and input data scenarios (an approach which istechnically infeasible), the use of photochemical models cannot providea complete picture of high ozone concentration in an urban area. In lightof this and the available ozone data, USEPA has adopted the policy thatall of an urbanized area and its adjacent fringe areas of development (andhence significant precursor sources) should be considered to be nonattainmentfor ozone when ozone standard violations are monitored in or downwind ofthe area. Kane and DuPage Counties are part of the Chicago urbanized areaand its adjacent areas of development. It should be noted that USEPA didevaluate surface level wind directions for high ozone days and found thatthe Chicago source area, which includes Kane and DuPage Counties, was generallyupwind of the worst-case ozone monitoring sites on the high ozone days.The study concluded that the Chicago source area was the likely precursorsource area for the high ozone concentrations observed in northeasternIllinois and in Kenosha and Racine Counties, Wisconsin. As noted in the May 23, 1986, TSD, a monitor in DesPlaines, which is generallydownwind of DuPage on high ozone days and is close to the DuPage Countyborder, recorded a recent ozone standard violation. These monitoring datasupport the continued nonattainment designation for DuPage County. Finally, the State of Illinois and commentors have not provided data (modelingor monitoring) to refute USEPA's view of the ozone formation and transportprocess for the Chicago area and the probable culpability of the Kane andDuPage County emissions in the formation of high downwind ozone concentrations.USEPA sees no reason to reverse its prior opinions on these issues. <T3>Comment No. 15. </T3>The USEPA must stipulate how attainment statuscan be obtained at the same time USEPA rules on the boundaries for a nonattainmentarea. This policy specification was ordered by the court in the remandof the Kane and DuPage County redesignation rulemaking. USEPA has not stipulatedwhich monitoring data will be decisive in determining the future attainmentstatus. <T3>Response. </T3>No part of this area, including Kane and DuPage Counties,could be redesignated to attainment until, at a minimum: (1) Illinois andIndiana have fully approved ozone plans for this area (so as to insurethat any improvements in air quality in the area are the result of permanent,enforceable emission reductions and not temporary reductions), and (2)all ozone monitors in the area and its downwind environs show no violationsof the ozone standard over the most current 3 years of available data.It should be noted that the Administrator disapproved the Illinois ozoneSIP for the Chicago area on October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40415), and the Indianaozone SIP for Northwest Indiana (the Indiana portion of the Chicago area)on November 18, 1989 (53 FR 46608). Further, as a result of a suit filedby the State of Wisconsin in the United States District Court for the EasternDistrict of Wisconsin (<T3>State of Wisconsin </T3>v. <T3>United States Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>No. 87-C-0395 (E.D.Wisc.), the court ordered the Administrator, on January 18, 1989, to promulgatea Federal ozone implementation plan for the Chicago area (including NorthwesternIndiana) within 14 months. The Federal ozone implementation plan is currentlyunder development and has not been adopted as of yet. <T3>Comment No. 16. </T3>USEPA proposes to treat some downwind areas asisolated nonattainment areas for the purpose of developing ozone attainmentdemonstrations. An isolated downwind area would have no authority to planfor and implement emission control measures in an upwind pollution-causingarea. Therefore, the isolated downwind area would never be able to achieveattainment of the ozone standard through its own efforts. This isolatedarea could be sanctioned for failing to achieve the ozone standard despitethe fact that it had no means to bring itself into attainment. <T3>Response. </T3>The States containing the nonattainment areas will havethe overall responsibility of adopting and implementing the emissions controlstrategy for their nonattainment areas. As part of this process, each Statewill have to establish the source emissions responsible for the observedozone standard exceedances. Although under USEPA policy no attainment demonstrationis required for isolated rural nonattainment areas, the State may demonstrate,based on wind direction, wind speed, times of peak ozone concentration,back trajectory calculations (including the consideration of pollutantdispersion), etc., that a separate upwind source area is responsible forthe ozone standard violation in the isolated rural area. It will then benecessary for the State to adopt an emissions control strategy for theupwind source area which assures attainment of the ozone standard in theisolated downwind area. If the upwind area is located in a different State,the upwind State will be responsible for the necessary pollution controls.This does not eliminate the need for emission controls in the isolatedarea. Emission controls are needed there to assist in reducing the localozone concentrations and to prevent the further propagation of the ozonenonattainment problem downwind. As discussed above, however, the degreeof controls necessary in any isolated downwind area, and the planning areafor which it is assigned, is irrelevant to the decision whether the upwindcontributing areas being designated as nonattainment. <T3>Comment No. 17.</T3> The proposed rulemaking has done nothing to supportUSEPA's use of the Census Bureau's defined urbanized area populations orurban area definitions as appropriate support for air quality considerations.The rulemaking purports to use city areas and populations of sample high-ozoneareas as somehow being relevant to all of Kane County and all of its population.There is nothing in the record to show what makes Kane County and DuPageCounty a significant VOC source area. <T3>Response.</T3> The population of an urban area is directly relatedto some significant area source VOC emissions, such as consumer solventemissions, automobile refinishing, architectural surface coating, residentialfuel combustion, etc., and indirectly to mobile source emissions. Therefore,the higher the population, the higher these emission contributions willbe and the greater the potential for downwind ozone impacts. The May 23,1986, TSD compared the populations and VOC emissions of Kane and DuPageCounties with those of smaller urban areas with observed ozone standardexceedances or significant downwind ozone concentration impacts. The populationsand VOC emissions of Kane and DuPage Counties were shown to be similarto, or greater than, those of the comparison urban areas with observedsignificant ozone impacts. The combination of the Census Bureau's identificationof certain areas in DuPage and Kane as ``urbanized areas'' adjacent tothe Chicago urbanized area, and the high population of those counties andtheir proximity as fringe areas of development (and hence emissions) warrantsthe conclusion that they have a similarly significant impact on ozone formationin the Chicago area. Although the USEPA has not conducted photochemical dispersion modelingto prove the culpability of Kane and DuPage County emissions, the weightof the data collected from other ozone emission studies indicate that emissionsfrom Kane and DuPage Counties can contribute significantly to high ozoneconcentrations observed in the Chicago area and its downwind environs.It should be noted that the commentor has not provided photochemical dispersionmodeling results or other adequate data to prove otherwise. <T3>Comment No. 18.</T3> A commentor submitted comments previously filedwith respect to USEPA's June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20722), nationwide ozone designationproposal. The commentor requested that these comments also be consideredin the proposed rulemaking on Kane and DuPage Counties. <T3>Response.</T3> Review of these comments shows that those relevant toKane and DuPage Counties were addressed in response to other comments directedspecifically at the December 29, 1988, proposed rulemaking. The other commentsshould be addressed when USEPA finalizes the rulemaking proposed on June6, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rulemaking Action </ITAG>Review of public comments shows that USEPA's policy and technical basisfor disapproving the redesignation of Kane and DuPage Counties to attainmentfor ozone are sound. Therefore, USEPA disapproves the State's request toredesignate Kane and DuPage Counties to attainment of the ozone NAAQS.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by October 3, 1989.
