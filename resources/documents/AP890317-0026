Whether coffee millionaire Alfredo Cristiani will face a runoffwith the second-place finisher in Sunday's presidential electionremains to be seen. But few doubt the Arena standard-bearer will endup the next president.   Arena has moved to the front of a seven-party pack with a flashy,tightly organized campaign that projects a moderate, can-do imageand capitalizes on what may be the party's biggest advantage _ it isnot the incumbent.   ``Many people will not vote so much for Arena as against theChristian Democrats,'' said the Rev. Ignacio Martin Baro, head ofthe Public Opinion Institute at the Central American University.   The Christian Democratic contender, Fidel Chavez Mena, has beenhurt by public perception of President Jose Napoleon Duarte'sadministration. Despite five years in power and more than $3 billionin U.S. aid, living standards deteriorated.   The party is seen as inept and corrupt and has been unable tosolve the nine-year civil war with the leftist Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, which has left 70,000 dead, most of themcivilians.   The third main contender is Guillermo Ungo, 57, who returned fromeight years of political exile to lead a coalition of leftistparties called the Democratic Convergence.   When Arena, known formally as the Republican NationalistAlliance, was born in 1981 it was closely identified with theinterests of the rich and conservative.   But it has broadened its appeal and mastered the art of electoralpolitics.   Arena is promising war-weary Salvadorans the peace and prosperitythey so desperately want, and is doing it with a style andorganization even skeptics find impressive.   ``In times of crisis, people turn to parties that show a greatdeal of self assurance,'' Martin Baro said. ``I think Arena has beensuccessful in selling that kind of image.''   Cristiani, 41, is the moderate face of Arena.   The other side is party founder and ``maximum leader'' RobertoD'Aubuisson, the charismatic former army major persistently accusedof sponsoring death squads. D'Aubuisson denies the charges.   The two faces of Arena are most evident at rallies. D'Aubuisson,who always accompanies Cristiani, is the one who stirs the crowd,who lights the spark.   An Arena rally is a tightly organized, high-energy affair. It hasthe intensity of an evangelical tent revival or a high school peprally infused with conservative political fervor.   Amid the bunting, bands and pom-pom girls, muscular young toughsraise clenched fists, their voices rising to this refrain from theparty song:   ``El Salvador will be the tomb where the Reds meet their end.''   Arena has deftly applied the flashy gimmicks of successful U.S.campaigns in a country where half the people cannot read and 40percent are out of work. Radio and television are the staples.   There are catchy party jingles. There are buttons, balloons andfunny hats. There are T-shirts and pom-pom girls, party pencils andmiles of red, white and blue bunting.   Candidates and party workers appear in public like a winning ballclub, wearing sporty windbreakers and duckbilled party caps.   ``Arena is going to win because people have confidence in it,''construction worker Genaro Herrera predicted during a rally.   Arena is promising jobs, houses, hospitals and schools throughwhat it calls ``capitalism for the masses.'' It wants to reduce thegovernment's role in the economy.   ``We may be conservative, but we are the only party that hasdefined the social problems of the country and offers a solution,''Cristiani maintained in a recent interview.   He said he will give the leftist rebels a choice: join thepolitical process or face an ``efficient, professional use of thearmed forces.''   Some fear an Arena victory could mean more violence and deeperpolarization. Others are more optimistic.   ``I think that as long as Arena can obtain their goalspeacefully, they will not resort to violence,'' Martin Baro said.``I think they would be much more dangerous at present in theopposition, losing the election.''</TEXT></DOC>
