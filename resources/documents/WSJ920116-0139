While Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel might bemore liberal than President Turgut Ozal, the fact is, thecountry is governed by an eight-officer junta.   To claim that the Armenians will ever forgive genocide isblasphemy. The Christian population was systematicallyexterminated in Turkey during the early part of the 20thcentury -- the Armenian genocide being the most hideousmanifestation.</LP><TEXT>   There are many more than 12 million Kurds in Turkey. Theyare, and have been, continuously persecuted. Recently,Turkish planes attacked refugee camps outside the Turkishborder, murdering innocent Kurds. The Kurds are part of anancient nation that deserves independence.   Your article ignores the Cyprus question. Turkey is inviolation of the same United Nations resolutions that wereviolated by Saddam Hussein. The Cyprus Turkish state isrecognized by only one country in the world -- Turkey. Therecannot be any peace in the region unless Turkish troops leavethe island.   Turkey is an isolated country that lost its geopoliticalimportance with the demise of communism. Eventually andinevitably, it will break up; Kurdish independence will berecognized and the just territorial claims of Turkey'ssurrounding neighbors will be realized.   To present Turkey any other way, as you are trying to do,is parroting Turkish Foreign Ministry propaganda.   Elizabeth Stupakis   Justice for Cyprus Committee   Anaheim Hills, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
