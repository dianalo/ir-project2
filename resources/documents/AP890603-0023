Witnesses alsoreported at least 30 people were beaten by police outside theBeijing Hotel.   About 700 to 800 riot police used tear gas to clear an areaaround the entrance to the Communist Party headquarters atZhongnanhai, just west of the square. They also attacked studentsand others with truncheons.   About 5,000 troops, meanwhile, confronted and were quicklysurrounded by crowds outside the Great Hall of the People who weredefying martial law restrictions imposed last month by Premier LiPeng.   The troop advance came hours after larger contingents ofsoldiers were driven back by throngs of people who implored thesoldiers not to crush the student-led movement for democracticreform that began in mid-April.   On the west side of the Great Hall, opposite from the square,crowds quickly grew into the thousands and blocked the troops fromadvancing onto Changan Avenue, the main street running past thesquare.   A city bus was moved in front of the troops to impede theiradvance. Large crowds stood on top of the bus and inside it.   About a half-mile to the west, near Zhongnanhai, students andothers were throwing rocks at riot police, who were armed withtruncheons and knives.   One man, his chest bloodied, said he had been beaten by police.   Chinese witnesses said riot police also battled crowds shortlyafter noon outside the Beijing Hotel, to the east of the square.   They said about 30 people have been beaten by police carryingtruncheons before the police had left the area and headed towardthe north, away from the square.   Meanwhile, an official report said three people were killed whenstruck by a police car in an accident Friday night. Students linkedthe deaths to their demonstrations and called for a general strikein protest.   Troops on Saturday moved against students whose defiance ofmartial law and occupation of Beijing's vast square for weeks havespurred a power struggle among China's rulers.   The military advances began about midnight and ended indisarray. More than eight hours later, soldiers still straggledaway from the city center to the outskirts, where about 200,000soldiers were reportedly camped.   Soldiers advanced down Changan Avenue, the capital's main road,but thousands of students and residents used trucks, buses andtheir bodies to stop them in front of the Beijing Hotel, severalhundred yards east of the square.   Other troop convoys coming from other directions also werehalted.   The middle of the square remained calm, with the ``Ode to Joy''from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony blaring over student loudspeakers.   More than 2,000 people surrounded two unmarked buses, onecarrying about 40 soldiers and the other supplies includingautomatic rifles, 1.2 miles west of Tiananmen.   Some of the people broke into the supply vehicle and removedseveral automatic rifles, one equipped with a bayonet, anddisplayed the weapons on a table set up on top of the bus.   A banner draped on the bus read, ``These are the angels of peacesent by Li Peng government to protect the people of the capital.''   The crowd alternately cheered and jeered the soldiers as theymoved away from the square. Shouts of ``What do you think you'redoing?'' and ``Are you of the people?'' filled the balmy night.   Said one soldier: ``If I'm going to die I want to die on thebattlefield, not on Changan Avenue.''   Earlier, about 3,000 student bicyclists headed from the squareto protest an incident in which a police vehicle ran into a crowd.The bicyclists turned back when they heard that advancing troopswere seen on the other side of the square.   Government-run Beijing Radio reported Saturday that three peoplewere killed in the accident. The official Beijing Daily newspapersaid Saturday that two people were killed and two were seriouslyinjured.   The newspaper said the police car was traveling too fast on wetpavement but gave no other details. Witnesses said the accidentoccurred at about 11 p.m. Friday.   They were not the first deaths linked to the demonstrations. Itwas reported about two weeks ago that a soldier was killed in atraffic accident involving troop movements connected to theprotests.   The Beijing Independent Student Union, in an announcement on thesquare, called for a general strike and a demonstration laterSaturday to protest the deaths.   About 300,000 people crowded into Tiananmen Square on Fridayevening when Ho Te-chien, a singer from Taiwan who defected toChina in 1983, and three others began a hunger strike atop themartyrs' monument in support of the students' 6-week campaign fordemocratic reforms.   Li declared martial law on May 20 to quell the burgeoningstudent-led protest movement, but the declaration only triggeredgreater support for the students.   The number of student protests inside the square had declineddramatically in the past week, with about 10,000 maintaining around-the-clock vigil. But Friday evening, huge masses againconverged on the plaza, the symbolic heart of China.   The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinarycitizens, are demanding more democracy, an end to officialcorruption.   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who advocatedconcessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and isunder house arrest.</TEXT></DOC>
