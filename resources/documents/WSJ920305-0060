Indonesian ladies,&quot; saysGeneral Hashim Mohamed Ali.   A caddy shortage isn't about to drive Malaysia's economyinto the rough. But Gen. Hashim may have caught a glimpse ofthe future in many parts of Asia. In Jakarta, there areenough Filipino white-collar professionals to fill a 20-lanebowling alley for weekly tournaments. In Japan, almost 40,000Chinese and Southeast Asians work in factories, ostensibly as&quot;trainees&quot; imported to fill gaps in the local work force. InSouth Korea, thousands of Chinese of Korean descent visitrelatives on tourist visas, then stay on to work in a countrythat not long ago was a major exporter of labor.</LP><TEXT>   Asian workers are on the move. More than two million menand women from East and Southeast Asia have left home to workelsewhere in the region. This growing labor force no longercomprises mainly domestic helpers, construction workers orunskilled farm laborers; it includes accountants, flightattendants, machine-tool operators and cooks. In the 1990s,economists expect more workers to flow across the region'sincreasingly porous borders, legally and illegally, raisingworrisome economic and social questions.   What's happening in East Asia's most successful economiesmirrors demographic trends first seen in industrializingWestern Europe and North America. As Asian economies prosper,birth rates fall, people live longer, urbanization gathersspeed as rural workers migrate to higher-paying jobs, andlabor costs rise. Gradually, the expansion of working-agepopulations is slowing as Asia's more economically advancednations age.   The West's industrial powers coped with these changes bydrawing immigrants from poorer countries and automatingproduction to remain competitive. But ethnically homogenousJapan's path to industrialization put a new spin on Asia'sdemographic development. Long reluctant to import foreignlabor, Japan instead exported capital to Asian countries withlabor surpluses. That produced a tide of manufacturing jobsthat has spread through Asia's first generation of newlyindustrialized countries, or NICs-South Korea, Taiwan, HongKong and Singapore. That tide, fueled with fresh capital fromthe NICs, has now spilled over into Southeast Asia,triggering a repeat of the cycle there.   As a result, demographic patterns that took 100 years toevolve in the West are being compressed into a few decades incountries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. There,growth in the domestic labor force is likely to slow bybetween 25% and 50% in the 1990s from the previous decade.Demographers detect similar trends emerging in Thailand,Malaysia, and even Indonesia, which remains comparativelypoor. Japan's work force, already the oldest amongindustrialized nations, is expected to begin shrinking soonafter the turn of the century.   &quot;Trends are pretty clear. In Japan and virtually all ofthe newly industrialized countries, there are severe laborshortages,&quot; says John Bauer, a labor economist at thePopulation Institute at Hawaii's East-West Center. &quot;Thesewill become much more dramatic over the next decade. Thesecountries haven't seen anything yet.&quot;   Already, the newly industrialized countries of Asia mustimport tens of thousands of workers. And soon, someeconomists fear, unmet demand for skilled technicians,scientists and managers could blunt the robust economicexpansion and industrialization that is transformingcountries such as Malaysia and Thailand.   All of this means that larger labor migrations are on tap,says Steven Wong Cheng Ming, assistant director-general forinternational economics at Malaysia's Institute for Strategicand International Studies. &quot;We're going to see an enormoustangle about how to come to terms with cross-border flows oflabor.&quot;   The shifting labor picture is already reshaping somenational economic goals. Tiny Singapore, which limits thenumber of foreign workers, has tacitly accepted the prospectof slower growth and the need to relocate many industries toneighboring Indonesia and Malaysia. Taiwan is recruitingthousands of Southeast Asian workers, and in Malaysia, wheremore than 50% of construction and plantation workers alreadyare foreigners, employers recently were allowed for the firsttime to import labor for certain factory jobs.   &quot;By the middle of the decade, we will have to re-rate theregion's ability to sustain growth in the labor force,&quot;predicts Miron Mushkat, chief regional economist at BaringSecurities (Hong Kong) Ltd. &quot;In some parts of Asia, we'realready reaching the point of demographic stagnation.&quot;   Some countries have begun to overhaul antiquated educationsystems and vocational-training programs to focus on thefuture needs of increasingly manufacturing-based economies.But results won't come quickly. Local businesses, too, willhave to invest in automated production, job training, andresearch and development. Wages, which have been rising fastin countries such as Singapore and South Korea, will have toclimb some more. Matching productivity gains to salaryincreases will become a key task for Asian managers.   &quot;How we solve our labor problem will depend on increasingproductivity over the next 10 years,&quot; says Kamal Salih,executive director of the Malaysian Institute of EconomicResearch. &quot;If we can manage it, growth won't be disrupted.But if we don't do something now, this will be a very seriousbottleneck in our industrialization process.&quot;   Some free-market advocates aren't too worried. Theycontend that the laws of supply and demand make the greaterflow of labor across borders inevitable, and they point toEurope's single market as an example. But in Asia, manycountries are wary of opening their doors to a diverseassortment of immigrants. Doing so will require painfuleconomic and social tradeoffs.   Resistance from labor unions to imported workers also hascropped up from Malaysia to Hong Kong to Japan. Their fear:Employers obsessed with quick fixes offered by cheap migrantlabor won't upgrade the salaries and working conditions oflocal employees. &quot;How can you develop a country by floodingit with foreign labor?&quot; asks G. Rajasekaran, a leader of theMalayan Trade Union Congress. Still, many economists areoptimistic, noting that with some exceptions, wages andincomes in developing Asia remain well below those in Japanand the West, leaving plenty of room for big productivitygains.   Other upbeat analysts say tight labor supplies will forcerapid technological innovation and adoption of sophisticatedproduction techniques that will enhance Asia's long-termcompetitiveness. &quot;Shortages will drive these economiesup-market,&quot; says William Overholt, executive director ofBankers Trust Co. in Hong Kong.   &quot;This isn't a problem, this is one aspect of success. It'sonly a problem if you react by trying to delay the process,&quot;says Mr. Overholt.</TEXT></DOC>
