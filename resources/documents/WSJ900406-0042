The hamburger chain's new owner, Grand Metropolitan PLC ofBritain, is optimistic Burger King will contribute to itsbottom line this year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're proving the validity of this acquisition,&quot; saysBurger King's chief financial officer, Robert Stetson.   A year-long overhaul has touched everything from thenumber of franchisees to the detergents used to clean thekitchens. Determined to distinguish Burger King, the nation'ssecond-largest burger chain, from the competition, Grand Methas launched aggressive promotional efforts, such as thecurrent one with popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtlevideotapes. Even small details are getting great attention.For instance, Burger King recently said it would replace itshouse salad dressing with actor Paul Newman's name brand.   But even though Burger King just completed its bestquarter in three years, with profit up 25%, managementconcedes it's too early to proclaim a total turnaround forthe unit, which was acquired along with Pillsbury Co. lastyear. The words &quot;turnaround and transformation signify fast,almost violent changes in direction, which aren'tappropriate,&quot; says Barry Gibbons, the British-born retailingwhiz recruit brought in last year to rebuild the Miami-basedfast-food business, whose profits sagged under Pillsbury.   &quot;They're just starting,&quot; agrees Emanuel Goldman, aPaineWebber Inc. restaurant-industry analyst.   Mr. Goldman believes Burger King must turn unique assetsinto competitive advantages, and he cites three examples: Oneis Burger King's ability to customize its foods, as touted inthe once-successful &quot;Have It Your Way&quot; campaign. It'ssomething that archrival McDonald's doesn't do. Another isthe fact that Burger King broils its burgers rather thanfries them as McDonald's does, a potential edge amid growingpublic consciousness about cholesterol and fats. Finally, theanalyst says, &quot;the fact that the company had been so grosslymismanaged&quot; under Pillsbury's ownership makes improvementthat much easier. &quot;We're not dealing with a bettersemiconductor chip,&quot; Mr. Goldman says. &quot;This is basic stuff.&quot;   But the rapid stream of changes and the company's demandsfor modernizations at the restaurants have bruised somefranchisees, the backbone of Burger King's 6,200-storedomestic system. Some complain of the burden those changeshave put on franchisees. &quot;They've not done one thing toreduce our costs,&quot; gripes one Midwest franchisee.   Mr. Gibbons promises that further planned changes shouldhelp reduce operators' overhead. He points to an experimentwith countertop computers where customers will punch in theirorders, then pay with the swipe of a credit card. Theintention is to reduce order errors, speed food delivery andshrink the store crew size.   Labor-saving devices also will modernize Burger Kingkitchens. &quot;We shouldn't be chopping lettuce in therestaurant,&quot; says Gary Langstaff, executive vice president ofmarketing. He and others see technology helping the companyrefocus the 270,000-strong store personnel on service.   Too many operators have concentrated on &quot;what's easiestfor the restaurant, not what's best for the customers,&quot; Mr.Langstaff says. &quot;The focus should be on the entire eatingexperience, which includes service as well as food.&quot;   As part of the service slant, the company wants to addmore of a personal touch. As reported, the chain soon willtest high-tech drive-through windows featuring better soundsystems and video screens that allow the customer to see theorder taker.   Mr. Gibbons wasted little time in changing things. In amemo his first day on the job -- written before breakfast, hesays -- the executive said earnings were &quot;a mess&quot; and costsrequired &quot;urgent work.&quot; Soon hundreds of employees were letgo and several management layers stripped away. What had beena billion-dollar food purchasing and distribution systemunderwent radical surgery.   Work also began on product introductions. With one millionsales a day, the new BK Broiler chicken sandwich already ischallenging Burger King's Whopper hamburger for star billingon the menu. The company's Kids' Club received a similarlypopular reception; several million youngsters signed up.Meanwhile, &quot;mystery shoppers&quot; -- essentially spies fromheadquarters -- prowled stores looking for problems, andoperators took thousands of calls on an 800 numberestablished for customer feedback.   Already nearly 100 franchisees have been dropped, on theground that they didn't meet the company's standards. Companymanagers stopped renewing leases for what Mr. Gibbons calls&quot;some of the worst operators in the business.&quot;   Joseph Angel, a franchisee in Portland, Ore., says theresult of the rapid-fire overhaul has been &quot;to get theconsistency of operations and product back on the frontburner.&quot; Adds Richard Fors, a Buffalo, N.Y., multi-storefranchisee who heads the chain's National FranchiseeAssociation: &quot;There's stability in the system for the firsttime in years. We used to think no one in the corporation waslistening.&quot;   But franchisees are still grumbling over Burger King'sdecision to take marketing money away from local promotionsin favor of national advertising campaigns. Also, Mr.Langstaff's &quot;Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules&quot; marketingtagline remains controversial; one franchisee questions itsappropriateness given today's concern with drug abuse andjuvenile delinquency.   Although he agrees that previous management &quot;panicked&quot;over marketing -- failing to introduce new products while itreeled through an embarrassing series of faux pax, includingthe infamous Herb the Nerd advertising campaign -- Mr.Gibbons prefers not to talk about Burger King's pastproblems. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, they're history.&quot;   Ever upbeat, Mr. Gibbons likens the company to aprofessional golfer whose game went into a slump. &quot;We're agreat name on the tour. We've had a couple of years off theleader board, no question. But with a new sponsor and a fewnew clubs, we're back.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
