As U.S. troops continued to arrive in Honduras in a show offorce, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said additionalassistance was being discussed with Honduran President Jose Azcona,in response to a reported Nicaraguan incursion.   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President Reaganwould give ``most careful'' consideration to any request fromHonduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, although hereiterated that U.S. troops were not expected to be involved in anymilitary operation in the region.   One of the Senate's leading peace advocates, Sen. Mark O.Hatfield, said the sending of U.S. troops amounted merely to``matching stupidity with stupidity'' and introduced legislationbarring the troops from a combat role without permission fromCongress.   Sponsors of the new Contra aid proposal said they hoped it wouldrevive negotiations in Congress and with the Reagan administrationon an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplieslost or expended during the past week's heavy fighting along theNicaraguan-Honduran border.   But the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by theSandinista incursion remained unclear. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Nicaraguantroops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives.   ``We think it's very important right now to send a signal to theSandinista government'' which allegedly crossed the border intoHonduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies, Borensaid.   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said announcement of the packagealso would strengthen the Contras as they enter direct cease-firetalks with the Managua regime, scheduled for Monday. ``This is acommon-sense, moderate and reasoned approach,'' she said.   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money tobuy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and to transportit to troops in the field, over the next year. About $3 million ofthat amount would go for communications gear.   But in what promised to be a controversial provision, thepackage would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weaponspreviously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Borensaid the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth ofundelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.   And it would give President Reagan the right to hold a quick,guaranteed vote in Congress on any request for further military aidunder certain conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistasand Contras break down.   As a ``carrot,'' the bill also would promise long-term economicaid for the region once political stability is restored.   An administration official, speaking on condition he not beidentified, said of the new aid package, ``We are encouraged fromreports we have heard about it, but we will have to wait until wehave the actual details.''   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., who has opposed Contra aid in thepast, said he was supporting the latest proposal because it ``isthe best way to ensure that (the peace talks) have some chance ofsuccess.''   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled sinceMarch 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package ofpurely humanitarian aid. Aid proponents saw the Sandinistaincursion into Honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest inaid.   Meanwhile, Abrams told reporters that American officials havebeen discussing with Honduran President Azcona the possibility ofproviding additional assistance to that country, in addition to the3,200 troops already airlifted to Palmerola Air Base nearTegucigalpa.   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''Abrams said, adding that the possibilities did not includeadditional troops. ``We do not have a formal request from PresidentAzcona as of this morning for any other form of assistance.Obviously, if we get one we'll take it very seriously.''   Baker said that if a request were received from Honduras fortroops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, ``it would be mostcarefully considered and most deliberately considered. But I cannottell you what decision the president would make under thosecircumstances.''   Baker, interviewed on the syndicated television program, ``JohnMcLaughlin's One on One,'' was asked at what point U.S. troopswould enter action.   ``I don't anticipate that will occur at all. I think that theHonduran forces can handle that on their own, and I fullyanticipate that either the Nicaraguans will retire on their own orHonduras will, as they say, encourage them to do that. But I do notexpect American troops to be involved in any military operationthere,'' he said.   Hatfield's proposal would permit U.S. military exercises inHonduras, like the training mission which began Thursday, only ifCongress has been notified a month in advance. Troops could not besent into combat without a declaration of war or a ``clear andpresent danger'' of attack on the United States or its citizens. Italso would prohibit any increase in the permanent U.S. militarypresence there.   He said the administration's action amounted to ``sinking to thelevel of those in Nicaragua who have no interest in peace.''   ``Under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and willnot tolerate sending American military personnel into combat inCentral America,'' Hatfield said. ``It is not an option... We willnot permit our young people to be used as pawns in this politicalgame. And we will not push them down the slippery slope ofintervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down thatslope into Vietnam.''</TEXT></DOC>
