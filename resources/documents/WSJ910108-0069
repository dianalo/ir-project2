Mossberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   MDEST EUROP AFRIC LATAM FREST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- If war starts in the Persian Gulf, police incountries across the world, including the U.S., plan raids onsuspected pro-Iraqi terrorist cells they have had undersurveillance for months.   It's understood that the raids are intended to disrupt andharass suspected terrorist groups that Western officialsbelieve are prepared to carry out Iraqi leader SaddamHussein's threat to take any war into countries around theworld.</LP><TEXT>   American intelligence officials say, however, that no suchraids can round up all terrorists poised to move when warstarts. They expect the onset of war to set off an immediatewave of terrorist bombings of American, other Western andmoderate Arab targets by members of groups either controlledby or sympathetic to Iraq.   Many of the expected incidents are likely to occur in theMiddle East, Europe and North Africa, these officials say.But threats have been made or detected in such far-flungplaces as Brazil, the Philippines and Australia.   Most ominously, government counterterrorism officials arebracing for possible bombings inside the U.S., which has foryears managed to repel and deter attacks by Mideastterrorists.   Terrorism experts in the Bush administration will discussthe terrorist side of a potential war only in general termsand only on condition they aren't identified. They wouldn'tcomment on the subject of rounding up suspected terrorists.   But one official said that &quot;our guess is that theterrorists have already done the operational planning formany of the incidents and that they are just waiting now forthe war.&quot; Another official said that counterterror forces,for their part, &quot;are fully cranked up and ready.&quot;   The contemplated police raids would be preventative, andmany of those rounded up would have to be released fairlyquickly for lack of evidence they had committed crimes. Butanti-terrorism agencies around the world hope the actionswill break up at least some early plans for attacks andfrighten terrorist leaders.   James Schlesinger, a former defense secretary and directorof central intelligence, predicted yesterday that &quot;there willbe a wave of terrorism and sabotage&quot; if war starts. He addedthat Western Europe would be a prime target and that &quot;Isuspect that there may be a number of intermittent attacks inthis country.&quot;   Since shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, the U.S.government has repeatedly claimed that it has spottedsuspected terrorist operatives scouting out and photographingpossible targets at American installations abroad. The StateDepartment said so again yesterday. And the administrationhas issued several specific terrorist warnings.   But as the possible start of war gets nearer, concern isrising.   Two developments are particularly worrisome, officialssay. There are some signs that Iraqi agents have begun tomake use of the established network of commercial fronts thatLibya established in the 1980s to organize and coordinateterrorism. And there are signs that non-Arab terrorist groupsare in contact with Iraq, leading to fears they too may joinin the expected terror campaign.   Among the main Arab groups likely to be involved in theattacks, officials say, are the Abu Nidal organization, thePalestine Liberation Front, and a band led by Abu Ibrahim, ashadowy master bomb maker. All are believed to operate out ofBaghdad.</TEXT></DOC>
