U.S. Treasury bonds fell especially sharply. Actively traded government bonds tumbled about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount. That was their biggest setback since Nov. 4.    Late in the day, benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 9.11%, the highest level since late September and up from 9.01% Tuesday. Corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bond yields also rose.    The dollar's woes added to traders' fears about how investors, especially foreigners, will react to the Treasury's auction today of about $9 billion of new 30-year bonds. In the past, foreign investors, especially Japanese institutions, have purchased huge amounts of long-term Treasury issues. But this time the dollar's weakness may frighten away many institutions.    A lower dollar also means higher prices of imported goods in the U.S., contributing to inflation pressures. If the dollar continues to drop, the Federal Reserve may react by raising short-term interest rates further to attract investors.    Many analysts expect the Fed to act by year end. That, in turn, would probably mean that U.S. banks would raise their prime, or base, lending rates, which have stood at 10% since August. Rates on short-term Treasury bills, which have risen sharply over the past week, were mixed yesterday.    Bond prices began to slide early in reaction to the dollar's weakness after the government released its September trade report. The trade deficit narrowed to $10.46 billion in September from a revised $12.27 billion in August, as expected.    Bonds continued to slump after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the continuation of foreign capital inflows at current levels is &quot;questionable.&quot;    Mr. Greenspan said evidence for the U.S. and most other industrial nations over the past century indicates that &quot;such sizable foreign net capital inflows have not persisted and, hence, may not be a reliable substitute for domestic savings on a long-term basis.&quot;    Mr. Greenspan, as usual, didn't indicate if the Fed is planning to tighten credit. But many analysts say the Fed won't have any choice if the dollar continues falling and the U.S. economy continues expanding at a brisk pace.    &quot;The prevailing market sentiment is still negative about the dollar,&quot; says Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc.    Nevertheless, Mr. Pardee and several other financial executives expect Japanese investors to buy large amounts of the new 30-year bonds today. One reason: U.S. government issues now offer much higher yields than comparable Japanese bonds.    For example, Japanese bonds due in about 10 years yield about 4 5/8%, compared with 9.01% on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and nearly 9 1/8% on 30-year Treasury bonds. Mr. Pardee estimated that Japanese investors will buy about 30% of the new 30-year Treasury bonds to be sold today.    Speculation has been growing all week that U.S. banks may raise their prime rate soon. But most bankers say they are awaiting a further move by the Fed.    Treasury Securities   Treasury bonds finished very close to their lowest levels of the day.    The government's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to 100 1/8, a loss of 1 1/32 point, from 101 5/32 late Tuesday. The yield rose to 9.11% from 9.01%.    The government's new 10-year notes dropped 5/8 point to 99 3/32 from 99 23/32 Tuesday. The yield rose to 9.01% from 8.92%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 10.10 points to 1235.73. It finished just above the low of 1235.04. The high was 1248.56. The total return so far this year on the bonds in the index is 7.03%; that includes both price changes and interest income.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted at 7.90% bid, down from 7.94% Tuesday. But the latest six-month bill rate was unchanged at 7.96% bid.    Calculated on a bond-equivalent basis, the latest three-month bill yields about 8.15%, while six-month bills return about 8.39%.    Municipal Issues -   Municipal bonds fell in reaction to a soft dollar and lower Treasury bond prices.    Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 fell about 3/8 of a point to 94.    Prices of New York state short-term obligations tumbled on Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.'s announcement that it placed the state's debt obligations on CreditWatch with negative implications. New York state tax and revenue anticipation notes were quoted late in the day at a price to yield 6.35% and offered at a price to yield 6.25%. At one point earlier, they traded at 6.39%, according to traders. Late Tuesday, the notes were bid to yield 6.10% and offered at 6%.    New York City revenue anticipation notes, which suffered along with short-term state obligations on name association, also pulled off their lows.    Longer-term New York state issues were only mildly affected by Sandamp;P's action. The reaction was mitigated in part by the dearth of available state bonds, some traders said.    Maury Cooper, vice president with Sandamp;P, said New York state's obligations will remain on CreditWatch &quot;until there's a clear indication from the state as to what action they're going to take.&quot; The state legislature reconvenes at the end of the month and &quot;we hope they will quickly take up discussion of how to address&quot; this year's $994 million budget deficit and the gap that Sandamp;P expects to emerge the following year, Mr. Cooper said.    Corporate, Other Issues   Israel kicked off the second phase of a debt refinancing program with the sale of $2.25 billion of securities.    Meanwhile, corporate bond prices finished the day 1/8 to 1/2 point lower in light trading.    Underwriters said the large Israel offering was meeting keen demand even on a day when credit markets in general were weak. Many portions of the Israel offering were priced at smaller spreads against Treasurys than originally expected.    This sale, like one in late September, allows Israel to refinance higher-cost military loans that were made by the U.S. government to Israel.    These transactions also allow the U.S. government to get those loans off its ledger and into the hands of the private sector. These certificates, though, do have 90% of the interest and principal backed by the U.S. government, with the remaining 10% collateralized by U.S. government securities.    So far, only Israel and Tunisia have taken advantage of the refinancing program. Turkey is said to be preparing an issue that could be sizable.    The Israel issue was priced to yield from 9.01% in 1991 to 9.415% in 2002.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. increased the coupon rate on the mortgage securities it auctions daily, signaling higher mortgage rates for consumers.    Freddie Mac raised the coupon on its 30-year mortgage securities to 10% from 9 1/2% at its afternoon sale.    The move resulted from the decline in the mortgage securities market during the past two weeks. Active mortgage issues are down about two points since Oct. 31.    Freddie Mac offered to pay loan originators 10.20% for 30-year mortgages deliverable within 10 days, up from the low of 9.82% on Oct. 31.    Freddie Mac takes mortgages it buys from originators and resells them to investors as mortgage securities.    Freddie Mac's action could prefigure an increase in the Veterans Administration's mortgage rate ceiling to 10.5% from 10%. The VA cut its ceiling for guaranteed loans to 10% from 10.5% on Nov. 1. Freddie Mac usually acts before the VA.    In the pass-through market, prices were off 1/4 to 1/2 point, as active issues held up better than Treasurys. Ginnie Mae 9% securities for December delivery ended at 94 1/2, down 14/32; 9 1/2% securities at 97 10/32, off 12/32; and 10% securities at 100, down 12/32.    The 9 1/2% securities yielded 10.02% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the yield spread above the 10-year Treasury note narrowed two basis points to 103 basis points.    Late in the day, a $500 million issue of Freddie Mac Remic mortgage securities was offered in 13 classes by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The offering, Series 23, brings Freddie Mac's Remic volume to $11.8 billion. The issue is backed by Freddie Mac 10% securities. Remics are real estate mortgage investment conduits.    Foreign Bonds   British government bond prices drifted slightly lower in light activity.    Prices rose early in the day but then turned down as U.S. Treasury bonds fell in reaction to the falling dollar.    Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 of a point to 115 25/32 to yield 9.67%. Among shorter-term bonds, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was down 4/32 to 101 22/32 to yield 10.81%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 fell 6/32 to 107 18/32 to yield 10.30%.    In other major markets:   --Japanese government bonds declined again in light activity ahead of the release of the U.S. trade deficit report. Japan's benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 fell to a price of 102.36, down 0.36 yen for each 100 yen face value, in the interdealer market. The yield rose to 4.63%, up 5.5 basis points on the day. The range on the session was 4.57% to 4.64%.    --Eurodollar bonds finished slightly lower, also in light activity. Among the new issues was an offering of 250 million European currency units by Nestle Holdings Inc., a holding concern for the Swiss food giant's U.S. units. Bankers Trust International was lead manager.    --Swiss franc bonds ended little changed. &quot;It's been extremely quiet and extremely boring,&quot; one dealer said. </TEXT></DOC>
