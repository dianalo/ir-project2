Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, who was Mexico's equivalent of FBIdirector, was arrested Tuesday and called the mastermind of themurder of newspaper columnist Manuel Buendia.   On Wednesday, opposition legislators demanded that formerPresident Miguel de la Madrid and Interior Secretary FernandoGutierrez Barrios testify before a parliamentary committee on their``possible knowledge'' of details surrounding killing, said theExcelsior News Service.   The opposition's proposal was rejected by members of thegoverning Institutional Revolutionary Party, the news agency said.   The business daily El Financiero on Wednesday quoted testimony ofthose interviewed in the investigation that led to Zorrilla's arrestas indicating he feared Buendia would publicize his alleged links todrug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero.   Caro Quintero is awaiting trial in the 1985 torture-murder of aU.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.   Excelsior, also quoting case testimony, said witnesses toldinvestigators Zorrilla was linked to Miguel Felix Gallardo andErnesto Fonseca Carrillo, both recently jailed for operating hugedrug smuggling operations.   The testimony quoted by Excelsior also said Zorrilla hadillegally provided police credentials to 16 drug traffickers to helpthem in their operations.   ``I'm innocent. I need your help. I'm not guilty,'' Excelsiorquoted Zorrilla as saying as he was processed at the NorthernPenitentiary on Wednesday night.   Zorrilla, 47, was scheduled to be arraigned today.   He surrendered to authorities Tuesday night after a briefshootout in a Mexico City neighborhood. No one was hurt.   He was questioned for 18 hours after his arrest by the deputyfederal attorney general in charge of narcotics, Javier Coello Trejo.   Zorrilla is accused of masterminding the May 30, 1984, shootingdeath of Buendia in a Mexico City parking garage. Buendia was acolumnist for the daily Excelsior and author of hard-hitting bookson corruption and illegal sales of drugs and weapons.   Authorities refused to identify three other suspects in thekilling, saying that could hamper their investigation.   Mexico City Attorney General Ignacio Morales Lechuga on Sundaynight announced an arrest warrant for Zorrilla, saying the formersecurity director had ordered Buendia's death.   The government has come under intense pressure to solve themurder of Buendia, one of 25 journalists slain since 1982, and therehave been accusations that high-ranking officials were involved in acover-up.   Zorrilla headed the Federal Security Department from 1981 tomid-1984. The department was dismantled in 1985 because ofcorruption.   He previously was a congressman and private secretary toGutierrez Barrios, now the nation's top law enforcement official.   Opposition legislators had asked Gutierrez Barrios and de laMadrid, whose six-year term as president ended in December, totestify before a parliamentary committee on the ``possibleknowledge'' they had of Zorrilla's involvement in Buendia's death,Excelsior said.   The governing party rejected the proposal. ``It is totallyfrivolous, without foundation and justification,'' Excelsior quotedPRI Deputy Dionisio Perez Jacomo as saying.   Gutierrez Barrios has not made any public statements onZorrilla's arrest.   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa on Wednesday, officialsannounced the arrest of a suspect in the February 1988 killing ofanother journalist, Manuel Burgueno Orduno.   The government news agency Notimex quoted the suspect as sayinghe killed Burgueno because of the reporter's written attacks againstthe suspect's brother, the former Sinaloa state judicial policecommander.   Police believe the former police commander, who remains at large,ordered the slaying.   The agency quoted state Attorney General Manuel Lazcano Ochoa assaying the suspect, Rigoberto Rodriguez Banuelos, confessed to beingone of four people involved in the killing.   The news agency said Rodriguez was arrested in Agua Prieta,Sonora. It did not say when he was arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
