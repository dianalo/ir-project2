Negative ones would assume darker motives.andM;Zelenograd is conveniently located about 20 miles from Moscow and only 10miles from Sheremetyevo, the city's international airport.andP;  Appropriately,the Doka site in a long grey building is dominated by a nearby hotelbuilding, which was built but never finished.andP;  Doka is now looking for alow-tech partner to finish it -- which would be an excellent commercialproposition if Technopolis is approved.andM;Doka had invited us to pique our interest and, with luck, to spread wordthrough us to others.andP;  While we were there, the trip's sponsor, DougMellinger of the Mellinger Group, signed a letter of intent with Doka to forma US-Soviet joint venture, ASTEC (for American-Soviet Technology EntrepreneurCooperation) to act as a holding company and financial sponsor forDoka-inspired joint ventures.andM;It's who you know....andM;Doka is a private organization -- i.e., one with no direct ties to the state.andO;As an independent organization, Doka is free to do what it wants -- but alsohas little power to get what it needs.andP;  In a world without meaningful money,it's who you are that counts: What resources do you control? Whatbureaucracies can you manipulate?andP;  What can you do for me?andM;Thus, you have to have ties to the state, because the state owns all theresources, from buildings and land to supplies, equipment and trainingfacilities.andP;  The state also tells students where to work and otherorganizations where to put food stores, bus lines and apartment buildings.andO;In other words, freedom can be just another word for lack of influence.andM;But Doka does have influence, in the usual ad-hoc way that connections work.andO;It was formally founded in 1987, by a bunch of young people &quot;who couldn'tfind jobs within the system,&quot; says founder Alexander Chuenko.andP;  They had beenworking together since 1982.andP;  The outfit was sponsored (or sheltered frominterference) by the State Committee on Science and Technical Policy (GKNT),a high-powered body that reports directly to the Supreme Soviet, but it tookno funding.andP;  Compared to, say, Petr Zrelov, the head of JV Dialog (seeRelease 1.0, 89-11), Chuenko seems somewhat more naive.andP;  Although both areParty members, (4) Zrelov seems to know how to make his connections work toachieve his own goals, whereas Chuenko, 10 years younger at 33ish, seems tohave won the confidence and enthusiastic support of people who share hisgoals, even if they don't have the energy or character to work for them moredirectly.andP;  Indeed, Doka seems to be unusually capable and aggressive.andP;  Wewere able to get our visa within a week of being invited.andM;Not just another pretty co-opandM;We got further evidence of Doka's connections through a round of visits withSoviet luminaries, starting with the mayor of Zelenograd and the chief of theMoscow Institute of Electronic Technology, also in Zelenograd -- whereChuenko was a student not so long ago.andP;  Founded in 1963, the Institute is asignificant part of Zelenograd's appeal as a high-tech center.andP;  It draws its4000 students from all over the Soviet Union, and conducts leading-edgeresearch in semiconductor design and manufacture, among other areas whereDoka hopes to attract foreign investment.andP;  Its students build prototypesystems in the Institute's own production facilities, and work in localgovernment-owned factories before and after graduation.andM;Others we met through Doka included the International Fuel and PowerAssociation (itself a group of energy-oriented ministries seeking foreigninvestors for energy projects, particularly environment-favoring ones such aspollution control and waste reuse), and high officials from the Committee onScience and Technology and the Academy of Sciences.andM;JVs in lineandM;Most interesting was Yuri Proskuryakov, deputy head of the Foreign InvestmentDivision of the Ministry of Finance, who is in charge of registering jointventures (although they need approval from other quarters as well).andP;  He runsa team of only five professionals (and one secretary) who are scrambling tokeep up with a stream of new applications for JVs.andP;  They come in at 200 permonth, but can be processed at only 160 per month.andP;  About 1280 have beenapproved since early 1987.andP;  Because of nationwide budget-consciousnessProskuryakov can't enlarge his staff, nor can he go outside to buy moreeffective software to keep track of things.andP;  (A dBASE application builtin-house keeps losing data, he says.)andP;  Finally, he says, some of his people,now replaced, left last year to join joint ventures themselves.andP;  (We guessit's encouraging to see that the market works, even in sometimes inconvenientways.)andP;  He can't give any special consideration to applications from friends-- Doka, say -- but he can take them home and make sure they get readpromptly.andP;  Moreover, he could be a valuable ally in piloting the unusualumbrella joint venture envisioned by Doka and Mellinger through the shoals ofbureaucracy.andM;Can the acorn take root?andM;Doka now has 33 people of its own and about 2500 contractors in 18 citiesthroughout the USSR, who can operate through Doka without the pleasures andperils of setting up in business for themselves.andP;  Doka has developed a numberof products internally, including a sensing device to help keep track of railcars.andP;  It also sells, among other software, the Semantic Maze package -- withunusual diligence and energy, according to developer Vladimir Pokhilko (seeRelease 1.0, 89-11).andP;  Turnover in 1989 should approach 10 million rubles ($16million at official rates), from products such as expert systems, softwarefor construction and operation of nuclear plants, electrical machinery,instruments and electronic components.andM;But unlike the research institutes which it resembles in many ways, saysChuenko, &quot;we're small and flexible.andP;  We get orders from our partners [i.e.andO;government organizations] to solve problems, and we figure out how to do so.&quot;andO;The surplus is ploughed back into research in such areas as solid-bodyphysics, as well as more mundane industrial areas.andP;  Doka has reinvested 8.5million rubles of payments over the past seven years, he says.andM;As noted, Doka's goals are far grander: Chuenko wants Doka to be the midwifeto a wide range of small high-tech-based joint ventures that will operate outof a free zone in Zelenograd to be called &quot;Technopolis.&quot;andP;  Rather than startApple Computer, he wants to start Silicon Valley, nurturing a cluster ofApples, Intels, software houses and the like.andP;  He'd like to get it started,and then let the market do its work.andM;Technopolis: Free in the ways that matterandM;The idea is to replace the state's cumbersome bureaucracy with a kinder,gentler, better-informed approval process run by Doka.andP;  Once Doka supports aventure, it would become part of the Doka family and benefits from theresources Doka can arrange in Technopolis without having to hunt for them orget approvals itself.andP;  Of course, it all hangs on the ability of Technopolisand Doka to get government clearance themselves.andP;  The answer should beforthcoming within a couple of months -- but since no one has ever done thisbefore, it's hard to say precisely what approvals are needed or precisely howfree to act Doka/Technopolis will be once it gets them.andM;Technopolis would provide the following benefits: quicker registration ofjoint ventures; lower tariffs, taxes and other fees, although those arehardly the problem; hard-currency salaries (at least in part); easy access topersonnel from elsewhere in the Soviet Union without cumbersome registrationprocedures and housing for them; special, beneficial terms for foreigninvestors such as insurance of investments (from government appropriation,not from poor business conditions).andP;  So far, Doka has received 10 proposalson which it can't yet take action...andM;Although only a few of Zelenograd's 170,000 citizens would actually work forTechnopolis, they would benefit from its presence.andP;  Technopolis, Doka hopes,would include a freeish market for apartments, support for privateenterprises selling food and services, educational facilities, and the like.andO;In essence, the goal is to create a free-enterprise zone not just forinternational organizations, but more importantly -- especially in its impacton Soviet thinking -- a free-enterprise zone for internal trade andenterprises.andP;  If it works, it could start a trend......andM;Barriers to success: Technopolis in contextandM;All this sounds eminently sensible.andP;  Yet its future is questionable.andP;  Themajor stumbling blocks are the existing power structures.andP;  The MosSoviet(Moscow City Committee) doesn't like the idea because Zelenograd belongs toMoscow, and it doesn't welcome a free zone within its territory.andO;MinElektronProm, the Electronics Ministry which controls the electronicproduction facilities of Zelenograd, is cold to the idea for much the samereasons.andP;  Moreover, until recently it hasn't welcomed foreigners snoopingnear such a high-level military center.andM;From the foreign point of view, Zelenograd is uncomfortably closely tied tothe country's defense establishment.andP;  Will our side allow people to sharetechnology in such a place?andP;  You could conjecture, as Soviet-computer expertSeymour Goodman of the University of Arizona points out, &quot;that the bottomline could be to have us transfer the technology.andP;  That's certainly the firstthing that would occur to our national security people.andP;  Militarymodernization remains a goal of perestroika; it keeps the military happy.&quot;andM;It is alluring to see Soviet government entities as the equivalent ofcompanies (down to their habit of diversifying into new areas).andP;  Yet it ismisleading, because their motives are different: power but not profit.andP;  Forthat reason, now that both idealism and terror are mostly gone, governmententities are by and large ineffective as productive enterprises.andP;  The oldorder is crumbling and the new order hasn't yet had the space or resources togrow to replace it.andP;  Soviets find it harder and harder to work at jobs theyincreasingly consider meaningless.andP;  This attitude may be contributing to thecurrent rapid decline: If you don't believe in what you're doing, why do itwell?andP;  Why fix decrepit buildings if they're coming down anyway?andM;Most of the people we encountered were scared but resigned: We're going tohave a couple of extremely tough years, was the general attitude.andP;  But as oftwo weeks ago, we didn't see much evidence of things getting better.andP;  Popularfeeling against the cooperatives (small private enterprises) is increasing;joint ventures are seen as a source of goods and hard currency -- not of newmanagement ideas and market practices.andP;  (Part of Technopolis's appeal is thatit involves joint ventures, not just indigenous free enterprise.)andM;Can new growth find its way into the sunlight?andM;On the other hand, companies (unlike agencies and ministries) have to startsmall.andP;  The country needs hundreds of little companies, most of them toosmall to notice and too small to seem to matter -- not one big program runwith full government support and absolutely no internal impetus for success.andO;Little companies with profit-minded owners do have such an impetus forsuccess.andP;  So the question is: Will they be strangled by the deadinfrastructure, or will they be able to feed off it and grow up through it?andO;And will they do so fast enough?andM;In principle, the new growth will be definition grow faster than the aging,crumbling state infrastructure, but can it grow fast enough to make adifference?andP;  Some 280 million people must be fed, housed and warmed in themeantime.andP;  In principle, if state bread becomes too scarce, people who canafford to will buy other foodstuffs from the private markets.andP;  Among thepeople we know best, rubles are plentiful and spent carelessly, but even theyblanch at paying 12 to 15 rubles for a kilo of second-rate meat in a countrywhere typical state salaries are 150 to 300 rubles a month ($240 to $480 atthe official rate, $15 to $30 at actual rates).andP;  On the other hand, aprogrammer we know recently paid five or six thousand rubles to get anapartment 4 square meters larger than the one he had.andP;  He also has a cordlessphone, a camcorder, VCR and other gadgets.andP;  Another friend has a VCR and amicrowave, to say nothing of parquet floors and a stereo system.andP;  As thesaying puts it, rubles are going out of style; people who have them try tospend them before they become worthless.andM;If the government does not allow natural forces to operate, there can be onlystagnation when the government itself fails to operate.andM;(3) Our trip was organized by 25-year-old Doug Mellinger, a US entrepreneurin software re-engineering and bakeries, who had met Doka leader AlexandrChuenko at an international &quot;young leaders&quot; meeting.andP;  Like Chuenko, he hassome powerful connections.andP;  The rest of the mini-delegation consisted of FranSmyth, who leads a high-tech research effort at Met Life; and a last-minuteaddition, Bob Clough, a friend of ours (through his wife, who works for JVDialog in Moscow; see Release 1.0, 89-11) who is doing his thesis on thepolitical and personal factors influencing the computerization of the SovietUnion.andP;  A high-powered bunch, for sure, but hardly the troop ofmulti-millionaires needed to launch a new national industry.andP;  The whole tour,with side visits to Doka's friends and sponsors, took four days.andP;  As usual inthe Soviet Union, it was a half-frustrating, half-exciting experience.andP;  TheSoviets still talk in speeches, and adding a translator means that everyexchange takes twice as long and is twice as formal.andM;(4) As people are also discovering in East Germany and Rumania, almost theonly place to go for business managers is Party ranks.andP;  With few exceptions,no one else has experience running anything, nor visibility in the community.andM;A number of Doka managers and scientists (specialists in software andsemiconductor technology) will be visiting the US in March.andP;
