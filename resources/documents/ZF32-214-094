NetWare and Microsoft Corp. LAN network operatingsystems.andP;  Altair consists of control modules and user modules.andP;  There is onecontrol module (CM) per microcell, controlling 32 devices and a user module(UM) attaching up to six devices.andP;  One cell covers an average area of 5,000square feet at a 3.3M-bit-per-second (bpm) throughput.andP;  Altair modules areconnected to the LAN via standard Ethernet &quot;T&quot; connectors with terminators.andM;Module installation is checked by a steady green indicator light on the frontof each user module.andP;  If the light is blinking it indicates impropercommunications with the control module.andP;  A basic feature of the Altairtechnology is the reuse of frequencies, which is possible due to thepropagation characteristics of 18-GHz signals.andP;  A solid support wall in abuilding is sufficient to allow the reuse of the same frequency by nearbymicrocells.andP;  The CM has a suggested retail of $3,995 and the UM costs $3,495.andM;BICC, Westborough, MA, uses the infrared frequency spectrum for its wirelesstoken ring LAN version called InfraLAN.andP;  BICC, not a household name in theUnited States is a $7 billion London-based company who makes cables.andM;BICC's InfraLAN boasts the first cableless LAN capable of transmitting dataat 4M or 16M bps and is based on IEEE 802.5 standards.andP;  The product comprisesa base unit attaching six terminals and two optical nodes--one for transmitand one for receive.andP;  Transmission bit error rates are given as [10.sup.-10andrsqb;and [10.sup.-11andrsqb;.andM;Because of the line-of-sight characteristics of infrared transmission,InfraLAN works in offices with less than ceiling-height partitions.andP;  It usesprimary and backup signals so that if a data path is accidentally blocked,the signal automatically reverses direction for uninterrupted data flow.andP;  Thecost is $500 per user.andM;Other products based on spread-spectrum techniques include: WaveLAN from NCRCorp. (Dayton), LAWN from O'Neill Communications Inc. (Princeton, NJ) andARLAN from Telesystems SLW Inc. (Toronto).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
