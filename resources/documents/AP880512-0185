Additionalmitigation was not found to be justified.''   The report, which runs several hundred pages, was condemnedquickly by the environmental group that forced its preparation as``shoddy and incomplete.''   ``They have not complied with the spirit or the letter of thecourt order against them,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, the president ofthe Foundation on Economic Trends.   ``We are putting the Defense Department on notice that unlessthey completely revise the method and content of the environmentalimpact study, we will file suit again,'' Rifkin said.   The environmental study was prompted by a lawsuit Rifkin's groupfiled in September 1986. The foundation is a Washington-basedenvironmental activist group that has long focused its attention onthe dangers of biological research and genetic engineering.   Within the biological field, the United States has committeditself by international treaty not to develop offensive biologicalweapons. However, the Army maintains a large defensive programaimed at developing vaccines and antidotes, detection systems andbattlefield gear that could be used to protect American soldiers ifattacked with natural or man-made poisons.   In order to develop such defenses, laboratories must work with avariety of deadly toxins.   According to the Pentagon, roughly $60 million is now beingspent yearly on such research at more than 100 military, universityand private laboratories in 27 states and eight foreign countries.   The foundation's suit sought to stop the research on grounds theprogram had grown so large that an impact study had become a legalnecessity. The Pentagon agreed to submit the environmental study aslong as it could continue the work in the interim.   In essence, the Army concluded Thursday its operating proceduresand lab safety features had evolved to the point ``that even severeaccidents would not create significant risk or impact upon thequality of the human environment.''   ``It is recognized that controversy exists concerning the needand appropriateness of the Biological Defense Research Program,''the study continued. ``But defense against biological weapons isconsidered a vital component of the overall defense posture of theUnited States and its allies.   ``And ... certain aspects of the program should be recognized asbeneficial. A large portion of the BDRP effort ... is for basicresearch and development.''   ``Offering us conclusory statements that everything is OK issimply immaterial,'' Andy Kimbrell, a foundation attorney, said.   ``The legal standard here is a `hard look' analysis of possiblehazards, and this isn't a `hard look.' For example, they list 129laboratories across the country and don't tell us exactly what'sgoing on at those labs, what organisms are being researched andwhat security and precautions have been taken. That'sunacceptable.''   Ironically, the Army released its impact study just one dayafter a Senate subcommittee blasted the Pentagon for ``seriousdeficiencies'' in the safety management of both the biological andchemical warfare research programs.   The majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs oversightsubcommittee reported it had found ``inadequate regulations, laxsafety enforcement and documented safety lapses.''   In the biological weapons area, the review found that ``there isno comprehensive set of safety regulations for research'' withbiological warfare agents and toxins, ``no emphasis on safety inthe contractor program and no office that monitors contractorsafety.''</TEXT></DOC>
