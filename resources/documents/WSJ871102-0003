SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SCHSECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   Last week, Charles Schwab Corp. went to great lengths to shield the identity of the mystery man who contributed to a $22 million trading loss, even identifying itself in federal court records in New York as &quot;John Doe andamp; Co.&quot;    But an unsealed order in a Chicago state court foiled the firm and unmasked the man -- Hong Kong investor Teh Huei &quot;Ted&quot; Wang. Mr. Wang, 52 years old, and his wife, Nina, are co-directors of the Chinachem Group, a closely held property and construction concern in Hong Kong.    Both for the Wangs and Schwab, the stock market's collapse has proven costly. The Wangs failed to meet margin calls on Oct. 19, leading to a court settlement in which Schwab settled $84 million in obligations for $67 million. A Schwab official said last week that the customer had gone through $40 million of his own money by midday Oct. 19 to meet the margin calls. The settlement contributed about $15 million to the $22 million after-tax charge, equal to 13% of Schwab's equity or a half year's earnings.    &quot;It's too dangerous to talk to the press,&quot; Mrs. Wang in Hong Kong said. &quot;Talk to my lawyer.&quot; She declined to confirm any dealings with Schwab. The Wang's lawyer couldn't be reached.    Schwab officials, meanwhile, say the damage to the company is limited. But some industry officials wonder whether the charge and the recent market turmoil will give the firm pause about some bold expansion plans. Some analysts are concerned that huge recent volumes and losses for individual investors, the backbone for Schwab and other retail brokerages, portend slower growth.    The latest incident also raises questions about the adequacy of Schwab's internal controls. Schwab said the client had been a customer without incident for three years, and began investing on margin only days before the 508.00-point collapse Oct. 19. The transactions are understood to have been handled in Schwab's Hong Kong office.    Some industry officials were surprised that Schwab entertained such a startlingly huge risk. &quot;That somebody was not aware of the potential for that kind of swing was just unforgivable,&quot; said a brokerage official close to the firm. Mr. Schwab is &quot;just mortified,&quot; a Schwab official said.    Both the Wangs and Mr. Schwab are no strangers to crisis over the last two decades. The Wangs have kept a low profile but were unwillingly thrust into the spotlight in 1983, when Mr. Wang was kidnapped at gunpoint by four men while driving to work. He was released eight days later when his wife agreed to ransom demands and paid $11 million into a bank account in Taipei, Taiwan. The alleged mastermind of the kidnapping, Jennie Pau Cheng Na-yuet, was arrested in Miami two weeks ago.    In 1972, long before his face and name became synonymous with discount brokerage, Mr. Schwab operated a no-load mutual fund that got into big trouble with state and federal securities regulators. The state of Texas took him to task for allegedly violating securities registration rules, while the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged related disclosure problems.    The $20 million fund shut down. It left him financially insolvent and contributed to a divorce. &quot;I emerged from the battle thoroughly bloodied,&quot; he later wrote. The episode was &quot;worse than anything I had ever imagined.&quot;    Mr. Schwab, 50, was born a lawyer's son in Sacramento. He was an entrepreneur from the start. As a child, he sold English walnuts that he had collected himself; he raised chickens and sold eggs door-to-door. He caddied at golf, and now has a nine handicap. He is a Stanford graduate and currently is married to the daughter of a wealthy Midland, Texas, oilman, who has a substantial interest in the firm.    It was Hugo Quackenbush, a high school friend from Santa Barbara, Calif., who first urged Mr. Schwab to try discount brokerage, which became possible when the federal government deregulated brokerage commissions in 1975. It was a rocky beginning. Full-service firms tried to pressure landlords to keep Schwab branches out of prime locations or deny Schwab seats on major exchanges, Mr. Schwab has charged. Several banks refused to loan the firm money, including BankAmerica Corp., he said.    Just a month ago, the firm, which Mr. Schwab built into the nation's largest discount brokerage with a loan from an uncle, was riding the crest of a bull market and other successes.    Revenue of $308 million last year was nearly five times the 1982 level, while profit grew sixfold. Net income for the third quarter rose 19% and revenue jumped 51%. After a contentious four-year union with BankAmerica, he and his managers bought back the firm, many say for a song, in March. BankAmerica purchased the firm for $53 million in 1983.    An initial public offering was completed in September, which valued the firm at roughly 50% more than the price paid BankAmerica. Even though Schwab's stock has fallen 50% since the offering, Mr. Schwab still has a roughly $50 million pretax profit from the sale, based upon the offering's terms.    Mr. Schwab, whose usually smiling face is the center of Schwab's advertising, is the spiritual leader, but the firm is no one-man show. Some employees consider him isolated, but others say it just shows he is an effective recruiter and delegator. &quot;He isn't comfortable in front of the lights,&quot; said Mr. Quackenbush, now communications director.    Mr. Schwab denied that the big charge reflected major control problems, but he conceded there was a breakdown. &quot;Based on all I know, with one exception, the controls were well in place,&quot; he said in an interview Friday. He declined to discuss what went wrong but vowed to retain an outside auditor to investigate. He said, &quot;We will never have an account of this size again.&quot;    Daily operating duties fall to the firm's president, Lawrence Stupski, a cigar-smoking Yale Law School graduate and former Navy officer. It was Mr. Stupski, for instance, who told Schwab employees about the charge Thursday morning.    Mr. Stupski said the firm needs to develop computer models to more quickly monitor changes in the value of customer accounts. Another brokerage official close to Schwab said, &quot;It wasn't any one person's fault. But with that kind of exposure, it should have been red-lined or second-guessed a lot more.&quot; The source said the problem may be partly a byproduct of the firm's explosive growth. &quot;Chuck has focused on creating a growth mentality. His mind-set isn't on little details.&quot;    Mr. Schwab also said the firm plans to proceed with opening 30 more offices over the next two years; it currently has 105. In the past, the firm has said it wants to start offering term-life insurance, mutual funds and other new services. Mr. Schwab said the expansion will proceed but indicated it would be tempered if the market sags much.    Lately, Schwab officials have been consumed with containing the big loss and correcting computer snafus that arose from swelling orders.    By Friday, however, some Schwab officials were headed home for dinner for the first time in two weeks, although a working weekend was ahead. Mr. Schwab said, aside from the charge, October was a &quot;wonderful&quot; month operationally. One Schwab official claimed to be &quot;sleeping like a baby. I wake up every hour and cry.&quot;    ---   Adi Ignatius in Hong Kong and William Power in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
