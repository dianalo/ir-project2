(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Efforts to fix problems that stoppedproduction at the only U.S. facility able to produce nuclear weaponsmaterial intensified today with the addition of extra control roomshifts at the Savannah River plant.   Federal officials also are expanding their on-site control aspart of a sweeping safety drive that makes it unlikely the plantwill meet a Dec. 31 goal for resuming production.   Creating an extra, fifth shift for each of the plant's threereactors means that one of the 14-member control-room teams will beundergoing training at any given time.   The crews will double the time they spend each year on a computersimulator, up to 150 hours, and classroom work will be expanded aswell, said Charlie Ahfield, a Du Pont reactor program manager.   Putting federal officials permanently inside each reactorfacility, for the first time, will allow the government to keep acloser eye on their operation, which has been run since 1950 undercontract by the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co.   The changes are designed to improve safety at the sprawling300-square mile site in a pine forest along the Savannah River,where more than 16,000 employees work under tight security.   The scene is surprisingly tranquil outside K reactor, the firstof the three scheduled to return to operation. Inside the massiveconcrete and reinforced steel structure, workers use remote-controlcranes and arms to prepare the reactor for restart.   ``They had set a target date of Dec. 31, but I would think itwould be after the 31st,'' said Andy Cwalina, a Du Pont reactorsupervisor. No new date has been announced.   Changes also are taking place in the administration complex, ``abeehive of activity,'' said Stephen R. Wright, a 14-year veteran ofthe plant and deputy manager of the Energy Department team preparingto restart K reactor.   The reorganization, which began several years ago, widened thisfall.   The top Energy Department safety official, Richard W.Starostecki, warned in September that some senior federal officialsat the plant had ``an attitude toward production reactor safety,which on the face seems to be similar to that which existed in thespace program prior to the Challenger accident.''   Such criticism raises hackles at Savannah River.   ``NASA killed 10 people. We never injured anybody with a nuclearaccident,'' said Andy Cwalina, a reactor supervisor, referring tothe seven people killed in the Challenger shuttle disaster and threekilled in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration'searlier Apollo program.   ``Our people have never hesitated, if they were concerned aboutsafety, to order a reactor shut down,'' said Cwalina. ``One thingthat we are learning is that you have to instill confidence amongyour overseers that you are operating a reactor safely.''   That means convincing Washington the aging reactors can runsafely at 100 percent power, rather than the 50 percent ceiling theyhave been under since a critical report last year by the NationalAcademy of Sciences.   Safety measures being instituted at Savannah River include:   _Raising operating standards to the same level as those attainedby commercial nuclear utility plants in the wake of the accident atThree Mile Island in March 1979. That ``will take years,'' accordingto Wright. A key to this is developing detailed mathematical modelsof how the reactor core behaves, especially during problems.   _Establishing ``a paper trail, from the cradle to the grave,''for important steps, said Wright. ``Before, I used an informal note.Now I use a quality control form. And more people receive copies.''   _Assuring that each shift is supervised by an operator who holdsa bachelor's degree in science or engineering. Nine of the 12 shiftteams meet that standard now.   _``An increase in oversight from Washington, an increase in linecontrol, an increase in overview and management. And Du Pont isincreasing its overview,'' said Wright.   In one key change, engineers from the Energy Department regionaloffice at the plant will be stationed permanently at each reactorand managers and inspectors who previously visited the reactors onlyon a spot basis ``will be going out considerably more'' said Wright.   ``The biggest increase will be technical review engineers. Theseare the guys that will be living out there. Plus there will betechnical inspections,'' said Wright.   U.S. officials say the nation still has enough nuclear materialsfor weapons, for the time being.   Plutonium supplies are adequate, according to Energy SecretaryJohn S. Herrington, but tritium, which decays at the rate of 5.5percent per year, could be running short by next summer, sayadministration and Capitol Hill sources who spoke on condition ofanonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
