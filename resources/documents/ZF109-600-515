 Digital's engineering ofthe new products to fit into its larger strategy was elegant and aimed at abroad base of applications.andM;To Digital, FDDI is first an internetworking technology, and second, thebasis for LANs.andP;  Unlike Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer, whosescientific and engineering markets need high-speed fiber LANs, Digital istargeting commercial customers who typically don't generate enough traffic tojustify fiber LANs.andP;  Rather, these customers need backbone technologies tosupport communications between their LANs.andM;Digital's FDDI products offer DECnet users sophisticated internetworkingtoday, and a path to high-speed LANs in the future.andM;DIGITAL'S FDDI STRATEGY.andP;  Digital's FDDI strategy is rooted in the simpleeconomics of the technology.andP;  Two factors will drive the acceptance of FDDI.andO;Price is the first.andP;  Per-connection prices are high.andP;  Digital'sFDDIcontroller 700 costs $6,000.andP;  For this reason, FDDI-to-Ethernet bridgesthat provide FDDI access to lots of workstations are more attractive to mostusers than are direct connections to FDDI for workstations.andP;  FDDI is alsoattractive as a LAN between hosts supporting lots of users--replacing today's&quot;channel connect&quot; solutions between hosts.andP;  As component costs come down,directly connecting workstations to FDDI LANs will become more practical fora wider variety of applications than they are today.andP;  Many in the industryexpect individual FDDI connections to cost $2,000 to $3,000 by 1993.andM;The second factor is the implementation of more distributed networkapplications.andP;  Users are just beginning to implement network applications ona wide scale.andP;  Most networks today are used for low-capacity chores like fileretrieval.andP;  Digital and other vendors expect this to change fast during thenext two years, as users implement more network-intensive applications.andM;Digital's whole corporate strategy is aimed at encouraging development ofdistributed network applications.andP;  Its Network Application Support (NAS)software strategy provides common network services, such as file, databaseaccess, print, and electronic mail, to applications across a network.andP;  Andits Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA) provides users with a systemsand network management/administration platform for distributed networks.andM;The company's strategy also indirectly addresses the FDDI cost issue facingthe industry.andP;  Digital designed its own chips to perform two of the threeessential functions of an FDDI controller: the Media and Access Control (MAC)and Elasticity Buffer/Link Monitor (ELM) chips.andP;  The company will buy fiberoptic transceiver (FOX) chips on the open market.andP;  Digital has licensed thesedesigns for production to Motorola and Advanced Micro Devices.andP;  Digital hopesto help stimulate a market for commodity FDDI chips through its licensingagreements.andM;THE WHY AND HOW OF DEC FDDI.andP;  Digital's choice of FDDI as a backbone protocolwas obvious, given its commitment to standards.andP;  FDDI gives users a lot:andM;* A technology based on a stable American National Standards Institute (ANSI)standardandM;* Transmission rates of 100 MbpsandM;* Up to 500 stations per ringandM;* Distances between stations of up to 2 kilometersandM;* Overall circumference of the ring of up to 100 kilometersandM;Single vs.andP;  Dual Connect.andP;  The performance characteristics of FDDI make clearwhy Digital and every other major vendor have chosen to use it.andP;  ButDigital's use of FDDI at this point in time is more controversial.andP;  At leastthat's what marketers for Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard/Apollo will betelling customers.andM;FDDI describes a protocol for using parallel rings of fiber optic cabling.andO;One of the rings is designated to be the primary ring, while the other is thebackup, or secondary, ring.andP;  The standard specifies three ways to use thefiber optic cable: single-attach stations (SAS), concentrators, anddual-attach stations (DAS).andP;  Digital has chosen to implement SAS andconcentrators, but, at this time, not DAS.andM;Single-attach stations connect only to the primary FDDI ring via aconcentrator, which is directly attached to the FDDI ring.andP;  The advantage ofthis design is reliability and manageability.andP;  SAS interfaces are simpler indesign than DAS, which reduces their overall cost and manufacturingcomplexity.andP;  Concentrators allow users to segment networks into hierarchiesof subnetworks and backbones, reducing the impact of a single failure to thelocal part of the network and shielding the backbone from the effects ofchanges and moves on subnetworks.andM;Dual-attach stations are directly attached to both rings of the FDDIbackbone.andP;  The advantage of this approach is, primarily, cost; DAS adapterscost less than the combined costs of SAS and concentrators.andP;  The disadvantageis increased complexity of design and manufacture.andP;  Also, hierarchicalnetwork configurations are more difficult to implement without concentrators.andM;Digital's choice of SAS adapters and concentrators as its first FDDI productsisn't surprising, since its architecture is built on the notion thatsegmenting larger networks into subnetworks raises reliability and makes bignetworks easier to m manage.andM;Sun and HP/Apollo are big DAS proponents, and they bash Digital's SASapproach.andP;  However, this is no religious war.andP;  Engineering users generallyare the biggest users of the DAS approach--and FDDI LANs.andP;  It's just a matterof time before Digital comes up with a DAS adapter for its engineeringworkstation products.andP;  In the meantime, it will be at a competitivedisadvantage to Sun and HP/Apollo in accounts that favor the DAS approach.andM;DEC's FDDI PRODUCTS.andP;  Digital's initial FDDI products serve its strategy ofpromoting FDDI as a LAN interconnect technology.andM;DECconcentrator 500.andP;  DECconcentrator 500 is Digital's FDDI concentrator,which provides attachment to an FDDI backbone for single-attach stations andbridges.andP;  DECconcentrator manages connections to the FDDI ring on power-up,and dynamically handles addition and removal of stations, and cable faults.andO;The concentrator ranges in capacity from 4 to 12 SAS attachments.andM;Pricing varies depending on configuration, but a fully configuredDECconcentrator costs $15,000.andM;DECbridge 500.andP;  DECbridge 500 is Digital's FDDI-Ethernet (802.3) bridge.andP;  Itattaches as an SAS to a DECconcentrator 500, bridging 10 Mbit Ethernet andFDDI traffic.andP;  DECbridge 500 not only filters and forwards packets, but alsotranslates between Ethernet and FDDI packet formats.andP;  This translationfunction is essential to network management.andP;  DECbridge 500's software canalso be loaded from the network.andP;  When Digital's current bridge networkmanagement software is replaced by a standards-compliant module, the newsoftware will be downline loaded.andM;DECbridge 500 costs $25,000 in the United States.andP;  Pricing outside the UnitedStates varies.andM;FDDIcontroller 700.andP;  FDDIcontroller 700 is Digital's first FDDI SAS adapter.andO;Digital chose for its first SAS implementation the DECstation 5000 Model 200,an Ultrix/RISC workstation aimed at scientific/engineering applications.andO;Other implementations will follow.andP;  Price is $6,000.andM;Extended LAN Management Software.andP;  ELMS is an extension of Digital's existingRemote Bridge Management Software (Version 2).andP;  It controls ports onconcentrators, checks the status of each port, and does protocol-andaddress-filtering.andM;ELMS is an interim product.andP;  A DECmcc Access Module that incorporates atopology map of the network, support for multiport management repeaters, andother new functions is in the future plan.andP;  The additional functions may ormay not be included in an upgrade of ELMS.andM;CONCLUSIONS.andP;  Digital has given its customers enough to get started with FDDIbackbones.andP;  The FDDI products are well-matched to Digital's overall strategyof supporting distributed networks covering entire enterprises.andM;The main issue for Digital is, When will it deliver more FDDI options?andP;  OneSAS adapter for a single engineering workstation model won't cut it for long.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
