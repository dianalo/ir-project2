BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP LABORTRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA)UTILITIES (UTI) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The wave of strikes in France has begun to recede, leaving Prime Minister Jacques Chirac with the job of repairing the damage to his popularity with the French electorate.    Mr. Chirac's difficulties with the labor unions, and before that with university students, have benefited his two main political adversaries -- Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, with whom he currently shares power in an increasingly stressful relationship, and Raymond Barre, a former prime minister who is expected to challenge Mr. Chirac for the center-right candidacy in next year's presidential elections.    The two major national strikes, involving train engineers and electric workers, began to unwind over the weekend. Union officials said striking rail workers, feeling a financial pinch after 3 1/2 weeks of work stoppage, have begun drifting back to work in large numbers. And the shorter but more devastating electric-power strike was virtually over by Saturday, when all unions but the Communist-dominated General Labor Confederation accepted the government's wage offer.    Some public-sector strikes threatened to continue, however. Paris public-transport officials warned, for example, of continuing bus and subway disruptions today, and Henri Krasucki, who heads the powerful communist union confederation, called on all workers to continue their strikes. Government office employees, meanwhile, demanded immediate negotiations over government wage offers that they called inadequate. Even performances at the Comedie Francaise have been delayed for half an hour starting today, after a strike of mechanical workers there.    A public-opinion poll conducted shortly before the strikes showed that the percentage of respondents expressing confidence in Mr. Chirac already had fallen seven percentage points, to 46%, after the recent student protests, with 49% of citizens saying they didn't have confidence in him. President Mitterrand's confidence rating, meanwhile, rose two points, to 58%. Business and political leaders say they think Mr. Chirac's popularity probably has fallen further since then.    &quot;Chirac is the big loser,&quot; says one senior French businessman privately. &quot;He seemed to lose control, and then had to compromise.&quot; Mr. Chirac withdrew proposals for a new railway workers' promotion system that would have put emphasis more on merit than on seniority. Similarly, the earlier student protests forced the government to withdraw planned reforms of the university system.    Added a businessman from a small company, &quot;The government is supposed to keep the trains and the electricity running. Who else are we supposed to blame?&quot;    The biggest winner in all of this probably is Mr. Barre, a rival of Mr. Chirac to be the center-right candidate in the presidential election scheduled for next year. Mr. Barre has been the harshest critic of the prime minister's effort to rule France in &quot;cohabitation&quot; with a Socialist president.    In a television interview late last week, widely viewed as the unofficial kickoff of his presidential campaign, Mr. Barre said he thought the French people were suffering from &quot;a feeling of overdose&quot; in the face of Mr. Chirac's effort to change France's economic rules. Many now consider Mr. Barre the front-runner to be the center-right presidential candidate.    But while Mr. Chirac is suffering, he still has a chance to bounce back. Another poll taken last week showed that 49% of those canvassed support the government argument that strong wage increases for public employees would upset the nation's economic balance. Only 42% opposed the government stand. Although the train and electric strikes have inconvenienced many citizens, Mr. Chirac has stuck to his insistence that, to battle inflation, wages mustn't rise more than 3%.    The French people often turn to the right at times of uncertainty, and it is that kind of bedrock conservatism that Mr. Chirac will be trying to mine in a series of one-day trips to the provinces this winter. He scheduled the trips after the student demonstrations, when he decided to cancel his plans for a special parliamentary session that would have considered fresh economic and social legislation. Now he will try to gather support not only for his stand on the students but also for his tough line on workers, before the regular parliamentary session in April. </TEXT></DOC>
