symposium, Intel presented papers on a wide rangeof far-flung technologies: an unannounced ultra-high-end embedded controllerfrom Hillsboro (see [mu]PR 6/20/90 p. 4), the &quot;DVI&quot; multi-media chip-setdeveloped in Princeton, the massively-parallel &quot;Touchstone&quot; computer arraydesigned in Aloha, OR, and the VLIW &quot;iWarp&quot; machine developed in conjunctionwith Carnegie-Mellon University.andM;What struck me most about these talks was that each described a blue-sky Randamp;Dproject well outside the microcomputer mainstream.andP;  If these technologiestake off, Intel may start to dominate the whole computer industry.andP;  Not allthese Randamp;D efforts mus succeed for the company to benefit, but what are theodds that any of these projects will realy win big?andM;The market for each is, at best, unproven, and Intel's track record for pastventures is not encouraging.andP;  For every runaway success there have beenseveral spectacular failures.andP;  A past column discussed the sad fate of the432 &quot;micromainframe&quot; and BiiN ([mu]PR 10/89 p. 22); here's a quick rundown ofsome of Intel's other amusing detours and missed opportunities.andM;Dead-End DRAMsandM;Intel invented the 1K DRAM.andP;  While the rest of the industry quickly adoptedstandardized functions and pin-outs, however, Intel continued to innovate,introducing new designs with dedicated as well as multiplexed address pins,both latched and unlatched output drivers, non-standard refresh schemes, andbuilt-in refresh logic.andP;  Intel even promoted a family of charge-coupleddevices (remember CCDs?) as a cheaper alternative to conventional DRAMs.andO;Alas, none of the new parts caught on.andP;  The applications enigneer who'dpromoted the parts went on to become senior vice-president of Intel'sMicrocomputer Group.andM;Fearing the prospect of low die yields at the 64K DRAM level, Intel developeda clever new scheme of redundant data rows and columns that could replacefaulty portions of the primary memory array.andP;  Configuration links could beprogrammed during production test, initially using laser zappers, later withsilicon fuses, to fix faulty devices.andP;  Unfortunately, even fully functionalparts incurred the cost and overhead of reconfiguration, and by the time thetechnology was perfected, die yields were good, and vendors without redundantbits had taken over the market.andP;  The DRAM operation shut down entirely at the256K level, and its last general manager was promoted to vice-president ofcorporate marketing.andM;Odysseys in Consumer ElectronicsandM;Q: Who invented the LCD digital watch?andP;  A: Microma, an Intel subsidiary.andO;Since LED watches needed both hands to operate, LCD watches were initially aprestigious and highly profitable item.andP;  When Texas Instruments and Nationalbegan undercutting the market, however, Intel decided to get out of thejewelry business.andP;  LCD watches now blanket every corner of the globe--evencentral Fiji.andP;  Microma's founder became Intel's VP of corporate programs.andM;Intel's Ted Hoff built a prototype of the world's first microcomputer-basedvideo game in 1970 to demonstrate one potential application of the 4004, butmanagement was not amused.andP;  Intel did join the video-game craze in the late70s, when it developed a custom controller for the Magnavox &quot;Odyssey II&quot;television line.andP;  The 8248 had built-in logic for icon positioning, collisiondetection, font tables, and color palettes, which effectively made the partthe world's first graphics chip, and gave video games a new level ofsophistication, but the demand for TV consoles with built-in &quot;Pong&quot; provedfleeting.andP;  Gordon Moore later told a shareholders meeting, &quot;Intel does acustom design project like this every few years, just to remind ourselves howmuch we hate doing custom design projects.&quot;andM;Lost Opportunities in Personal ComputingandM;Long before the IBM PC, long before Apple, even before Altair, there was apersonal computer systems business, and Intel owned it.andP;  Intel PCs werecalled &quot;development systems&quot;, though, and were targeted solely at embeddedmicroprocessor software designers.andP;  In 1974, a consultant named Gary Kildalladvised Intel that the right core software could transform developmentsystems into general-purpose computers and open up a much broader market.andO;Intel passed.andP;  Kildall then founded Digital Research, Inc., introduced CP/M,and opened up the PC software industry.andM;Perhaps Intel chose not to cultivate this business because at the time theonly significant microprocessor sales volume seemed to be in embeddedapplications.andP;  &quot;If every minicomputer ever built was replaced with amicroprocessor,&quot; the top brass was fond of saying, &quot;our production lineswould only stay busy for a week.&quot;andP;  The 1981 announcement of the IBM PCchanged Intel's perspective, but by then the development systems business wasdoomed.andP;  Its director was already a VP.andM;The &quot;Analog Microprocessor&quot;andM;Ted Hoff also invented the world's first single chip digital signalprocessor.andP;  The 2920 could filter, convolve, and analyze audio waveforms inreal time.andP;  As with any first-generation high-tech device, of course, the2920 had limitations, and sales fell short of expectations.andP;  But instead ofrefining the concept with a second-generation design, Intel abandoned the DSPbusiness.andP;  Hoff is now an independent consultant.andM;Magnetic Bubble MemoriesandM;In 1979 Intel introduced the world's first 1-megabit magnetic-bubble memory.andO;Aside from its then-astounding data capacity and then-unique non-volatility,the device offered a simple and cheap manufacturing process and high dieyields.andM;Alas, the simplicity of die fabrication could not make up for the complexityof its package, in which the die was enmeshed in interwoven magnetic coils,sandwhiched between permanent magnets, and encased in an iron shield.andP;  Bubblememories needed two power supplies and six custom support chips to work,which themselves combined NMOS, CMOS, HMOS, VMOS (remember VMOS?), andbipolar process technologies.andP;  The business was eventually sold off.andM;The &quot;Operating System Coprocessor&quot;andM;In 1981 Intel device engineers found a clever way to pack two bits ofinformation into a single-transistor ROM cell.andP;  Never mind that the cell wastwice as big as single-hit cells: capability is the mother of invention, somarketeers began searching for software to sell in ROM form.andP;  What theysettled on was a 16-Kilobyte subset of the iRMX-86 operating system kernel(remember iRMX 86?), with an interrupt controller and timer thrown in forgood measure.andM;The contraption was unleashed on the world as the 80130 &quot;Operating SystemFirmware&quot; component.andP;  Early plans were to call it an &quot;OS Coprocessor&quot; tobuild on the overwhelming success of the 8087 math coprocessor, but thisfailed when even management conceded the part performed no active processing.andO;The second choice, &quot;Operating System Foundation&quot;, was suggestive of women'sundergarments, and &quot;Software On Silicon&quot; had an unfortunate--thoughprophetic--acronym.andM;The 80130 was a case study in misguided product development.andP;  Systems builtwith the part still needed external EPROMs for system-specific initializationand applications code, so its net hardware impact was to replace two 28-pincommodity peripherals with one proprietary 40-pin component, hardly a benefitin systems that already needed at least two dozen other ICs.andP;  It did keepcustomers from ripping off iRMX software without paying license fees, butthis made on awkward selling point at best.andM;Product documentation tried valiantly to justify the 80130 in terms of itsabstract, intangible aesthetic benefits, while downplaying the part'sROM/interrupt controller/timer construction; nevertheless, customers justnever did flock to the 80130, nor to its CP/M-86 companion, the 80150.andP;  Themarketing manager responsible for the family quit in frustration beforeformal introduction, as did its chief applications engineer, who now writescolumns for a microprocessor newsletter.andM;The Value of InnovationandM;In principle, I applaud Intel's willingness to confront new marketopportunities, even the insurmountable ones.andP;  A company that doesn't takechances can't advance, and entrepreneurial risk-takers really should becommended, whether or not they succeed.andP;  In the words of Kenny Rogers,&quot;You've got to know when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em.&quot;andP;  A projectthat misses its window of opportunity should be shut down early, before toomuch time and effort is lost.andP;  Ditto for projects that are years ahead oftheir time, if that puts them years ahead of the market.andM;But with all of the raw creativity and vision that go into Intel's variousRandamp;D projects, it's disturbing to see how few succeed, and the unaggressivenature of the ones that do.andP;  By for the company's most visible and the mostluerative success -- the product line whose profits feed the coffers thatkeep other Randamp;D projects afloat -- is the 386 family.andP;  The 386 was Intel'ssecond attempt to fix the architectural limitations of the original 8086, andowes its success less to innovation than to good, competent engineering,mature process technology, and the marketing inspiration that monopolies onproduction keep margins high forever.andM;The venerable old 8051 family has had surprisingly durable legs.andP;  Ten yearsafter introduction the product line is still selling well -- Intel shippedthe 100,000,000th unit in January -- and still proliferating.andP;  But the 8051architecture is anything but inspired.andP;  It was initially proposed by a juniorapplications engineer who got fed up with the 8048 and sought only to fix theearlier chip's most glaring shortcomings.andM;In the systems business, Intel's biggest success has come from building386-based OEM motherboards, modems, and add-in memory boards and coprocessorsfor PCs -- pure vanilla stuff.andM;Alas, I'm afraid the road to microcomputer success lies not in pursuinginnovative Randamp;D projects, or in trying to open up brave, new markets, so muchas in refining existing products for which the market is secure.andP;  Too oftenthe real profits seem to lie not in inventing a better mousetrap, but inmaking last year's mousetrap just a little bit faster, a little bit cheaper,and a little bit easier to use.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
