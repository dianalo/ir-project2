North's defense, possibly delaying the formerWhite House aide's trial.   The three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreedto consider North's challenge of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell's decision to let prosecutors see the summary of classifiedinformation defense lawyers want to elicit from high governmentofficials during the trial.   In a related development, Gesell refused to allow furthercensoring of 300 classified documents prosecutors want to use asevidence against North. The ruling again raised the possibility thatmajor charges against North could be scuttled if the governmentrefuses to divulge classified information at the trial.   But an administration official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said it was too early to assess the impact of Gesell'sdecision on the case against North.   The judge's decision does not spell the end of the case, theofficial said, adding that it may only force prosecutors to dropcertain documents as evidence against North.   pickup 4th graf pvs bgng:``Gesell denied</TEXT><TEXT>   Gesell denied a motion filed last month by independent counselLawrence E. Walsh to seek to accommodate objections of U.S.intelligence agencies to the court's Dec. 12 order.   Meanwhile, North's lawyers subpoenaed Secretary of State GeorgeP. Shultz and four other State Department officials, includingAssistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, the top departmentofficial for Latin American policy. Also subpoenaed wereUndersecretary Michael H. Armacost, legal adviser Abraham Sofaer andM. Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant. North also has hadsubpoenas issued for President Reagan and President-elect Bush.   North is scheduled to go to trial Jan. 31 in U.S. District Court.   But the appellate panel's action could delay the trial while itconsiders what the defense called ``grave constitutional issues''involving North's right to a fair trial.   Gesell's refusal to accomodate some of the objections of U.S.intelligence agencies to divulging certain classified information inthe prosecution exhibits also raises new problems for Walsh.   The judge is insisting, for instance, that references to Iran,Israel and Central American nations remain in the documents, despitea government request that the nations be referred to by letter. TheCIA and other agencies also object to the judge's requirement thatthe full text of intelligence reports be presented verbatim.   Gesell, meanwhile, granted Walsh permission to subpoena North'sdaily diaries of his activities that were kept throughout hisinvolvement in the Iran-Contra affair.   The judge gave North until Jan. 18 to either produce the spiralnotebooks or object to turning over the material, which would be akey piece of evidence for prosecutors.   In the dispute over the summary of the defense case, the defendscontends that giving the 162-page document to Walsh will giveprosecutors an unfair look at the defense strategy for the formerNational Security Council aide.   The appellate panel agreed to consider North's request for a writof mandamus that would permanently bar Gesell from turning over thedefense summary to Walsh. It also issued an administrative stay thatprohibited Gesell from proceeding with his original plan to giveWalsh the summary by 4 p.m. on Tuesday.   ``The purpose of the administrative stay is to permit the courtsufficient opportunity to consider the pending motion and petitionand should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,''said the brief order by Circuit Judges Kenneth Starr, James Buckleyand David Sentelle.   The stay has no time limit, so it could delay the scheduled startof North's trial on charges he conspired with three co-defendants toillegally divert more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-saleprofits to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.   The summary would provide prosecutors with ``a detailed road mapto the defense case and to potential cross-examination ofprosecution witnesses,'' North's lawyers said in court papers.   ``No defendant in the history of federal criminal jurisprudencehas been compelled to reveal before trial the details of anticipateddefense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issue in thecase,'' North's lawyers said.   In reply papers filed Tuesday, Walsh told the appeals court thathe needed access to the defense summary in order to determinewhether the classified information North wants to disclose intestimony is relevant to the case.   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the defense mustnotify the government of its intention to disclose any classifiedinformation at public trial.   In addition to seeking to disclose thousands of pages ofdocuments, North has proposed revealing a variety of secrets,possibly about covert operations, while questioning current andformer government officials called as witnesses in the case.   Former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and armsdealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, also charged in thecase, are scheduled to be tried separately.</TEXT></DOC>
