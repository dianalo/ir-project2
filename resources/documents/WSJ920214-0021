The agency, in steps designed in part to pre-empt popularlegislation being pressed by Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.),said that for the first time it would require companies toinclude non-binding proposals about company pay to appear onproxy ballots. Ten companies are receiving letters from theSEC telling them that the agency no longer considers payproposals excludable from the ballot.</LP><TEXT>   As part of the agency's sweeping revisions of its stanceon executive pay, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said theagency would propose proxy-disclosure rules to giveshareholders a better understanding of how much topmanagement is being paid. If the rules are adopted afterbeing put up for public comment, all compensation of topexecutives would be set forth in one table in the proxystatement. Currently, shareholders trying to determine howmuch an executive is being paid must thumb through severaloften long and obscurely written sections of the proxy.   In addition, the new rules would require companies toinclude a three-year comparison of chief executive pay withcompany performance, determined by stock price changes plusdividends. That new table would also include another SECshift, forcing companies to use a uniform method of valuingstock options to allow for better comparison amongindustries.   In another move to hold company officials' feet to thefire, the SEC would require a section in corporate proxystatements explaining what targets management needs to reachto merit incentive compensation.   Separately, Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), the House's toptax writer, proposed yesterday to cap at $1 million theannual deduction a company could take for an executive'scompensation. While the disclosure rules won't be ready untilthe 1993 proxy season, the advisory votes on corporate paycome into play for 10 major companies this year. Mr. Breedensaid that the agency's move would put directors, who setmanagement pay, in a better position to craft compensationpackages by knowing the opinion of shareholders. &quot;We want totry to reduce the role of the government,&quot; he said. &quot;We'renot trying to define what compensation should be given. Themarket should make that judgment.&quot;   Shareholder groups, which have been fighting for thechanges, expressed gratitude for the government's support.&quot;This sends a powerful message to corporate America that thegovernment is also very concerned about this,&quot; said RalphWhitworth, president of the United Shareholders Association.If a conversation about pay levels wasn't &quot;going on in everyboardroom in America last week, it is this week,&quot; he said.   While the votes are non-binding and can be ignored bydirectors, they are likely to spur reviews of compensationpackages by the directors who set that pay. &quot;You look atthings differently when you are placed in a situation whereyou have to defend them,&quot; said Commissioner Richard Roberts.&quot;That's human nature.&quot;   Changes to some pay packages would take place even beforethe shareholder votes would be held, many contend. &quot;Wellbefore the vote, if polls tell managers that institutions areleaning heavily for something, they will be ready tonegotiate,&quot; said John Coffee Jr., a professor at ColumbiaUniversity Law School. &quot;Management always prefersnon-confrontational, behind-the-scenes compromises.&quot;   Some companies, including UAL Corp. and ITT Corp., alreadyhave negotiated with shareholder groups to change their paypackages or the way they report that pay.   Moreover, corporate advisers, including lawyer MartinLipton, already are prodding companies to justifycompensation levels to their big shareholders. This week, theBusiness Roundtable, a group representing the nation'sbiggest companies, is sending an advisory to members urgingthem to link executive pay more directly to corporateperformance and offering advice on how to respond toinquiries from shareholders.   This year, all the accepted proposals were submitted bysmall shareholders. Under the law, any holder with at least$1,000 of stock who has held that stock for a year can file aproposal. But the wild card is how far institutionalinvestors, who hold more than half of the stock of thebiggest companies, will go to support these proposals, orwhether next year they will file their own.   Sarah Teslik, executive director for the Council ofInstitutional Investors, predicts a new level of activismfrom a group that has often been seen as sympathetic tomanagement. &quot;You will see some `no' votes from some pensionfunds you haven't even heard from before,&quot; she said. &quot;Andonce they get used to voting `no,' they will vote `no' onother issues. I think it will dramatically increase theactivism of funds.&quot;   United Shareholders' Mr. Whitworth contends that unionswill use the issue as a way to take aim at management. &quot;It'sa perfect point to dramatize the difference between what theaverage employee is paid and what top executives get,&quot; hesaid.   In switching its policy, the SEC reversed a decades-oldstance that executive pay is a matter of a company's&quot;ordinary business&quot; and therefore isn't subject toshareholder vote. Recent massive publicity and politicalfuror over the issue led to the change, Mr. Breeden and otherseveral commissioners said. &quot;I think shareholders should beable to vote on issues that are important to the company,&quot;said Commissioner Mary Schapiro. &quot;That includes executivepay.&quot;   The agency also was under great pressure from CapitolHill, where Sen. Levin, chairman of the Oversight ofGovernment Management Subcommittee, has been holding ameticulous set of hearings on legislation that wouldaccomplish much of what the SEC is doing on a regulatorybasis. Recently, Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), who heads theSenate panel that oversees the SEC, urged the agency to act.The Levin plan is attractive to liberal Democrats from alabor stance and attractive to conservative Republicansbecause it gives the owners of a company more say overmanagers.   But Sen. Levin is still pushing for more steps. Forexample, he wants the agency to force changes in howcompanies report stock options on their books. Currently,companies aren't required to take as expenses any optionsthey grant, despite the obvious value of those options.Yesterday, the SEC said it would prod accounting groups tocome up with a solution to the problem in the next fourmonths.   The companies that will be forced to have votes on payproposals this year are Bell Atlantic Corp., InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., Grumman Corp., Chrysler Corp., AetnaLife andamp; Casualty Co., Eastman Kodak Co., Black Hills Corp.,Battle Mountain Gold Co., Equimark Corp. and Baltimore Gas andamp;Electric.</TEXT></DOC>
