RJR said FCB/Leber Katz Partners will handle advertising for Winston, while Young andamp; Rubicam picks up Camel. FCB/Leber Katz, the New York outpost of Foote, Cone andamp; Belding Communications, already handles advertising for Salem, Vantage and Ritz as well as some other Nabisco products. Young andamp; Rubicam currently handles More, Now and Chelsea cigarettes.    The loss deals a severe blow to McCann-Erickson, and is perhaps the worst of a series of setbacks suffered recently by the Interpublic Group of Cos. unit. The agency's New York office lost the $20 million to $25 million American Express Gold Card account and the $15 million to $25 million Shearson Lehman Hutton account earlier this year -- losses only partially offset by some small wins. In May, the agency's top creative executive, John Nieman, jumped ship for D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles.    Meanwhile, McCann-Erickson's carefully cultivated relationship with RJR management had suffered since last year's acquisition of RJR by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Edward A. Horrigan Jr., former chairman of RJR's tobacco unit, had been close to several top McCann-Erickson executives; that close relationship hasn't been duplicated with the new leadership.    In an effort to strengthen its management, McCann-Erickson said yesterday that Sean Kevin Fitzpatrick, currently vice chairman of its sister company Lintas:Campbell-Ewald in Detroit, will become McCann's U.S. vice chairman and chief creative officer. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who will succeed Mr. Nieman, is a highly regarded creative executive credited with Chevrolet's hugely popular &quot;Heartbeat of America&quot; campaign. Mr. Fitzpatrick will work on a special project at Interpublic before moving to McCann-Erickson.    McCann-Erickson's sudden firing came amid criticism of its Camel &quot;Old Joe&quot; cartoon-camel campaign, which some consumer groups claim encourages children to smoke. The move also came as Winston, the nation's second-largest-selling cigarette after Marlboro, is suffering further declines in market share -- a decline that a series of ad campaigns has failed to stem. Industry executives say RJR has long been planning to yank the Winston account, and decided to move Camel, too, in order to consolidate at agencies where it is large enough to wield considerable clout.    Industry executives also believe the move signals that RJR doesn't plan to increase ad spending on some cigarette brands -- and may even slash spending as the company struggles to pay down debt from last year's buy-out.    &quot;I think the changes were made mostly because they anticipate that their cigarette spending isn't going to grow dramatically,&quot; said one ad industry executive familiar wtih RJR. &quot;If you've got four agencies and don't have much money to spread around, you don't need as many agencies.&quot; RJR's other agency, Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Long, Haymes andamp; Carr, is unaffected by yesterday's moves.    An RJR spokeswoman attributed the switch simply to &quot;streamlining our agency relationships. We're in the process of restructuring our company, and we're looking for every way we can to streamline what we do.&quot;    Winston's market share has been steadily falling for years. Its recent advertising hasn't been memorable; even RJR staffers and ad agency executives couldn't recall its latest campaign slogan when asked yesterday. (For those of you who can't either, it's got a sports theme with the tagline &quot;Winning Taste.&quot;)    Winston commanded a 10.7 share of the market in 1988, down from 11.1 in 1987, according to Wheat First Securities, Richmond, Va. For the 12 months ended June 30, Winston's share fell again, to 10.2.    Even as Winston's grasp on the market slipped, however, McCann-Erickson's latest campaign for Camel appeared to be a rousing success. Buoyed by the high-profile, if somewhat goofy, Old Joe cartoon campaign, the brand's filtered cigarettes grew to a 2.9 share in 1988 from 2.7 the year before and 2.6 three years before that, according to Wheat First; its smaller, nonfiltered cigarette business continued to decline slightly each year. &quot;We're very pleased with the results the overall campaign has achieved,&quot; the RJR spokeswoman said.    But the Camel campaign has sparked outcries in some circles. It was widely derided Tuesday -- the day before McCann-Erickson was fired -- at a congressional subcommittee hearing on a bill to restrict cigarette advertising. James W. Johnston, RJR's chairman and chief executive officer, even wrote a letter to Rep. Gerry Sikorski (D., Minn.) apologizing for one of the ads, which explains how to pick up girls at the beach.    &quot;This ad should never have run,&quot; Mr. Johnston said in his June 16 letter. &quot;I apologize to you and others who were offended by it and can assure you that it will never run again.&quot; Also at Tuesday's hearing, a former model for Winston cigarettes testified that the Winston ads were aimed at young people.    According to Leading National Advertisers, Camel spent $24.4 million on advertising in 1988, while Winston spent $30.3 million, not including spending on sports promotions. Some ad agency executives, however, contend that actual billings are far greater, since LNA doesn't count all non-broadcast media.    Young andamp; Rubicam wouldn't comment, but Stanley Katz, chairman and chief executive of FCB/Leber Katz, said his agency was &quot;thrilled&quot; to handle both Winston and Salem, RJR's two largest brands. Turning around Winston's declining fortunes &quot;is going to be very difficult. Reynolds knows it's going to be very difficult and we're realistic about that,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;We're very optimistic.&quot;    At McCann-Erickson, meanwhile, a spokeswoman said, &quot;We don't dispute the fact that it is in RJR's best interest to consolidate. We only regret that we're the odd man out.&quot; McCann-Erickson still retains RJR tobacco business in 19 countries abroad, handles tobacco direct marketing, and advertises crackers and other RJR Nabisco brands in the U.S.    ---   Ad Notes....    NEW ACCOUNTS: New York ad agency LGFE, formerly known as Lord Geller Federico Einstein, picked up three accounts totaling $15 million: Fasolino Foods Co., North Bergen, N.J.; Palm-Aire Spa Resort and Country Club, Pompano Beach, Fla.; and Citizens for a Drug Free America, a new citizens action group in Washington.    NEWSPAPER SPENDING: Newspaper Advertising Bureau, New York, lowered its 1989 forecast of U.S. newspaper ad expenditures to a 5% increase from a 6% gain. A spokesman said the revision was made to reflect a slowdown in classified ad growth and less optimistic expectations for the economy for the rest of 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
