The threat came in typewritten statements in Arabic signed bythe Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian faction holding Americanjournalist Terry Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.   Israeli warplanes and helicopters attacked guerrilla strongholdsin Lebanon today in retaliation for a bombing that killed sevenIsraeli soldiers. Fifteen people were killed and 35 wounded in theair raids, police said.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:   ``We deplore the loss of life and the needless suffering ofpeople on both sides, Lebanese and Israeli alike. We remain deeplyconcerned about the tragic pattern of action and reaction inLebanon.''   One of the two identical statements attributed to Islamic Jihad,or Islamic Holy War, went to a Western news agency with an instantcolor photograph of Anderson.   The same statement without a photograph was delivered toBeirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper.   The statement paid tribute to the Shiite Moslem suicide bomberwho killed seven Israeli soldiers in Israel's self-designated``security zone'' in south Lebanon on Wednesday, and it denouncedIsrael's retaliatory air strikes.   ``Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not passwithout a punishment. The criminal America must realize it will notget away with what it has done, especially in connection with thehostages we hold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes atthe dignity and glory of our people and mujahedeen (holyfighters).''   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, 57, acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut, was abducted June9, 1985.   In the photo, Anderson, with a bushy beard, was looking directlyinto the camera. He was wearing a Commodore Hotel T-shirt, as hewore when he was kidnapped.   The photograph was similar to one released April 10, whenIslamic Jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a Kuwaiti jetlinerhijacked to Cyprus was stormed to free the passengers.   The Israeli jets scored direct hits on ammunition dumps andtraining bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, said apolice spokesman in Lebanon.   On Thursday, Israel's leaders vowed to retaliate againstHezbollah, which claimed responsibility for killing the Israelisoldiers Wednesday. Hezbollah is an umbrella group for Shiitegroups believed holding most of the 14 foreign hostages, whoinclude nine Americans.   The Lebanese police official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said 12 Israeli fighter-bombers were involved insimultaneous air strikes near Sidon, provincial capital of southLebanon, and in the eastern town of Mashgara.   Helicopter gunships later joined the attack on Mashgara, policesaid.   Eight people were killed and 15 wounded in the Sidon area, andseven were killed and 20 wounded in Mashgara, the spokesman said.   He said clouds of black smoke hung over the stricken bases onthe outskirts of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, and Mashgara, 15miles to the east.   The Israeli military command said the raids occurred about 10a.m. and were aimed at ``Palestinian targets in the Sidon area andHezbollah command posts in the villages of Mashgara andAl-Luwayzah.''   The village of Al-Luwayzah is about two miles southeast ofMetulla, where the car bombing occurred. The military statementsaid at least six U.S.-made F-16's took part in the raids.   Lebanese police said an ammunition depot belonging to Hezbollahwas hit near the Palestinian refugee camp of Mieh Mieh, on theoutskirts of Sidon, and set off a series of explosions.   A Palestinian guerrilla training base was hit in Mieh Mieh. Theplanes also blasted targets in the nearby Ein el-Hilweh refugeecamp.   Shortly after the air attack, Israeli troops in the hills insouth Lebanon fired on Mieh Mieh and Al-Luwayzeh with long-rangehowitzers.   U.N. peacekeeping sources said Israeli helicopters also attackedMeidoun, four miles south of Mashgara.   The Lebanese police spokesman said warplanes also hit targets inthe Ein el-Hilweh refugee camps, also outside Sidon.   The warplanes drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Palestinian andHezbollah gunners. No hits were reported.   Hezbollah, an umbrella for Shiite Moslem militants loyal toIran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, claimed responsibility for thecar bombing that also wounded eight Israeli soldiers and twoLebanese women.   Israeli officials often have charged that Arafat's PLOguerrillas and Hezbollah cooperate in the guerrilla warfare againstIsraeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen in south Lebanon.   The bombing was the deadliest attack against the Israelis sinceMarch 1985, when a similar suicide car bomb killed 12 Israelis andwounded 14.   Israel withdrew from most of south Lebanon in June 1985, threeyears after invading the country, and established a security zone,about six to 10 miles deep, north of its border to preventguerrilla infiltrations from Lebanon.   The air raid was the 16th on Lebanon this year. By police count,68 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous attacks sinceJan. 3.</TEXT></DOC>
