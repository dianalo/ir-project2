Meanwhile, floodwaters receded in Kentucky and Tennessee, wheresomething new began falling from the sky: snow.   Flurries began swirling around Nashville early today astemperatures dropped into the 20s throughout Tennessee, bringing areprieve from the heavy rains that have plagued the region for morethan a week. Most of Kentucky also got light snowfall overnight.   A clash between warm and cold air was blamed for the severeweather Tuesday in North Carolina, where a construction worker diedin the collapse of a house he was building near Lillington, about 25miles south of Raleigh. Four people were injured in that incident.   The National Weather Service said there were apparently sometornadoes in the state, but could not confirm individual accounts oftwisters.   In Anson County, just north of the South Carolina border, thestorm destroyed a cable television business, sent a tree crashingthrough the roof of a house, blew over two airplanes at an airport,ripped the tin roof off a service station and tore part of the roofoff the Morven Elementary School _ where pupils went through a stormdrill last week.   ``We had just had our tornado drill last week so that childrenknew exactly what to do,'' said Gloria Truman, the school secretary.``They were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15seconds. They were perfect. You could not ask for them to be anybetter.''   One of the 227 children, fourth-grader Shannon Short, 9, recalledthe storm in vivid detail.   ``It was thundering and the glass was bumping and then the top ofthe ceiling started shaking. That's when it started,'' she said.``The rain was splashing on the windows. It sounded like rocks. Wehad to get out because the rain was falling in on our classroom.''   About 30 miles north in Moore County, several trailersoverturned, injuring four people, while to the east in RichmondCounty, wind tore half the roof off a motel in Rockingham.   In Kentucky, crews doubled their efforts to pump flood water fromLebanon Junction, a town south of Louisville that has been inundatedby the recent floods. National Guard Sgt. Ian Lamb said a secondheavy-duty water pump was flown in by helicopter and lowered onto arain-soaked levee that was too soft to support a truck.   About 150 families left their homes in Calhoun, Livermore andRumsey in McLean County in western Kentucky because of flooding fromthe Green River, said Don Armstrong, a spokesman for the stateDivision of Disaster and Emergency Services. The river was expectedto crest at 10 feet above flood level by Friday.   Authorities said flooding may have been to blame for the death ofa woman whose body was found Tuesday night in 18 inches of water inher basement in LaRue County.   In western Tennessee, about a dozen people were expected to begincleaning up today in the town of Obion, where nearly 400 people wereevacuated after a levee on the Obion River burst.   Schools were closed Tuesday in four Tennessee counties whereroads were under water, but reopened today when they cleared.   However, authorities said they were confident that the floodingthreat was passing with the end of the rains. Virtually all ofTennessee's swollen rivers had either passed flood stage or wereexpected to by Friday, forecasters said.</TEXT></DOC>
