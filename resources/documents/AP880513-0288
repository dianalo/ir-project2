On other markets, precious metals were higher; cattle futuresrose while pork futures were mixed; energy futures were slightlyhigher; and stock-index futures advanced.   Soybean futures, which had posted strong gains in five of thesix previous sessions, leaped as much as 14 cents a bushel on theChicago Board of Trade and set new contract highs across the board.   The National Weather Service said in its 30-day outlook that theOhio River valley, central Mississippi River valley and theMississippi Delta region would all be drier than normal.   The large speculative firms Refco Inc. and Candamp;D Commodities ledthe trading, analysts said.   ``They were using that forecast as an excuse to rally the(soybean) market,'' said Jon Horton, an analyst at ResearchDepartment Inc. in Chicago. ``It's still a bull market, soeveryone's back in it on the long side.''   Some private forecasters also reduced their predictions for rainover the weekend, said Mickey Luth, soybean analyst with ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc.   The soybean market is particularly sensitive to weather concernsbecause of indications that the U.S. soybean stockpile is dwindlingand a large crop is needed to meet expected demand.   Some analysts have called the recent soybean speculationexcessive but Luth questioned that opinion.   ``Who knows? From an overall balance sheet point-of-view, maybethe soybeans should have been up here anyway,'' he said.   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 4} cents higher with the contract fordelivery in May at $3.06 a bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ centshigher with May at $1.97 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2 centshigher with May at $1.57\ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 14cents higher with May at $7.19{ a bushel.   The surge in soybean futures supported expectations for higherinflation, which helped boost precious metals futures prices,analysts said.   Platinum futures led group, which had been flagging in reactionto a government report issued early Friday that said wholesaleprices had risen a moderate 0.4 percent in April. Theinflation-sensitive metals markets had expected a greater increase.   ``Better buying emerged late in the session as soybean and someother markets firmed,'' said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst inChicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That mitigated the effectsof the Producer Price Index for April and tended to fuelinflationary expectations that have been building recently.''   Platinum settled $6.70 to $7.20 higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, with July at $550.30 a troy ounce.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $1.50 lowerto 40 cents higher with June at $453.70 a troy ounce; silver was4.8 cents to 5.8 cents higher with May at $6.632 a troy ounce.   Cattle futures gained due to strong cash prices while porkfutures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   Advances in the cattle pit were limited by position-eveningahead of Monday's seven-state cattle-on-feed report, which isexpected to show fewer feedlot placements during April compared tolast year and a nearly equal number of April marketings, analystssaid.   Support for the hog and pork belly contracts stemmed fromexpectations that cash markets will remain firm as hog slaughtersexperience a seasonal decline, said Philip Stanley, an analyst inChicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .65 cent higher with June at73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .48 centhigher with May at 80.77 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent lower to.43 cent higher with June at 53.55 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .35 cent lower to .38 cent higher with May at 54.40cents a pound.   Most energy futures prices inched higher in lackluster tradingon the New York Mercantile Exchange.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 4cents higher with June at $17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .15 centto .30 cent higher with June at 47.47 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .15 cent lower to .42 cent higher with June at 52.34cents a gallon.   Stock-index futures posted substantial gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled 3.75 points higher at 257.55.</TEXT></DOC>
