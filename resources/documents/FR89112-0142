One proposed change to the Technical Specification (TS) contained in NNECO'sSeptember 30, 1988 application for licensee amendment, was found to beunacceptable. The proposed change addresses the surveillance program tobe undertaken following a plant shutdown resulting from high primary-to-secondaryleakage per TS 4.4.5.1.3. The proposed TS change would delete the requirementfor a general steam generator tube inspection, per TS Table 4.4-6, andinstitute an inspection aimed specifically at detecting and repairing thesource of the leakage. It is our position that the existence of a leakingsteam generator tube may suggest a more widespread problem that can onlybe investigated via the normal sample inspection specified in TS Table4.4-6. Accordingly, the NRC staff has denied NNECO's proposed change to TS 4.4.5.1.3.The other provision of the amendment relating to TS 4.4.5.1.4.a.8 requesthas been approved by Amendment No. 138 dated January 3, 1989. Notice ofIssuance of that amendment will be published in the Commission's biweekly<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. The licensee was notified of the Commission's denial of the proposed TSchange by the letter transmitting Amendment No. 138.
