(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers have called athree-day memorial to cool passions raised by a long strike, butunion officials can't guarantee that wildcat strikers will return tothe mines after the holiday.   ``They've looked to the government for a solution to theirproblems and see people hauled off and carted off to jail,'' saidJohn Duray, a spokesman for the UMW in Washington, D.C.   More than 37,000 miners were on wildcat walkouts in eight statesFriday, protesting The Pittston Co.'s refusal to sign a nationalcontract with 1,800 miners in West Virginia. The walkouts began June12.   They also were incited by millions of dollars in fines leviedagainst the union by judges and the arrests of strike leaders andsupporters.   ``There's a whole lot of talk about law, but there's not anyjustice,'' Duray said. ``The system's broken down.''   Violence has increased with the miners' frustration, Duray said,prompting UMW President Richard Trumka's call Friday for a three-daymemorial period beginning Monday.   It was the first official union sanction for wildcat action,which judges around the country have been declaring illegal. ButTrumka said his objectives were anything but provocative.   ``The union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calmthe volatile situation in the coal fields,'' he said in a statementreleased by the union. ``Although the union has requested that theyreturn to work, the conditions which led to the protest ... remainunchanged.''   All UMW members east of the Mississippi River will be asked tostay away from work Monday through Wednesday, except those atWestmoreland Coal Co. The union used memorial days for Westmorelandworkers in Virginia in April.   Duray said he didn't expect a settlement with Pittston byWednesday and couldn't predict whether the miners would return towork.   Most of the nation's mines have been closed for two weeks in anational vacation period and were scheduled to restart midnightSunday. It was unclear how the memorial wildcat action would affectthe reopenings.   Bituminous Coal Operators Association spokesman Morris Feibuschrefused to comment on Trumka's call.   About 2,000 striking miners surrounded a meeting hall in Beckley,55 miles southeast of Charleston on Friday to protest the firing of28 colleagues _ the first union men fired since the start of thewildcat strikes. The protestors prevented a hearing between unionofficials and the Toney's Branch Coal Co.   ``I think that's only going to worsen the situation,'' DemocraticRep. Bob Wise said of the firings. ``Once you get the genie out ofthe bottle, it's going to be hard to get it back in.''   Wildcat strikes have spread through the Appalachian andMidwestern coal fields in apparent violation of the UMW's nationalcontract with the BCOA.   The National Labor Relations Board on Friday asked a federaljudge in Alton, Ill., to order 8,500 coal miners in Illinois to endtheir wildcat strike and return to work.   The NLRB cited the union for violations at some mining operationsin West Virginia, saying its members were using ``violence, threatsand intimidation.''   The board also said it planned court action to force miners backto work at two coal mines in Indiana.   Pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without acontract before walking out April 5, refusing a company request thatminers work mandatory overtime and on Sundays and refusing proposedcuts in medical benefits for pensioners.</TEXT></DOC>
