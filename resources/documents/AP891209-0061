About 400 rebels surrendered Saturday in Cebu, ending the sixthand bloodiest attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.   The political and economic damage has been devastating. Theviolence shattered the illusion of stability, carefully crafted byMrs. Aquino's advisers.   It also exposed the disarray in a government that all too oftenblames its own shortcomings on the legacy of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos.   ``She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' a senior Bushadministration official told reporters in Washington. The official,speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Aquino's ability tosurvive depends on how well she learns from the coup attempt.   It is far from certain any lessons will be learned.   Mrs. Aquino reorganized her Cabinet after coup attempts inNovember 1986 and August 1987 and promised ``a new beginning,''which proved largely rhetorical.   ``This coup happened because of her administration's wishy-washyapproach to national problems,'' columnist Pedro Chanco wrote inthe newspaper Malaya. ``My fear with Mrs. Aquino's tough posture(during the coup attempt) is the likelihood that she will forgetall about it when the crisis is over.''   Despite talk of national reconciliation, Mrs. Aquino has nevermastered the art of dealing with political rivals, essential tobuilding a consensus in this fragmented society.   Behind the public image of the frail, vulnerable widow stands aniron-willed woman, whom associates describe as stubborn to a fault.   She tends to dismiss criticism as the carping of jealous rivals.   But Mrs. Aquino faces a military deeply politicized after yearsof martial law, which Marcos imposed from 1972 until 1981. Eachcoup attempt has enhanced the influence of the military at theexpense of civilian authority.   Although Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels,military commanders opened talks and persuaded most of them tosurrender. Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa told Mrs.Aquino of the talks after they began.   Mutineers will be tried by military courts, which have beenreluctant to impose harsh sentences after previous coup attempts.   Ironically, the ``people power revolution'' itself encouragedthe notion that the military should play a role in politics. Therevolt began in February 1986 as a coup attempt against Marcos,organized by some of the same officers who have since tried tooverthrow Mrs. Aquino.   It succeeded after Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and secular groups senthundreds of thousands of followers into the streets to ``protect''the mutineers from Marcos' troops.   Young officers of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM,who led the 1986 uprising, assumed they would share power with thepresident they helped put in office.   Instead, Mrs. Aquino filled her Cabinet with many longtimesupporters bitter at the military for martial law.   She also made peace overtures to Communist and Moslem rebelswhile others in her government threatened to prosecute soldiers forhuman rights abuses under Marcos.   That deepened suspicion and resentment in the ranks and promptedthe reform movement to begin plotting. The movement, organized in1985 to fight corruption in the ranks, is believed to have led atleast three coup attempts, including the latest.   Its members include Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leaderof the August 1987 coup attempt. Honasan is believed to have playeda key role in the recent attempt.   Apart from political jealousy, movement members were motivatedby a belief that their goals were not realized. Corruption persistsin both the military and civilian government.   Although most Filipinos remain suspicious of a militarygovernment, a growing number are dissatisfied with Mrs. Aquinobecause of rising prices, decaying infrastructure and a lack ofdecisive leadership.   In 1986, many Filipinos assumed Mrs. Aquino would introducesweeping social, political and economic reforms to transform thenation's feudalistic society.   Instead, she simply restored traditional democraticinstitutions, including a bicameral Congress, and left the job ofreform to them.   A bicameral legislature, patterned after the U.S. system, hasproven unwieldy here and incapable of speeding controversiallegislation.   Mrs. Aquino has ruled out a second term in 1992. As a ``lameduck,'' she finds it difficult to bring to heel errant legislatorswhose terms run concurrently with her own.   Since parties are weak and based on temporary personalalliances, congressional leaders also have trouble delivering thevote on controversial legislation.   Leaders of the recent coup attempt called for acivilian-military junta to initiate reforms and organize areferendum to decide what form of government to establish.   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, fired as defense minister after theNovember 1986 coup attempt, believes a unicameral, parliamentarysystem _ with a figurehead president and prime minister _ would bebetter.   ``It provides a safety valve that will release political steamand enable the people to make a vote of no confidence, to dislodgethe government without resorting to arms,'' Enrile said. ``This isthe way to end all these recurring coups.''   The latest attempt occurred as millions were facing growingeconomic hardships due to rising prices, electricity shortages, adecline in the peso and transportation problems.   For months, many supporters were warning Mrs. Aquino thatdiscontent was mounting.   Intead of taking action, Mrs. Aquino asked for patience andblamed the problem on Marcos. She went to West Germany and Francein August and to Canada and the United States last month, seekinginvestments. She took her 18-year-old daughter, Kris, to NorthAmerica to shop for Christmas presents.   ``In all humility, I can whisper now, `perhaps I told you so,''' said Jose Luis Alcuaz, fired as telecommunications chief afterpublicly warning a coup was imminent. ``The `fed-up factor' hasreached alarming proportions.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert H.
