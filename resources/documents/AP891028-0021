Mitchell,D-Maine, told reporters Friday.   White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman responded to thecriticism with a lecture about the need for statesmanship.   ``We need people in Congress to get back to their better selvesin all of this,'' Darman said.   The issue is blocking Senate action on bills to provide economicassistance to Poland and Hungary and to raise the federal debtlimit so the government can continue to borrow money.   It also is slowing work by Senate and House negotiators on acompromise bill to reduce the budget deficit.   The Treasury Department stepped in Friday with a plan to ensurethat Social Security checks will go out next week even if Congressand the president are unable to agree on a higher debt limit. Thedepartment announced it will borrow $17.6 billion on an emergencybasis Monday.   Friday's announcement was considerably less dramatic thanTreasury's disclosure 24 hours earlier that it was taking theunprecedented step of emergency borrowing. The earlier statementhad been read as indicating $17 billion in new borrowing would berequired Monday.   In fact, Treasury will be raising its credit needs by only $2billion Monday. The remaining $15.6 billion will be raised in theusual Monday auctions of 3- and 6-month securities. The onlydifference is that buyers will have to pay for those securitiesTuesday, rather than Thursday as usually would be the case.   That money will be used to keep the government going afterTuesday night, when federal credit authority drops from $2.87trillion to $2.8 trillion. The extra $17.6 billion from securitiessales is expected to carry the government for another week, throughNov. 7.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, described the emergency borrowing as an unprecedentedgamble.   ``I don't see how such an action can fail to undermineconfidence in our financial operations,'' he said.   He said there was no danger Congress would fail to raise thedebt ceiling or would do anything else to jeopardize governmentchecks for 38.9 million Social Security recipients.   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady toexplain his actions in writing by Monday on the unusual borrowingaction.   ``I view this as a serious matter,'' he said in a letter toBrady.   At Bush's urging, the House voted last month to tax capitalgains _ profits from the sale of stocks and other investments _ ata lower rate than applies to wages and other income. The Houseattached the cut to a bill designed chiefly to reduce the budgetdeficit.   Senate Republicans have developed, with Bush's backing, a newplan for cutting capital-gains cuts. The chief sponsor, Sen. BobPackwood, R-Ore., says as many as 44 Republicans and 12 Democrats _a majority of the Senate _ favor his bill, but he acknowledges hedoes not have the 60 votes that would be required to end aDemocratic filibuster against it.</TEXT></DOC>
