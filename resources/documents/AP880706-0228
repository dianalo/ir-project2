KUNII</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Talks between Japan and the United States havefocused on balancing trade between the countries, but haven'tignored the fact that Japan has built its technological edge on thefoundations of Western science.   Under a pact signed last month by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita, Japan will donate $4 million to inviteU.S. scientists and engineers to the country, open researchlaboratories to Americans and boost the number of foreignresearchers invited on scholarships from 28 to 200.   Washington long has demanded more funding and a commitment tobalance the flow of researchers and information, getting tough ascritics, especially U.S. industry, call for an end to what they sayhas been Japan's free ride.   The Japan Center at the University of North Carolina estimatesthat 15,000 Japanese students and researchers enter U.S.institutions a year, five times the number of Americans coming toJapan.   Japan earned $2.2 billion from foreigners in fiscal 1986 on itspatent licenses and other technology information, while it paid$2.4 billion, over 80 percent of that to the United States.   Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for ScienceInformation System, discounts Tokyo's latest moves.   ``It's a big step but it's still symbolic,'' said Inose,developer of the government's fifth-generation computer researchproject and one expert consulted by the government over thebilateral science pact.   ``We should establish a sort of system of substantial scale interms of money, or university chairs and positions, and let this beunderstood by the Americans and the Europeans,'' Inose said. ``Theywill decide whether they want to come over.''   Leading Japanese scientists, many of whom have studied or workedin America, agree that the time has arrived for Japan to repay itsdebt.   ``My generation has all gone to the United States to study.Japan just preaches about international cooperation, but it reallyhas to start putting out more funds ... like the U.S. governmentwhich has spent so much over the years,'' Tokyo UniversityProfessor Shoji Tanaka, one of the world's leadingsuperconductivity researchers, said in an interview.   Inose, who invented the digital telephone switch as a researcherat the University of Pennsylvania and Bell Telephone in the late1950s, agrees.   ``I have repeatedly told the government that the United Stateshas spent a great deal to invite Japanese scientists and engineerson Fulbright scholarships... I don't think we ever reciprocated forthat.''   The U.S.-Japan Agreement on Cooperation in Science andTechnology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research innon-energy areas. It was renewed five times since 1985 and, after10 months of negotiations ending in June, officials agreed to a newpact effective from 1988 to 1993.   The largely symbolic agreement was not controversial untiltensions mounted over Japan's trade surplus. When full-scale talksto renew the pact began last year, the United States surprisedJapan by laying down a list of stringent rules to balance bilateralcooperation.   In 11th-hour talks in June, U.S. negotiators won a majorconcession when Japan agreed to restrict the publication of jointtechnology with possible military application and to restrict thetransfer of such information.   Technological exports include information and licenses on oldand new technology, such as submarine-silencing equipment ToshibaMachine Co. sold to the Soviet Union in violation of a Westernblock trade agreement.   No provisions exist under Japanese law to prevent thedissemination of scientific and technological information developedfor peaceful purposes. But officials say they can adhere to thepact because both sides have agreed to distribute the results oftheir joint research as widely as possible.   In Tokyo, however, the feeling pervades that Japan is beingforced to comply with a pact of benefit only to Washington. ``To usin Japan it appears we are under the pressure of the U.S.government,'' Inose said.   Japanese officials point to a number of problems overlooked byWashington.   Nagahide Onozawa will oversee 100 of the foreign researchersunder the jurisdiction of the governmental Japan Society for thePromotion of Science. He says promising American scientists,eligible for 30 to 40 of the endowments, are not the most likelycandidates to respond to the new program.   ``Apart from the problems of language and style of living, manyresearchers at the start or the peak of their careers are not thatinterested in coming to Japan ... they're afraid of being leftbehind by their colleagues back home.''   Tanaka, head of the government's International SuperconductivityTechnology Center, questions the intentions of the U.S. governmentand industry.   Tanaka found no takers when he recently visited the UnitedStates in an attempt to woo American corporate participation in thenew superconductivity project despite paranoia that Japan wastaking the lead in the field, which promises a bounty in terms ofapplication patents.   Tanaka said nationalism is driving the U.S. government as itcloses off symposiums on superconductivity to foreign participationin a bid to take first place in the field. Yet superconductivity isone area U.S. officials selected for joint research in drawing upthe new bilateral agreement.   Tanaka and other scientists say U.S. industry is not interestedin joining costly programs like the one he heads.   William Norris, chairman emeritus of the Control Data Corp.,echoed the opinion of U.S. firms when he told a recent U.S. Senatespace subcommittee that Japan should give U.S. firms ``freeaccess'' in exchange for the technology it has developed fromAmerican research.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said in a briefing,``The Americans' major interest is in Japanese institutions ofapplied science rather than basic science. Most of the appliedscience institutions here are private ... and we cannot control theprivate sector.''   Japan's private industry footed 80.3 percent _ compared with the50 percent U.S. firms put up in America _ of the $68 billion thenation spent on research and development in 1985.   Of the research in Japanese industrial laboratories, almost 94percent of the outlays went into experimental development andapplied research, a fact not overlooked by U.S. industry.   Japan's technological standing, Inose said, is world-class infields like computer memories and biotechnology. ``The UnitedStates cannot excel in every area and they have to think about aninternational division of labor.''</TEXT></DOC>
