For its hearings here today, the committee invited theformer owners of four expensively defunct Texas thrifts:Thomas M. Gaubert of Independent American SavingsAssociation; Edwin T. McBirney III of Sunbelt SavingsAssociation of Texas; Don R. Dixon of Vernon Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, and Jarrett E. Woods Jr. of Western SavingsAssociation.</LP><TEXT>   All are targets of a U.S. Justice Department investigationthat has been grinding away for more than three years,probing the improper lending practices and other abuses thatled to the collapse of the four thrifts. Except for Mr.Gaubert, none of the four men has been charged with criminalwrongdoing. And Mr. Gaubert's indictment, which didn'tinvolve his stewardship of Independent American, ended inacquittal in 1988. Of the four, only Mr. Gaubert consideredappearing before the committee, but he has anotherobligation: He is currently serving on a Dallas County grandjury.   A banking committee staff member said the four men wereinvited to give them an opportunity to respond to allegationsthat are sure to be made by other witnesses. Otherwise, thehearing will focus on prosecutors' progress in investigatingthrift fraud.   The panel &quot;isn't going in there with a feeling that {theprogress} has been good or bad,&quot; says a staff member. &quot;Butmembers are hearing that the constituents are impatient withthe pace of the prosecutions and convictions.&quot;   Some would consider the pace glacial, including thetargets of the investigations. All four were out of thethrift business by early 1987 and remain in judicial andbusiness limbo today.   Of the four, Mr. Gaubert, who relinquished control ofIndependent American Savings in 1984, has spent the most timein the cross hairs of the government's guns. He was indictedand acquitted in 1988 of charges that he defrauded a tinyIowa thrift, and a five-year statute of limitations onprosecutions now precludes charges for any criminal activitythat may have occurred at Independent American.   But the Justice Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Forcekeeps questioning, among other things, Mr. Gaubert'sborrowings and other transactions with the defunct SunbeltSavings, according to lawyers whose clients have beenquestioned about Mr. Gaubert.   &quot;It remains very curious why the Justice Departmentconcentrates so much time and effort on this one guy who'sbeen out of the Sandamp;L for more than five years, unless it'sbecause they hold a grudge and don't like to see peopleacquitted,&quot; says Mr. Gaubert's attorney, Abbe David Lowell ofWashington, D.C.   While the investigation drags on, Mr. Gaubert is battlingthrift regulators in court over the terms of their takeoverof Independent American. In a separate court case, he isdueling with Sunbelt Savings FSB, which took on the assets ofthe defunct Sunbelt, over $35.3 million in loans that Mr.Gaubert guaranteed in 1985. Among the loans was one for $6million he used to buy controlling interest in TeleCom Corp.,a holding company with interests in air-conditioningdistribution and conveying-equipment manufacturing.   Mr. McBirney is struggling with his own publicly tradedholding company, Oxidyne Group Inc. A subsidiary, OxidyneCorp., apparently has developed some promising technology forthe oxidation of solid waste in mile-deep wells, but thecompany hasn't been able to scare up the $12 million to $18million it needs to fulfill its first contract, with Houston.   Could it have something to do with the reputation of Mr.McBirney, whose wild and woolly spending at the old Sunbeltearned it the nickname Gunbelt Savings? &quot;I know it's animpediment to the company,&quot; Mr. McBirney says of his positionas Oxidyne Group chief executive. He is now seeking a buyerfor the company, or at least a new chief executive.   In the meantime, federal investigators are inching closerto indicting Mr. McBirney with the cooperation of severalformer officers of Sunbelt subsidiaries.   Mr. McBirney won't appear before the House BankingCommittee &quot;in this atmosphere,&quot; says Paul E. Coggins, hisattorney. &quot;That will happen to one of my clients whenelephants start to fly.&quot;   Mr. Woods, who was ousted from the ownership of WesternSavings in September 1986, has also paid a price for histhrift days. When the Dallas Morning News reported last yearthat a company owned by trust funds for Mr. Woods's childrenwas attempting to get millions of dollars in government loansto rehabilitate a South Dallas apartment complex, cityofficials and the U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment quashed the deal.   Now, Mr. Woods is having to demolish most of the apartmentcomplex and must show the city proof of financing for repairsof the remainder, according the terms of a court settlementwith the city.   Mr. Woods &quot;just wishes it would all go away, and he couldget on with his life,&quot; says Paul M. Wolff, one of Mr. Woods'sattorneys from the Washington law firm of Williams andamp;Connolly. Mr. Wolff says his client is working in realestate, but won't be more specific. And the lawyer says hehas heard little from the Bank Fraud Task Force &quot;except theytell me they hate my client.&quot;   A Justice Department spokesman said the agency wouldn'tcomment on the progress of its investigations.   Since Mr. Dixon left Vernon Savings in mid-1986, he hasmaintained a low profile, a sharp contrast to the days whenVernon paid for tours of Europe and a home in California.Now, his attorney, William M. Ravkind, says Mr. Dixon isinvolved in an offshore insurance deal but wouldn't be morespecific.   Meanwhile, the trappings of Mr. Dixon's old life are beingauctioned away under the auspices of the U.S. BankruptcyCourt in Dallas. So far, the auctions have netted about $2million, most of that from the sale of a vintage-cardealership that Mr. Dixon owned in California.   Just last week, Mr. Dixon got a glimpse of the future whenVernon's former chairman and chief executive, Woody F.Lemons, was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison foraccepting kickbacks from Vernon borrowers, among otherthings.   &quot;That makes plea bargaining doubtful,&quot; Mr. Ravkind says.&quot;I guess we'd better not lose.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
