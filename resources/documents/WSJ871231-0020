The appeals court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Fed's decision was consistent with amendments to federal banking law that Congress passed in 1982.    Beginning in 1979, the Fed, in response to another appeals court decision, said that only banks headquartered in towns with a population of 5,000 or less could sell insurance through brokerages in such small towns. Moreover, the Fed said the bank-holding company also had to have a bank branch or lending office in any town in which it wanted to sell insurance.    In 1982, Congress said that insurance sales should generally be off limits to the banking industry, with a few exceptions that included small towns. To carry out the 1982 amendments, the Fed decided it was no longer necessary to limit small-town insurance sales to those banks that are headquartered in such towns. But the Fed kept the requirement that a bank have a branch or lending office in a town where it wants to sell insurance.    The Fed's decision was appealed by several trade groups for insurance agents. In an opinion written by U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson, sitting as a member of the appeals court, the appeals court said the Fed &quot;validly exercised its discretion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
