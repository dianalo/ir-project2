Three times, using different names, Anthony Dearill Eilandpleaded guilty to burglary, and each time was placed on probation.   Investigators said they caught up with Eiland, as he's now knownby police, after eight months when they jailed a man named JoeSmith last week and matched his fingerprints with three other setson file.   Police said Eiland may have taken advantage of a backlog ofpaperwork.   Incomplete computer records used to research Eiland's burglarycases at the district attorney's office alternately omitted SocialSecurity numbers and fingerprint ID numbers, said Norman Kinne,first assistant district attorney.   ``Unless you knew the names,'' he said, ``you wouldn't hit onit.''   The suspect was being held on more than $50,000 bail on chargesincluding burglary, violating probation, an evading arrest and aninvestigative charge of failure to identify himself.</TEXT></DOC>
