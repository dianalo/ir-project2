The Senate, as part of its work on a $288 billion militaryspending bill, refused a day earlier to restore funds for Star Warsto a level closer to the $4.5 billion it approved last month inauthorization legislation.   The overwhelming vote of 66-34 was perceived by some lawmakersas a blow to the program.   ``I think there is a growing recognition ... that we have toreduce our expectations and level of resources committed to it,''Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters. The Senate vote was ``a strongindication of concern in that regard,'' he said.   President Reagan proposed Star Wars, formally known as theStrategic Defense Initiative, six years ago, hailing it as anuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States.   But Vice President Dan Quayle's recent comment that the Reaganadministration's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the UnitedStates was ``political jargon,'' and the Soviet Union's decision toseparate Star Wars from a strategic arms reduction treaty haveundercut support for the program.   ``SDI has now been cut loose,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia,ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday.   Work on the military spending bill was put aside Wednesday asthe Senate took up a $9.4 billion compromise plan to pay for theBush administration's war on drugs. That plan was approved 97-2.   Later in the day, however, the Senate did briefly take up thebill and passed by voice vote an amendment limiting production ofthe airborne self-protection jammer until further testing iscompleted. In addition, a non-binding resolution was introducedcalling for U.S. participation in a multinational anti-drug strikeforce.   The Senate will vote on that measure Thursday when it isexpected to complete the appropriations bill. A handful ofamendments on anti-satellite weapons, U.S. troop levels in Europeand Star Wars are still pending.   The Senate Appropriations Committee, in adopting the spendinglegislation, approved on a 16-11 vote a measure requiring that $820million of the $3.7 billion for Star Wars be used for research onlasers and particle beams.   Proponents of the amendment expressed concerns that theadministration will sacrifice long-term research on directed energyweapons such as lasers and particle beams in favor of a ``quick fixor a Phase 1 deployment'' that would favor the so-called``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in the administration.   The funding level for Star Wars adopted in the appropriationsbill totals about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billion for the Pentagon'sprogram and $355 million in Energy Department and militaryconstruction money. That falls $900 million short of what Bushrequested for the program in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   Among the other amendments are:   _A measure to bar funds for anti-satellite weapons tests unlessthe administration could certify that the Soviets had engaged intests of their own, had refused to bargain in good faith inlimitations and had blocked international verification efforts.   _A proposal calling for either a reduction of 30,000 Americantroops stationed in Europe or a requirement that U.S. allies footthe bill for those personnel if NATO and the Warsaw Pact nationsfail to reach a conventional arms agreement by Oct. 1, 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
