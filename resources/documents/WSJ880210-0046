But bond trading volume was lackluster once again as dealers remain apprehensive about several government economic reports to be released tomorrow and Friday. Some actively traded Treasury bonds advanced by about three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, the 10th gain in the past 15 sessions.    The yield on some 30-year Treasury bonds fell to about 8.34% from 8.36% Monday and as high as 9 1/8% in mid-January. Corporate and municipal bond yields also drifted lower yesterday. Because of recent declines in many short-term rates, some analysts predict that banks will lower their prime lending rate soon to 8 1/4%. The prime, or base, rate now stands at 8 1/2%.    The Commerce Department tomorrow morning will report retail sales for January. Many analysts expect the report to show little or no change. Of much greater interest, though, will be the department's report Friday morning on the nation's December merchandise trade deficit.    The trade report, which often sends shock waves through all the financial markets, is widely expected to show that the deficit in December was about the same as November's $13.2 billion. But, as usual, estimates vary enormously.    In a survey of 16 analysts polled by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, estimates of the deficit ranged from $11.5 billion to $15 billion. The average estimate was $13.5 billion. Several traders said their strategy going into the trade report will be to hold a neutral position. &quot;It's much too dangerous to gamble on a number like that,&quot; said Jorge L. Gamarci, chairman and chief executive officer of Lloyds Government Securities Corp.    The interest rate on federal funds fell sharply yesterday afternoon, averaging about 6 1/4% for the day. That was down from 6.58% Monday and an average of around 6 3/4% earlier this year. Analysts said yesterday's decline was due largely to technical factors that have temporarily flooded the banking system with reserves. The funds rate decline came even though the Fed acted to drain reserves.    Still, many economists and traders agree the Fed is loosening its credit hold in an effort to bolster the economy. &quot;I think they have already eased a notch,&quot; said Mr. Gamarci of Lloyds. Such a move would be justified by the dollar's recent strength, he said. But he doesn't expect the Fed to go a step further and cut its discount rate. That rate, which is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, is 6%.    The Federal Reserve's policy committee met yesterday and will meet again today to review credit strategy. Fed-watchers say the central bank is moving cautiously, taking very small steps, in order to test the reaction of the bond and foreign-exchange markets.    If the dollar and bond prices continue to hold steady or rise, some analysts say the Fed may take additional steps, such as allowing the federal funds rate to drop to the 6 1/4%-to-6 1/2% range. But if the dollar or bond prices suddenly collapse, as some traders predict, Fed officials could easily reverse direction and push the federal funds rate back to the 6 3/4% level.    Recent declines in the federal funds rate aren't the only signs of an easier Fed policy, says H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. He also points to a rapid acceleration over the past month in the growth of bank reserves. From December to January, the Fed pumped up total bank reserves at an annual rate of about 19%, he said, adding: &quot;We're seeing a thaw in the Fed's yearlong monetary freeze.&quot;    The Fed &quot;has made a decision to move toward a more accommodative stance,&quot; Mr. Heinemann said. &quot;I think we're seeing persistent, aggressive injection of funds into the credit markets.&quot; He expects the Fed to lower its discount rate &quot;sometime this spring&quot; by half a percentage point to 5 1/2%.    Since Aug. 11, when he was sworn in, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &quot;has had little to say in public about monetary policy,&quot; Mr. Heinemann wrote in a recent report. &quot;Other members of the Fed have not been so reticent. Indeed, they have been outspoken. Sometimes we wonder who is in charge.&quot;    Evidence of a Fed credit-easing move is &quot;anything but conclusive,&quot; according to Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc., in San Francisco. Still, he wrote in a report yesterday that &quot;the pattern of Federal Reserve trading desk activity over the past several days suggests that an easing in policy may be in progress.&quot; As a result, &quot;the center of gravity of the Fed funds rate may be in the 6 1/2% area.&quot;    A better test of the Fed's intentions probably won't come until mid-March, Mr. Maude said. At that time, technical factors, notably corporate tax payments, will place &quot;renewed upward pressure&quot; on the federal funds rate. &quot;In the interim, however, the best bet is to assume that the Fed has eased policy.&quot;    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 rose to a price of 105 28/32 from 105 18/32 Monday. Several other long-term issues posted slightly larger gains. The Treasury's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 advanced to 99 28/32 from 99 20/32, while the yield fell to 8.14% from 8.18%.    Rates fell slightly on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month bills declined to 5.59% bid from an average of 5.63% at Monday's government auction. The rate on the latest six-month bills dipped to 5.84% from an average of 5.85% Monday.    Although recent declines in the federal funds rate have greatly encouraged many analysts, they cautioned against reading much into yesterday's unusually sharp drop. Today is the final day of a two-week bank accounting period, and thus banks must settle their reserve positions at the Fed. The funds rate often swings wildly on the last few days of such periods. For example, the funds rate at one point Monday fell to as low as 1 1/2%   Elsewhere in the credit markets, U.S. Trust Co. lowered its broker-loan rate yesterday to 7 1/2% from 7 3/4%. That's the rate on loans backed by stock as collateral.    Municipal bond prices &quot;are fluctuating in a very narrow range with no real sense of direction,&quot; said S.E. Canaday Jr., a vice president at John Nuveen andamp; Co. The bond markets &quot;really are looking for guidance, and the guidance will come Friday when we see a figure on the trade balance.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
