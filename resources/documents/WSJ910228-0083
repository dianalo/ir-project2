During the seesaw session, the 51-member committeeapproved a string of amendments that would have radicallychanged how the nation pays its $200 billion tab to clean upthe Sandamp;L industry. The amendments, attached to a bill to fundthe cleanup, would have shifted part of the burden to stateswith the greatest Sandamp;L losses and would have put spending forthe Sandamp;L cleanup on a pay-as-you-go basis, to avoid interestcosts from government borrowing.</LP><TEXT>   The chaos was a strong sign that the Sandamp;L bailout isreasserting itself as a divisive, unpleasant political issue.Although Congress appears certain to approve some additionalspending for the Sandamp;L cleanup, the amount and the conditionsare unclear.   The Bush administration had requested $78 billion to carrythe Resolution Trust Corp. though fiscal 1991, which endsSept. 30. The legislation would provide $30 billion in newfunds to cover losses at Sandamp;Ls, and another $48 billion intemporary funding would be available, which the RTC expectsto recoup through the sales of assets from failed thrifts.   But the bill was never passed on to the full House, andthe discussion erupted into a partisan brawl. First,Democrats voted overwhelmingly against the stripped-downversion of the bill, which would have provided the Sandamp;Lcleanup agency with the funds. &quot;It's unreasonable for theadministration to ask for $30 billion, for a blank check, andnot expect us to do anything with it,&quot; said Rep. Stephen Neal(D., S.C.).   Then Republicans voted overwhelmingly against the versionof the bill that included the revised funding plans. &quot;Thiswasn't a refunding bill,&quot; groused Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie,the panel's ranking Republican, &quot;it was a social welfaredocument.&quot;   Last night, members weren't certain how or when the bill,or a new version, would be considered. The Senate is to takeup a similar bill this week, but Senate staffers weren'tcertain whether the Senate's version will be consideredtoday.   Members increasingly have found voting for the &quot;Sandamp;Lbailout&quot; difficult to explain on the stump, even though thespending is to protect depositors in thrifts that lost orsquandered their deposits. Moreover, roughly one-third of thecommittee members are new this session, and so have no stakein preserving the Sandamp;L cleanup as produced by the Bushadministration and the prior Congress.   &quot;There is no accountability,&quot; declared Rep. Jim Slattery,a Kansas Democrat who joined the committee this year. Mr.Slattery and Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) helped pushthrough an amendment that would have given the administration$30 billion this year, but would have required either hugetax increases or spending cuts for future Sandamp;L spending.Future Sandamp;L spending would have been subject to thepay-as-you-go provisions of last year's budget agreement,which exempted the huge Sandamp;L outlays. The administration hasalready said that another $33 billion will be required infiscal 1992.   It was only the first of several sweeping amendments thatwere passed earlier in the day, including a complex plan torequire states with the biggest Sandamp;L losses to pay aproportionate share of the cleanup. No state funds have beeninvolved in the cleanup so far. &quot;Those states which areresponsible for creating the savings-and-loan mess shouldhelp pay to clean it up,&quot; said Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa.).   Those sorts of amendments may yet have a reasonable shotat passage, at least in the House. In the prior congressionalsession, a previous incarnation of Mr. Kanjorski's amendmenthad 100 sponsors.   ---   Greg Hitt contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
