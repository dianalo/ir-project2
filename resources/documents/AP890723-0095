The picket was organized by labor consultant Ray Rogers, whosetactics have been controversial in other labor actions.   About 30 flight attendants, who have been on strike since March4, marched along with their children and other family members atthe Logan International Airport terminal.   Eastern and Continental are subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.,whose chairman, Frank Lorenzo, has been the chief target ofcriticism from the stikers.   The picketers said they were particularly targeting passengerswho took advantage of Continental's special $1 fares for childrenunder age 18. The special was in effect for passengers whopurchased tickets for their children before June.   Children walking the picket line carried balloons and signs withsuch messages as ``Lorenzo is a stinker'' and ``Lorenzo is a bozo.''   ``We're here to bring to the attention of the public ourstrike,'' said Dolores Stewart, an Eastern flight attendant for 15years. ``We're here with our children because we have families tooand we know of what we speak.''   The strikers had a permit to picket in front of the terminal andpassengers moved through to the busy ticket counter withoutincident. Many were handed leaflets by Rand Wilson of Rogers' NewYork-based labor consulting firm, the Corporate Campaign. Theleaflets detailed alleged safety and service shortcomings ofContinental and Eastern.   Continental spokesman Ned Walker declined to comment on thepicketing, saying it was primarily a matter between Eastern and thestrikers.   Rogers was hired by the flight attendants union in Miami to helpraise public awareness of the strike. He has stirred up controversyin other strikes for advocating confrontational tactics.   The Corporate Campaign strategy involves focusing publicattention on affiliates and major customers of a company involvedin a strike to try to apply economic pressure to management.   Eastern filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws afterthe strike severely curtailed its operations.</TEXT></DOC>
