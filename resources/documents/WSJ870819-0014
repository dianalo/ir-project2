The asbestos-abatement and insulation concern said recent developments at the site of a large, fixed-price asbestos-removal contract probably will produce a substantial loss. The company, which entered into the contract early last year, said the project won't be completed until 1988.    Brand's chairman, Eugene L. Barnett, declined to identify the contract or give specifics about the problems, but said the contract has been unprofitable for the company since last year.    The company said that ultimately it may be able to recover all or part of the expected loss, but it is recording the full potential loss in the third quarter.    In last year's third quarter, Brand had net income of $4.3 million, or $1 a share, including a $3.2 million tax benefit, on revenue of $27.7 million.    Brand said it expects to be profitable for all of 1987.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Brand shares closed at $26, down $2.75. </TEXT></DOC>
