The justices ruled that a controversy from Minnesota has becomemoot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.   ``We conclude that there is no longer any live controversy onthe issue of whether the (challenged) statute is constitutional asit applies to prize lists, and that this appeal is moot,'' thecourt said in an unsigned opinion.   Justices Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall cast dissentingvotes but did not explain why.   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a brief dissenting opinion, saidthe court should have reversed _ not merely set aside _ a federaljudge's ruling that had upheld the publishing ban.   The Minnesota Newspaper Association originally challenged apostal law that bars newspapers from carrying advertisements andprize lists.   Postal laws currently prohibit use of the mails to disseminateinformation about any lottery not run by a state. Since nearly allnewspapers rely on the mail for at least a portion of theirdistribution, the postal laws apply to them.   But after the justices agreed last October to study the case,Congress enacted a new law, to take effect in May 1990, droppingthe ban on advertising for private lotteries. The newspaperassociation and the government agreed to drop that part of the case.   Government lawyers then told the justices that the existing banon publishing prize winners will not be enforced.   The dispute had focused on lotteries and other gaming, such asbingo and raffles, sponsored by non-profit, charitableorganizations and others.   Lawyers for the Minnesota newspapers said, ``The revenuegenerated by charitable gaming is very substantial. In Minnesotaalone it appears to exceed $200 million per year.''   U.S. District Judge Paul A. Magnuson upheld the ban on lotteryadvertising even though he acknowledged that the ads are aconstitutionally protected form of commercial speech. The newspaperassociation appealed.   The judge, however, ruled that newspapers cannot be barred fromrunning lists of private lottery winners unless such lists arefound in advertisements. The government had appealed that part ofhis ruling.   The case is Frank vs. Minnesota Newspaper Association, 87-1956.</TEXT></DOC>
