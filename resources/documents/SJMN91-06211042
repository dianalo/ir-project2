Law' image . . . and I was struck that everybody was sonormal.&quot;;    Well, almost everyone, she said.;    &quot;Phil took me over to SantaCruz, and I said, 'Yeah! This is it, the beach, the bodies!' I thought thewhole place would be like that . . . but it's really not what it's portrayedto be on TV.&quot;;    She hopes to go on for her doctoral degree, but says thatwill depend on getting additional scholarships, since her family has a modestincome.;    In fact, she said, both her parents were laid off from theirgovernment jobs when she was in high school, and the family has gotten bysince on government assistance and a small salary her mother earns as a chef.;   It's not an uncommon situation in Ireland, she said, where the economy isterrible, jobs are scarce and most young people with talent or education leaveto find employment and a better life elsewhere in Europe or the UnitedStates.;    She blames the government and hundreds of years of oppression atthe hands of the English for Ireland's woes.;    Not the least of which, shesays, is the persistent violence between Catholics and Protestants in NorthernIreland.;    &quot;It's embarrassing, but I've never even formed opinions aboutit,&quot; she said. &quot;I try not to have opinions about it; I'm scared. It's a very,very dangerous topic to talk about at home. It's safer to steer clear of it.&quot;;   As a psychologist, some aspects of American culture concern Farragher.;   Topping her list is Americans' obsession with food, their stomachs andfitness. She believes those priorities explain why so many Americans,including children, have eating disorders.;    She also marvels at how quicklykids become sexually aware here, compared to her little town in Ireland.;   And she said she thinks the obsession with self-esteem can create arrogantkids who believe they must be best in everything.;    And while she sees prosand cons in Irish and American child rearing, she sees one distinct result ofthe American way.;    &quot;No wonder there are so many therapists doing wellhere,&quot; she said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK FOLEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910729  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  661  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 29, 199100211042,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
