SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meteorologists know that a stalled highpressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought inMiddle America, but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomenaoccurred and when they might end.   In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry airgradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwisepattern around the center.   It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist,counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thusrain.   As followers of newspaper weather maps and broadcast reportsknow, America's changing weather pattern generally consists of aseries of highs and lows _ anticyclones and cyclones _ marchingacross the country from west to east.   That pattern is stalled, has been for a month or more, and islikely to stay stalled, according to Donald L. Gilman, head of theLong-Range Predictions Group at the National Weather Service.   In normal times, the highs and lows, and their accompanyingweather fronts, are steered across the nation by strong,high-altitude winds known as the jet stream.   Tearing across the nation's middle and southern sections inwinter, these winds pull along the major storms that many peopledread.   When warm summer weather comes, the jet stream usually edges tothe north. There, it brings in moisture from the Pacific Northwest,while at the same time helping pull storms north into the nation'smiddle from the Gulf of Mexico.   Not so this year, Gilman said.   The jet stream has split in two. One stream is sweeping to thenorth in Canada, steering Pacific storms north of the Farm Belt.The second is moving across just south of the United States,blocking gulf storms from coming north.   And trapped in the middle is that dismally warm and sunnyanticyclone.   This split is ``not a rare event, if you define rare assomething that almost never happens. But it's not frequenteither,'' said Robert Livezey, an associate of Gilman's at thefederal Climate Analysis Center.   Can he say why it occurs?   ``Unfortunately not. The processes which lead to this sort ofevent aren't well understood right now,'' Livezey said.   It may simply be part of the natural variability of theatmosphere, he said. At any rate, the meteorologists aren't readyto attribute it to any specific cause.   ``That's one of the problems in dynamic meteorology that we'restill working on. Figuring out how (these patterns occur) is one ofthe keys to long-range forecasting,'' said Paul Sabol of theClimate Analysis Center.   Even determining whether the high caused the jet stream tosplit, or the split jet stream trapped the high, is difficult,Livezey said.   At any rate, the two work together.   The high blocks the movement of storms into the Farm Belt whilethe jet stream guides them around it.   Once that pattern starts, the hot, dry weather tends to worsenand reinforce itself, said Vernon E. Kousky, also of the ClimateAnalysis Center.   ``Everybody has felt the cooling sensation when water evaporatesafter they get out of the ocean or a pool,'' he explained.   In the same way, ``If you have wet ground, some of the solarradiation is used to evaporate water, the area is kept cooler andthis is good for man and plants as well.''   The drought, however, has reduced ground moisture. Without thecooling of evaporation, and the clouds that the evaporated watermight eventually form, the weather can get hotter and hotter.   ``You might call it a drought feedback mechanism, it tends toperpetuate on itself,'' Kousky said.   When it will end, no one was willing to say.   ``There is no normal lifetime of a drought. They can last fromseveral months to years,'' the National Weather Service noted in astatement on the drought.   ``Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the drought's end, itsgeographic spread, or changes in severity, cannot be made today,''the service said.   In his long-range forecast, Gilman called for the currentweather pattern to continue, at least through July. The mostintense focus of the drought may drift to the east and south in thenext three months, he said.   But the pattern of rainfall behind it will be spotty, he said,with only the western parts of the Great Plains likely to see muchincrease in rain through the end of September. Whether that will bein time to save threatened crops remains to be seen.</TEXT></DOC>
