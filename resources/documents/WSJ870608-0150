The maker of engine-cooling equipment said its sales for the year are expected to be 5% to 10% higher than the $349 million figure last year.    Modine said the automotive replacement parts market is expected to increase sales 35% as its consolidated acquisitions begin to add to the improving business from other operations. The company added that its heating-division sales are expected to be up about 5%.    The company said in addition to the effect of higher sales, it will benefit, by several percentage points, from tax-rate reductions resulting from the new income tax act. </TEXT></DOC>
