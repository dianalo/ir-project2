KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate voted Thursday night to open thedoor to supplying military aid to the non-communist resistanceforces in Cambodia.   By a vote of 59-39, it adopted an amendment by Sen. CharlesRobb, D-Va., opening the way for President Bush to make lethal aidavailable to the resistance forces allied with Cambodia's PrinceNorodom Sihanouk in order to stiffen their ability to resist.   The amendment is to a $4.6 billion State Departmentauthorization bill.   The Senate earlier voted 97-1 for a more general amendment thatheld out the promise of substantial aid to a new Cambodiangovernment, which is ``determined to prevent the return to power ofthe Khmer Rouge.''   Robb and other supporters of his amendment said it was essentialto supply lethal aid because the United States has a moralimperative to bar the return of the Khmer Rouge.   That left-wing faction is blamed for the killing of more than 1million Cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970's.   Opponents of the Robb amendment said opening the door to aidputs the United States ``on a slippery slope'' in Southeast Asiasimilar to the development of its involvement in the Vietnam war.   The amendment, similar to one already approved by the House,does not specify the dollar amount of military aid or indicate whatkinds of weapons would be supplied.   Robb said it does not directly authorize military aid but doesgive the President the ``flexibility'' to ask authorization for itat a later time.   The Senate's action comes at a time when negotiations areopening in Paris on the future of Cambodia after the announcedSept. 30 withdrawal of the occupying Vietnamese army.   ``The administration in my judgment needs that flexibility,''Robb said. ``By aiding the non-communist resistance we advance theprospects for a successful outcome in Paris. But if we do nothingonly heighten the prospects for a bloody civil war and the returnof the Khmer Rouge.''   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., told the Senate: ``Militaryaid to the so-called non-communist resistance would derail afast-moving peace process that promises real hope.''   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., appealed in vain for the Senate totake more time to consider the issue.   ``The president of the United States has not asked for onedollar in military aid,'' he said. ``I may vote for military aidwhen the president makes a request for it, when he says, this iswhat we need, this is why we need it.''   ``I say we've got time to consider this issue,'' Byrd said. ``Wedon't have to vote for it at this hour of the night.''   ``I stood on this floor when we slid into the war in Vietnam,''Byrd said. ``I think we should let history give us some guidancebefore we take sudden action here and write a blank check for thepresident.''   Other senators disagreed and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-N.J.,called the Robb approach ``measured involvement.''   ``This is our responsibility lest we be accused of forgettingthe lessons of the first Asian holocaust,'' Lieberman said. ``Letus do what is required to keep a second one from occurring.''</TEXT></DOC>
