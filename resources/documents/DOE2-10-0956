<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0956 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computational design for the principal equipment involved in the absorptionand desorption sections of a heavy water production plant (Girdler-sulphidemethod) is described. the programs were developed in FORTRAN. A detailleddescription of transport equations for the desorption tower, which areapplicable for the absorption one is included. The optimization criteriaused for the equipment design were mainly economic; the results wereobtained under the optimal conditions for the towers. The programs maybe used in the long term, for the simulation of the absorption and desorptionsections together with the isotopic exchange sectionts</TEXT></DOC>
