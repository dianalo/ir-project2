U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell took the action, and gaveOliver L. North and two of his co-defendants a tongue-lashing,because they disobeyed his order establishing procedures for thehearing.   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was allowed to testify,and he told the court of an elaborate procedure he established sothat his entire staff would avoid exposure to the immunizedtestimony, especially from news reports.   Walsh is unable to use immunized congressional testimony by thedefendants to prosecute them, unless perjury is committed.   Testifying with immunity during the Iran-Contra hearings wereNorth, a former National Security Council staff member;his one-timeboss, former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter; andbusinessman Albert Hakim. The fourth defendant, retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, testified without immunity.   Gesell said the three immunized defendants ``ignored'' his orderthat they present a single grand jury witness who might testifythat his grand jury testimony was influenced by the immunizedcongressional testimony.   Instead, lawyers for the three immunized defendants sought topresent three witnesses, and issued subpoenas for Walsh and eightmembers of his staff to testify at the hearing. Gesell, who hadordered that only Walsh need testify, canceled the subpoenas lastweek.   ``Since the defendants did not comply, they won't be allowed topresent witnesses,'' he said today when the hearing began.   ``It's not unusual that defendants make decisions that they arenot going to cooperate with the court. That's their right. We willproceed whether we have confrontation and name-calling or not.''   During the hearing, special independent counsel Herbert J.Stern, who is handling the immunity question, introduced intoevidence memos written or ordered by Walsh, which instructed hisstaff to avoid exposure to the immunized testimony and to otherinformation on the defendants.   The memos also included instructions to grand jury witnesses andgrand jurors to avoid such exposure, especially through newsarticles or broadcasts.   The defendants in the case are charged with conspiring to use alawful presidential order permitting the sale of arms to Iran as aspringboard to illegal actions, including supplying assistance tothe Nicaraguan Contras when such aid was banned.</TEXT></DOC>
