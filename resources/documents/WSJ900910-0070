He has now lost the two major cases to reach theappeals court, with more legal defeats likely soon.Independent counsel Walsh -- independent, that is, fromexperienced prosecutors at the Justice Department -- hasbecome a multimillion-dollar legal disaster area.   Mr. Walsh was especially busy last week. He asked the fullappeals court in Washington to review the appeals opinionthat seems likely to reverse all of Oliver North'sconvictions. Mr. Walsh does not want to accept that heviolated the Constitution when he used evidence from Mr.North's coerced testimony to Congress, despite the clear rulethat such evidence can't be used at trial. The same mistakesprobably will also reverse John Poindexter's conviction.</LP><TEXT>   Part of Mr. Walsh's enormous prosecuting team is inBaltimore trying a former CIA official, Thomas Clines. Thiscase may also be headed for a fall. The charges against Mr.Clines, an Iran-Contra middleman, have nothing to do with theoriginal allegations of supposedly illegal arms trades or thediversion of money from the Iranians. Instead, Mr. Walshaccuses him of failing to report all taxes owed on his covertincome.   There are many problems with this case, includingprecisely how are private contractors, asked by governmentofficials to play middlemen roles, supposed to account forsecret income on their tax returns. Taxes owed surely must bepaid, but Mr. Walsh's lead witness, Richard Secord, shockedthe proceedings when he said the prosecution case rests onevidence that had somehow been falsified.   What especially piqued our interest in this case, however,was that Mr. Walsh brought it as a tax case. Federal criminaltax cases are fewer than 1,500 a year. There is strictoversight because of the real danger of selective taxprosecution.   Indeed, the Justice Department Guidelines for U.S.Attorneys requires prosecutors to get prior approval for anycriminal tax case from the tax division of Justice. U.S.Attorneys Manual Section 6-4.122 says even independentcounsel must not bring an indictment &quot;without specific priorauthorization of the Tax Division.&quot;   Did Mr. Walsh get approval from Justice before indictingMr. Clines? When we asked, Mr. Walsh's press spokespersonrefused to comment. Justice spokesmen, however, say that Mr.Walsh did not consult the department before bringing any ofthe Iran-Contra cases. In other words, Mr. Walsh apparentlydid not follow Justice rules before charging Mr. Clines. Thiscould be a ground for an appeal from any conviction.   This was not the first time Mr. Walsh ignored Justiceguidelines that apply even to independent counsel. Last weekhe got confirmation from a federal appeals court that hiscase against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez was an abusefrom day one.   He indicted Mr. Fernandez, the former agency chief inCosta Rica, for giving misleading statements about his rolein Iran-Contra. The supposed misstatements about who did whatto help the Contras were not under oath or part of anytranscript, but Mr. Walsh had an even bigger problem. To showthat his statements were true, Mr. Fernandez needed to citesome 100,000 classified documents.   Mr. Walsh ignored the Justice Department rule thatprosecutors considering indictments in cases involvingclassified material must first consult with the intelligenceagencies. Instead, Mr. Walsh brought the indictment, thenwhen intelligence officials screamed about the sources andmethods that would leak if there was a trial, he dismissedthis as &quot;fictional secrets&quot; and &quot;artificial deniability.&quot;   Mr. Walsh, no national-security expert, was wrong. TrialJudge Claude Hilton agreed with a classified filing by threetop intelligence officials who warned of &quot;exceptionally gravedamage&quot; if these secrets got out. Last week a unanimousappeals court agreed that there can be no trial. The detailedopinion by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson itself was full ofasterisks marking sensitive material, as in &quot;although theprogram and the `may not have been as closely tied as ,' theywere still relevant to the charges against Fernandez and thuswere admissible.&quot;   The criminalization of policy differences known asIran-Contra has been a flop. President Reagan was notimpeached, Nicaragua is inching toward freedom and Iranremains in the feudal era. At home, we have learned thatinstitutional pressures on congressionally createdindependent counsel have forced many of them to push theouter envelope of prosecutorial behavior. Mr. Walsh has leftno doubt that his targets were prosecuted to the extent thelaw allows, and as we now know even beyond.   Enough is enough. There is a long rap sheet against Mr.Walsh: He violated immunity rules in the North and Poindextercases; violated tax rules in the Clines case; violatedclassified information rules in the Fernandez case. How muchmore evidence does President Bush need before deciding it'stime to thank him for his services and send Mr. Walsh home?</TEXT></DOC>
