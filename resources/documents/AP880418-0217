Some Kuwaitis also see it as vital to the survival of theircountry, which is threatened by a 7{-year-old war between Iran andIraq that rages only 50 miles to the north. Iran accuses Kuwait ofaiding Iraq in the war and has attacked its main oil-exportterminal.   ``I think Kuwait has set an example that you never, evernegotiate with terrorists,'' said Faisal Al-Marzouk, editor of thenewspaper Al-Anbaa.   ``I think it's unfortunate that the United States, West Germany,France have always wanted to negotiate the release of hostages heldin Lebanon,'' he said in an interview.   For two weeks this land of about 1.7 million residents, only 40percent of whom are citizens, has rejected the demands of hijackerswho seized the Boeing 747 on April 5. It now is at the airport inAlgiers.   The gunmen want Kuwait to free 17 pro-Iranians convicted ofbombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983 in return for theplane and about 35 hostages still held on it, including threemembers of Kuwait's royal family. They have killed two Kuwaitipassengers and have said they would massacre the rest.   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, ordered financialaid Monday for the families of the two men slain by the hijackers.   A government statment said the emir ordered that all outstandingdebts of the two victims and their families be written off and thatthe full salaries of the slain men be paid to their families.   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a visiting Kuwaiti soccer teamoffered to replace the hostages.   Malaysia's Bernama news agency said the 52-member team,competing for the Asian Cup, released a statement saying themembers would ``sacrifice themselves'' for their country.   It reported the Kuwaiti team's president, Sheikh Fahad Al-AhmadAl-Jabar Al-Sabah, a younger brother of the emir, said the soccerplayers were ready to depart for Algeria.   A senior Western diplomat said many Kuwaitis view the hijackingas an affront.   ``The Kuwaitis aren't going to back down. It's a matter ofnational pride,'' said another with extensive official contacts.   Al-Marzouk, the editor, said: ``Even if they kill all thehostages on the plane, we'll never, ever release the killers whoare here in Kuwait.''   Several previous attempts have been made to force the release ofthe 17 prisoners, who were convicted in 1984. Three are sentencedto death.   Lebanese extremists believed related to some of the 17 hijackeda Kuwait Airways jetliner in December 1984 on a flight from Dubaito Karachi, Pakistan, and force it to Tehran. The five-day ordealended when Iranian security men entered the plane in disguise andsurprised the hijackers. Two of the four Americans on board werekilled by the terrorists.   Release of the imprisoned bombers also has been set as acondition for freeing American hostages held by Moslem extremistsin Lebanon.   Kuwait even refused to grant Church of England envoy Terry Waitea visa in 1985 when he asked to come and discuss his efforts tofree foreign hostages. Waite disappeared in Beirut in January 1987and is believed held hostage.   U.S. officials who sold weapons to Iran to try to free theAmericans are said to have pressed Kuwait briefly, butunsuccessfully, to release the prisoners.   Diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited severalreasons for Kuwait's hard line:   _ As a rich but weak country close to powerful and often hostileneighbors, it cannot afford to become a target of blackmail.   _ Kuwaiti officials have expressed fear that, ``if they knuckledunder ... they would put every civilized country at risk.''   _ Fear that bowing to the hijackers would create conflict inKuwait between the majority Sunni and minority Shiite Moslem sects.Kuwait is ruled by Sunnis but many of its Shiite minority areethnic Iranians, and Iran is predominantly Shiite.   ``They're just not going to let their country go the way ofLebanon,'' which has been ravaged by civil war since 1975, aEuropean diplomat said.</TEXT></DOC>
