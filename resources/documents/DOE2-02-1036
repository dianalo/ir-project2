<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-1036 </DOCNO><TEXT>The inelastic scattering of /sup 20/Ne on /sup 90/Zr and /sup 208/Pb hasbeen studied at 500 and 600 MeV incident energies. High statistics spectrawere measured at the grazing angle. For each target, spectra at the twoincident energies were compared by means of cross correlation analysis.Structures were observed in the inelastic spectra, but they appearedat different excitation energies at the two beam energies and thereforecannot be identified with high-excitation energy states of the targetnuclei in contradiction to the results of previous experiments. Ratherthey arise from the decay of discrete unbound states in the projectile-likenuclei which were excited by a one-nucleon-transfer reaction. In particular,the structures observed in the transfer-evaporation continuum of the/sup 20/Ne+ /sup 208/Pb spectra appear to be mainly due to neutron emissionfrom known discrete unbound states in /sup 21/Ne. A relatively low upperlimit is given for the production cross section of multiphonon statesin these systems.</TEXT></DOC>
