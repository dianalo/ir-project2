The nation's fifth-largest investment firm said Tuesday it willtry to sell the brokerage unit, which accounts for about 10 percentof Drexel's business, to another brokerage house.   Drexel said it also is abandoning its business in municipalsecurities, over-the-counter stocks, and research and transactionsin non-U.S. securities. The restructuring will cut Drexel's workforce by about a third.   The move comes five days after Drexel agreed to tight federaloversight for three years in settling civil fraud charges with theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph announced therestructuring over the firm's public address system, calling theverdict by its board of directors last weekend ``the onlyeconomically viable solution.''   He said the move was made to so Drexel could deal with the``current realities'' at the firm, implying the government's nearlythree-year investigation of alleged securities abuses, manyinvolving the Milken's dealings with jailed inside trader IvanBoesky.   ``The decision was made in view of the anticipated inability togrow the retail business to an economically viable size in light ofongoing adverse publicity ...,'' Drexel said in a statement.   The SEC pact clears the way for settlement of criminal fraudcharges with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Drexel hasagreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650million to avoid a massive racketeering indictment.   A rash of civil lawsuits over Drexel's activities, possiblynumbering in the thousands, now are expected to be filed inindividual states. In addition, congressional officials haveindicated they plan further investigations into Drexel.   The continued investigations, along with the possiblehigh-visibility trial of former Drexel junk-bond financier MichaelMilken, means the firm will remain in a negative spotlight for sometime.   ``It's a kind of situation that's very sensitive as far asretail clients are concerned,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analystBrenda Davis McCoy.   In its statement, Drexel cited ``the depressed state of thesecurities industry, the anticipated lack of participation byindividual investors'' and increased competition from commercialbanks in retail brokerage.   Drexel, which does not release earnings or other detailedfinancial data, said it has total capital of about $2 billion andnet equity capital of about half that.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to give details on theextent of the retail business decline, but said: ``It was justgetting difficult. Indeed, the numbers were going in the otherdirection.''   After a board meeting Tuesday, Drexel said it notified about 10other Wall Street firms about peddling the division. It said ithopes to have bids by Saturday and a sale completed by early nextweek.   Drexel's statement said the firm would concentrate on high-yieldjunk bonds, government securities, corporate finance, institutionalfixed income activities, mortgage-backed securities, arbitrage andcommodities.   Business on Wall Street has been sluggish because of highinterest rates, continued investor distrust following the October1987 market crash, and a severe decline in mergers andacquisitions. Several firms announced weak first-quarter profits inthe last week.   Drexel itself has shrunk from a high of about 10,000 employeesworldwide to 9,100 today. The 10 percent payroll decline is aboutaverage for Wall Street firms, most of which laid off hundreds ofemployees after the crash.   The retail brokerage unit has lost about 200 brokers from a highof 1,300. It now has about 1,100 brokers and another 1,200employees. Drexel declined to say how many people would be laid offin the restructuring.   ``Individuals prefer money market instruments, savings accountsto speculation or even investments,'' said James Hanbury ofWertheim Schroder Inc. ``It's cyclical. We're in a down cycle.''   Joseph named Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. andPaineWebber as possible buyers. Shearson spokesman Steve Fagan saidhis firm is not interested in the unit.   Because of the planned personnel reduction, Drexel also said ithad informed the city of New York that it was scrapping plans tobuild new Manhattan offices.</TEXT></DOC>
