Meanwhile, in secondary markets Friday, fixed-coupon Eurodollar bonds rose 1/4 point to 3/8 point on the strength of U.S. Treasurys and a surge in the dollar.    The World Bank's offering of $300 million of 9%, 10-year bonds Friday was even more closely watched than most of the bank's launches, as the strongest Eurobond borrower introduced an issue with a very difficult maturity.    The recent volatility in long maturities has turned numerous launches of issues dated longer than five years into exercises in frustration. However, the World Bank issue seemed to find good demand -- although it wasn't a sellout, with a number of orders merely representing a switch from seasoned bonds into the new issue, reportedly to pick up about 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.    After a long absence, investors cautiously have been returning to top names in Eurodollar bonds recently. Still, that&quot; doesn't mean the 10-year part of the Eurodollar bond market now is open to any borrower,&quot; said a banker involved in the syndications group.    &quot;Investors have be come fairly ruthless about the criteria for what they will accept,&quot; the banker said.    Meanwhile, the rising price of oil prompted another borrower to test the Swiss franc foreign market's appetite for bonds with warrants to buy oil, as Montedison's launched 4 7/8% bonds due in 1994 with oil warrants.    The third such issue in eight days, the bonds were priced at 122 by Morgan Stanley S.A. Reaction appeared mixed.    Previously, Kredietbank International Finance N.V. offered 3% notes due 1992 at 100.5 through Goldman Sachs Finanz AG. The other issues was pulled after its launch.    Separately Friday, Mesa L.P. issued as much as 200 million Swiss francs ($131 million) of 5 1/2% callable bonds due in 1992 at par, through S.G. Warburg Soditic S.A. </TEXT></DOC>
