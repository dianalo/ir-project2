Until now, scientists have predicted global warming would bebased largely on the rising levels of carbon dioxide and otheratmospheric gases produced by human activities, such as the burningof fossil fuels and logging of forests.   Many say that such warming, left unchecked, could drasticallyalter worldwide weather patterns and increase polar-ice melting,thereby raising the sea level and flooding coastal regions.   That's bad enough, but when natural responses to warming areconsidered, the situation looks even grimmer, said Daniel Lashof, aformer Environmental Protection Agency scientist now working for theNatural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.   ``All the models are modeling a dead Earth,'' Lashof said. ``Whenyou look at a live Earth, you get a different answer.''   Researchers are just starting to study how global warming maykill off forests and prompt the release of methane from oceansediments, events that in turn could heat up the Earth even more.   Lashof predicted that these responses and other natural``feedback'' could as much as double the amount of global warming,already forecast by current studies to range from 2 to 10 degreesover the next century.   His predictions were supported by others at the conference onglobal warming concluding this weekend at actor-filmmaker RobertRedford's Sundance resort in central Utah.   Studies supporting Lashof's conclusions ``are accumulating on analmost day-by-day basis,'' said George Woodwell, director of theWoods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts.   ``If the biotic effects that appear to be materializing are real,they have the potential for speeding the process of warmingappreciably,'' Woodwell said.   Global warming theories hinge on the ``greenhouse effect,'' inwhich certain gases in the atmosphere block incoming solar heat fromescaping back out to space.   Those gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, have always beenpresent and are kept in equilibrium by natural processes. The oceansabsorb carbon dioxide, for example, as do trees, which store carbonin trunks, branches and roots.   But industrial societies are pumping carbon dioxide into theatmosphere at much-elevated rates, as well as adding new``greenhouse gases'' such as chlorofluorocarbons.   Research has so far concentrated on measuring and then reducingthese manmade gases, but natural processes that occur as the globeheats up are important as well.   An example: Rising temperatures could destroy entire forests, asit gets too hot for tree species adapted to the local climate. ``Thegrowth rate of trees is very temperature-dependent. If they get toohot or too cold, they don't grow well,'' said Daniel Botkin, abiology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara.   The scrub brush that follows would not store as much carbon,Botkin said. And it would take decades for other, moreheat-resistant trees to migrate in from the south, he said.   ``Trees may be left behind,'' he said. ``They can't keep up withthe climate change. You'd get a pulse of carbon from those forests.''   Another natural response to global warming could involve methanetrapped in offshore ocean sediments, Lashof said. If the atmospherewarms, so will the oceans, releasing some of that methane into theair.   A global warming-induced shift of forests to the north also couldheat things up further by decreasing the amount of light reflected,Lashof said. Trees of the northern boreal forest absorb more heatthan the snowy tundra.   But that effect could be counteracted elsewhere by greater lightreflected from the spreading of grassland and desert areas, he said.   Lashof concedes that other natural processes may slow the rate ofglobal warming, not increase it.   One recent study suggests, for example, that warming couldincrease the amount of sun-blocking clouds, producing a coolingeffect.   But Lashof, though conceding his model depends on loose estimatesfor many calculations, believes the net effect of the Earth'sresponses would speed global warming.   Woodwell recommended a sharp reduction in the use of fossil fuelsas the best way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. Stopping thedestruction of forests and planting new ones also could help, hesaid.   Lashof said all is not bleak, despite the gloomy predictions.Humans are causing global warming, but it appears they also can stopit _ if they act in time. ``When you take a look at the problem, youfind there is a lot you can do about it,'' Lashof said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT></DOC>
