The consortium has asked bidders for EFA contracts to certify that there aren't any resale restrictions on the equipment they seek to sell, according to companies familiar with the bidding terms. The U.S. government routinely puts such re-export restraints on advanced defense gear, trying to keep the equipment from reaching countries hostile to the U.S.    Eurofighter G.m.b.H., the Munich-based EFA consortium, was formed last year by Britain, Italy, Spain and West Germany, and the four nations jointly will work on the project. Their armed forces are expected to buy between 700 and 800 aircraft, delivered beginning in 1995. The consortium's leading concerns, including British Aerospace PLC and Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Bloehm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, view export sales as vital for achieving adequate profits.    Eurofighter's tough equipment stance illustrates the increasing tension between the U.S. and Western Europe over Washington's efforts to keep sensitive American technology out of unfriendly hands. The European position also suggests a deepening protectionist attitude toward U.S. defense goods. Many of the planes the EFA will replace are aging U.S.-designed aircraft.    Pentagon officials confirmed yesterday that a strongly worded letter was sent last month by Eleanor Spector, deputy assistant defense secretary for procurement, to her counterparts in the European countries in the Eurofighter project. The letter apparently was taken by the Europeans as a U.S. threat to tighten military technology transfer from the U.S. on other projects if the Europeans didn't allow U.S. firms to participate in the European fighter.    But a Pentagon spokesman told Reuters news agency: &quot;Whatever the intent of the {earlier} letter, we want to clarify the matter. It is not our policy to threaten or penalize our friends in the consortium.&quot;    Europeans reacted angrily last month when the U.S. asked to audit European importers of American technology to assure there is no re-export to the Soviet bloc. The British government, which has been particularly upset by U.S. export policy, declared last week that its recent purchase of early-warning aircraft from Boeing Co. was &quot;free from acceptance by the U.K. government that U.S. laws can be used to encroach on U.K. sovereignty.&quot;    Hughes Aircraft, a General Motors Corp. division, fears that the EFA's re-export demand will prevent it from supplying the fighter aircraft's radar system. Bids for the radar contract, the first major one tendered by Eurofighter, are due this month. The radar contract is valued at about $1 billion, European defense contractors say.    Hughes has joined a private consortium, led by AEG AG of West Germany, aimed at building the radar in Europe under license from Hughes. U.S.-designed radar and other gear are being used heavily in the first major cooperative European warplane, the Tornado.    Buck Bender, marketing director for Hughes's radar division, says he doesn't expect the company to get the necessary clearance from Washington to make the pledge that Eurofighter wants. He says Hughes is negotiating with the U.S. Defense Department so it can promise that there won't be any re-export restraints for EFA sales to about 20 countries, including European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    But, he adds, he isn't hopeful that the assurances Hughes can give will satisfy the Eurofighter group.    U.S. defense contractors view the radar contract as a test case that will decide whether they have any role in the Eurofighter program, according to Mr. Bender. &quot;It's going to be very difficult for them (the consortium) to build an aircraft with up-to-date avionics without U.S. equipment,&quot; the Hughes executive says.    Gary Willox, Eurofighter's general manager, declines to discuss the bidding terms for the radar, except to say that any re-export restraints would    Privately, however, Eurofighter officials take a harderline. &quot;They're making it plain they aren't going to accept acontract with restrictions on resale,&quot; says an official atone British company, who asked not to be named. Adds asalesman at a U.S. electronics concern in Britain, &quot;There's ageneral edict that no U.S. equipment will be used unless it'sabsolutely necessary.&quot;   A chief Hughes competitor for the EFA radar contract is a European group that would supply radar designed by Ferranti PLC of Britain. One British defense industry official familiar with both systems says the West German air force prefers the Hughes radar. West Germany already uses a version of it in other aircraft. But there has been political pressure to keep the contract solely European, the official adds. </TEXT></DOC>
