The normalized intensity is constantfor excitation in the first two electronic absorption bands and increasessignificantly for excitation in the third absorption band. This increasein fluorescent quantum yield is explained as a result of reduced non-radiativetransitions due to a decrease in the van der Waals interactions betweenthe molecules at the surface of the liquid, and also by a decrease inthe efficiency of excimer formation there. With increasing energy ofthe exciting photon photoelectrons are released which produce secondaryexcitations and hence cause the observed increase in fluorescent yield.</TEXT></DOC>
