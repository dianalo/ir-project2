That exceeds the mark of about 201 million decimal placesproduced last year in Japan, David Chudnovsky of Columbia Universitysaid Thursday.   Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.The infinite string of digits begins with 3.14159, and contains noobvious pattern.   The newly calculated number would stretch for 600 miles ifprinted, Columbia University said.   Chudnovsky and his brother Gregory, associate research scientistsat Columbia, came up with the number after devising a new algorithm,which is a series of mathematical steps.   The algorithm lets researchers calculate more and more decimalplaces for pi by simply adding to an existing string, rather thanhaving to start from scratch, Chudnovsky said.   It also has a self-correcting feature that can check whether thepi calculation is on the right track while the calculation is inprogress, he said.   The researchers checked their calculation by running thealgorithm through two supercomputers with different hardware andsoftware, Chudnovsky said. When the results were compared,``everything perfectly fitted together.''   So what good is knowing this number?   ``We can use it as a very stringent test for testing theperformance of hardware and software,'' said Chudnovsky, who calledpi calculations ``the ultimate stress test.''   And by calculating pi out to great lengths, researchers caninvestigate whether the string of digits is random or contains somehidden pattern, he said.   ``We sort of see more of the tail of the dragon,'' he said.   The new work is to be presented next week at a conference oncomputers and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.   Peter Borwein, associate professor of mathematics at DalhousieUniversity in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, said the new workappears to be a record.   Tackling the digits of pi ``has become something of a benchmarkin computational sophistication,'' he said in a telephone interview.   ``It seems like since there have been computers, people have beenusing them to compute the digits of pi.''</TEXT></DOC>
