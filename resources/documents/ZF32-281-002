Aside from retarding improvement in a fixed environment, lackof diversity also leaves us vulnerable to external change -- everything fromcomputer viruses to AIDS, global weather changes and the arrival of moreefficient competitors.andP;  From a global perspective, diversity -- the fact that&quot;we&quot; included both small and large, both warm-blooded and coldblooded,animals -- enabled us, the vertebrates, to survive in the face of whateverkilled off the dinosaurs.andP;  Diversity leads to adaptability, because it offersa range of solutions.andM;In recent days, the Internet virus attacked (with exceptions) only machinesrunning BSD 4.3 -- compelling testimony for why we don't want everyone usingthe same system.andP;  If you want to get worried, perhaps AIDS is the factor thatwill prove how similar all humans are.andP;  Mammals may survive, but thisparticular species may not.andP;  Similarly, the name UNIX may survive, but theparticular variants espoused by OSF or UNIX International may not.andP;  (And itmay keep the name but little else.) On the other hand, it's nice to have acouple to choose from, and OS/2 is spurring both of them along from outside.andM;Finally, change or no, you don't want each element of a system to have thesame goals and behavior: For example, it's fine to have newsletter writerscompeting to be better, but if everyone were a newsletter writer therewouldn't be much for them to write about, no matter how finely competitionhoned their skills.andP;  Likewise, in a software system, you want specializedmodules for specific tasks that can be called as needed.andP;  And you may wantmodules optimized for speed or for memory conservation, to be used as theavailability of resources warrants.andM;Diversity and SAAandM;From this perspective, IBM may be moving in the wrong direction with SAA.andO;Rather than let diversity flourish, it's attempting to obliterate thedifferences among its three broad product lines, with the result that none ofthem is optimized for any particular environment.andP;  And underlying it all,there's still the notion of the host controlling everything.andP;  IBM's notion ofcooperative processing is a PC talking to a mainframe, rather than twoconsenting PCs.andM;The real issue isn't to be able to run all software elements everywhere, asSAA would have it, but to allow all software elements to talk to one another.andO;That is, messages should travel freely, but they should be executeddifferently by different recipients.andP;  Objects with common protocols may havedifferent internal implementations, with no one the wiser.andM;The correct balance (for now) is probably a variety of operating environmentsconnected by a variety of communications protocols and even some facilitiessuch as object protocols.andP;  The Open Software Foundation, for example, iscurrently soliciting technology-for a distributed computing environment (page16).andP;  This would not legislate the structure of the individual elements, andin fact could be the most useful part of the OSF suite, long after the localstuff -- UNIX or whatever sits at an individual desktop -is gone.andP;  While thecommunications stuff itself could also improve, in this context it's theenvironment rather than the self-organizing system itself.andM;Diversity in businessandM;The same principles can be applied to companies themselves.andP;  Competition anddiversity are good -- but at the right level: between companies not withinthem.andP;  This leads ineluctably to the conclusion that a company is frequentlybetter off funding a start-up than taking on an innovative, counter-cultureproject itself.andP;  This philosophy lies behind Lotus's recent decision to&quot;restructure&quot; its relationship with Lotus Notes -- a wonderful product thatLotus finds itself incapable of selling or supporting properly.andP;  The issueisn't the quality of the product or the size of Lotus's salesforce, butsimply the company's ability to twist its mindset to the service of a productso different from the one it was built upon.andP;  Lotus's heritage is numbers andindividual productivity; Notes is about text and communication andcollaboration.andM;Likewise, Cray Research's decision to split the company in two was astraightforward, clear-eyed recognition of the company's inability to supporttwo conflicting efforts managerially and emotionally.andP;  Finances were besidethe point.andM;This honest realism is refreshing in a world where everyone wonders how IBMcan support both its proprietary SAA and the &quot;open&quot; UNIX standard (and withinthe UNIX camp, OSF's Motif as well as NextStep).andP;  Elsewhere, you couldquestion the wisdom of Sun Microsystems' three product lines, andHewlett-Packard's ability to absorb the Apollo product line and culture.andO;Should Sun have bought TOPS? (On the other hand, Apple is doing fine with theApple II and the Mac -- perhaps because they do not overlap at all anymore.andO;But Apple was certainly smart to spin out Claris, for both external andinternal reasons.)andM;In fact, stockholders of IBM would probably be richer right now if IBM hadbeen split up by the Justice Department ten years ago.andP;  Meanwhile, formerATandamp;T stockholders are doing well with their investments in the regional Belloperating companies carved out of the old ATandamp;T, although the parent companyis still fighting the aftereffects of its size and inflexibility.andM;Among smaller companies, the most common malady is lack of focus, not lack offunds.andP;  All too often, going for market share or exploiting opportunitiesmeans a diversity of products for a variety of customers -- a great idea in amature market, but a dangerous dilution of effort where deep technologyrather than breadth of product line is the key to success.andP;  Many start-upsdie from internal competition for attention and resources long before theyget big enough to attract competition from outside.andP;  (No examples becausetheir names won't mean anything.andP;  .  .  )andM;By contrast, Cray Research's John Rollwagen and the new Cray Computer'sSeymour Cray decided the original company's two parts would be better off ifeach could be single-minded in pursuit of one system architecture.andP;  Thecountry benefits too.andP;  Now it has two supercomputer companies instead of one,plus the promise of a start-up founded by yet another Cray alumnus, SteveChen, and funded by IBM.andM;All this flies in the face of the current obsession with standards.andP;  In fact,the supercomputer race is far from over, and the last thing it needs ispremature standards that would bring innovation ancts progress to a halt, orhalf-hearted competition between two parts of a strife-torn company.andP;  If thegovernment doesn't know which effort to fund (or &quot;protect&quot;), so much thebetter.andP;  Let them fight it out in the marketplace.andP;  And let the governmenthelp them both by buying and using machines rather than with subsidies.andM;This applies, of course, to other markets besides supercomputers.andP;  The bestthing the government can do anywhere is encourage businesses to compete.andO;Although Cray welcomes help against Japanese trade barriers, it'sheartwarming to see how eager it is to foster competition at home.andP;  (There'sthat -cosm issue again.)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
