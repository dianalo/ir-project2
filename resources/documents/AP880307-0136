U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher rejected an Immigration andNaturalization Service argument that the body-cavity searches areneeded because adults will use children as couriers if agentscannot search them.   ``Children confined by the INS are not charged with any criminaloffense, let alone an offense that might indicate a propensity toconceal weapons or contraband on their persons,'' Kelleher ruled.   In 1987, of 84,000 aliens searched, there were 20 discoveries ofcontraband or weapons, only four of which were related tojuveniles, Kelleher noted.   His ruling came in a class-action suit filed in 1985 by acoalition of immigrants' rights groups that challenged what theydescribed as routine strip-searches of children upon admission toINS detention facilities and following all visits with anyone otherthan attorneys.   Children are particularly susceptible to trauma from stripsearches, Kelleher said. He rejected an argument by Assistant U.S.Attorney Ian Fan that children from Central America have noexpectation of privacy when arrested here.   ``Many carry the expectation of liberty, opportunity and abetter life, the embodiment of which is our Constitution,''Kelleher wrote.   Only children are affected by the ruling. John Hagar, anAmerican Civil Liberties Union lawyer involved in the suit, saidthe ruling covers all nine states in the INS' Western Region.</TEXT></DOC>
