The proposal would combine two Treasury Departmentagencies, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency andthe Office of Thrift Supervision, into a new federal bankingagency to regulate national banks and federally charteredthrifts. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would regulateall state-chartered banks and thrifts, and the FederalReserve Board would regulate all bank and thrift holdingcompanies with assets greater than $10 billion.</LP><TEXT>   This initially would give the Fed jurisdiction over about50 or 60 of the nation's largest banking organizations, withthe number expected to grow as banks and thrifts continue toconsolidate. The FDIC would regulate smaller state-charteredholding companies, and the new Treasury agency would beresponsible for federally chartered bank and thrift holdingcompanies with assets under $10 billion.   The plan, worked out by group of House Banking Committeemembers headed by Rep. Doug Barnard Jr. (D., Ga.) and Rep.Jim Leach (R., Iowa), appears to overcome many of thepolitical difficulties that torpedoed a Treasury regulatoryoverhaul plan. As part of its sweeping proposal to rewritebanking laws, the Treasury proposed to give the Fed authorityover all state-chartered banks and holding companies. Itsplan would have given a new Treasury agency authority overall national banks, thrifts and their holding companies.   The FDIC complained that the proposal would have strippedit of most of its regulatory powers, and the Fed complainedthat it would have lost control over most of the nation'smajor banking organizations. As result, a House Bankingsubcommittee refused to consider the regulatory portion ofthe Treasury's proposal and appointed a task force to draft anew plan before the banking committee starts considering bankreform later this month.   Task force members stressed that their proposal is subjectto change after the regulators evaluate it and submit theircomments today. &quot;We haven't taken a vote yet,&quot; said Rep.Carroll Hubbard (D., Ky.), a task force member.   The proposal represents &quot;the tentative center of gravityof the task force,&quot; Rep. Leach said. A number of issuesremain to be worked out, including whether to establish acouncil charged with producing uniform bank regulations andhow to regulate diversified holding companies that would beestablished if Congress approves a Treasury proposal to letcommercial firms own banks.   The task force wouldn't go as far toward regulatoryconsolidation as the Treasury plan, which would compress fourregulatory agencies into two. But most analysts praised thepanel's plan. &quot;I think the politicians have figured out howeverybody wins,&quot; said James McLaughlin, a regulatory attorneywith the American Bankers Association. But Kenneth Guenther,the executive vice president of the Independent BankersAssociation, expressed concern that the plan would give toomuch power to the Treasury and &quot;politicize&quot; bank regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
