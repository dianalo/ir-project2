<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-0450 </DOCNO><TEXT>Leasing of approximately 7.83 million hectares (19.4 million acres) ofouter continental shelf (OCS) lands in the Beaufort Sea Planning Areais proposed. The 3516 blocks are located in waters of the Beaufort andChukchi seas that range from approximately 5 to 260 kilometers offshoreand are from 2 to approximately 1000 meters deep. The potential effectsof the proposal are based in part on the assumption that the conditionalmean economically recoverable resources unleased in the area are estimatedto be 650 million barrels of oil, with a marginal probability of 0.69for hydrocarbons. There is an 82% chance that one or more oil spillsof at least 1000 barrels may occur over the life of the field. Accidentaloil spills are considered to be unavoidable adverse effects. Possibleeffects of oil spills include death of organisms, alterations in primaryand secondary production, reduced reproduction, and a variety of sublethaleffects. Moderate disturbance effects on caribou from development andproduction are possible. Additional stress associated with industrialdevelopment in the local area would be felt by residents of Kaktovik,Nuiqsut, Atquasu, Barrow, and Wainwright. An increase in emission ofair pollutants would occur as a result of this lease sale. Water pollutionfrom onshore activities would be a long-term but local effect.</TEXT></DOC>
