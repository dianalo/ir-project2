Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> HAMLET, Ind.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thomas Ward, concerned citizen and card-carrying member of Common Cause, supports campaign-finance reform and worries about the influence of special-interest money.    But Thomas Ward, Democratic House candidate for Indiana's Third District, has raised more money from political action committees, or PACs, than any other House challenger in the U.S. The campaign, he says, &quot;has tempered my idealism with reality.&quot;    Mr. Ward has raised almost twice as much PAC money as the Republican incumbent, Rep. John Hiler, in a contest that illustrates the remarkable extent to which Democrats dominate the flow of special-interest contributions, particularly in House races.    When Mr. Ward first challenged Mr. Hiler two years ago, he was outspent by nearly 2-1 but still came within 47 votes of winning in a 77-day recount.    &quot;I learned that no matter how hard I work, no matter how hard the staff works, the message isn't going to get out unless you're well-financed,&quot; he says shortly before addressing a small group in Hamlet, a farming community of about 700 people.    It's a lesson he has taken to heart. Almost since the day the recount ended in January 1987, Mr. Ward, a 39-year-old attorney from Knox, has been calling on PAC directors, telling them that he could have won if only they had invested in his campaign.    PACs dismissed Mr. Ward's 1986 challenge and gave him only nominal support. His campaign raised $190,264 compared with Mr. Hiler's $400,335, couldn't afford a professional poll-taker and had to cancel television commercials. The campaign was able to buy television time in the week before the election only because Mr. Ward personally lent it $20,000.    Mr. Ward's work has paid off. By June 30, he had already extracted $226,582 from PACs, nearly 70% of the campaign's total receipts of $331,986, according to Federal Election Commission figures.    The additional resources have allowed him to launch a $40,000 direct-mail effort, hire a bigger staff than last time, retain a nationally known poll-taker and reserve $80,000 of television time for the final four weeks of the campaign. The campaign expects to spend about $500,000 this year, not far below Rep. Hiler's projected budget of $650,000.    Mr. Ward isn't resting on his fund-raising laurels, either. During a two-day visit to Washington, he spent about three-quarters of his time visiting PAC directors, giving them updates on the race and encouraging them to give even more.    Mr. Hiler's campaign had raised $359,925 by June 30, $114,624 of it from PACs. Some of the gap between PAC contributions to the two campaigns is due to the fact that business and trade association PACs tend to make their donations later than labor groups, which account for more than four-fifths of the Democrat's specialinterest contributions.    But it also reflects the inclination of business PACs to concentrate on Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress, and their lack of concern about vulnerable Republicans. Some Republicans are so upset by this that they are threatening to drop their opposition to legislation restricting PAC participation in campaign financing.    The 35-year-old Rep. Hiler has never been secure in this swing district along the Michigan border. Since toppling House Democratic Whip John Brademas in 1980 with 55% of the vote, he hasn't been able to win more than 52%. Polls taken for the Ward campaign show Rep. Hiler ahead but within reach of the challenger, according to campaign manager Mike Marshall. (Hiler campaign officials won't discuss their polls.)    While Mr. Ward hopes his reach is extended by more money this time, other factors are going Mr. Hiler's way. Unemployment in the district has dropped in the past two years, blunting Mr. Ward's 1986 campaign theme of job losses in the area. This year, Mr. Ward portrays himself as the champion of &quot;the little people,&quot; contrasting his humble origins to Rep. Hiler's more affluent roots.    The fact that this is a presidential election year also should give Mr. Hiler a boost; every Republican presidential candidate since World War II has run better in Indiana than he did in the U.S. as a whole. The presence of Indiana's two popular Republican senators on the ballot -- Dan Quayle as the vice presidential nominee and Richard Lugar as a candidate for re-election -- should help still further.    In addition, Rep. Hiler, the more polished campaigner of the two, is waging a much more aggressive campaign than before, keeping Mr. Ward on the defensive and often off balance. &quot;Winning by only 47 votes, you get a lot of religion,&quot; Mr. Hiler says.    He has been going after Mr. Ward from the beginning, challenging him to take stands on various issues from taxes to imposing the death penalty in drug-related murders. Mr. Ward has often been unprepared, taking four days to respond after Rep. Hiler pledged not to raise income tax rates and appearing to vacillate on the capital-punishment question.    In his first term, Rep. Hiler was such a resolute supporter of President Reagan that House Speaker Thomas O'Neill dubbed him one of &quot;Reagan's Robots.&quot; So eager was he to cut federal spending that he was unwilling to seek federal projects for his district.    That changed after some close elections. He has voted against Mr. Reagan's wishes, as on sanctions against South Africa and renewing the Superfund program to clean up hazardous wastes. And his television commercials this year boast of helping get federal funds for various local projects, using the slogan &quot;Experience at work for Indiana.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Campaign '88: GOP Candidate for Congress Finds Ironic Issue in His Democratic Opponent's Use of PACs...&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 19, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
