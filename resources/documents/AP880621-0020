But to Jesse Jackson, she's a ``superwoman''who has traveled the country this spring as an emissary of hispresidential campaign.   Actress Margot Kidder devoted the better part of more than twomonths to almost non-stop campaigning for Jackson, a man she can'teven vote for because she is a Canadian citizen.   Kidder lives in the United States, along the Hudson Riveroutside New York, and feels strongly about national and globalpolitics. Aside from her acting, Kidder works with the human rightsgroup Amnesty International.   Jackson, she said, ``is a man who is actually standing up andsaying all the things I always thought the Democratic Party stoodfor.''   Jackson has other high-profile celebrity backers, among themBill Cosby, disk jockey Casey Kasem and singer Holly Near. ButKidder has been the most visible on a regular basis _ at timestraveling with the campaign and other times making her way to smalltowns across the country where she was a surrogate speaker forJackson.   Jackson introduced her from the stage as the campaign's own``superwoman.''   Kidder believes she was most effective when she spoke to groupsas a representative of the campaign, often appearing in smallcommunities. She says her celebrity status might have been theinitial draw, but the Jackson campaign was the main attraction.   ``I feel I was most useful in the small towns and the smallcommunity meetings where I was out on my own,'' she said in aninterview. ``I went from coffee shops to rallies, you name it ...it was very inspirational.''   Kidder, best known for her role as Lois Lane to ChristopherReeve's Clark Kent in the movie ``Superman,'' says she has beenpolitically active since getting involved in California's nuclearfreeze movement in the early 1980s.   Around that time, she first met Jackson at a peace rally, thenagain briefly on the eve of the 1984 primary in California throughtheir mutual friend, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters.   That year Kidder wanted to write an article for Vogue magazineabout the Democrats and followed the pre-convention action beforeattending the party's San Francisco convention. She was attractedto Jackson's foreign policy issues initially.   ``I was present at the platform hearings and rules committeehearings in '84, and was kind of aghast at seeing the attempts bythe party establishment to shut Jackson out,'' she said.   Politicians who agreed with Jackson's positions ignored him inbelief he could not win, she said.   She left the convention disillusioned with party politics, butwent on to campaign for liberal Democratic congressional candidatesacross the country.   Kidder said she found it disconcerting to speak to students whowere apathetic to politics or were supporting President Reaganbecause they wanted to make a lot of money.   She said she ``dropped out of conventional politics'' untiljoining the Jackson campaign just prior to the April 19 primary inNew York, again, she said, at the urging of Assemblywoman Waters,Jackson's state co-chair in California.   Kidder scoffs angrily at the inevitable campaign plane rumorsthat arise from her working relationship with Jackson.   ``I find it really obscene that people cannot accept that awoman who happens to be an actress and relatively attractive cannotbe accepted within a campaign as a valuable contributor withoutsomething else going on,'' she said in denying the rumors.   The mother of a 12-year-old daughter, Kidder said she related topeople she met as a mother and shared the impression Jackson hadmade on her with his anti-drug message and his integration ofeconomic issues with domestic and global policies.   But, she said, ``I hardly think Jesse Jackson needs Lois Lanestanding by him to give him credibility.''   She plans to go to the Democratic convention next month inAtlanta, where she said, Jackson's constituency has earned ``theright to either be on the ticket or have their issues more thanpaid lip service to in the platform.''   Her other goal is to cement the Jackson coalition, the 7 millionpeople who voted for him, ``so that it has a firm place within andwith the Democratic Party.''   Kidder says of her work for Jackson, ``I go to bed feeling likeI have done a little bit of meaningful work.''</TEXT></DOC>
