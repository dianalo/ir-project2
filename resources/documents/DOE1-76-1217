<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-1217 </DOCNO><TEXT>Lattice statics and lattice dynamics computer simulation methods are appliedto investigate the elastic properties of grain boundaries in fcc metals.The elastic constants in the GB region are found to differ significantlyfrom their bulk ideal-crystal values. Due to the broken symmetry in theGB region a pronounced anisotropy of the elastic properties is observed.Whereas Young's moduli are found to increase in the GB region, the shearmodulus and Poisson's ratios generally decrease. The magnitude of theseeffects is shown to depend sensitively on the GB structure.</TEXT></DOC>
