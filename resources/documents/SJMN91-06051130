It may notopen officially until several months after that, said Joseph Murray, deputydirector of the department's National Cemetery System western regional officein Denver.;    That's long after most experts say the Persian Gulf war willend.;    &quot;There are no plans for early interments&quot; at San Joaquin Valley as aresult of the Persian Gulf war, Murray said.;    But requests from familieswho want loved ones who were killed in action in the gulf transferred to thenew cemetery after it opens would be routinely approved, he said.;    The SanJoaquin Valley cemetery, near Santa Nella, has been in the planning stages forat least two years and was needed because there's no room for the burials ofcaskets in other Northern California cemeteries run by the Department ofVeterans Affairs, Murray said.;    Of the five national cemeteries inCalifornia, only Riverside in Southern California still accepts caskets,Murray said.;    All five, including Golden Gate and San Francisco nationalcemeteries, accept cremated remains, he said.;    The veterans departmentexpects to handle seven burials a day when the San Joaquin Valley cemeteryopens, probably in early 1992. The cemetery will have room for the remains of125,000 veterans and their dependents, who also are eligible for burial innational cemeteries.;    Located four miles west of Santa Nella off Interstate5 in Merced County, the San Joaquin National Cemetery is being carved out ofrolling pasture land.;    The site is situated at the end of a one-lane,pothole-filled farm road behind a vast orchard filled with pink almondblossoms and at the base of the foothills of the Diablo range.;    The land,70 miles southeast of San Jose, was donated by the Wolfson family, which stillruns a sprawling ranch that surrounds the site.;    Initial development of thesite will include 105 acres and will support administration and maintenancebuildings and 23,000 grave sites on 65 acres, spread out beneath a75-foot-high flagpole that will sit atop one of two hills that rise more than120 feet over the site.;    According to the veterans department, the $10million project will serve 1 million California veterans and their families.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK FOLEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  468  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051130,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
