Louis.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The Fiber Channel standard, a 4-layer communications scheme thatdefines a serial, fiber-optic I/O channel and could potentiallyeliminate bulky parallel connectors, is still under development bythe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X3T9.3 committee,but the first products offering support for the developingstandard are beginning to appear.andP;  PCO already has availabletransmitter and receiver modules, and modules from Advanced MicroDevices and Honeywell are expected in 1991.andP;  AMD expects to offerfairly extensive support of the specifications in a module pairdue in early 1991.andP;  Honeywell expects to begin sampling itsmodules in late 1991.andP;  PCO has not yet committed to supporting theFiber Channel standard in future versions of the modules alreadysampling.andP;  Pricing is expected to vary widely, based approximatelyon data rates.andP;  PCO's pair is priced at $590; Honeywell estimatesits parts will cost from $2,500 to $3,000 in quantities of 100.andO;Choice of light sources for module makers and systems developerswill include long- and short-wave lasers and long- and short-waveLEDs.andP;  PCO favors the long-wave LED, AMD leans toward short-wavelasers, and Honeywell employs long-wave lasers.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Product DevelopmentStandardsModulesTransmittersReceiversData CommunicationsFiber optics.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
