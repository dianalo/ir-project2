If the policy objective is defined as preventinganother explosion of a nuclear device, then the prospects are indeedgloomy. If the policy objective is to reduce the rate and degree of proliferationin order to be able to cope with the destabilizing effects, then thesituation is by no means hopeless. What is remarkable from this secondpoint of view is that the rate of proliferation has not been faster.Of the many states expected in 1960 to have exploded nuclear devicesby now, most have not. From an international perspective, the policyobjective is to maintain the presumption against proliferation. The greatdanger is an acceleration of the rate of proliferation, with generalrestraints breaking down and decisions to forbear reconsidered because&quot;everyone is doing it.&quot; Such scrambles have occurred in internationalpolitics - witness the rapid partition of Africa in the third quarterof the nineteenth century, or the rapid extension of coastal states'jurisdiction in the oceans during the past decade. Preventing such abreakdown in the restraints against nuclear proliferation is a feasiblelong-term objective, one that has been pursued with some success. Ironically,these gains are currently threatened on one side by those who pursuea broader anti-nuclear agenda and assert it as anti-proliferation policy,and on the other side, by those whose satisfied view of the past leadsthem to belittle the risks of proliferation in the future. This essayassesses the central gains and mistakes of the last few years, and outlinesthe major problems involved with maintaining a non-proliferation regimein the 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
