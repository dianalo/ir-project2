As expected, the FDIC also reported yesterday that its insurance fund stood at $18.4 billion on June 30, $164 million higher than at Dec. 31. During the first six months, the fund took in $1.7 billion in insurance premiums, income on investments, proceeds from the sale of failed banks' assets and other income.    The agency also spent $95 million on operating expenses in addition to the money it set aside to handle 96 bank failures.    Despite predictions that the number of bank failures could rise to about 200 this year, FDIC officials expect the insurance fund to break even or post a modest gain for the full year.    The FDIC insures deposits of $1.5 trillion held by 14,800 banks. Yesterday was the first time the agency has made a midyear report public. </TEXT></DOC>
