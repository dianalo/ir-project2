The family-run company is likely to become a takeover target,and several potential acquirers who had been anticipating thebankruptcy are expected to come forward, sources said.   Donnay climbed to the top rank among the world's tennis racketmakers when Bjorn Borg advertised its products a decade ago, butthe company began to suffer heavy losses after the Swedish championretired in 1981.   Although its business was declining, banks continued to lendDonnay money, asking very few guarantees, said Fabrice Jacquemart,a spokesman for the government of Wallonia in southern Belgium,which has a 27 percent stake in the company.   ``Donnay got this credit line because of its notoriety,'' hesaid. But the Walloon government and the unions want to avoid atakeover for Donnay's name only.   ``The unions will be vigilant to avoid that a company takeoverwill be agreed to with the sole purpose of buying the name of thebrand,'' said union spokesman Jacques Hardy.   Donnay's debts total about 1.4 billion francs, or $35 million,Jacquemart said. Weeks of negotiations with banks and the Walloongovernment failed to result in an accord that would have preventedthe bankruptcy.   Creditors refused to provide new funds for Donnay, which hassubsidiaries in the United States, Hong Kong, Brazil andSwitzerland. Its 1987 revenue stood at $29 million, down a thirdfrom 1986, and its losses totaled $2 million.   The Donnay family started a firm in 1910 with six workers whomade wooden tool handles. It moved into tennis rackets in the1930s, but the business took decades later when Donnay contractedwith Borg, then a little-known rookie who went on to win fiveWimbledon titles.   At its peak, Donnay made over 1.5 million rackets a year andemployed 600 people. But its output slipped 50 percent and itsstaff was cut to 350 when the company's fortunes started fading inconcert with Borg's retirement.   Other problems also dogged Donnay. The company had troublemarketing its products to an international audience as well askeeping up with technological changes in the sport.   When rackets shifted from wood to synthetics and fibers in theearly 1980s, Donnay lagged the revolution. And the company wasunable to replace Borg with one of the new rising stars of tennis.</TEXT></DOC>
