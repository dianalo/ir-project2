SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not satisfied with extended weekday hours,Saturday hours and automated tellers open 24 hours, some banks arecrossing the once-unthinkable financial frontier of Sunday hours.   It's well under way in Atlanta, and by November at least twoCalifornia banks plan to offer full service on Sundays, from newaccounts to home equity lines of credit. Most of the branches willbe located in a common Sunday stopping place: supermarkets.   A smattering of other banks have also tried Sunday hours, thelatest strategy in a trend toward greater flexibility that beganwith bank deregulation a decade ago.   Since deregulation, banks have courted customers with everythingfrom free toasters to interest-bearing checking accounts toSaturday hours.   Weekend banking is ``acknowledging the fact that life in the'80s ain't as simple as a couple of decades ago,'' said NancyEvans, spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association.   ``Banks are finally learning they will have to be retailers.They've been too conservative,'' said Jack Seefus, president andchief executive of the six-branch Antelope Valley Bank, in thedesert 60 miles north of Los Angeles.   All Seefus' branches already are open from 9 to 1 on Saturdays.And they will stay open from 11 to 3 Sundays beginning in November,a boon to the booming population of people who work in Los Angelesbut live in distant cities like Lancaster and Palmdale wherehousing is cheaper.   ``The demographics have changed so much. These commuters havegot to have a place to bank, and they don't pull into town until 6or 6:30,'' Seefus said.   ``This is just another type of convenience we're providing forpeople,'' agreed Michael Wallace, executive vice president ateight-branch Fremont Bank near San Francisco.   Fremont has had Saturday hours at its regular branches for 20years. It plans to open eight more that will be open from 11 to 5on Sunday, beginning with two in November.   Both banks are small _ Fremont has $220 million in assets,Antelope Valley has $112 million.   And both will tie their Sunday hours into another emergingbanking trend _ branches at supermarkets. The eight new Fremontbranches will be built inside Safeway stores in cities along theeast side of San Francisco Bay.   Two Antelope Valley Bank mini-branches are already located inmarkets, and Seefus hopes to add more.   ``It's a very inexpensive way to expand your operations,'' hesaid.   ``People think only the consumer will use a bank like that in amarket,'' Seefus said. ``But that's not true. Businesses use thoselittle banks, too. The K mart in Mojave uses us. They come over tothe Stater Brothers market and do their banking.''   Seefus won't be surprised if California's bigger bankseventually open at least some branches on Sunday to keep theirsmaller rivals from taking away customers.   Elsewhere in the country, Georgia's Bank South (75 branches, $5billion in assets), has tried Sunday banking over the past year atits 31 branches in big Kroger stores in the Atlanta area.   ``It has been very successful,'' said spokesman Bolling ``Bo''Spalding.   ``We were primarily a corporate bank, and now we're trying tobuild a retail presence,'' Spalding said. ``We want to do that bydifferentiating ourselves, being the most convenient bank inAtlanta.''   Like Fremont Bank, Bank South builds its offices into the frontof the supermarket. They stay open seven days a week until 8 p.m.,beginning at 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday and 1 p.m. on Sundays.   ``The advantage is the relatively low overhead, both in buildingthe branches and staffing them,'' Spalding said. ``We have two orthree people in a supermarket branch compared to 10 or 12 in aregular branch.''   ``The reason that makes sense for us and the customers is thatSunday is Kroger's second-busiest day of the week, behindSaturday.''   Sunday banking ``suits people's lifestyles better,'' he said.``With two-income families, both people working, they can't meetthe banks' traditional hours.''   Savings and loans, traditionally more sensitive to retailcustomers, have experimented with Sunday hours over the years. Theyinclude Western Savings andamp; Loan Association in Arizona, which hasbranches in 24 Smitty's markets in the Phoenix area, which are openfrom 8 to 7 on Sundays and 8 to 9 on Saturdays.   But finding banks willing to stay open on Sunday has been ``veryrare,'' said Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the AmericanBankers Association in Washington.   Still, she suggests that may change _ at least in some places.   ``Banks are being much more aggressive about drawing customersthese days,'' Ms. Stafford said.   ``They are making branches more attractive, figuring out ways ofattracting customers rather than just waiting for them to walk in,selling bank services like you would sell other retail services orproducts.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 1</NOTE></DOC>
