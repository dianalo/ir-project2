But the cosmetics giant said that if Salomon turns it down, Revlon might seek to buy as much as a 25% stake in Salomon in the open market.    However, an individual familiar with Revlon's Salomon strategy said that Revlon isn't interested in acquiring Salomon. It believes that Salomon's management is doing a good job of restructuring the firm to make it more profitable, and that Revlon remains &quot;supportive of management,&quot; the individual said.    In a letter to John H. Gutfreund, Salomon chairman, Ronald O. Perelman, Revlon chairman, said that Revlon has filed under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Act &quot;to seek clearance to buy shares in the open market in the event you are unable or unwilling to conclude a transaction&quot; with Revlon. A copy of the letter was obtained by this newspaper.    A Revlon spokesman confirmed that the company had sought permission from the government to buy as much as 25% of Salomon.    However, Mr. Gutfreund said in a news release last night that Salomon's board had approved the agreement to buy the 14% stake in Salomon held by Minerals andamp; Resources Corp. and to sell the $700 million of preferred stock to Mr. Buffett. Salomon also acknowledged receiving the Revlon offer, but said &quot;our board of directors unanimously determined not to pursue the Revlon proposal.&quot;    Salomon's actions make it likely that Revlon will try to purchase shares in the open market. But traders are likely to continue to bid up Salomon's stock price if they think Revlon will be a major buyer.    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, investors are required to seek antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission before they can buy more than $15 million of stock in a target company. If these investors intend to buy only for investment purposes, they can purchase as much as 9.9% of a company without first seeking clearance.    Mr. Perelman's move clearly shook Salomon, where some officials said that, denials to the contrary, they believe Revlon intends to mount a hostile takeover of the firm. Some senior Salomon officials speculated that Mr. Perelman plans a leveraged buyout. One senior official said if Mr. Perelman chooses to go ahead, he would be tough to stop. &quot;He's got one thing we haven't got, and that's money,&quot; the official said.    The official also labeled as &quot;baloney&quot; the long-held industry belief that a brokerage firm couldn't be taken over without its consent because all the talented people would leave. &quot;Where would they go?&quot; asked another official close to Salomon.    In the letter to Salomon, Revlon proposed terms that it apparently hopes would appeal more to Salomon's other holders.    Revlon would wind up with preferred stock convertible into fewer common shares than Mr. Buffett would receive, so that other holders of common would have less dilution of their holdings, according to individuals familiar with Revlon's offer.    Salomon's agreement, announced Sunday, to sell $700 million of preferred shares to Mr. Buffett was designed to block Revlon from becoming a major shareholder in the large New York investment banking firm, according to individuals familiar with the two companies. Revlon, the sources said, had planned to buy the 14% stake in Salomon that had been held by Minerals andamp; Resources, Salomon's largest shareholder.    Salomon agreed to buy the stake itself from Minerals andamp; Resources, a Bermuda-based investment company controlled by South African mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer. Salomon agreed to pay a premium-to-market price of $38 a share, or $809 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Salomon closed at $34.75, up $2.75, on volume of 2,495,600 shares.    At the same time, Salomon also said it agreed to sell the new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock, equivalent to a 12% stake in Salomon, to Berkshire Hathaway Inc., an insurance and retailing concern that Mr. Buffett heads.    The sources said that Salomon's agreement to sell the shares to Mr. Buffett was entered into only after Revlon's Mr. Perelman had told Mr. Gutfreund on Saturday that Revlon wanted to buy Minerals andamp; Resources' 21.3 million Salomon shares for $38 a share.    In his letter to Mr. Gutfreund, Mr. Perelman said Revlon wanted to make a &quot;firm offer&quot; before the Salomon board approved the sale of the preferred stock to Berkshire Hathaway.    &quot;We will purchase preferred shares in Salomon Inc. on exactly the same terms and conditions as you were prepared to accept from Berkshire Hathaway,&quot; Mr. Perelman wrote. But, he added, Revlon would be willing to agree to convert the shares at $42 a share, rather than $38 a share, meaning less dilution for Revlon holders.    Mr. Perelman told Mr. Gutfreund that &quot;from all our previous discussions with you during the past week, we remain convinced that an interest in Salomon would be beneficial to both our companies.&quot;    As previously reported, Revlon has offered to buy Boston-based Gillette for $47 a share, or $5.41 billion. The maker of razor blades and personal care products has refused that offer, which is effective until Oct. 15. The Revlon spokesman said that the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing &quot;has no effect on our interest in Gillette.&quot;    Last week, Minerals andamp; Resources, which had been trying to get Salomon to arrange the purchase of its stake for several months, announced in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it might sell its Salomon shares &quot;if and when attractive price and other terms are available.&quot;    Revlon's Mr. Perelman first learned that Minerals andamp; Resources' stake was on the block earlier this month through its investment banker, First Boston Corp., according to persons familiar with the bargaining. First Boston earlier had talked with Minerals andamp; Resources' investment banker, Lazard Freres andamp; Co., about helping to place the 14% stake.    According to market sources, Minerals andamp; Resources indicated its willingness to sell Revlon the shares for $38 each. But Mr. Perelman first wanted to meet with Mr. Gutfreund before signing an agreement with Minerals andamp; Resources, the sources added.    The two executives met for about 45 minutes last Wednesday night. Mr. Perelman is understood to have asked Mr. Gutfreund for two seats on the Salomon board. Mr. Perelman told Mr. Gutfreund that Revlon hadn't any intention of acquiring Salomon and offered to limit its holdings in the firm to about 20% or 25%.    Because of the Jewish New Year, Mr. Perelman and Mr. Gutfreund scheduled their next meeting for Saturday night. Individuals familiar with that meeting said Mr. Gutfreund tried to persuade Mr. Perelman not to buy the 14% stake and said that Salomon's management wouldn't support Revlon's purchase.    After the short meeting, Mr. Gutfreund is understood to have contacted Felix Rohatyn, the top mergers and acquisitions partner at Lazard Freres, to arrange for Salomon to buy the shares held by Minerals andamp; Resources for $809 million, the same price Revlon had offered. On Sunday, Mr. Gutfreund also arranged the sale of the preferred stock to Mr. Buffett, details of which had been partly worked out the previous week.    &quot;They (Salomon) panicked and sold the stock (to Mr. Buffett) under devastating terms,&quot; asserted an individual familiar with Revlon.    Salomon's agreement in principle with Mr. Buffett calls for the firm to pay Mr. Buffett a 9% annual dividend on his preferred stock. That would indicate that Salomon is offering to give Mr. Buffett $63 million a year for his investment. That dividend, of course, would be in addition to any paper profits Berkshire Hathaway would have if the price of Salomon's shares rises.    Berkshire Hathaway, for its part, will have two seats on the Salomon board and has agreed to vote its shares as recommended by the Salomon board as long as Mr. Gutfreund or someone &quot;satisfactory to Berkshire Hathaway&quot; is chief executive. Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates also agreed not to control more than 20% of Salomon's voting stock for seven years.    ---                     Perelman's Purchases   April 1980 -- Ronald O.
