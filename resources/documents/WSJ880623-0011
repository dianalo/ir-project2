The tests involve probes that can identify a person's unique genetic patterns in small samples of blood, hair, semen or other cellular material. Such probes, which are pieces of DNA that stick to the DNA in a sample, have provided crucial evidence in more than a dozen murder and rape cases during the past year and are increasingly used in paternity testing.    Until recently, only a handful of U.S. companies offered DNA-probe testing services. But now the probes are becoming commercially available to hundreds of medical laboratories. Collaborative Research Inc., a Bedford, Mass.-based biotechnology concern that has developed one of the world's largest collections of DNA probes, said it plans to commercially license them. Another concern, Lifecodes Corp. of Valhalla, N.Y., recently introduced a testing kit using DNA probes.    The marketing of the probes promises to speed standardization of tests based on them -- a necessary prelude to their wide acceptance in medical and legal circles. &quot;It will be very beneficial&quot; for the probes to be sold commercially, said Cathy Schoener, a manager at the Memorial Blood Center of Minneapolis, which is researching DNA-probe tests with Collaborative's probes. &quot;One of our problems now is that other laboratories can't duplicate our results&quot; with the probes because they aren't widely available. Replicating results is a standard validating procedure among medical laboratories that perform paternity tests, she added.    The initial market for the probes will be some 400 U.S. laboratories that perform forensic and paternity tests. Collaborative will offer sets of DNA probes that can distinguish one person from others with greater than 99% probability, said Orrie Friedman, the company's chairman. He added that conventional tests, which involve analysis of non-DNA cellular constituents, often yield comparable probabilities no better than 90% and sometimes aren't precise enough for use in legal cases.    The cost of tests based on Collaborative's probes is expected to be comparable to that of conventional tests, said Linda Pine, a Collaborative vice president. A paternity test -- involving samples from a mother, child and alleged father -- might cost $250, including $40 or so for DNA probes themselves, she added. Lifecodes said its paternity kit is priced around $100.    Several other companies offer forensic and paternity testing services based on DNA probes, including Cellmark Diagnostics, a Germantown, Md.-based unit of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, and Forensic Science Associates, a closely held concern in Richmond, Calif.    Government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are pushing for wider use of DNA probes, which often provide data that holds up well in court. With Cellmark's test, for example, &quot;we can get odds of 30 billion to one that we are right&quot; in matching a DNA sample with the person from which it came, said James Werner, Cellmark's vice president, administration.    An FBI spokesman cautioned that more research on the probes is needed to standardize and validate them for widespread use in criminal investigations. He added that forensic researchers with the agency are evaluating how well the probes work with the kinds of samples typically recovered during investigations.    Industry researchers already have shown that the probes can be used in certain cases in which conventional blood tests won't work -- such as to analyze samples as much as two weeks old, compared with a four-day or five-day age limit on samples used in conventional tests. Forensic Science's tests employ so-called gene-amplification technology developed by Cetus Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., that enables even older samples to be analyzed by enlarging the amount of DNA in a sample. The Cetus technique also enables analysis of very small samples -- in principle only a few cells, said a Forensic spokesman.    Use of the DNA-probe test has yet to become a major civil liberties issue, but questions have been raised about its potential for abuse. For example, civil libertarians have expressed concern over the possibility that DNA samples -- which can be analyzed to determine a person's predisposition to certain inherited diseases -- might be filed away like fingerprints by law enforcement agencies. </TEXT></DOC>
