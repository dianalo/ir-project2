The revisionsestablished new regulations and revised existing regulations and proceduresto make them equivalent to NSPS, NESHAPs, PSD, Stack Heights and Visibility.The revisions also updated various existing State rules and provided newState rules for oil and gas production facilities. This action only addressesthe PSD rule revisions, the updating of various existing State rules andthe addition of the new rules for oil and gas production facilities. Amore detailed discussion of the revisions follows below.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Chapter 33-15-01_General Provisions </ITAG>The definition of ``Trade waste'' [33-15-01-04(36)] was revised by addingthe term ``wood-containing preservatives'' to the list of what constitutesa ``trade waste.'' A change was made in the malfunctions regulation [33-15-01-13(2)]. Priorto this change, the malfunction subsection required companies to notifythe State immediately concerning any malfunction that was expected to causea violation of any article or other applicable rules and regulations ofthe State. This proved to be unworkable in some situations, and, as a matterof practice, the State had been requiring notifications only if the malfunctionwas expected to last greater than 24 hours or if the discharge of the contaminantposed an immediate danger. The regulations have been amended to requiresources to report a malfunction to the State as soon as possible if themalfunction is expected to last longer than 24 hours and cause the emissionof air contaminants in violation of this article or other applicable rulesand regulations of the State. The regulation has also been amended to requireimmediate notification to the State for any malfunction that would threatenhealth or welfare, or pose an imminent danger. A subsection on continuous emission monitoring system (CEM) failures [33-15-01-13(3)]was added. This addition requires that when a CEM fails, an alternativemethod acceptable to the State for measuring or estimating emissions mustbe undertaken as soon as possible. In addition, timely repair of the emissionmonitoring system must be made. The State added a new section on the confidentiality of records [33-15-01-16]to clarify the State's procedure concerning the submittal of confidentialinformation. This section addresses public inspection, information submittedas trade secrets, accepted trade secret claims, rejected trade secret claims,appeal of nondisclosure claims, retention of confidential information,maintenance of log, transmittals of confidential information, and relationshipto issuance of permits. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. Chapter 33-15-02_Ambient Air Quality Standards </ITAG>There were numerous changes to this Chapter to bring the wording of theregulation up-to-date and to clarify the Air Quality Guidelines the Statefollows. The State rescinded several Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS) whichwere no longer used or necessary. The rescinded AAQS included settled particulate(dustfall), coefficient of haze, reactive sulfur (sulfation), suspendedsulfate, sulfuric acid mist, sulfur trioxide or any combination thereof,and hydrocarbons. The State also amended its hydrogen sulfide (H<T2>2</T2>S) AAQS. Prior to the regulation change, there were two AAQSfor H<T2>2</T2>S. Both standards were based on \1/2\-hour concentrations. Thisproved to be cumbersome for dispersion modeling purposes, as well as generalreview of monitoring data. The State changed the H<T2>2</T2>S standard to one 1-hour standard that it believes is as stringentas the two \1/2\-hour standards. The State deleted Table 2-Methods of Air Contaminant Measurement. Methodsof measurement have been incorporated by reference into 33-15-02-05, Methodsof Sampling and Analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Chapter 33-15-03_Restriction of Emission of Visible Air Contaminants</ITAG>The State added provisions into 33-15-03-01 that require: (1) Existingsources to comply with the visible air contaminant restrictions for newinstallations in 33-15-03-02 when technology and feasibility develop; and(2) existing sources that install control technology capable of meetingthe restrictions of 33-15-03-02 to meet those restrictions. The State alsoadded provisions to allow parties aggrieved by the above two items theability to request a hearing before the department, according to Article33-22 and North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-32. In Method of Measurement, 33-15-03-05, the State defined ``per hour'' forReference Method 9. The State also added to this subsection a sentencethat allows sources to use a continuous opacity monitor to determine compliancewith visible emission standards when Reference Method 9 opacity readingsare not available. For clarification, additional minor wording changes were incorporated intothis Chapter. <ITAG tagnum="84">4. Chapter 33-15-04_Open Burning Restrictions</ITAG>Minor changes were adopted in a 33-15-04-02. One of these changes includesthe addition of the requirement that open burning comply with the RuralFire Mitigation Action Guide included in the North Dakota Rural Fire ContingencyPlan.Language in 33-15-04-02 (7)(c) and (8)(c), which restricted open burningbetween three hours after sunrise and three hours before sunrise, was omitted.Deleting this language allows open burning during times of the day whendampness and calm conditions prevail, and thus provides for safer burningconditions.Language was also added [33-15-04-02(8) (c) and (d)] to restrict the burningof liquid hydrocarbons near Class I areas if it will adversely affect theambient air or visibility of such areas, except in emergencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Chapter 33-15-05_Emissions of Particulate Matter Restricted</ITAG>The State added 33-15-05-01(2)(b) and 33-15-05-02(2)(g) to provide a mechanismfor parties aggrieved by restrictions applied on them to request a hearing,according to article 33-22 and North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-32.The maximum allowable emissions of particulate matter from fuel burningequipment used for indirect heating (33-15-05-02) ws amended to exemptthe following from the particulate standard: (1) Sources with a heat inputof not more than ten million BTU/hour and (2) sources with multiple boilerswith a total aggregate heat input of not more than ten million BTU/hour.Previous to this revision, the rule had exempted sources with a heat inputof less than five million BTU/hour or sources with multiple boilers eachwith heat inputs of five million BTU/hour or less and a total aggregateheat input of less than ten million BTU/hour.Subdivision (f) was added to 33-15-05-02 and requires existing sourceswhose heat input is greater than 250 million BTU/hour and who are equippedwith state-of-the-art control technology to comply with the particulateemission limitation of the fossil fuel-fired NSPS when directed by theState.<ITAG tagnum="84">6. Chapter 33-15-07_Control of Organic Compounds Emissions</ITAG>The State amended this Chapter to correct the overlap that existed betweenthis Chapter and the NSPS Chapter concerning storage tanks. Storage tanksare now incorporated in the NSPS for storage tanks [33-15-12-01(8)].<ITAG tagnum="84">7. Chapter 33-15-10_Control of Pesticides</ITAG>The State added to this Chapter paragraph 33-15-10-02(3) to highlight thedisposal requirements for surplus pesticides and empty pesticide containers.<ITAG tagnum="85">8. Chapter 33-15-11_Prevention of Air Pollution Emergency Episodes</ITAG>The State made minor wording changes in this Chapter to update its regulations.<ITAG tagnum="85">9. Chapter 33-15-14_Designated Air Contaminant Sources, Permit ToConstruct, Permit To Operate</ITAG>This Chapter was amended by adding alcohol plants to the list of designatedair contaminant sources [33-15-14-01(1)(x)]. A paragraph was also addedthat prohibits permits to construct from being transferred without priorapproval by the State [33-15-14-02(11)]. The permit to construct and permitto operate fees were compiled into one section [33-15-14-04] and updated.The fees were adopted as follows:1. The filing fee of $75.00 or $100.00 was increased to $150.00 for allsources.2. A new classification system was developed based upon the frequency ofinspections and the amount of staff time spent on projects. Annual costswere adjusted based upon the amount of staff time involved with the variousclassifications.3. An addition was made that allows the State to collect annual fees forsources operating under a permit to construct that have not yet receiveda permit to operate.The State also changed the permit exemption limit [33-15-14-05(1) ((b)and (c)] for fuel burning equipment to be consistent with the languagein the particulate emission rate exemption discussed in Chapter 33-15-05.Previous to the revision, fuel burning equipment, other than smokehousegenerators, which had a heat input of not more than ten million BTUs/hour(and burned gaseous fuels containing not more than 2 and 5-tenths grainH<T2>2</T2>S per 100 standard cubic feet; or distillate oil) or one millionBTU/hour (and burned residual oil); or 350,000 BTU/hour (and burned solidfuel), were exempt from obtaining a permit to construct or operate. Therule has been revised to exempt fuel burning equipment, other than smokehousegenerators, which meet the following criteria:(1) The aggregate heat input does not exceed ten million BTU/hour.(2) The total aggregate heat input from all equipment does not exceed tenmillion BTU/hour.(3) The emissions from all equipment do not exceed 25 tons per year ofany contaminant.Finally, the State amended this Chapter to correct the overlap that existedbetween this Chapter and the NSPS Chapter concerning storage tanks. Storagetank exemptions are now incorporated in the NSPS Chapter (33-15-12).<ITAG tagnum="84">10. Chapter 33-15-15_Prevention of Significant Deterioration</ITAG>This Chapter was amended by updating the regulations and making them consistentwith Federal regulations. The stack height section [33-15-15-01(3)] wasrevised by deleting all the stack height regulations from 33-15-15 andreferencing the new stack height Chapter (33-15-18).The State updated the air quality models subdivision [33-15-15-01(4)(f)(1)]by deleting the reference to outdated EPA modeling guidelines and insertinggeneral language on modeling requirements. Dana Mount, Director, Divisionof Environmental Engineering, submitted a letter of interpretation on June29, 1987, stating that the general language means the applicant must complywith the requirements of EPA 1986 version ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models(Revised)'', EPA 450/2-78-027R.To the subdivision on additional impact analyses [33-15-15-01(04)(i)],the State added language to require evaluation of endangered and threatenedspecies of vegetation and wildlife. To the subdivision on sources impactingfederal Class I areas_additional impacts [33-15-15-01(4)(j)], the Stateclarified the notice requirements to the federal land managers. To thesubdivision on Public Participation [33-15-15-01(5)], the State clarifiedthe procedures on public hearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">11. Chapter 33-15-16_Restriction of Odorous Air Contaminants </ITAG>In this Chapter, the State made wording changes to clarify the rules. Thechanges allow a State-certified inspector to determine whether an odoris objectionable.<ITAG tagnum="85">12. Chapter 33-15-20_Control of Emission from Oil and Gas ProductionFacilities</ITAG>The State added this Chapter to establish registration and reporting requirementsfor oil and gas production facilities. The registration and reporting requirementsprovide a means to determine if sources are subject to PSD (33-15-15).They also provide requirements for the control of production facility emissions.The State received numerous public comments, as well as comments from EPA,on the draft regulation revisions. In some instances the State amendedits regulations in addressing such comments. EPA feels the State has adequatelyaddressed all of the public comments, as well as EPA comments.EPA made several interpretations regarding this submittal. The State wasnotified on June 13, 1988 of such interpretations. In a letter dated June16, 1988, Dana Mount, Director, Division of Environmental Engineering,confirmed EPA's interpretations. The following are EPA's interpretations:1. Subsequent to the State revising Chapter 33-15-11, Prevention of AirPollution Emergency Episodes, 40 CFR 51, Appendix L, was amended to addressPM-10 (see 52 FR 24672, 7/1/87). The State submitted draft regulationson March 8, 1988. EPA interprets the State's submittal of the draft regulationsas a commitment to revise its regulations as required.2. Subsequent to the State revising 33-15-15, 40 CFR 51.166, Preventionof Significant Deterioration, was amended to address PM-10 (see 52 FR 24672,7/1/87). As required by Section 110(a)(2) of the Act, the State must adoptand submit to the [EPA] Administrator, within nine months, a plan to implement,enforce and maintain the PM-10 ambient air quality standards. The Statehas submitted draft regulations to EPA and held a public hearing to addressthe PM-10 amendments to 40 CFR 51.166. EPA interprets the State's submittalof draft regulations and the holding of a public hearing as a commitmentto revise its regulations as required.3. Subsequent to the State revising 33-15-15, EPA promulgated SupplementA (1987) to the Guidelines on Air Quality Models on January 6, 1988 (see53 FR 392). Supplement A (1987) adds four additional models to the Guidelines.Although the State has nine months from the effective date (November 6,1988 in this case) to submit revisions to the rule, EPA is addressing SupplementA in this package. Because North Dakota's air quality modeling regulations[33-15-15-01(4)(f)] are written in such a manner as to not preclude theuse of Supplement A (1987), EPA interprets the State's rules to mean thatSupplement A (1987) and any future additions to the modeling guidelinespromulgated by EPA will be utilized by the State to estimate ambient airconcentration required under PSD.4. Regarding Chapter 33-15-20, Control of Emissions from Oil and Gas ProductionFacilities, EPA would like to point out that it interprets the State'srequirement that demonstrations must be performed in accordance with the``North Dakota Guideline for Air Quality Modeling Analyses'' in 33-15-20-03(3)to mean that EPA's Guidelines on Air Quality Models (Revised) will alsobe followed, as appropriate. EPA makes this interpretation because, eventhough 33-15-20-03(3) specifically references the State's modeling guidelines,it also says that all sources that emit greater than 250 tpy must complywith the State's PSD chapter. In the State's PSD chapter, EPA modelingguidelines are required.One further interpretation not addressed in the June 13, 1988, letter iswith respect to the malfunction notification regulation, 33-15-01-13(2).EPA interprets this regulation as merely a notification requirement forsources that have a malfunction that can be expected to last longer than24 hours and cause the emission of air contaminants in violation of statutesand regulations. Additionally, EPA interprets that all sources will reporta malfunction, regardless of duration, if it would threaten health or welfare,or pose imminent danger. Whether a source is required to report a malfunctionor not does not obviate such a source from meeting its obligation to complywith applicable emission limitations and federal and State statutes andregulations.In addition to the interpretations addressed in the June 13, 1988, letterto the State, EPA also requested the State to commit to correcting a fewdiscrepancies found in the PSD regulations. When EPA reviewed the draftsubmittal which addressed PM-10, it found a few discrepancies in the State'sPSD regulations that had not been detected earlier. The discrepancies areas follows: (1) In 33-15-15-01(2)(a), the following statement appeared,``the provisions of this Chapter do not apply to those counties or otherfunctionally equivalent areas on a contaminant specific basis that exceedthe national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide or particulatematter.'' This is incorrect because PSD applies to those areas that havebeen designated attainment or unclassifiable for any National Ambient Airquality Standard (NAAQS) under Section 107 of the Clean Air Act. EPA pointedthis out to the State and is requiring the State to amend this paragraphto say that this Chapter applies to areas designated as attainment or unclassifiablefor <T3>any</T3> NAAQS. (2) In 33-15-15-01(6)(d), ``subsections 5 and 6'' shouldbe ``subsections 5, 6 and 7''. (3) In 33-15-15-02(1), ``subdivision d ore'' should be ``subdivision c or d''. Although these discrepancies werenoted in a submittal subsequent to the submittal EPA is currently processing,the EPA required the State to commit to correct these deficiencies in orderto proceed with this submittal. In a letter dated June 16, 1988, Dana Mount,Director, Division of Environmental Engineering, committed to correct suchdiscrepancies.EPA proposes to take no action on the revisions to Chapter 33-15-16, Restrictionsof Odorous Air Contaminants. This Chapter is not a part of the federallyenforceable SIP, since it bears no relationship to attainment or maintenanceof any NAAQS. (See 44 FR 63102, November 2, 1979.) Likewise, EPA has nobasis for approving or disapproving these revisions to the Chapter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA hereby proposes to approve the revisions to the Implementation Planfor the Control of Air Pollution for the State of North Dakota as submittedon January 26, 1988, (except for the additions and revisions to the NSPS,NESHAPs, Stack Height and Visibility regulations which are being addressedin separate actions and the odor regulation which is not a part of thefederally enforceable SIP) with the interpretations as discussed and theunderstanding that the State will correct the discrepancies noted in thePSD regulations.Under 5 U.S.C. andSection;605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Nitrogen dioxide,Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfuroxides.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James J.
