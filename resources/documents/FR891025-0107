Pursuant to this mandate, the Attorney General requested thatthe Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP)establish a Task Force on Felon Identification in Firearm Sales to developa range of options that would comport with the statute.After preliminary research by components of the Departments of Justiceand Treasury, the Task Force held its first meeting on 14 March. I cannotoverstate my appreciation for the superlative efforts of all of the TaskForce representatives, especially the staff of OJP's Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS), which coordinated production of this Report. Under thedirection of Dr. Joseph M. Bessette, BJS staff invested considerable talentand expertise, and many evenings and weekends, to produce this document.The goal of the Task Force was to identify the entire range of issues thatought to be considered before implementing a felon identification system.The Task Force published its draft report on 26 June 1989 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for a thirty-day public comment period. We werepleased to receive more than one hundred comments from members of Congress,State and local officials, public interest groups, and private citizens.A broad range of views was presented. One law enforcement group, the PoliceExecutive Research Forum, conducted a survey of its members on the options.The comments not only assisted the Task Force in improving the draft report,but will also be of great value to decisionmakers in assessing the strengthsand weaknesses of the various options presented. The Task Force was mostgratified by the general consensus among commenters that the draft reportpresented a thorough and objective review of a most complex subject.President Bush has said that loopholes that ``allow deadly weapons to fallinto deadly hands'' must be closed. The biggest obstacle to achieving thisgoal is that so many of the guns used in the commission of crimes are obtainedon the streets and not through licensed dealers. To deal with the problemof guns used in the commission of crimes, the President has proposed acomprehensive approach, including enhanced penalties for criminals usingfirearms. The President has also recognized that one barrier to an immediateand accurate felon identification system is incompleteness in criminalhistory reporting. The President has called upon the Federal, State, andlocal governments to provide timely and accurate reporting of arrest anddisposition records. Such a reform would have a wide range of beneficialcriminal justice applications.Several commentators on the draft report recognized that improved criminalhistory records are essential to a viable felon identification system.The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives noted that``the incompleteness of criminal history records is a critical hindrance.''The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms commented that``the greatest * * * value of this report is the bright light it shedson the primitive state of the criminal history reporting in the UnitedStates.''In section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, known as the ``McCollum Amendment,''Congress has recognized the need to develop improved mechanisms to enforcecurrent laws that prohibit felons from obtaining firearms. The goal ofimmediately identifying felons in the gun shop will be increasingly feasibleas the advance of technology continues at its remarkable pace. Developmentsin computerized criminal history information systems and improvements inAutomated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) have been impressive.It is not the existence of the technology, but rather its costs, the needfor trained personnel, and the incompleteness of criminal history recordsthat present the greatest impediments to implementing such systems.Representative Bill McCollum, a primary author of section 6213, concludedafter reading the Task Force report: ``Fingerprint identification by gundealers is a goal we can achieve * * * [W]e are capable of having an immediateand accurate identification system without interfering with the activitiesof those Americans who are eligible to purchase firearms.'' In this Report the Task Force does not make recommendations or reach conclusions.We are keenly aware of the significant concerns about protecting the privacyinterests of all citizens, as well as enhancing the ability of law enforcementauthorities to protect society from the criminal element. In addition,we recognize that those who select among the options must be mindful ofpreserving what Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has called the ``historicand honorable firearms tradition in this country.'' Although the report focuses on the practical impediments to felon identification,it is in no way intended to minimize the significant legal issues thatmust be vigorously considered before adoption of any system would be warranted.The Task Force is indebted to several commenters, including the AmericanCivil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Lincoln Legal Foundation, and the NationalRifle Association (NRA) for their legal analyses. First, Second, Fourth,and Fifth Amendment and other constitutional and statutory concerns havebeen elucidated in the comments received. Several other organizations andindividuals expressed particular concern about establishment of any listof firearm owners and the dissemination of arrest information to non-lawenforcement personnel.The options contained in this Report fall into two basic categories: thosewhere identification of felons is made at the point of sale versus thoseinvolving a preapproval procedure. In both cases, verification of identificationwould be made in the gun shop. In neither case would a waiting period berequired for each purchase of a firearm. We recognize the several thoughtfulcomments that the Report was either under- or over-inclusive. The TaskForce believes, however, that it has taken a broad approach that is consistentwith section 6213 and that provides an appropriately wide array of optionsfor policymakers to consider. Reliability would be enhanced with prior approval if fingerprint checksare conducted requiring 4-6 weeks. The basic prior approval system, however,is considerably more expensive than the basic point-of-sale system_perhapstwo or three times as costly_and raises other significant policy issuesas well. It is clear to the Task Force, however, that considerably shorterwaiting periods (7 days has been commonly suggested) do not significantlyenhance reliability over the point-of-sale systems described herein.The Report contains options that range from lower-cost systems that minimizethe burden placed on firearm purchasers to extremely costly systems thatrely upon technology just now becoming available and that raise issuesof the type involved in a national identification system. The most elaborateoptions presented in this report may cost up to $10 billion or more. Butless exotic schemes, albeit less than perfect alternatives, are also presentedfor consideration. They could be implemented in the near term at substantiallyless cost. In assessing this Report, it is important to note that there would be shortcomingsin any felon identification system. One major effect of a felon identificationsystem may be to discourage felons from direct purchase and to encouragetheir use of alternative means to obtain prohibited weapons. In a 1986study for the Department of Justice, it was determined that about five-sixths(84%) of convicted offenders in State prisons who admitted to ownershipof firearms claimed to have acquired their weapons from sources other thana retail outlet. Through the use of ``straw men'' who lack a criminal record,and therefore may be eligible to purchase firearms, some felons may beable to obtain the tools of their deadly trade. In addition, there is anactive ``black market'' in firearms. Although many of the options may be subject to intense public policy debate,the Task Force has attempted to remain assiduously neutral in preparinga complete and fair description of various alternatives. Each option presentedis meant to be flexible and adaptable to numerous modifications. If thisobjective has been achieved, then the Report can serve as a skeleton ontowhich decisionmakers may add the details necessary to produce a viablefelon identification system. Such a system must preserve legitimate rightsto privacy and firearms ownership, while at the same time enhancing theability of law enforcement to carry out its responsibility to maintainthe domestic peace.<ITAG tagnum="6">Richard B.

Appendix: Summary of Comments  on the Draft Report </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Part I. Introduction and Summary of Findings</ITAG>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (section 6213(a) of Public Law 100-690,November 18, 1988) requires the Attorney General, in consultation withthe Secretary of the Treasury and other Federal, State, and local law enforcementofficials, to ``develop a system for immediate and accurate identificationof felons who attempt to purchase one or more firearms but are ineligibleto purchase firearms by reason of section 922(g)(1) of title 18, UnitedStates Code.'' The Attorney General is further required to make a reportto Congress describing such a system no later than 1 year after passageof the Act (November 18, 1989) and to begin implementation of the system30 days later (December 18, 1989). Finally, the Attorney General is requiredto conduct a study to determine whether an effective method can be designedto identify other persons prohibited by Federal law from purchasing firearms(Section 6213(c)). Such persons include: fugitives from justice, thosewho use or are addicted to illegal drugs, those who have been adjudicatedas mentally defective or have been committed to any mental institution,illegal aliens, those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, andthose who have renounced their American citizenship. This second studymust be submitted to Congress by May 18, 1990.This report represents the completion of the first phase of the task todesign a system for identifying felons who attempt to purchase firearms.Its purpose is to describe a variety of possible options for such a system.It details the essential elements of each option; cost estimates; the impactof the system on firearm dealers and on local, State, and Federal law enforcementagencies; the strengths and weaknesses of each option; and associated legaland policy issues. The options are organized into two basic types: thosethat involve some kind of immediate verification at the gun shop of theprospective purchaser's eligibility, and those that document an individual'seligibility to purchase firearms for some specified period of time, suchas three years. Although the latter type requires a ``waiting period''for the initial background check, it allows for immediate verificationthat the purchaser is not a convicted felon at the time of subsequent gunpurchases. Within each of these categories the options are arrayed fromthe lower-cost alternatives to higher-technology, more expensive options.This report does not address the issue of identifying other persons, besidesfelons, who are ineligible under Federal law from purchasing firearms.The Task Force decided that this parallel activity ought to be initiatedby a private contractor with expertise in criminal justice and informationsystems. In July of this year the Bureau of Justice Statistics contractedwith Enforth Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to carry out thiswork.Scope of the ProblemThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) of the Department ofthe Treasury estimates that approximately 7.5 million new and used firearmsare sold at the retail level each year in the United States through 270,000Federally licensed firearm dealers. Currently, those who purchase firearmsare required to fill out BATF form 4473 at the dealership attesting thatthey do not fit into any of the categories of persons ineligible to purchasefirearms. These forms include identifying information for the purchaseras well as the type and serial number of any firearms purchased. The formsare kept by the dealer and are subject to inspection later by BATF officials.They may be examined, for example, to try to track down the purchaser ofa firearm left at the scene of a crime.At this time there is no Federal requirement for any checking of the eligibilityof the purchaser, either before or after the purchase. The dealer reliesprimarily on the purchaser's signature attesting to his eligibility. Falsestatements by the purchaser on the BATF form are a Federal felony punishableby a prison term of up to 5 years.Although the Federal government does not require a criminal history orany other kind of check of firearm purchasers, the States are free to imposetheir own requirements. Currently, 20 States and the District of Columbia(covering 55% of the Nation's population) stipulate that a pre-purchasecriminal history check be made of anyone who wishes to buy a handgun. Fourof these States and D.C. include the purchase of long guns in this requirement.These checks are done during a waiting period that ranges from 2 days to6 months. Two States without waiting periods do a criminal history checkonly after the purchase is made. Twenty-eight States currently requireno criminal history check for firearm purchases.Any system for identifying felons who attempt to purchase firearms mustconfront two distinct issues of scope. One is the large number of firearmsales in this country. The estimated annual total of 7.5 million retailsales is equivalent to a daily average of more than 20,000 sales, assuminga 7-day business week. Since many stores are likely to be closed on Sundaysand to be busier on Saturdays than midweek, it is likely that on peak daysas many as 30,000 or more firearms are sold. During hunting season peak-daysales may reach 50,000 firearms. Any new system for identifying felonsmust be capable of handling this heavy volume. Second, such a system mustinvolve either the participation or cooperation (depending on the system)of 270,000 licensed firearms dealers. Although precise figures do not exist,it is estimated by the BATF that 60-70% of these dealers are not gun storesas such, but rather individuals who collect and deal in guns on a smallscale (hobbyists, collectors, etc.). These small-scale dealers accountfor an estimated 20-25% of all firearm sales. Any system that placed specialdemands on gun dealers in terms of capital expenditures, training, or personnelresources would pose a particular problem for these small-scale operations.Other problems may arise in attempting to identify felons who purchasefirearms during gun shows or in other ways outside of normal retail outlets.Key Elements of a Felon Identification System There are three key elements of the felon identification system mandatedin section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988: (1) the definitionof felon, (2) the meaning of ``immediate,'' and (3) the level of accuracyrequired.<ITAG tagnum="81">Definition of Felon </ITAG>Section 6213(a) relies on the definition of felon previously specifiedin the Gun Control Act of 1968 (with subsequent amendments). This definitionincludes those convicted of a ``crime punishable by imprisonment for aterm exceeding one year,'' but excludes (1) certain specified Federal orState offenses relating to the regulation of business practices and (2)any offense classified by the State as a misdemeanor and punishable bya term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years. Also excluded are those whoseconviction has been expunged or set aside and those who have been pardonedor who had their civil rights restored. This definition presents certain problems for any system that would accessautomated criminal history records as part of a clearance process: First, automated conviction records do not show how long a person couldhave been sentenced. Approximately one-third of those convicted of feloniesin State courts receive no incarceration sentence. Another fifth receivea sentence to a local jail, usually for less than 1 year. In these casesthe automated conviction and sentencing records often will not show whetherthe conviction could have resulted in a sentence of more than 1 year andtherefore whether the offense met the Federal definition of a felony. Second, the offense identifiers contained in automated conviction recordsmay not precisely show whether the offense is one of the business relatedcrimes exempted from the Gun Control Act.  Third, automated criminal history records may not accurately show whethera conviction offense is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than 2 yearsof incarceration, also exempted from the Gun Control Act. Finally, automated criminal history records often do not show whether aconviction has been set aside or led to an eventual pardon or the restorationof civil rights.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Immediate </ITAG>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act does not define ``immediate'' with relation tothe mandated felon identification system. In the absence of such a definitionthe Task Force has considered options that would meet the immediacy testin two distinct ways. One is a system that would involve on-site inquiriesby gun dealers (by telephone, for example) to determine eligibility atthe time of purchase with response times of one to several minutes. Theother is a system involving a preapproval mechanism whereby a prospectivegun purchaser would apply for documentation (such as a license, permit,or identification card) authorizing him to purchase firearms and then usethat documentation each time he makes a purchase.  In such a system theapplication process would take approximately 4-6 weeks. Once the documentationwas issued, however, the purchaser could buy a firearm without additionaldelay at the time of sale. <ITAG tagnum="81">Accurate </ITAG>Although the Anti-Drug Abuse Act mandates the ``accurate identificationof felons,'' it does not specify the level of accuracy that would be acceptable.Accurately determining who is a convicted felon involves two issues. Firstis the identification of the person attempting to purchase a firearm. Althoughstandard identification documents such as driver's licenses and creditcards are regularly used in commercial and banking transactions, theseare not definitive evidence of the identity of the bearer. Such documentsmay be altered or counterfeited or may be originally obtained with falseinformation. Because identification documents cannot absolutely prove identity,``biometric'' information (physical evidence such as fingerprints, retinalscans, DNA, etc.) is often used to establish positive identity for variouspurposes. New technologies, such as automated fingerprint identificationsystems (AFIS), have dramatically increased the speed and efficiency ofusing biometric information to establish identity. This report exploresthe possibility of using biometric information and biometric technologiesto identify accurately convicted felons who attempt to purchase firearms. The second issue regarding the accurate identification of convicted felonsis the quality of the criminal history data bases that would have to beaccessed to verify that a firearm purchaser was not a felon. A perfectlyaccurate criminal history data base would be up-to-date (new arrests, convictions,etc., would be entered promptly), complete (all official transactions wouldbe entered), and devoid of any inaccurate data that might, for example,show a conviction in a case that resulted in acquittal or dismissal. Theissue of accuracy and completeness of criminal history data bases is addressedin greater detail below.  The Quality of Felony Conviction Data As discussed above, the congressional mandate to establish a felon identificationsystem for firearm sales requires identifying those who have been convictedof a Federal or State offense punishable by imprisonment for more than1 year (with certain exceptions). How accurate and complete are convictionrecords? To answer this question requires an examination of where and howcriminal history records are maintained.  Criminal history data are maintained in either manual or automated format three different levels of government: (1) Operational law enforcementor criminal justice agencies such as police, prosecutors, and courts; (2)centralized State criminal history repositories (often run by the Statepolice); and (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Within the States the criminal history repositories are responsible formaintaining complete and accurate information of official  criminal justicetransactions. Such transactions include arrests for serious crimes, decisionsnot to prosecute, court dismissals, convictions and acquittals, admissionsto and releases from local jails and State prisons, and entries to andexits from probation and parole.  A 1984 survey of State criminal historyrepositories conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed thatmore than 35 million criminal history records were maintained in the States(<T3>State Criminal Records Repositories,</T3> Technical Report, Bureauof Justice Statistics, October 1985). In 11 States the records were notautomated, and in most of the others automation was only partial. Halfthe States reported that they had a fully automated <T3>name index</T3> to their criminal history records, even when the recordsthemselves were manual. Only seven States reported that they did not haveat least a partially automated name index. A telephone survey of 20 Statesconducted for the Task Force in April of this year showed that only 3 ofthe 20 States had fully automated criminal history records, and half theStates had less than 65% of their records automated (<T3>A Survey of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories,</T3> Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989). On the other hand, 14 of the 20 States had fullyautomated name indexes to their criminal history records. Currently, two telecommunications networks link law enforcement agenciesto State repositories: the National Law Enforcement TelecommunicationsSystem (NLETS) and the network supported by the National Crime InformationCenter (NCIC). The NCIC network links law enforcement agencies with theInterstate Identification Index (III) maintained by the FBI. Law enforcementagencies use computer terminals to inquire whether a criminal history recordexists for a named individual. If such a record exists in the repositoryof 1 or more of the 20 States that participate fully in the III system,the inquirer is notified and can request the criminal history record throughNCIC. In addition to pointing to State data for the 20 fully participatingStates, the NCIC system makes directly available any other criminal historyinformation from the FBI's own automated records maintained in its IdentificationDivision. These records include information from the other 30 States aswell as Federal criminal justice transactions.The FBI's Identification Division is responsible for conducting fingerprintchecks on individuals processed through the criminal justice system andon those who must pass a criminal history check for specified jobs or positions(such as Federal Government employees, child care workers in some States,etc.). These fingerprint-based criminal justice transactions form the basisfor substantial criminal history information. This information is maintainedin three basic categories at the FBI. The largest is the group of automatedcriminal history records for 12.5 million persons arrested for a fingerprintableoffense (a felony or serious misdemeanor) for the first time on or afterJuly 1, 1974. Next largest is the group of manual records for 8.8 millionpersons born in or after 1929 and arrested for a fingerprintable offensefor the first time before July 1, 1974. The smallest is the group of manualrecords for 3.6 million persons born before 1929 and arrested for a fingerprintableoffense for the first time before July 1, 1974. The FBI maintains an automatedname index both to the 12.5 million automated files and to the 8.8 millionmanual files of those born in or after 1929. There is no automated nameindex for the final group. Currently, the automated name index and theautomated files for the 12.5 million persons arrested for the first timeon or after July 1, 1974, are linked to the NCIC system. Thus, those whomake inquiries through NCIC will access these automated records but notany of the manual records maintained by the Identification Division.Given these data systems, the law enforcement official who wants immediateaccess to felony conviction data has two basic options: to access directlythe automated records maintained by his own or another State or to accessinterstate and Federal records through the NCIC system. He may, of course,do both. The problem, however, is that the conviction records accessedthrough these computerized methods are not complete.These conviction records are incomplete for two distinct reasons. First,as noted above, many records at both the State and Federal levels are notautomated. Among States recently surveyed, an average of about one-thirdof criminal history records were not automated; at the FBI the proportionis about one-half. (It should be noted, however, that the automation ofthe records of young, active offenders is much more extensive than therecords of older, less active offenders.) Second, and equally important,convictions, as well as other final dispositions, are often not reportedto the State central repository or to the FBI even when an automated recordexists of the individual's arrest. The FBI, for example, estimates thatapproximately one-half of the arrest charges in their records do not showa final disposition. Data from the 1984 survey of State repositories citedabove show that about 34% fewer final dispositions than arrests were reportedto the repositories in 1983. (Ideally, each arrest should eventually bematched by a final disposition.) In several States the proportion of underreportingwas as high as 70-80%. Moreover, the April 1989 survey of 20 States revealedthat 8 of the 17 States able to supply a figure estimated that at least20% of convictions within the State were not reported to the repository.Based on the combination of partial automation of criminal history recordsand underreporting of convictions, it is reasonable to estimate that nationwidethe records of approximately 40-60% or more of felony convictions are notcurrently available in automated form and thus not immediately accessibleby law enforcement authorities. Such a high level of undercoverage rendersimpracticable a felon identification system that relies principally onimmediate access to automated conviction records. It should be pointedout, however, that because many felons have more than one felony conviction,there are likely to be automated conviction records covering more than40-60% of felons.This problem of undercoverage, however, can be significantly mitigatedif the manual records maintained by the State repositories and the FBIare accessed. There are two ways to access these manual records. One isto use the automated name index to the manual records, if one exists, toidentify a record and then manually retrieve and examine it. The other,more common, method is to do a fingerprint search based on a full 10-printfingerprint card. If a fingerprint match is found, then the manual filecan be retrieved and examined. This method is by far the more reliablesince it establishes a positive identification. Because both of these methodsrequire direct human intervention at some stage, they are not as immediateas a computer-based search of automated files. For example, the FBI currentlyrequires 14 business days to process a fingerprint card, and, dependingon the location of the requesting agency, an additional 4-10 days may berequired for mail handling. (For the sake of simplicity the rest of thereport assumes an average of 7 days for mail handling.) A new automationsystem at the FBI holds the promise of reducing fingerprint processingtime to somewhere between 2 and 10 business days, depending on a proposedexpansion of computer resources. While accessing manual records reduces the undercoverage that exists ina search of only automated files, it does not eliminate the problem. Asindicated above, a significant proportion of final dispositions are notreported to the State repositories or to the FBI for inclusion in eitherautomated or manual records. In these cases the law enforcement officialmay be able to get the missing disposition information directly from thecourt or prosecutor's office for the jurisdiction where an arrest tookplace, but not through an on-line computer-based search. Impediments to Creating a Perfect SystemA perfect system for immediately and accurately identifying convicted felonswho attempt to purchase firearms would have three key elements: (1) A completeand accurate automated data base showing every conviction for a State orFederal offense punishable by more than 1 year in prison and clearly showingthe specified exceptions (such as business related offenses, misdemeanorspunishable by 2 years or less in prison, convictions set aside or pardoned,and cases where civil rights were restored); (2) a means for positivelyverifying the identity of a prospective purchaser at the time of the saleof the firearm; and (3) a mechanism for immediately linking identifyinginformation about the purchaser with the information in the data base.Such a perfect system may eventually be implemented. However, it is notfeasible or practical at this time. There are several reasons for thisconclusion.First, as the above discussion has shown, automated conviction recordsare too incomplete to rely on to identify convicted felons. Moreover, evenwhen conviction information is available it will not necessarily show whetherthat offense meets the Federal definition of a felony or whether the convictionwas subsequently set aside or the offender had his civil rights restored.Second, positive verification of identity at the time of the gun sale wouldnecessarily require the collection of biometric information by the gundealer. Based on the Task Force's review of state-of-the-art identificationtechnology and its survey of the capabilities of the State repositories,it appears that the only feasible way to do this is with a 10-finger livescan that digitizes the prints and then transmits the digital representationover telephone lines to repositories capable of receiving this informationand automatically searching their data bases for a match. Machines capableof collecting and digitizing a full set of prints currently cost approximately$35,000-100,000 each. This is prohibitively expensive to require of allgun dealers. If purchased by the government for use by 270,000 gun dealers,current prices would require an investment of approximately $9-27 billion.If restricted to the estimated 35% of federal firearm licensees who areactual commercial dealers, the cost would be approximately $3-9 billion.No doubt, mass production would reduce the cost; nonetheless, the sophisticatedoptics and computer hardware used in these machines would limit the costreductions. In addition, it takes a substantial amount of training to operateone of these machines, thus raising questions about the logistics of training270,000 firearm licensees, or even the estimated 95,000 commercial dealers.Moreover, because it takes about 6 minutes to get each set of 10 prints,gun dealers that average 10 sales an hour would have such a machine runningconstantly and would require an additional full-time trained employee justto operate it. This would further raise the cost to the dealer. (Note that machines that take and digitize a single print for communicationto an external data base are much less expensive_approximately $3,000-6,000_butthese are not suitable for matching a single individual to a data baseof millions of offenders. Such single-print searches are extremely computer-intensive,often requiring hours to complete, and are unreliable for proving identityin a search of a massive data base. Currently, such single-print searchesare used as an investigative tool in serious crimes to produce a list ofpossible identities or are used for security purposes to compare one individual'sprints against those already on file.)Finally, even if sophisticated AFIS technology were made available to gundealers, it would be necessary to convert and/or upgrade the technologyin most of the State repositories and the FBI so that digitized fingerprintinformation could be received and compared to fingerprint-based data bases.This would be a massive and expensive operation. Practical AlternativesWhat, then, are the practical alternatives for establishing a reasonablyeffective system for identifying convicted felons who attempt to purchasefirearms? The Task Force has identified two different kinds of systemsthat would meet the Congressional mandate and allow for the beginning ofimplementation by December of 1989. Both types of systems would rely oncurrently available identification techniques and technologies but wouldbe open to improvements in identification documents and methods, includingthose involving biometric information. The two basic options are identifiedhere as Option A and Option B. The body of the report includes a sampleof possible modifications of these two basic options.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A: Point-of-Sale Approval Through a Telephone Check</ITAG>Option A provides for on-site, immediate access to automated name indexesmaintained by State repositories and the FBI through telephone calls tothe repository of the State in which the sale takes place. State officialswould use computer terminals tied into their State records and into theNCIC and NLETS networks to determine whether there was an arrest recordeither within or out of State for someone with the name, race, sex, anddate of birth of the prospective gun purchaser. If there was no ``hit''during this immediate verification process, the gun dealer would be notifiedover the phone and the sale would be made. If there was a ``hit,'' thesale would not be allowed at that time. If the prospective purchaser wishedto pursue the sale, he would seek clearance through a secondary verificationprocess. Under this procedure fingerprints would be taken at a local lawenforcement agency and sent to the State repository. A fingerprint searchwould be conducted by the State and then by the FBI. Any criminal historyrecords obtained through the fingerprint check would be examined by Stateofficials for an indication of a conviction for a disqualifying offense.Incomplete information would be supplemented by inquiries to courts orprosecutors' offices. If no evidence of a conviction for a disqualifyingoffense was found, a Certificate to Purchase would be issued to the prospectivebuyer (valid for up to 1 year). The purchaser would present this documentationto the gun dealer certifying his eligibility. The entire secondary verification process could take as long as 4-6 weeks.It is estimated, however, that approximately 84-88% of prospective gunpurchasers would successfully pass the initial verification and thus wouldnot have to go through the secondary verification. Reasonable modificationsof this system might reduce some of the burdens placed on the eligiblepurchaser.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option B: Firearm Owner's Identification Card</ITAG>Option B is essentially the same as the secondary verification of OptionA. The difference is that everyone who wanted to purchase a firearm wouldgo through a fingerprint-based clearance process. If there was no evidenceof a felony conviction, as defined by Federal law, the State would issuea Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) Card valid for up to 3 years. Thiscard would be presented whenever the bearer wished to purchase a firearm.The chief advantage of Option B over Option A is that it eliminates theproblem of the false ``hits'' that occur in a name-based automated criminalhistory check because of mistaken identity. This option also has severaldisadvantages. The chief disadvantage is that it puts every prospectivegun purchaser through a 4-6-week clearance procedure every several years.It also places much greater demands than Option A on existing criminaljustice identification systems and is thus considerably more expensive.The Task Force has also identified a variety of higher-technology variantsof these two basic options. They are summarized here.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A1: Computer Terminal Access by Gun Dealer to DisqualifyingInformation</ITAG>This option would replace the telephone calls of Option A with direct computerterminal access to an intermediary computer that would review the Stateand Federal criminal history indexes and transmit notices of approval ordenial to the dealer. This would be considerably more expensive than OptionA in the short run and would present no particular operational advantagesover it. <ITAG tagnum="81">Option A2: Touch-Tone Telephone Access by Gun Dealer to DisqualifyingInformation</ITAG>This option is similar to Option A1 but substitutes a touch-tone telephonefor computer access. Like Option A1 it is more complicated and expensivethan Option A, at least in the short run, without any corresponding advantages.It is possible that in the long run Options A1 and A2 would be less expensivethan Option A by reducing the need for computer operators at the Staterepository to respond to the calls from the gun dealers.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A3: Live Scan of Fingerprints by Gun Dealer</ITAG>This option, requiring that fingerprints be taken directly at the pointof sale and digitized for transmission to the record repository, is similarto the biometrically-based system described previously in the discussionof a perfect felon identification system. While it would provide the greatestassurance of a positive identification, it would be the most difficultand expensive to implement.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A4: Biometric Identification Card</ITAG>This option is not so much an alternative to the basic Option A as an additionalfeature that could be added to it. Under this option positive identificationwould be enhanced at the gun dealership by the comparison of a single fingerprintof the prospective purchaser with digitized information from a biometrically-basedidentification card issued by the State. <ITAG tagnum="81">Option B1: Live Scan of Fingerprints by Local Law Enforcement andBiometric Check by Gun Dealer</ITAG>This option combines elements of both prior approval and immediate check.Prospective gun purchasers would go to a designated law enforcement agencyfor a criminal history clearance. The agency would conduct a live 10-printfingerprint scan using AFIS equipment (as in Option A3). The digitizedfingerprint information would be transmitted to the State repository andthe FBI to check for arrest and conviction records. Applicants who passedthis clearance would be issued a FOID card. Those wishing to purchase afirearm would present the FOID card to the gun dealer. Equipment at thedealership would allow a comparison of a single fingerprint from the purchaserto digitized information on the card (as in Option A4).<ITAG tagnum="81">Option B2: Smart Card Containing Disqualifying Information</ITAG>Under this option every adult would carry an identification card issuedby the State of residence, such as a driver's license, that would haveelectronically imprinted identifying information, including biometric dataand information such as felony convictions that would legally bar someonefrom purchasing a firearm. At the gun dealership such a card would be placedinto a reader to verify identification (by comparison with a single fingerprint)and to determine whether the bearer was prohibited from purchasing a firearm.<ITAG tagnum="81">Creating a Data Base of Ineligible Persons</ITAG>Several of the organizations that commented on the earlier draft of thisreport (June 1989) proposed that a national data base be created of convictedfelons and possibly others prohibited by Federal law from purchasing firearms.This data base would include such personal identifiers as name, date ofbirth, sex, race, and possibly such descriptive features as height, haircolor, eye color, etc. It could also include a digitized representationof the fingerprints of the ineligible person, allowing for remote positiveverification that an individual desiring to purchase a firearm was notprohibited because of a criminal conviction.Because existing criminal history records are arrest-based, they includemany individuals who are not ineligible to purchase firearms either becausethe arrest did not result in a conviction or because the conviction wasnot for a disabling offense (as specified in the Gun Control Act). Forexample, the FBI maintains records for some 25 million persons who havebeen arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor. An unknown fractionof these 25 million have been convicted of an offense making them ineligibleto purchase firearms. If this fraction is somewhere between 20% and 50%,then a data base limited to those with disabling convictions would containrecords on 5-12.5 million persons. If this data base were automated andmade accessible to law enforcement authorities through the NCIC or NLETStelecommunications systems, it could facilitate both point-of-sale checks(Option A and its variants) and preapproval checks (Option B and its variants).It would also eliminate one type of false positive in the on-site telephonecheck by gun dealers (Option A): Cases where someone has an arrest recordbut no disabling conviction. Although it would not eliminate the othertype of false positive_cases where the prospective buyer has the same personalidentifiers as a prohibited person_there would be fewer of these sincethe data base to be checked would be considerably smaller than existingarrest-based records. In addition, if a new data base were established,it could include more identifying information than existing automated records,further reducing the likelihood of false ``hits.''Another advantage of establishing such a data base is that lists of otherpersons ineligible to purchase firearms, such as those who have been dishonorablydischarged from the Armed Forces, could be added to it.Whatever the merits of creating a data base of those who have been convictedof an offense disqualifying them from purchasing firearms, the Task Forcedid not explore this option systematically for the simple reason that automatedconviction records throughout the United States are currently too incomplete_bothin terms of coverage and of the information necessary to determine whethera conviction offense meets the criteria established by the Gun ControlAct_to consider this a viable short-term option. This in no way precludesconsideration of such an option as a longer term possibility, especiallyif disposition reporting improves within the States.Cost EstimatesAll of the options detailed here would place substantial new demands onFederal and State criminal history repositories and law enforcement agencies.In the few months that the Task Force has been operating it has not beenpossible to develop precise estimates of the cost implications of eachof the options. Nonetheless, some broad estimates have been derived. Theseshould be taken only as a general indication of the cost implications ofa felon identification system. They are conservative estimates that mayhave to be revised upward as the implications for local, State, and Federalpractice are more fully explored. Option A, which is judged to be the least expensive of the various possibilities,would have projected combined local, State, and Federal start-up costsof $36-44 million. Annual operating expenses would be an estimated $53-70million. Other variants of Option A would cost some additional amount overthe base system. (There is the possibility, however, that a more fullyautomated system that electronically connected gun dealers to the necessarydisabling information would in the long run prove less expensive than OptionA by reducing ongoing personnel costs.)Option B, the basic preapproval system, would have total estimated start-upcosts of $148-153 million, and additional annual operating costs of $136-161million. The two other variants of Option B would likely cost considerablymore.Note that if existing criminal history checks for gun purchasers are takeninto account, the actual new cost would be somewhat lower than these estimates_perhaps8-12% less for operational costs.Part, or all, of these costs might be recouped by charging the gun purchasera special fee. Assuming 7.5 million gun purchases per year, a fee in therange of $7-9 per firearm might cover the annual operating costs of OptionA (although not the start-up costs). Assuming 6 million FOID cards issuedin the first year under Option B and 5 million issued each subsequent year,a fee in the range of $27-32 per application would be necessary to coverannual operating costs. (Some may consider such fees an unfair burden oninnocent purchasers. An alternative approach may be to impose special fineson those convicted of firearms violations.)The following summarizes cost information for the two basic options andthose higher-technology variants for which enough information was availableto approximate at least partial system costs:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,12,10</C> <H1>Options </H1><H1>Start-up costs (millions)</H1><H1>Annual operating costs (millions)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A: Telephone check by gun dealer<D>$36-44</D><D>$53-70</D></ITAG>A3: Live scan of fingerprints:<ITAG tagnum="2">By all gun dealers<D>9,590-27,144</D><D>3,047-8,347</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">By commercial dealers only<D>3,457-9,636</D><D>1,172-3,063</D></ITAG>A4: Biometric identification card checked: <ITAG tagnum="2">By all gun dealers<D>198-368</D><D>102-168</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">By commercial dealers only<D>93-158</D><D>70-105</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B: FOID card<D>148-153</D><D>136-161</D></ITAG>B1: Live scan by law enforcement and biometric check:<ITAG tagnum="2">By all gun dealers<D>344-572</D><D>203-295</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">By commercial dealers only<D>239-362</D><D>171-232</D></ITAG></ITAG>Implementation IssuesThere are four broad possibilities for implementing a felon identificationsystem: (1) to create a self-standing Federal system that is run entirelyby Federal officials; (2) to mandate a cooperative Federal-State systemin which State officials carry out a substantial portion of the criminalhistory checks; (3) to establish a mandatory Federal standard that Statescould meet in a variety of different ways; and (4) to offer the Statesseveral models for a cooperative Federal-State system and make Federalresources and leadership available to assist the States.(1) The Task Force did not focus its research efforts on the creation ofan independent Federal system because 90% or more of arrests and convictionsin the United States are handled by State and local officials. Becauseof the variety of State laws, practices, and data systems, only State officialsare in a position to properly interpret criminal history record informationfor their State and to determine whether a conviction meets the Federalstandard for disallowing a firearm purchase. Moreover, State officialsare in the best position to track down missing or incomplete informationwith local courts or prosecutors. Thus, the active involvement of Stateofficials in the criminal history checks would seem essential to an effectivefelon identification system.(2) Given the necessity for active State involvement, the Federal governmentcould create a felon identification system by mandating that the Statesadopt a particular system, such as one of those detailed here or a modificationthereof. Under this implementation strategy, the Federal Government wouldselect a felon identification system and each State would be required towork with Federal officials to implement it. The result would be a uniformsystem in each of the 50 States.(3) Another possible implementation plan is to allow variation across theStates in the kind of system established as long as each State's systemmet certain minimum Federal standards. As noted above, 20 States and theDistrict of Columbia (covering more than half of the Nation's population)currently conduct some kind of criminal history check for those who wishto purchase handguns. There is, however, substantial variation among thesesystems. In some States checks are conducted by local authorities; in othersby State authorities. Some States access only State records when conductingthe check; others also access Federal records. A few States require fingerprints;most do not. Of these existing systems, some might be as effective as theoptions detailed in this report in keeping convicted felons from purchasingfirearms through legitimate retail outlets. Others might be easily upgraded.All of the options presented in this report meet at least two minimum standards:all firearm purchases from Federally licensed dealers are covered, anda name check of both State and Federal automated data bases is conductedfor evidence of an arrest for a serious crime (such checks usually alsoinclude date of birth, race, and sex). It appears that only four Statesand the District of Columbia currently meet both standards.  (4) Finally, the Federal Government could take a leadership role in designingone or more felon identification systems and in encouraging, but not mandating,State cooperation. Under this strategy the Federal Government would expandits own resources at the FBI and BATF to make such a system(s) possibleand would provide expertise and technical assistance to State and localofficials.Legal and Policy IssuesWhatever option is chosen, new legislation would be required to addressa number of issues: (1) To mandate a specific system on the States, toestablish minimum Federal standards, or to base a system on voluntary complianceby the States; (2) to establish the funding mechanism for carrying outthe criminal history checks, possibly involving user fees by gun purchasers;(3) (under some options) to authorize the release of limited criminal historyinformation to gun dealers (e.g., whether there is a ``hit'' on a namesearch of automated arrest records); (4) to specify penalties for gun dealerswho improperly disclose criminal history information obtained as part ofa felon identification system; (5) to determine the minimum acceptablelevel of accuracy for the system; (6) to establish a statutory right ofappeal for the prospective gun purchaser from any adverse decision, includingthe right to inspect records; and (7) to set forth policy regarding theuse of information generated by a felon identification system, includingany fingerprint data collected. (This is an illustrative, not an exhaustive,list.)Solving the Problem of Felons Acquiring FirearmsIn evaluating the various possibilities for identifying convicted felonswho attempt to purchase firearms, it must be recognized that even a perfectfelon identification system would not keep most felons from acquiring firearms.One study of convicted offenders in State prisons found that about five-sixthsof those who admitted to ownership of a firearm claimed to have acquiredthe weapon through some means other than purchase through a retail outlet(<T3>The Armed Criminal in America</T3>, National Institute of Justice,November 1986). (A small proportion of felons, however, may translate intoa large number of individuals.) These other means included the black market,thefts, and informal transactions with friends or associates such as apurchase or trade. An effective felon identification system will do littleto eliminate or reduce these off-the-record transactions. Indeed, a particularlyeffective system may force even more felons to turn to the black marketfor their weapons or to use accomplices without a criminal record to purchaseguns for them. Nonetheless, a system that keeps felons from purchasingweapons over the counter may at least increase the difficulty, and perhapsthe costs, of acquiring weapons for use in crime and may, in fact, denyweapons to some number of less sophisticated criminals unable to accessthe black market or to find willing accomplices. Moreover, because blackmarkets may not provide ready access to the high quality weapons availablethrough retail outlets, an effective felon identification system may restrictthe quality, if not the quantity, of weapons in the hands of felons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II. Options for a Felon Identification System</ITAG>Section 1. Schematic OverviewIn considering the design of a system for identifying felons who attemptto purchase firearms, it is useful to begin with a general overview ofthe basic components. Any final system would be comprised of an approvalprocedure, a designated processing organization, access to data sources,a designated decision organization, final action, and an appeals process.Different systems are basically different combinations of options amongthese components. (See Exhibit 1.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Approval Procedures</ITAG>Approval to purchase a firearm may occur either prior to an individual'strip to a gun dealer or at the point of sale in the shop. Prior approvalschemes include the issuance of: (1) an identification card, which establishesin advance that the individual is eligible to purchase a firearm, (2) acertificate to purchase, which permits an individual to purchase a firearmfor a limited period, or (3) a smart card on which basic data are encodedthat establish an individual's eligibility. Point-of-sale approval proceduresmay involve telephone checks by the gun dealer of criminal history recordsthrough local or State law enforcement agencies or a regional office ofthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Direct checks of data basescould also be made over touch-tone telephone lines: dealers would accessdata with a series of identifying numbers and receive approval or denialfrom a State or Federal computer system. Dealers could also make electronicchecks through terminals or automated biometric devices with direct linesto the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and State criminal historyrepositories.<ITAG tagnum="81">Processing Organizations</ITAG>Identification systems for firearm purchases may employ one or more organizationsthat process an application and search the criminal history data bases.For example, applicants may be required to appear in person at a locallaw enforcement agency, such as the police or sheriff's department, toobtain a permit or identification card. This agency would search localfiles and access State or Federal files through the NCIC and NLETS communicationsystems. Alternatively, the applicant could apply at the point of sale,and the gun dealer would call a local, State, or Federal agency to receiveapproval for the sale. A slightly different system could designate theregional offices of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as processingagents for firearms applications and as conduits through which access isgained to State or Federal data bases. Finally, a wholly separate agency could be established at the State orregional level to function as a Felon Identification Center.<ITAG tagnum="81">Data Sources</ITAG>Currently, two basic sources of criminal history data (State and Federal)can be accessed to determine if an applicant has a disqualifying conviction.Any system of identification for firearm purchases must specify which databases are to be used and how they will be accessed.Most States maintain a repository of criminal history record information(CHRI); in a few States the repository is maintained by a municipalityor consortium of local law enforcement agencies. States also maintain ``hotfiles,'' listing outstanding wants and warrants. The degree of automationof the CHRI files varies considerably from State to State: some repositoriesare completely automated, others partially automated, and a few Statesmaintain only paper files.Criminal history data and ``hot files'' are also maintained at the Federallevel within NCIC and the Identification Division of the FBI. The Federalfiles contain records from the applicant's State of residence as well asFederal and out-of-State records. These records may be accessed throughfingerprint searches (via the mail) or through electronic name and date-of-birthsearches (via NCIC access to the Interstate Identification Index [III]).Finally, a new data source could be created for the specific purpose ofidentifying individuals with disqualifying convictions and other individualsprohibited from buying firearms. A national center, for example, couldcreate and maintain an index, which would merge indexes from current Stateand Federal data bases, mental health records, and records kept by theImmigration and Naturalization Service. This national index of individualsprohibited from purchasing firearms would be updated continuously. It wouldserve as the sole data source for Federal regulation of firearm purchases.<ITAG tagnum="81">Decision Organizations</ITAG>Once the processing organization has checked the data bases, the data mustbe interpreted and a decision made. The processing organization may notnecessarily be the decision organization. Local law enforcement may evaluatethe data or rely on the State police or identification bureau to do so.In response to problems of evaluating out-of-State and Federal records,other system designs may designate regional or Federal agencies as thedecision organization.<ITAG tagnum="81">Action</ITAG>The designated decision organization must either approve or prohibit anindividual from purchasing a firearm. Depending on the type of approvalsystem, the organization would transmit the decision to the applicant directlyor through the gun dealer. Potential options include issuance of a card,a certificate, a notice of denial, or an electronic message of approvalor denial.<ITAG tagnum="81">Appeals Process</ITAG>Once an applicant receives final notice that the application has been denied,he may appeal the decision. The designated appeals organization may bethe local police, a State agency, a regional office of BATF, or some otheragency. Legislation may also establish a right to a judicial appeal onceadministrative appeals are exhausted. <ITAG tagnum="81">Basic Options and Variants</ITAG>Although there are numerous possible combinations among these components,the Task Force has detailed two basic options: Option A, which is a point-of-saletelephone check by gun dealers with secondary verification, and OptionB, which is a preapproval system requiring a firearm owner's identificationcard. The descriptions presented here specify for each basic option thetype of approval procedure, the processing organization, the data sources,and the final decision organization. There is additional discussion ofspecific characteristics, estimates of volume, cost figures, advantagesand disadvantages, and potential modifications. Each basic option is followedby several higher-technology variants.Section 2. Point-of-Sale Approval Systems<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A: Telephone Check by Gun Dealer With Secondary Verification</ITAG>A cooperative Federal and State system would be established requiring thatgun dealers obtain clearance from a designated law enforcement agency atthe time of sale of all firearms. This system would include both (1) animmediate telephone check of automated criminal history records by gundealers through a designated law enforcement agency and (2) a secondaryfingerprint-based verification procedure for all individuals rejected throughthe initial telephone check. Each system would have the following elements:<T3>Telephone check (Exhibit 2). </T3>1. At the time of purchase each gundealer would require the buyer to fill out an application and show twopieces of identification, with at least one having a current photo.2. The gun dealer would be required to telephone a State law enforcementagency for a criminal records check. Appropriate security procedures (suchas a call-back procedure or password system combined with additional dealeridentification and access codes) would be introduced to protect againstunauthorized entry and dissemination.3. The designated State law enforcement agency would access existing telecommunicationsnetworks to check the master name index within the State of purchase andthe FBI's Automated Identification System_Phase III (AIS-III). The AIS-IIIindex contains pointers to the Interstate Identification Index (III) forout-of-State arrests. Both State and Federal ``hot'' files would also bechecked.4. Initial checks would be made of the State and Federal master name indexes.These indexes contain identifying information on persons previously arrestedfor ``printable'' offenses (felonies and serious misdemeanors). Since theseare arrest-based indexes, some of the applicants found on these indexes(e.g., those arrested for a felony but not convicted, those convicted ofmisdemeanors only, and those who were pardoned) will be qualified to purchasefirearms. In those States in which criminal history files are automated,it may be possible to access and evaluate individual files while the gundealer remains on the phone. It may also be possible to access and evaluatesome out-of-State records. (Note that currently several hours are oftenrequired through the NCIC system to obtain records for individuals arrestedin the 20 III States).5. The gun dealer would immediately (i.e., within a few minutes) receivenotice of permission or denial of sale from the designated law enforcementagency. The dealer would receive a transaction number for each inquiryand be required to record the number on each application. Regardless ofwhether or not the sale was made, the dealer would be required to retaina copy of the application and a record of the telephone inquiry. The designatedlaw enforcement agency would retain records of all inquiries for use inaudits of gun dealers. Names of applicants would not be retained on theinquiry data base.6. If the sale was denied, the gun dealer would instruct the applicantthat a Certificate to Purchase may be obtained from a local law enforcementagency.<T3>Secondary verification (Exhibit 3). </T3>1. An applicant who previouslyfailed a telephone check would be required to appear in person, with twopieces of identification, at a law enforcement agency in the State of theapplicant's legal residence. (Special procedures would have to be establishedfor the sale of firearms to out-of-State residents.)2. Each applicant would be fingerprinted, and the fingerprint cards wouldbe mailed to the State criminal history repository.3. The State agency would access in-State automated and manual criminalhistory records and also send the fingerprint cards to the FBI for a checkof out-of-State records.4. If an FBI rap sheet was found for the applicant, the State agency wouldreceive by mail a copy of the records maintained by the FBI's IdentificationDivision. These records would include Federal criminal justice transactionsas well as transactions in the 30 States that do not participate in theInterstate Identification Index (III). Additional information from non-IIIparticipating States could be sought directly from these States throughNLETS. If the applicant had been arrested in a III participating State,as indicated by the FBI records, the State agency would request via NCICadditional records from such a State. If the records so obtained were insufficientlycomplete to make a final determination of eligibility (e.g., lacking dispositiondata), additional information could be sought by telephone or mail inquiryto the relevant courts or prosecutors' offices.5. Based on all the available information, the State agency would makea determination whether there was evidence of a disqualifying convictionand would issue either a Certificate to Purchase or a Notice of Denial.The Certificate to Purchase would be valid for no more than 1 year. Thedesignated State agency would maintain a data base of all certificatesissued. Individuals could renew their certificates by submitting a writtenapplication_no fingerprints would be required. Names of individuals notrenewing their certificates would be purged from the data base at the endof 1 year.6. Copies of the Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial would be sentto the applicant and to the local law enforcement agency submitting thefingerprint card.7. If a Notice of Denial was issued, the applicant would be informed ofhis right to appeal (see Part II, Section 4.)8. If the applicant possessed a Certificate to Purchase and decided topurchase a firearm, the gun dealer would be required to verify, prior tosale, the identity of the purchaser_through two pieces of identification_andthe validity of the certificate_by calling the designated State agencyto check the validity of the Certificate to Purchase against the certificatedata base.<T3>Data sources.</T3> The initial telephone check would scan the Stateand Federal automated name indexes and would access whatever automatedrap sheet data could be immediately retrieved. Access to this informationwould be through a designated law enforcement agency only. (See Part IV,Section 3, and Exhibit 4 for an overview of national access to criminalhistory files.)Obtaining a complete check of out-of-State records would require expandingthe FBI's Automated Identification System-Phase III (AIS-III), which isaccessed through the NCIC telecommunications network. Currently, only thoseindividuals first arrested on or after July 1, 1974, are listed in theAIS-III master name index (approximately 12.5 million persons). The recordsof approximately 8.8 million individuals born in or after 1929 but arrestedbefore July 1, 1974, are <T3>not</T3> currently accessible through the NCIC network.In general, the current name indexes to criminal history data at the Stateand Federal level are arrest-based data sets only, containing identifyinginformation on individuals arrested for felonies and serious misdemeanors.In some instances, for example, if the charges are dropped or if the individualis acquitted or pardoned, States may purge the indexes of these names.With few exceptions, these indexes do not contain information on convictions.These indexes also exclude information on juvenile records. In general,criminal history records on juveniles are only retained in State and Federalfiles if an arrest results in a charge or trial as an adult.The secondary verification procedure utilizes all criminal history databases at the State and Federal levels, including automated and manual records.In addition these may be supplemented by direct queries to courts and prosecutors'offices. State law enforcement officials, who are in the best positionto interpret criminal history records, will determine whether there issufficient evidence of a conviction that meets the Federal standard fordisqualification.An inquiry data base would be created and maintained by the designatedState agency. This data base would record basic information on all inquiriesfrom the gun dealers. For each inquiry, a dealer's license number, a transactionnumber and date, and an outcome code (i.e., approval or denial) would berecorded. This information would be used by BATF for subsequent auditsof gun dealers. Names of applicants would not be retained in this database.A data base containing a list of the Certificates to Purchase and Noticesof Denial would also be created and maintained by the designated Stateagency. This data base would contain basic information on individual applicantswho had previously received a Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial.It would contain an applicant's name, date of birth, race, sex, a flagindicating approval or denial, and (when appropriate) a number assignedto the Certificate to Purchase. The data base could be updated continuouslyfor subsequent disqualifying convictions if fingerprint data or State identificationnumbers were retained for all persons receiving a certificate. After 1year the Certificate to Purchase would expire. A new certificate wouldbe issued if the applicant submitted a renewal form and passed subsequentState and NCIC checks. Renewal would not require resubmission of an applicant'sfingerprints. Identifying information on all other holders would be removedfrom the data base after 1 year. This data base would be used by the Stateagency to verify the validity of certificates at time of purchase. Thedata base would also be used to detect those individuals who were issueda Certificate to Purchase but who were subsequently convicted of a disqualifyingoffense.This data base would also contain names of individuals issued a Noticeof Denial. Such a data base could detect repeated attempts by disqualifiedapplicants to purchase a firearm. Criminal penalties could then be leviedagainst those individuals who attempted to purchase a firearm after receivinga Notice of Denial.<T3>Verification and controls. </T3>Gun dealers would be required to maintaincopies of approved applications and logs of inquiries. However, gun dealerswould not keep copies of rejected applications, which would be sent tothe State. Dealers would receive a transaction number for each inquiryand be required to retain this number for subsequent audits. No sale couldbe made without this number. The designated State law enforcement agencywould be required to maintain records on all inquiries.Gun dealers would be subject to criminal penalties for any false inquiryor disclosure of any information received from a telephone check. Falseinquiries by gun dealers could be quickly detected if computer-generatednotices were sent to subjects of every inquiry. Postcards could be mailedto all persons whose files were accessed. Procedures would be adopted to verify the identity of gun dealers to theState agency. A call-back procedure could be used; for example, the gundealer would call the State agency, provide the dealer codes (includingdealer identifiers from State or Federal licenses), hang up the phone,and wait for a return call from the State agency. An alternative procedureis a single-call method, with a variable password system and dealer codeslinked to a data base maintained by the State agency.<T3>Positive identification. </T3>Positive identification of applicantsby gun dealers prior to the initial telephone check will be limited bythe quality of identification documents presented and by the range of dataelements accessible on the State and Federal master name indexes. Currently,searches of the automated indexes are limited primarily to the applicant'sname, date of birth, race, and sex. The use of additional data elements,such as place of birth, scars and marks, height, weight, eye and hair color,and miscellaneous numbers (for example, Social Security number or driver'slicense number), depends on whether they appear on existing master nameindexes and on their use and accuracy on identification documents. Despiteproblems of identifying individuals based on name and date of birth, numerousStates currently conduct name-based checks on gun applicants. (See PartIV, Section 2, for a description of current State practices in conductingcriminal history checks of prospective firearm purchasers.)Additional efforts to ensure positive identification by the dealer at thetime of purchase could include placement of the applicant's fingerprinton the application form (BATF form 4473, Exhibit 5). The dealer could rollthe print of the applicant's right index finger at time of application.Though this print would not be submitted to the State identification bureau,it may serve as a deterrent to those possessing fraudulent identificationcards. In the future the print on the application could be used in combinationwith an identification card containing a similar print. (See Option A3for further elaboration of fingerprint checks by dealers.)Positive identification of applicants by dealers at the time of purchasemay also be enhanced by continued efforts by States to provide more secureand tamperproof identification documents. In addition, if an applicantprovided a drivers' license as identification to the gun dealer, its validitycould be checked against files maintained by the State department of motorvehicles. This check could be conducted by the same State agency accessingState criminal history records. Even if positive identification could be established by the dealers, theState agency would face problems of ``multiple hits'' (more than one personon the name index with a similar name, date of birth, sex, and race) and``false hits'' (a person on the name index other than the applicant witha name and date of birth similar to the applicant's). Estimates obtainedfrom the FBI, detailed below, indicate that approximately 50% of the caseswhere persons appear to have a criminal history record based upon an initialname search are eventually found to be false hits.<T3>Estimates of volume.</T3> Figures obtained from the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms indicate that approximately 7.5 million new and usedfirearms are sold annually. This figure represents a 10-year average ofdomestic firearms production (adjusting for imports and exports) plus usedgun sales (estimated at about 50% of all sales of new firearms). The 7.5million annual purchases is equivalent to a daily average of more than20,000 sales. Since many stores are likely to be closed on Sundays andto be busier on Saturdays than mid-week and since firearm sales increaseduring hunting season, the number of sales may reach as high as 50,000on peak days.Assuming that a name check will be conducted prior to every purchase, thenumber of inquiries into the Interstate Identification Index (AIS-III)would increase by approximately 70% from the current level of 10.7 millioninquiries a year. However, relative to all inquiries received daily byNCIC, including ``hot'' files as well as AIS-III inquiries, name checksof gun applicants would increase the total number of inquiries by about5% at the peak time during hunting season. The 50,000 additional inquiriesresulting from gun applicants are small relative to the recent 1-day recordof 1.1 million inquiries into NCIC.The number of additional fingerprint cards would vary depending on thehit rate from the name check. This rate can only be estimated indirectly.Assuming that the final hit rate on gun applicants will resemble the ratefor fingerprint-based checks currently conducted by the FBI on applicantcards, an estimated 6-8% of all applicants will be rejected. (There arecurrently no national data on ultimate rejection rates for gun applicants.)Further, if half of all initial hits in a name and date-of-birth checkof gun applicants are false hits (based on FBI estimates for all applicants),then the expected initial hit rate should be between 12% and 16% for allgun applicants. Finally, not all of the initially rejected applicants maysubmit fingerprints for the secondary verification_perhaps 10-14% of allapplicants will submit fingerprint cards.The number of applicants for a Certificate to Purchase will be less thanthe number of purchases, since applicants may buy more than one firearma year. Precise counts of the annual number of purchases per buyer do notexist. However, if we assume that the majority of applicants will buy onlyone firearm and a relatively small number will buy many firearms, the estimateof 1.25 firearms per buyer may be a reasonable expectation. Such an estimatesuggests that an estimated 6 million individuals buy the 7.5 million firearmssold annually.As a result of the above assumptions, we may expect approximately 725,000fingerprint cards on gun applicants as a result of a rejection from thetelephone inquiry by the dealer. Assuming the current 5-day week at theFBI's Identification Division, this represents an additional 3,000 fingerprintcards per day_an increase of nearly 10% in the number of cards receiveddaily.<T3>Additional system flows.</T3>The estimate of 7.5 million new name searchesof automated records and 725,000 new fingerprint checks that would be generatedby this option ignores the fact that many States currently conduct criminalhistory checks of gun purchasers. Twenty-two States and the District ofColumbia (covering more than half of the Nation's population) now conducta pre- or post-purchase criminal history check. Thirteen States and DCaccess Federal and interstate records through NCIC. Six States and DC takefingerprints. Four States and DC include the purchase of all types of firearms;the others, only handguns.Presumably, if Option A were adopted, the new criminal history checks wouldnot be conducted on top of existing checks, for this would create an unnecessaryredundancy. Either (1) States would modify their existing systems and criminalhistory checks to conform to the elements of Option A, or (2) the Federalmandate would accept current preapproval systems as effectively accomplishingthe goals of Option A if certain minimum standards were met. In eithercase if current practice is taken into account, the net new impact on Federaland State repositories would be somewhat less than the estimate of 7.5million new name searches of automated records and 725,000 new fingerprintchecks.Criminal history checks of gun purchasers currently conducted by the Statesaccount for approximately 15% of the projected 7.5 million annual inquiriesinto NCIC under Option A and 8% of the 725,000 fingerprint checks at theFBI. As a result, the additional impact of Option A on NCIC and the FBIIdentification Division is estimated at 6.4 million inquiries and 664,000additional fingerprint cards. At the State level current practices accountfor a somewhat greater proportion of the inquiries required by this option.An estimated 20% of the total 7.5 million name and date-of-birth searchesprojected for State identification bureaus under Option A are currentlyconducted. Consequently, 6.0 million additional inquiries would be requiredat the State level under Option A.Finally, as a result of the proposed expansion of the AIS-III index, theFBI's Identification Division would also need to respond to requests forrecords on the 8.8 million individuals who were born in or after 1929 butarrested for the first time before July 1, 1974. Expansion of this indexwould necessitate the assembly, retrieval, and mailing of an estimated4,000 manual files daily (including 3,000 files to meet anticipated criminaljustice requests plus 1,000 files for firearm applicants).<T3>Identifying convicted felons.</T3> In many, perhaps most, cases theactual criminal history record of an applicant would be examined only whena fingerprint card is submitted. For an estimated 80-90% of all prospectivepurchasers, a check would only be made for the existence of a criminalrecord. For the applicants who were identified by a name and date-of-birthsearch and who subsequently submitted fingerprints, a more complete assessmentof the record would be required.The difficulty of accurately identifying a convicted felon varies fromState to State. In some States felony identification is <T3>automated: </T3>a felony conviction flag exists in the record. In otherStates felony identification is obtained from the State statutory codelisted for each conviction offense. Interpretation of this code is typicallyachieved <T3>manually</T3>, unless a computer program exists to automatically classifystatutory codes as either felony or non-felony offenses. In other Statesfelony identification is only <T3>sometimes possible</T3>. In these States a felony may be determinedwhen a conviction is unambiguously a felony (such as murder or rape) orwhen a free text field exists and the word felony appears in the field.The issue is further complicated by the fact that the State definitionof a felony may not correspond with the definition in the Gun Control Act(an act punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year.)The task of accurately interpreting criminal history records is even moredifficult when an applicant has been arrested in States other than thecurrent State of residence. <T3>FBI records do not contain sufficient information to identify felonsor those convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than 1year</T3>. FBI offense codes are typically recorded as literals (free text)or as numeric NCIC codes. State statutes and text containing the word ``felony''are only infrequently reported.Faced with these difficulties, States currently conducting criminal historysearches on gun applicants employ three strategies: (1) infer a felonyconviction based on sentencing data (e.g., if the record contains a sentenceto incarceration of greater than 1 year, the applicant is identified asa felon); (2) obtain more detailed out-of-State records via NCIC or NLETS,which may designate conviction offenses as felonies; and (3) infer a felonyconviction from a literal description.<T3>Response times. </T3>The initial telephone check would be immediate,within minutes, assuming sufficient resources. Electronic searches of Stateand Federal master name indexes could be conducted while the gun dealerremained on the line. Among the 20 State identification bureaus surveyedfor the Task Force by Fisher-Orsagh Associates, the average in-house responsetime for a non-fingerprint search utilizing a terminal is about 20 seconds(<T3>A Survey of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories, </T3>Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989). Additional minutes would be needed if the Stateagency attempted to reduce the number of false hits by requesting additionalinformation from the gun dealer. An additional 30 seconds would be requiredfor an NCIC check of the AIS-III index.The secondary verification procedure would require approximately 4-6 weeksto complete. Existing searches based on fingerprint cards at the FBI'sIdentification Division are processed within 14 working days. An estimated7 days would also be required for submission of fingerprint cards via themail and return of FBI rap sheets to the State agency. Some additionaltime would be necessary for evaluating criminal history records by thedesignated State agency, including, if necessary, calls to courts or prosecutors'offices.The response time for secondary verification may be reduced once currentautomation procedures at the FBI are fully in place. The FBI anticipatesthat response times will be reduced to somewhere between 2 and 10 days,depending on a proposed expansion of their computer system.Estimates for fingerprint searches conducted by State criminal historyrepositories, which would be simultaneous with the FBI checks, indicatea total response time for a criminal justice inquiry of 3 to 23 workingdays, including mail turnaround time. In the 20 States examined by Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, the average response time for a fingerprint search was 5 days,assuming the search was for a criminal justice purpose. For non-criminal-justicesearches the average increased to a total of 9 days. No significant reductionin this response time is expected in the near future.<T3>Costs. </T3>Of all options, the telephone check with a secondary verificationmay be the least expensive to implement and operate. Costs are kept downby using existing technologies, telecommunication systems, and data sources.Costs are further reduced by limiting fingerprint checks only to thoseindividuals appearing on the master name indexes and by creating a State-leveldata base of Certificates to Purchase and Notices of Denial.For the telephone checks only, the total estimated cost at the State andlocal level includes a start-up cost of $14.3-17.7 million and an additionalannual operating cost of $30.0-39.4 million. The estimated cost of thesecondary verification would include a start-up cost of $8.6 million andan annual operating cost of $10.4-13.3 million. The combined cost for thetelephone checks and secondary verification at the State and local levelwould be between $22.8 and $26.2 million in start-up costs and between$40.3 and $52.6 million in annual operating costs. (For more detailed costfigures, see Exhibit 6 and <T3>Estimates of Start-up and Operational Costs of Systems for IdentifyingFelons Who Attempt to Purchase Firearms, </T3>Fisher-Orsagh Associates,June 1989.)At the Federal level the combined cost for the telephone check and secondaryverification is estimated at $12.7-17.8 million a year. The start-up costis estimated at $13.1-17.3 million.When local, State, and Federal costs are added together, the total estimatedannual operating cost for Option A ranges from $53 million to $70 millionand the total estimated start-up cost ranges from $36 million to $44 million.Note that if existing criminal history checks for gun purchasers are takeninto account, the actual new cost may be somewhat lower than these estimates,perhaps 11-13% lower for operating and start-up costs. On the other hand,these estimates do not include any costs to dealers for new phone linesor staff or to local police for their part in the secondary verification.A substantial portion of the operating costs could be transferred to theindividual applicant through fees for all gun purchases, whether or nota fingerprint search is performed. Given the total annual cost estimates,a fee of $7.07-9.39 per applicant per purchase would be required to coverlocal, State, and Federal costs. <T3>Impact</T3>_1. <T3>Purchasers: </T3>The vast majority of individuals without criminalrecords would have the immediate ability to purchase a firearm. Exceptfor individuals falsely rejected by the search of the master name indexes,those without criminal records would not be burdened by preapproval procedures.2. <T3>Dealers: </T3>In addition to current application procedures, dealerswould be required to make a telephone call prior to every purchase andto create and maintain a log of all inquiries. The time necessary to makethe checks is expected to average about 3 minutes per sale. An additionaltelephone line may be required for some dealers. Among high-volume dealers,additional staff may be required to handle multiple checks simultaneouslywithout generating long waiting lines at the gun shop.3. <T3>Local law enforcement: </T3>Local law enforcement agencies would processan estimated 725,000 applications and fingerprint cards a year as a resultof the secondary verification procedures. This work load may require someadditional staff and funds for agencies currently working at peak levels.4. <T3>State law enforcement: </T3>The State identification agency or otherdesignated agency for applicant checks would experience a large increasein its work load. To process the estimated 7.5 million telephone inquiries,States would need new communications lines, staff to respond to inquiries,additional office space, computer terminals to access the State mastername indexes, and software to build the inquiry data base. State identificationbureaus would also require a 7-day work week with longer hours (or 6 daysif gun sales were prohibited on Sundays).To process the estimated 10% increase in fingerprint cards, States wouldrequire funds, staff, space, and software to maintain a data base on theCertificates to Purchase. (See <T3>A Survey of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories, </T3>Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989, for the ability of specific States to handle a 10%increase in in-house searches of their criminal history files.) Statesmay also be required to establish an administrative appeals procedure forchallenging adverse decisions.5. <T3>NCIC and FBI Identification Division: </T3>The NCIC communicationssystem would experience a minor increase in volume_an increase of 5% ona peak day during hunting season. To process this increase in volume, 16additional lines plus an enhancement to the front-end capacity on the NCICcomputers will be required. The number of additional inquiries into theAIS-III computer, however, would increase by approximately 70%. To handlethis increase, the AIS-III computer must be significantly enhanced. Thetelephone search would also require additional staff at the FBI's IdentificationDivision to process requests for the 8.8 million manual records of offendersarrested for the first time before July 1, 1974, and born in or after 1929.The manual records would be requested through NCIC for all criminal justicepurposes and mailed to the requesting agency by the FBI IdentificationDivision. Based on the estimated 725,000 fingerprint cards submitted annually andthe 4,000 daily requests for manual files through NCIC, approximately 395additional employees may be needed by the Identification Division as aresult of Option A. An estimated 126 of these employees would be technical(e.g., fingerprint technicians, classifiers, and verifiers) and 212 wouldbe typists; all of these would require 3-6 months of training. The FBIwould require 12-18 months to recruit and clear these 395 new employees.These new employees would require nearly 8,000 square feet of additionaloffice space.<T3>Impact of AFIS technology on secondary verification. </T3>At the presenttime the FBI and more than half of the States either have an automatedfingerprint identification system (AFIS) or are in the process of procuringsuch a system. These systems, as currently utilized, require techniciansto classify the prints according to pattern type; the prints are then scanned,digitized, and matched against prints from an AFIS data base. (Note thatnew AFIS equipment has recently been introduced that automates the classificationprocess, but this is not yet a proven technology.) At the end of the matchingprocess, a list of all potential identification candidates is produced,and a technician visually compares the print to the corresponding listand makes the identification decision. (See ``Appendix'' to <T3>Legal and Policy Issues Relating to Biometric Identification Technologies,</T3>SEARCH Group, Inc., June 1989.)Despite the automation of the search process, further implementation ofAFIS technologies will have little impact in the near future on the estimatedresponse times and costs of processing the additional fingerprint cardsgenerated by the secondary verification procedure. The AFIS matching processis time consuming and both labor and machine intensive.<T3>Advantages. </T3>1. Access to criminal history records would be limitedto law enforcement agencies, except that gun dealers would receive noticeof approval or denial. (However, dissemination of any information to gundealers indicating evidence of an arrest may violate existing policiesand statutes of some States.) 2. With the exception of the addition of 8.8 million records to the AIS-IIIindex, the system would utilize existing State and Federal criminal historydata bases. The additional inquiry data base and Certificate data basewould be easily established and maintained at a low cost.3. Access through NCIC to the 8.8 million manual records maintained bythe FBI's Identification Division would have added benefit to law enforcement.Currently, checks are limited to younger offenders and those first arrestedafter 1974. Addition of these records would enhance the level of servicethat the FBI could provide to law enforcement agencies nationwide.4. Compared to other options, the initial telephone check would reducethe burden on State and Federal identification systems. Only an estimated10-14% of all purchases would require a fingerprint search.5. No list of applicants or purchasers would be created. Only those individualsissued a Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial could be identifiedin a data base. The identity of individuals holding certificates wouldbe regularly expunged from the data set within a year of the date of issuance.<T3>Disadvantages. </T3>1. The validity of the telephone check is onlyas reliable as the purchaser's identification documents. It does not provideunique identification as do the more expensive fingerprint or other biometricsystems. Consequently, prohibited individuals intent on obtaining a firearmwith false identification documents would be able to pass the telephonecheck.2. A major burden would be placed on the State agency accessing the repositorydata and on local law enforcement agencies that issue the fingerprint cards.The extent of the burden would depend on the volume of requests and degreeof record automation. Further automation of State master name indexes andcriminal history files would be encouraged.3. The system would not be immediate for individuals rejected by the searchof the master name indexes. In addition, some individuals may be falselyidentified because their name and date of birth match those of anotherindividual. Extensive false hits could generate considerable adverse reaction.4. Rejection of prospective buyers as a result of telephone checks maybe perceived by gun dealers as a cause for lost revenue. Buyers who ultimatelyqualify for purchase may not always return to the original dealer and makethe purchase.5. Occasionally the State or NCIC computer systems may not be operatingat the time of purchase, resulting in delays and possibly loss of revenueto the gun dealer. (See modification 8 for procedures in the event of systemfailure.) <T3>Potential modifications. </T3>1. The secondary verification procedurecould be modified so that applicants would only be required to appear ata law enforcement agency to be fingerprinted if the State repository wasunable to make a positive determination of eligibility after receivingall automated criminal history records. This could take up to a day ortwo. If the State repository could not determine an applicant's identityor resolve questions of eligibility, the applicant would then be fingerprintedat a local law enforcement agency, and the fingerprint cards would be submittedto the State identification bureau and the FBI for evaluation.This modification could reduce the burden on applicants eligible to purchasefirearms. Applicants with prior arrests but qualified to purchase firearms(e.g., those not convicted of any offense, those convicted only of crimesnot meeting the Federal definition of a felony, or those pardoned) wouldnot automatically be fingerprinted or required to wait the projected 4-6weeks for a complete fingerprint check and evaluation of records.This modification would also reduce the volume of additional fingerprintcards submitted to the State identification bureaus and the FBI.2. A fingerprint could be placed on the BATF application (form 4473). Oncegiven approval for purchase, the gun dealer would roll a print of the applicant'sright index finger, for example. Although this print would not be submittedto the State identification bureau, it could greatly enhance BATF's abilityto prosecute applicants who provide false information. In addition, requiringan applicant to provide a fingerprint on the application form may serveas a deterrent to those who possess fraudulent indentification cards butwho are reluctant to submit fingerprints.3. An applicant data base could be created and maintained by the Stateidentification bureau. This data base would be queried first when a purchasercheck was conducted. It would contain basic information on individual applicantswho had been previously approved through a point-of-sale name check ora secondary verification procedure. The data base would include an applicant'sname, date of birth, race, sex, and a flag indicating approval for purchase.The data base could be updated continuously for subsequent disqualifyingconvictions. Once individuals received approval, no additional searchesof their criminal history files would be conducted for subsequent purchases.This option could eliminate the need for a Certificate to Purchase.If States constructed this data base, the number of name searches and printsearches could be significantly reduced. Fears that such a data base wouldcreate a list of gun purchasers could be allayed by requiring States tosystematically purge records after a 2 or 3 year period. Moreover, sucha data base could be limited to those who failed the telephone check andthen passed the secondary verification; thus, only a small portion of allgun purchasers would be included.4. Point-of-sale approval requirements could be relaxed for certain typesof dealers. Low-volume dealers and those selling at gun shows could beexempted from the telephone checks. However, to regulate purchases of firearmsfrom these dealers, State law enforcement agencies could be required toperform random criminal history checks on those who have purchased firearmsfrom these low-volume dealers.5. Fingerprint searches in the secondary verification process could belimited to the repository within the applicant's State of residence. Federaldata bases would be searched only on name, date of birth, race, and sex.Applicants found to have out-of-State rap sheets would be required to appealto the State repositories maintaining the disqualifying records. This modificationwould have two good effects: (a) a reduction of response time for secondaryverification, and (b) no need to evaluate out-of-State records. However,a major disadvantage is that once a hit is made through NCIC, the burdenof certifying qualification to purchase would be shifted to the applicant.6. To increase reliability, applicants for specific types of guns couldbe required to be fingerprinted and would not be eligible for a telephonecheck.7. To ensure that excess delay in making an eligibility decision did notunduly interfere with the rights of qualified purchasers, the system couldinclude firm deadlines for governmental action at various stages. Failureto meet a deadline would allow the sale to proceed. Ineligible purchaserswould still be subject to subsequent prosecution.8. In the event of a computer system failure or interruption in telecommunications,gun dealers could be permitted to proceed with the sale. Once system functionswere resumed, dealers would be required to conduct the telephone checks.If an illegal purchase had been made, the State agency accessing the repositorydata would notify law enforcement agencies. Alternatively, firearm salescould be postponed until the computer and telecommunications systems wereagain operational or until a specified period of time had elapsed.See also the discussion of establishing a data base of ineligible personsin Part I.<ITAG tagnum="81">OPTION A1: TERMINAL ACCESS BY GUN DEALER TO DISQUALIFYING INFORMATION</ITAG>This option is a variant of Option A, described above, but instead of thegun dealer calling a law enforcement agency, which would access criminalhistory records electronically, the dealer would directly access an intermediarycomputer that would review the indexes and transmit ``accept'' or ``reject''notices to the dealer. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would present the same identification documents to thedealer as required under Option A.2. The dealer would use a terminal in the shop to access an intermediarycomputer that would review criminal history indexes and transmit authorizationor denial notices to the gun dealer's terminal. (Special passwords wouldbe required to prevent unauthorized access. Transaction logs would be maintainedby the State or NCIC to monitor inquiries.)3. If the notice was to ``accept,'' the sale could be completed immediately.If the notice was to ``reject'' (indicating the existence of a printableoffense), the applicant would be directed to a local police departmentto initiate the secondary verification process. 4. Subsequent procedures follow Option A.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> All advantages and disadvantagesnoted in Option A apply to this option except as follows:1. The costs for installation of a terminal in each dealership would besubstantial. Training would also be required in the use and maintenanceof the terminals. Procedures for passwords and logs would also be required.2. Access through an intermediary computer would require a new computercapability at the Federal level and in each of the 50 States. Such a capabilitycould be costly.3. There would be no noticeable reduction in response times, since telephonechecks under Option A would also be completed on a real-time basis.<T3>Estimated cost.</T3> See discussion under Option A2.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A2: Touch-Tone Telephone Access by Gun Dealer to DisqualifyingInformation</ITAG>This option is the same as Option A1 above, but substitutes a touch-tonetelephone for terminal access. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would provide identification to the dealer as requiredunder Option A.2. Using a touch-tone telephone and a toll-free number, the dealer wouldaccess an intermediary computer, as in Option A1, and would enter his licensenumber to prove eligibility. The communications system would establisha log of the transaction. The dealer would then enter the applicant's digitizedname and other identifiers.3. The message would be received by the State repository or NCIC and checkedagainst a master name index.4. The dealer would be advised of the ``accept'' or ``reject'' status only.5. If rejected, the applicant would be advised to seek secondary verificationthrough a local police department. Subsequent procedures would follow OptionA.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> The advantages and disadvantageswould also be similar to those for Options A and A1; however, the costsmay be lower than Option A1 since terminals would not have to be installedat all dealers.<T3>Estimated cost.</T3> Although Options A1 and A2 do not present anyparticular operational advantages over the simpler Option A, they wouldbe more complicated and costly to set up. Thus, in the short term theydo not have any benefits over Option A. Nonetheless, it is possible thatby directly and electronically connecting gun dealers to disqualifyinginformation, Options A1 and A2, or others like them, would prove less expensivein the long run than Option A with its need for numerous new personnelin the State repositories to field the calls from gun dealers.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A3: Live Scan of Fingerprints by Gun Dealer</ITAG>This option differs from other variants of Option A in that fingerprintswould be taken directly at the point of sale and digitized for transmissionto the record repository. Records would be scanned on the basis of fingerprints.The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would place his hands into a fingerprint scanner, whichwould be maintained and operated by the dealer.2. Digitized fingerprint data on all 10 fingers would be transmitted tothe State repository.3. At the State repository, a fingerprint technician would calculate thepattern types of the 10 fingers and then select a subfile of the data basefor a subsequent automated search. Fingerprints would be checked againsta criminal history data base, a fingerprint index, or a specially createddata base of disqualified persons.4. If the search resulted in a list of potential candidates, a fingerprinttechnician would examine the candidate prints and make a determinationof identification.5. Based on the search, an ``accept'' or ``reject'' message would be sentto the gun shop. Fingerprints of accepted applicants would not be retainedby the State identification bureau.6. If a rejection was based on a check against a fingerprint index only,the applicant would be advised to initiate secondary verification. If arejection was based on a full record check or check against a special disqualificationdata base, the denial would be final, but the applicant would be advisedof appeal procedures.<T3>Additional characteristics.</T3> 1. Dealers would be required to install10-finger scanning equipment including a capability to transmit the scandata to the State repository and the ability to receive ``accept'' or ``reject''messages from the repository.2. States would need: (a) the capability of receiving the 10-finger scandata, (b) fingerprint technicians to determine pattern types and subfilesto be searched, (c) the ability to search files based on pattern type anddigitized minutiae, (d) the ability to compare applicant prints to candidatefile-prints and determine identification, and (e) the ability to transmitresults to the dealer.3. In order to check for out-of-State arrests, the system would requirethe FBI to set up a mechanism for receiving digitized fingerprint datafrom State repositories, which currently use several incompatible AFISsystems. 4. Response times would include an estimated 6 minutes to scan 10 fingersat the shop, 1-6 minutes for a technician to classify the prints, and 1minute to verify a match from the search file. An additional 5-15 minuteswould likely be required to search the fingerprint file (depending on thesearch procedures, the size of the data base, and the availability of computerequipment). This is an estimated total of 13-28 minutes.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> 1. Use of fingerprints ensures accuracyof identification at the gun shop. In a properly functioning system, noone who had previously been fingerprinted for a crime would escape detection.2. There would be a substantial reduction in the number of secondary verifications,perhaps as much as 50-80% over Option A.3. A major disadvantage is the extremely high cost of developing, installing,and maintaining on-site equipment and transmission lines. Training fordealers would also be required to obtain properly scanned fingerprints.High-volume dealers would require multiple scanners and additional staff.4. Indexes to Federal and State criminal history files would have to beupgraded and made compatible with fingerprint data transmitted from theon-site scanners. At a minimum, indexes to current criminal history fileswould require upgrading.5. Response times (13-28 minutes) would be longer than the telephone checkof the basic Option A.<T3>Estimated cost.</T3> Because of the novel and complicated nature ofthis option and its use of technologies still under development, it hasbeen possible to estimate only part of the costs of setting up such a system.Consequently, the following estimates should be viewed as only a roughmeasure of system costs. For a system involving live fingerprint scan at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $9.6-27.1 billion and annual operating costs (assumingequipment depreciation and maintenance) at $3.0-8.3 billion. For a systemrestricting live scan to commercial dealers (an estimated 35% of all dealers),total start-up costs would be an estimated $3.5-9.6 billion and annualoperating costs would be $1.2-3.1 billion.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option A4: Biometric Identification Card</ITAG>This option is not so much an alternative to the basic Option A as a distinctfeature that could be added to it. The system requires that the applicantobtain a State-issued identification card that incorporates biometric information,name, date of birth, and other standard identifiers. This card could bea general-purpose card, such as a driver's license, or a special-purposecard for gun purchases. The biometric information could be an actual fingerprinton the card, or it could be a digitized representation of biometric informationmagnetically encoded on the card. This option also requires that dealershave equipment able to read the applicant's fingerprints, or other biometricinformation, and compare them against characteristics on the card. Thesystem would work as follows:1. The applicant would obtain a card from the State with biometric identifiers.2. The applicant would present the card to the dealer. The dealer wouldthen use equipment to compare the biometric data from the applicant withthe information on the card.3. If there was a match, the dealer would proceed with an inquiry to theState repository either (a) by telephone, as in Option A, or (b) if thecard was in a digitized format, through a device that could communicatewith an external database over telephone lines (as is used in approvingcredit card purchases).4. The remaining procedures follow Option A.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. The use of biometric informationon the ID card and the subsequent biometric check at the gun shop wouldenhance the reliability of the identification check by making it substantiallymore difficult for such an identification document to be counterfeitedor altered. However, other technologies also exist, such as holograms,to enhance the security of identification documents. Moreover, the biometriccard does not solve the problem of individuals using fraudulent ``breeder''documents, such as birth certificates, to obtain the biometric ID card.2. Prior recording of biometric identification data on the card eliminatesthe need for transmission of biometric data from the dealer to the centralfacility.3. On-site equipment to check biometric data at the point of sale wouldbe expensive to install, maintain, and operate. Dealers would have to betrained.4. Interstate coordination, perhaps requiring the collection and maintenanceof fingerprints for all applicants, would be necessary to prevent applicantsfrom obtaining separate ID cards in different States using different names.This would be important since subsequent inquiries to State or NCIC databases would be based on name rather than fingerprints.5. Biometrically supported identification could be used to link the dealerwith data bases of other ineligible firearm purchasers, such as those dishonorablydischarged from the Armed Forces.6. Regulations would have to be issued to govern action by dealers if applicantswere discovered to be using false identification (for example, where anapplicant's fingerprints did not match data on the card).<T3>Estimated cost. </T3>The following cost estimates do not include anycosts associated with producing and distributing a biometric identificationcard.For a system involving a biometric check at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $198-368 million and annual operating costs at $102-168million. For a system restricting the biometric check to commercial dealers(an estimated 35% of all dealers), total start-up costs would be an estimated$93-158 million and annual operating costs would be $70-105 million.Section 3. Prior Approval Systems<ITAG tagnum="81">Option B: Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) Card</ITAG>Each State would develop a system for issuing a Firearms Owner's Identification(FOID) Card, which would be required for purchasing any firearm and wouldbe valid for up to 3 years from the date of issue. This system, which wouldbe quite similar to the secondary verification of Option A, would havethe following requirements:<T3>System description (Exhibit 3).</T3> 1. Prior to purchase of a firearm,each applicant would be required to appear at a law enforcement agencywithin the jurisdiction of the applicant's legal residence.2. Each applicant would be fingerprinted and photographed, and the fingerprintcards and photograph would be submitted to the State criminal history repositoryand to the FBI's Identification Division for a fingerprint check.3. Results from the FBI fingerprint check would be returned to the designatedState agency for evaluation.4. Additional records could be obtained directly from other State repositoriesor from courts or prosecutors' offices, as described in the discussionof the secondary verification procedures of Option A.5. State officials would evaluate the records from all sources to determinewhether the applicant was eligible to purchase a firearm. The designatedState agency would issue a FOID card or Notice of Denial. The State agencywould maintain a data base on all FOID cards.6. If a Notice of Denial was issued, the applicant would be informed ofthe right to appeal.7. The State agency would periodically issue to all gun dealers a listingof all invalid FOID cards.8. If the applicant possessed a FOID card and wished to purchase a firearm,the gun dealer would be required to verify, prior to sale, the identityof the purchaser and the validity of the card. The applicant would fillout an application for purchase, which would require an additional pieceof identification. The gun dealer would check the listing of invalid FOIDcards.9. If the sale was denied, the gun dealer would instruct the applicanton the procedures for an appeal. The gun dealer would send a copy of theapplication to the appeals agency.<T3>Data sources. </T3>Fingerprint searches would utilize all existingcriminal history data bases at the State and Federal levels. Manual aswell as automated files would be searched. Approval of an application fora FOID card would not require an immediate search for out-of-State records;consequently, the AIS-III index would not have to be modified (as in OptionA). Searches of records on individuals who were arrested before 1974 wouldutilize the current procedures of the FBI's Identification Division.A FOID card data base would be maintained by the State identification bureauor designated State agency. This data base would contain basic informationon applicants who had previously received a card. It would contain theapplicant's name, date of birth, race, sex, other identifying information,and the FOID card number and expiration date. The data base could be regularlyupdated by the State identification bureau for subsequent disqualifyingconvictions if fingerprint data or State identification numbers were retainedfor all persons receiving a FOID card. The State agency would issue ona regular basis lists of invalid FOID cards. Unless the applicant electedto renew the FOID card, the data base would be purged of all applicantinformation after the expiration date.<T3>Verification and controls. </T3>Gun dealers would be required to maintaincopies of all applications and the purchaser's FOID card number. Gun dealerswould be subject to State or Federal audits. Dealers would be subject tocriminal penalties for false records of sale and to loss of license forincomplete records.Access to criminal history records would be restricted to law enforcementagencies.If a card holder became prohibited from purchasing firearms after the FOIDcard had been issued, a Letter of Revocation would be sent by the Stateagency to the individual. The State agency would be required to send allgun dealers a listing of invalid FOID cards. No attempt would be made torecall invalid cards or firearms.<T3>Positive identification.</T3> Positive identification of applicantsby gun dealers could be enhanced by placing the applicant's picture andfingerprint on the FOID card. Requiring the applicant to provide at leastone additional document with a picture identification would provide furtherconfirmation of identity by the gun dealer.Security provisions could be introduced to the FOID card, which would increasethe difficulty and costs of counterfeiting. States could also be encouragedto develop better procedures for issuing breeder documents and securingexisting cards (such as driver's licenses) from counterfeiting.An applicant's fingerprint could also be placed on the BATF application(form 4473, Exhibit 5) at the time of purchase. This requirement wouldnot only enhance BATF's ability to prosecute applicants who provide falseinformation but also serve as a deterrent to individuals with false documentswho may be reluctant to provide a fingerprint.<T3>Out-of-State sales.</T3> The sales of firearms to out-of-State residentseither at a gun shop or through the mail is currently restricted by Federallaw to long guns (e.g., rifles and shotguns). With few exceptions, interstatesales of handguns are prohibited. Under Option B applicants possessinga FOID card issued in one State would be permitted to purchase a long gunin another State; however, <T3>applicants could only obtain FOID cards in their State of residence.</T3>Three procedures may be adopted to check qualifications of out-of-Statepurchasers: (a) dealers may be required to call a national toll-free numberfor a check of NCIC files or a national list of invalid FOID cards; (b)dealers may be required to call the State agency that issued the FOID card;or (c) out-of-State residents may be required to obtain a Certificate toPurchase from a local law enforcement agency.The first procedure would require the nonresident applicant to fill outthe BATF application and present the out-of-State FOID card plus anotherphoto-identification card to the dealer. The dealer would be required tocall a national center, which would conduct a name and date-of-birth searchof State and Federal files through NCIC. The dealer would receive a messageof acceptance or denial. If the sale was denied, the applicant would beadvised of the right to appeal; however, all appeals would be conductedwithin the applicant's State of residence.The second procedure for sales to nonresidents would require the dealerto call the State agency that issued the FOID card. All dealers would receivea listing of phone numbers of State agencies that issue FOID cards. Specialsecurity provisions (such as call-back procedures, dealer codes, and variablepasswords) would be established in each State to verify the identity ofthe out-of-State dealers.The third procedure would require that nonresident applicants obtain aCertificate to Purchase from a local law enforcement agency within theState of purchase. Prior to purchase of a long gun, the applicant wouldsubmit the out-of-State FOID card and other identification documents toa local law enforcement agency; a name and date-of-birth check of NCICfiles would be conducted; if the applicant had no prior disqualifying record,the applicant would be issued a Certificate to Purchase. The certificatewould be valid for 1 month.<T3>Identifying felons.</T3> The problems of interpreting criminal historyrecords are the same as those discussed in Option A. Accurate interpretationof in-State, out-of-State, and Federal records, though difficult, couldbe achieved given sufficient resources and time.<T3>Response times.</T3> The fingerprint search procedures (including mailhandling) and evaluation of records would require under current practicean estimated 4-6 weeks. (See Option A for details on how response timesare estimated for the equivalent secondary verification procedure.)Some reduction in the average response time could be achieved if Statefingerprint searches produced evidence of disqualifying convictions oryielded an FBI number before the results of the FBI fingerprint check werereceived. In the former case the applicant would be disqualified on thebasis of the State records alone; in the latter case the FBI number couldbe used to do an immediate query of Federal and out-of-State records throughNCIC.<T3>Expected number of cards issued annually.</T3> The proposed FOID cardwould be required of all purchasers of firearms. Unlike the current systemin Illinois (see part IV, section 2), FOID cards would not be requiredof current owners or those wishing to buy ammunition. Start-up of the proposedFOID card system would begin with new buyers only.Data on FOID card applications in the State of Illinois provide some basisfor estimating the number of cards to be issued nationwide under OptionB. Nearly 200,000 FOID cards are issued annually in Illinois. Relativeto the resident population age 18 or older in Illinois (8.5 million), thisfigure represents a rate of 2.4 cards per 100 adult residents. If thisrate were applied to all adult residents in the United States, the expectednumber of cards issued annually would exceed 4.2 million in 1990. A FOIDcard valid for only 3 years, instead of 5 years in Illinois, would generatea larger estimate_nearly 6 million cards issued yearly.Because the proposed FOID card system for the Nation is restricted to firearmpurchases only (and excludes requirements for possession of a firearm orpurchase of ammunition), the annual number of cards issued should be somewhatless than the 6 million, based on projections from the Illinois system.However, based on figures from Option A, an estimated 6 million individualsbuy the 7.5 million firearms sold annually. Consequently, in the firstyear of start-up, the estimated number of FOID cards issued cannot be lessthan 6 million. Once the system has been implemented, the number of cardsissued annually should diminish. Though no data exist on the number ofrepeat buyers from year to year, if we estimate that about a sixth of buyersin any one year purchased a firearm in the previous year, then the estimatednumber of cards issued annually should approach 5 million in the long run.Current practices of the District of Columbia and the 22 States that conducta pre- or post-purchase criminal history check would reduce the net impactof Option B by approximately 8%. As a result, the total projected increasein fingerprint cards at the State and Federal levels would be approximately5.5 million in the first year and 4.6 million in subsequent years.The resultant number of fingerprint checks at the FBI would represent morethan a doubling of civil (applicant) fingerprint cards (from the currentfigure of 4 million cards). Overall, the FOID card procedure would increasethe total number of fingerprint cards submitted to the FBI's IdentificationDivision from 8.4 million to 13.0 million_an increase of approximately55%. <T3>Impact_</T3>1. <T3>Purchasers: </T3>Individuals without criminal records would not havethe immediate ability to purchase a firearm. Those without criminal recordswould be required to have fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agencyand be required to wait an estimated 4-6 weeks to obtain a FOID card. Oncea purchaser possessed a card, there would be no additional waiting periodduring the time the card was valid.2. <T3>Dealers: </T3> Little additional burden would be placed on gun dealers.Gun dealers would not be required to place any calls to law enforcementagencies for clearance prior to a sale. Dealers would be required to enterthe FOID card number on each application form and review the lists of invalidFOID cards prior to each sale. Dealers would not perceive a loss of salesas a result of buyers being rejected in the shop at time of sale.<T3>3. State law enforcement: </T3>States would experience a substantialincrease in work load. Local law enforcement agencies would process additionalpaperwork and fingerprint cards. In the long run, the number of fingerprintcards would increase on average by 55% in each of the State identificationbureaus. States would also need to establish an administrative staff tocoordinate processing of appeals, to conduct system audits, and to coordinateaudits of gun dealers.4. <T3>FBI Identification Division: </T3>The FBI's work load would dramaticallyincrease. Based on the long-term projection of 5 million fingerprint cardssubmitted annually, as many as 1,700 additional employees may be neededby the Identification Division. Approximately 550 of these employees wouldhold technical positions (e.g., fingerprint technicians, classifiers, andverifiers) and 520 would be typists; all of these would require an estimated3-6 months of training. The FBI would need several years to recruit andclear these 1,700 new employees, assuming this is even possible. Moreover,it would require an additional 31,000 square feet of office space.<T3>Costs. </T3>The annual operating cost at the State and local levelis estimated to be between $71 million and $91 million. (For detailed costestimates, see Exhibit 6 and Estimates of Start-up and Operational Costsof Systems for Identifying Felons Who Attempt to Purchase Firearms, Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989.) State and local law enforcement agencies wouldalso require an estimated $72 million for start-up costs.At the Federal level the estimated cost for processing the anticipated5 million fingerprint cards a year is $65-70 million, and the cost forstart-up is $77-81 million.Overall, when local, State, and Federal costs are combined, the estimatedannual operating cost for Option B is $136-161 million, and the estimatedstart-up cost is $148-153 million.If the annual operating costs were transferred to applicants through userfees, a fee of $27.28-32.39 per FOID card application would be requiredto cover local, State, and Federal costs.Note that if current fingerprint checks for gun purchasers are taken intoaccount, the actual new costs may be slightly lower than these estimates_perhaps 5% lower for start-up costs and 8% lower for annual operating costs.<T3>Advantages. </T3>1. The system would utilize existing data sources,communications systems, and search procedures.2. Access to criminal history records would be limited to law enforcementagencies. Gun dealers would receive only a listing of invalid card numbers.3. Positive identification for those with a criminal history record couldbe established at the time of application for the FOID card. Unlike OptionA, an estimated 6-8% of the individual applicants would not be falselyrejected and suffer potential embarrassment at the gun shop because theyhad a name and date of birth similar to that of someone with a criminalrecord.4. Use of the FOID card would make purchase of firearms more convenientby eliminating point-of-sale criminal history checks. Only one criminalhistory check would be required in a 3-year period regardless of the numberof firearms purchased. 5. This system would be much less burdensome to the gun dealer than thepoint-of-sale options.6. FOID cards would be State based, and their use could be restricted tothe purchase of firearms only. Individuals would be required to possessa FOID card at the time of purchase but not for subsequent transport, possession,or use of firearms.See also the discussion in Part I of establishing a data base of ineligiblepersons.<T3>Disadvantages. </T3>1. Individuals without criminal records would nothave the immediate ability to purchase a firearm and would be requiredto have fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agency. The processingof applications for FOID cards could take approximately 4-6 weeks. Theremay also be public resistance to systematic fingerprinting of all firearmpurchasers.2. Fingerprint searches are slow and costly and place heavy demands onState and Federal repositories, which are having difficulties with currentwork loads. 3. A State FOID card system would create a list of all persons with validcards. Though essential to verification and prevention of forgery and fraud,the creation of such a list may be controversial. (Strict limitations couldbe placed on access to the FOID card data bases in each of the States.Uses of the data bases for any purpose other than verifying the validityof FOID cards could be restricted by State or Federal statute. Establishmentof a national data base of FOID cards or out-of-State access to State-leveldata bases could be prohibited.)<T3>Potential modifications_</T3>1. Fingerprint searches may be limitedto the repository within the applicant's State of residence. Federal databases would be searched only on name, date of birth, race, and sex. Inorder to accomplish this, the AIS-III index would have to be expanded toinclude individuals arrested before 1974. State repositories would assembleFederal and out-of-State records from automated and manual FBI files plusadditional records obtained from NCIC. This modification would substantiallyreduce the FBI's burden in conducting fingerprint checks while increasingits burden in providing manual records in response to NCIC inquiries. Thenet effect could be a reduction in burden to the FBI. This modificationin Option B would also potentially reduce response times and system costs.A major disadvantage would be decreased reliability in searches of Federaland out-of-State records since name searches of automated records are lessreliable than fingerprint-based searches.2. A notarized statement of eligibility from an applicant could be substitutedfor fingerprint checks (similar to procedures in Illinois). Fingerprintchecks would not be performed. Verification and control procedures couldbe introduced through random criminal history checks conducted by Stateidentification bureaus. Criminal sanctions could be imposed on individualswho falsify information on the application form. State repositories andFederal officials would be given authority to conduct audits, to revokeFOID cards, and to impose criminal sanctions on fraudulent applicants.Major advantages of this modification would include: (a) the burdens onState and Federal repositories would be reduced; (b) the burden on applicantswould be limited to obtaining a notarized statement; and (c) response timefrom application to issuance of card could be reduced from the 4-6 weeksin Option B. The major disadvantage would be an increased potential forfraud by disqualified applicants.3. Fingerprints could be required only for the initial issuance of theFOID card. Renewals could be based on a name and date-of-birth search only.As a result of this modification, the annual number of fingerprint searchescould be reduced by about a third.4. The FBI Identification Division could build a ``stop file.'' Applicantprint cards could be added to the existing criminal files or to a specialFOID card file. State identification bureaus could then be notified bythe FBI when a FOID card holder was subsequently convicted of a disqualifyingoffense. As a result of this modification, FOID cards would not have tobe restricted to a 3-year term; consequently, the number of fingerprintcards sent to the State and the FBI would be reduced. Major disadvantagesof this procedure would include: (a) a substantial increase in the numberof non-criminal fingerprint cards retained by the FBI and (b) increasedfears that such a data base would create a Federal list of gun owners andthat it could be used for other criminal justice or investigative purposes.5. The proposed system could be modified so that FOID cards would be requiredonly of purchasers of specific types of guns. <ITAG tagnum="81">Option B1: Live Scan of Fingerprints by Local Law Enforcement andBiometric Check by Gun Dealer</ITAG>This option is a variant of the preapproval system described in OptionB. In this variation gun buyers would be fingerprinted by local law enforcement;State and Federal criminal history files would be electronically checkedby the local law enforcement agency; individuals would be notified of theresults while at the law enforcement agency; if approved, individuals wouldbe issued a FOID card; if rejected, individuals would be advised of appealprocedures. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would go to a designated law enforcement agency to obtaina FOID card.2. The applicant would place all 10 fingers into a fingerprint scanner,which would be maintained and operated by the local law enforcement agency.3. Digitized fingerprint data would be transmitted to the State identificationbureau.4. At the State identification bureau, a fingerprint technician would calculatethe pattern type, which would identify the subfile of the State fingerprintdata base. The subfile would then be searched for potential matches.5. If the search resulted in a list of potential matches, a fingerprinttechnician would examine the prints and determine identity.6. If a match was found, a technician at the State identification bureauwould inspect the criminal record for disqualifying convictions. If theapplicant was disqualified, the local law enforcement agency would be immediatelynotified and the applicant would receive a Notice of Denial.7. If a match was not found in the State files (or if the applicant hadno disqualifying convictions), the digitized fingerprints, pattern types,and other identifying information would be transmitted by the State identificationbureau to the FBI. The FBI would subsequently conduct an electronic searchof the national fingerprint files, master name index, and criminal historyfiles.8. If a match was found in the FBI files, the State identification bureauwould receive (by NLETS) copies of the automated records and (by mail)copies of the manual records. If automated, the State would evaluate therecords and transmit results to local law enforcement. If manual, the Statewould notify the law enforcement agency that a record was found and thatthe applicant could return within 7 work days to receive a FOID card orNotice of Denial.9. If an applicant was issued a FOID card, the State identification bureauwould retain a copy of the applicant's fingerprints. A print of eitherthe thumb or index finger would be imprinted on the FOID card.10. At the gun shop, purchasers would present the card to the dealer. Thedealer would then use equipment to scan the applicant's fingerprint (oneprint). The equipment would compare the applicant's print to the printon the FOID card. 11. The dealer would call the State identification bureau. The FOID carddata base would be examined to determine whether the person in the gunshop was the same person who applied for the card, whether the card hadbeen reported lost or stolen or had expired, or whether the person hadbeen subsequently convicted of a felony.12. The dealer would receive notice of approval or denial of sale fromthe State identification bureau. As a result of a denial, applicants wouldbe advised of appeal procedures.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. Advantages include: (a) Shorterresponse time to obtain a permit_a majority of applicants could, withinan hour, receive a valid FOID card from local law enforcement; (b) theability to increase the reliability of identification at the gun shop;(c) the ability to identify FOID cards as lost, stolen, lapsed, or disqualified;and (d) the enhancement of automated fingerprint processing for all lawenforcement purposes.2. Disadvantages include: (a) The high costs of start-up and operations;(b) the requirement for equipment and software that are currently beingtested or yet to be developed; (c) the need for modifying existing Stateand Federal data bases to interface with digitized fingerprint information;(d) the incompatibility of the existing AFIS systems, currently producedby four different vendors, with each other and with the FBI; (e) additionalautomation of State indexes and criminal history files; (f) public resistanceto a data base that identified all FOID card holders; (g) significant increasedburden on local law enforcement agencies; and (h) the need for additionalfingerprint technicians and record evaluators at State identification bureaus.<T3>Estimated costs. </T3>Because of the novel and complicated nature ofthis option and its use of technologies still under development, it hasbeen possible to estimate only part of the costs of setting up such a system.Consequently, the following estimates should be viewed as only a roughmeasure of system costs.For a system involving a biometric check at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $344-572 million and annual operating costs at $203-295million. For a system restricting the biometric check to commercial dealers(an estimated 35% of all dealers), total start-up costs could be an estimated$239-362 million and annual operating costs would be $171-232 million.<ITAG tagnum="81">Option B2: Smart Card Containing Disqualifying Information</ITAG>In this variation of a preapproval system, everyone would carry a card(e.g., a driver's license) that would have electronically imprinted identificationinformation, including biometric data such as fingerprints. Whenever someonebecame legally disqualified to purchase a firearm (for example, by beingconvicted of a felony), the card would be updated to contain this information.Anyone attempting to buy a firearm would have to produce the card. Thecard would be put into a reader that would indicate whether the carrierwas prohibited from purchasing firearms.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. The major advantage is that thisprocedure would not require a communications system_the disqualifying informationwould be on the card itself.2. A major disadvantage is the cost of implementing such a radically newidentification system and providing criminal justice agencies with thefacilities to update these cards.3. There may be substantial public resistance to the requirement to carrysuch a card, especially since the need for interstate coordination mayrequire the creation of biometric data bases for the Nation's adult population.<T3>Estimated costs. </T3>Sufficient information does not currently existto make reliable cost estimates of this novel and far-reaching option.Section 4. Appeal ProceduresThe appeals process commences at the point that the applicant receivesfinal notice that the sale has been denied and has been notified of thereasons for denial. This may occur after ``secondary verification'' (OptionA) or after denial of a firearm owner's identification (FOID) card (OptionB). As described in both options, fingerprint checks against State andFederal data bases would have been completed prior to final denial andinitiation of the appeal period.During the appeal, the applicant may challenge the denial on grounds thatthe data are inaccurate (e.g., an acquittal was recorded as a conviction);that the record is incomplete (e.g., a subsequent pardon was not recordedin the data base); or that the offense does not represent a disqualifyingoffense under the Federal or State standards. Challenges based on inaccurateidentification would not occur at the appeals stage since fingerprint checksprior to denial would, presumably, catch errors of this type. The appealsprocess would proceed as follows:1. Following final denial, the applicant is advised of rights to appealand given a document to initiate the appeal.2. The applicant would go to the agency designated to handle appeals (orwould submit documents to a nonlocal appeals agency).3. The applicant would be provided a copy of the criminal history recordthat was used as the basis for disqualification.4. The applicant would indicate the basis for the appeal. The appeals agencywould assist the applicant either directly or indirectly by providing names,addresses, or telephone numbers for inquiries to in-State or out-of-Stateagencies.5. If errors could not be corrected on the spot or by telephone, the applicantwould obtain and submit to the appeals agency documents supporting eligibility(for example, court records of acquittal, pardon, or restoration of rights).6. The appeals agency would then review the documentation and rule on theappeal. If eligibility was established, the individual would receive aFOID card or Certificate to Purchase.7. If eligibility was denied, the applicant would be advised of rightsto a court challenge.<T3>Additional considerations. </T3>1. The agency (or agencies) assignedresponsibility for appeals must be determined. The agency could be thedecision agency (State or Federal), a local agency, or a separate entity(State or Federal). Although the latter option would provide an independentreview, the decision agency would probably be more familiar with the criminalhistory records. Local agencies would best serve as a conduit to the officialappeals agency rather than as the agency responsible to rule on the appeal.2. The degree of formality for the appeal must be determined. For example,a separate ``Board'' could be established, or alternatively, an existingunit within an agency could be designated.3. Procedures for applicant assistance must be developed. In particular,procedures regarding challenges based on out-of-State records should bedeveloped and coordinated on a national basis.4. The time for the appeal and decisions may have to be limited.5. Some States may consider their existing procedures for correcting orupdating criminal history records as adequate for a felon identificationsystem.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part III. Legal and Policy Issues</ITAG>Statutory and constitutional challenges may be expected to arise regardingthe creation of any of the felon identification systems described in thisreport. (See <T3>Legal and Policy Issues Relating to Biometric Identification Technologies,</T3>SEARCH Group, Inc., June 1989.) Issues related to the First, Second, Fourth,Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, perhaps amongothers, must be carefully considered. In particular, some organizationstake the position that certain types of felon identification systems may,to some degree, unconstitutionally infringe upon the ``right of the peopleto keep and bear arms.'' This position relies primarily on (1) the impositionthat presale checks would impose on non-criminals, (2) the limited deterrencevalue of any system given the small proportion of felons purchasing firearmsthrough retail outlets, (3) the potential infringement of rights arisingfrom the maintenance of a gun owner register, and (4) the requirementsof some systems that prospective purchasers provide fingerprints priorto purchase. In light of the significance of constitutional issues, a finalselection of any particular identification system ought to be precededby a rigorous legal review by appropriate divisions within the U.S. Departmentof Justice.The legal review conducted for the Task Force found that criminal historychecks, including those based on fingerprints, are currently required byState and Federal law for a variety of non-criminal-justice purposes suchas job applications and security clearances. Depending on the jurisdiction,such checks are conducted for those desiring to be lawyers, child careworkers, State or Federal employees, bartenders, etc. Although the courtshave generally upheld these requirements as rationally related to legitimategovernmental purposes, a felon identification system involving the screening,and possibly fingerprinting, of all gun purchasers may raise unresolvedconstitutional issues. In addition to constitutional issues, the use of felon identification systemsin firearm sales raises a variety of important legal and policy issuesthat may have to be addressed in State and Federal legislation. Some ofthe major issues are outlined here.A Federal or State System; Mandatory or Voluntary?There are four broad possibilities for implementing a felon identificationsystem: (1) To create a self-standing Federal system that is run entirelyby Federal officials; (2) to mandate a cooperative Federal-State systemin which State officials carry out a substantial portion of the criminalhistory checks; (3) to establish a mandatory Federal standard that Statescould meet in a variety of different ways; and (4) to offer the Statesseveral models for a voluntary cooperative Federal-State system and makeFederal resources and leadership available to assist the States.(1) The Task Force did not focus its research efforts on the creation ofan independent Federal system for the simple reason that 90% or more ofarrests and convictions in the United States are handled by State and localofficials. Because of the variety of State laws, practices, and data systems,only State officials are in a position to properly interpret criminal historyrecord information for their State and to determine whether a convictionmeets the Federal standard for disallowing a firearm purchase. Moreover,State officials are in the best position to track down missing or incompleteinformation with local courts or prosecutors. Thus, the active involvementof State officials in the criminal history checks would seem essentialfor an effective felon identification system.(2) Given the necessity for active State involvement, the Federal Governmentcould create a felon identification system by mandating that the Statesadopt a particular system, such as one of those detailed here or a modificationthereof. Under this implementation strategy, the Federal Government wouldselect a felon identification system and each State would be required towork with Federal officials to implement it. The result would be a uniformsystem in each of the 50 States. Such a mandate could be enforced by makingState cooperation a condition for the receipt of specified Federal fundsor, more directly, for the sale of firearms within the State (under theFederal authority over interstate commerce).(3) Another possible implementation plan is to allow variation across theStates in the kind of system established as long as each State's systemmet certain minimum Federal standards. As noted above, 20 States and theDistrict of Columbia currently conduct a prepurchase criminal history checkfor those who wish to buy handguns. There is, however, substantial variationamong these systems. In some States checks are conducted by local authorities;in others by State authorities. Some States access only State records whenconducting the check; others also access Federal records. A few Statesrequire fingerprints; most do not. Of these existing systems, some mightbe as effective as the options detailed in this report in keeping convictedfelons from purchasing firearms through legitimate retail outlets. Othersmight be easily upgraded.All of the options presented in this report meet at least two minimum standards:all firearm purchases from federally licensed dealers are covered; anda name check of both State and Federal automated data bases is conductedfor evidence of an arrest for a serious crime (such checks usually alsoinclude date of birth, race, and sex). It appears that only four Statesand the District of Columbia currently meet both standards.(4) Finally, the Federal Government could take a leadership role in designingone or more felon identification systems and in encouraging, but not mandating,State cooperation. Under this strategy the Federal Government would expandits own resources at the FBI and BATF to make such a system(s) possibleand would provide expertise and technical assistance to State and localofficials.Sources of Funding for Criminal History ChecksThe Federal Government will be required to invest substantial resourcesin national data bases, including both personnel and equipment, in orderto handle the increase in workload that would result from a felon identificationsystem for firearm sales. State repositories also will require substantialadditional resources to handle the work load increase and to continue toimprove data quality. Given these resource needs, policymakers will haveto determine the appropriate funding mechanism for carrying out the requiredcriminal history checks. Such funding mechanisms could include one or moreof the following: (1) direct appropriations by the Federal and State governments,(2) user fees by gun purchasers, (3) increases in firearm dealers' licensingfees through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and (4) specialfines imposed on those convicted of firearms violations. In addition, legislationwould have to address whether the State and Federal governments would shareany revenue generated by a felon identification system and in what proportion.Release of Criminal History Information to Gun DealersThe Task Force has not proposed any options that would give gun dealersdirect access to criminal history record information. Such access wouldviolate established standards of privacy and confidentiality as well asnumerous State statutes that preclude access to criminal history recordsby non-law enforcement personnel. Nonetheless, several of the options dorequire notification to the dealer that a criminal history check has turnedup evidence of an arrest for a felony or serious misdemeanor. Even thislimited provision of information may violate some State statutes or regulations.Under Option A and its variants, for example, the dealer would learn whetherthere was evidence that the prospective purchaser had a criminal historyrecord, but the dealer would not learn the substance of the record itself.This may be viewed by some as a release of criminal history informationto non-law enforcement personnel in a way that would embarrass or stigmatizethe prospective purchaser. Indeed, in many (perhaps most) cases an initialindication of a criminal record would eventually be shown to be untruebecause it resulted from a misidentification with someone else with a commonname and date of birth. Yet a ``hit'' on the initial telephone check willbe known to personnel at the gun store and perhaps to customers or otherswho are present. As a result, the purchaser's reputation within his communitymay be harmed through no fault of his own. This issue indicates the needfor legislative prohibitions on the release by gun dealers and others ofanything learned during the telephone check of purchasers, although itmay be difficult to enforce such prohibitions against customers or otherswho may overhear or observe the results of a ``hit'' during the telephonecheck.An important privacy consideration is whether gun dealers in a point-of-salesystem would keep the records or lists of those who failed the initialcheck. Operationally, as in the options described in this report, suchrecordkeeping is not necessary and could be prohibited by law.Note that under Option B and its variants the prospective purchaser hasalready completed a full-fledged criminal history check before going tothe gun dealer. Thus, the gun dealer only sees those who have previouslyqualified to purchase a firearm. He does not learn about those who failedthe pre-approval procedure. Only in the few cases where the purchaser hadbeen arrested between issuance of the FOID card and his attempt to purchasea firearm would any disqualifying information become known to the gun dealer.Another issue of relevance to gun dealers is whether or to what extenttheir liability ought to be limited by law for providing firearms to disqualifiedpersons on the basis of inaccurate information they received from law enforcementauthorities.The Issue of AccuracyThe Congressional mandate under Section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Actcalls for the ``accurate identification of felons'' who attempt to purchasefirearms. The statute, however, does not specify the level of accuracythat would be acceptable. Since, for the reasons elaborated earlier inthis report, a perfectly accurate system is not feasible in the foreseeablefuture, policymakers will have to decide how much accuracy is requiredfor an effective felon identification system. Generally speaking, the mostaccurate systems are those that are the most expensive and that createthe greatest inconvenience for the gun purchaser.The issue of accuracy has two sides: (1) to correctly identify felons whoattempt to purchase firearms and (2) not to reject eligible persons whoattempt to purchase firearms. Deficiencies in identification documentsfor positively establishing identity, incomplete criminal history records,and the prevalence of common names and dates of birth complicate thesetwo tasks and make it that much more difficult to achieve both simultaneously.A system, for example, that focused primarily on not rejecting eligiblepersons might prove incapable of correctly identifying a large number offelons. On the other hand, a system that single-mindedly sought to keepconvicted felons from purchasing firearms might catch in its nets numerouslaw-abiding individuals who have a right to purchase firearms. How thebalance is to be struck between these two goals_to correctly identify felonsand not to reject eligible persons_is a policy, not a technical, judgment.The options outlined in this report present a variety of schemes for meetingthe two sides of the accuracy mandate.Because criminal history records are subject to error, the dictate foran accurate system points to the need for mechanisms through which prospectivegun purchasers can update and correct criminal history information. Fortunately,such procedures currently exist in all the States. Any felon identificationsystem for firearm sales ought to have a linkage to these procedures sothat corrections to criminal history records can be made in a timely fashion.Other-wise, persons eligible to purchase firearms may be improperly prohibitedfrom doing so.The requirements for establishing an accurate felon identification systemhighlight the need for complete and up-to-date criminal history records,preferably in an automated format. Improvements in the accuracy of criminalhistory records would generate benefits in a wide range of criminal justiceapplications.Creating a Data Base of Firearm PurchasersNone of the options outlined in this report provide for or require thecreation of a national data base of firearm purchasers. Since all the optionsare essentially State run, any recordkeeping, whether manual or automated,regarding the application to purchase, or the actual purchase of, firearmswould be maintained at the State level, as is currently the case in theStates that now require a written application and criminal history checkfor firearm purchases.Operationally, the maintenance of computer inquiry logs_transaction recordsthat do not necessarily require the applicant's name_is necessary to measuresystem traffic and cost and to ensure that inquiries are made only by legitimatedealers for legitimate purposes. In addition, any preapproval system (suchas Option B and its variants and the secondary verification of Option A)must maintain records of successful applicants if the system is to havethe capability of revoking permits (or FOID cards) if a holder is convictedof a disqualifying felony. This could apply under systems that requirethe return of a revoked permit and under those in which dealers check thevalidity of a permit prior to sale.The development of a data base of gun purchase applicants raises the possibilitythat such records might be used for other purposes. For example, individualsincluded in such a data base might be treated as possible suspects in crimesinvolving firearms. If fingerprint data were included in the file, latentfingerprints might be routinely run against the data base.Policymakers, of course, could prohibit such use of applicant records throughlaw. Moreover, strict limits could be placed on the time during which recordsof firearm applicants were maintained and on the extent to which applicantnames would appear on transaction logs. In point-of-sale systems, timelimits could be placed on the retention of initial inquiry records whichdo not result in a ``hit.'' Preapproval systems, however, have greaterrecordkeeping requirements if the possibility of revoking permits is tobe maintained. It may be advisable to enact new statutory provisions toensure that record retention restrictions are enforced. Potential ``Tracking'' of Firearm PurchasersAny system that requires a criminal history record check prior to purchaseof a firearm creates the potential for the automated tracking of individualswho seek to purchase firearms. It would be possible, for example, for authoritiesto ``flag'' the names of specific individuals, perhaps suspects in criminalcases, who might seek approval to purchase a firearm. If an automated criminalhistory check was conducted on such a flagged individual as part of anapplication to purchase a firearm, an electronic message to this effectcould be sent to the interested law enforcement agency without the knowledgeof the applicant. In this way authorities could learn about the potentialpurchase of a firearm by someone under investigation or surveillance aswell as the geographic location of the purchaser.Policymakers will have to decide whether to prohibit all such trackingactivity or to permit it in some circumstances (for example, notifyingthe Secret Service when a person suspected of being a threat to the Presidentpurchases a firearm). If some tracking is to be permitted, then clear rulesand conditions for such activity will have to be established.Issuing Documents Authorizing Firearm PurchasesThe pre-approval options outlined here (Option B and its variants) requirethe issuance of some kind of documentation (FOID card, certificate to purchase,permit, etc.) for the prospective gun purchaser to present to the gun dealercertifying that the purchaser is not a convicted felon. Moreover, the point-of-saleoptions (Option A and its variants) have a similar requirement for thosewho fail on the original telephone check.Such a requirement, especially if mandated by Federal law, raises policyissues regarding whether the firearm purchaser ought to be singled outand forced to prove through documentation that he is not a convicted felonbefore he can engage in an otherwise lawful commercial activity. In additionto the inconvenience that such a requirement creates, it may be viewedas demeaning by some.The other policy issue that such a requirement for documentation presentsis that this may be interpreted as an initial step toward a national identificationcard, something that members of Congress and others have strongly opposedin the past. It should be noted, however, that there are several importantdifferences between a national ID card system and the kinds of documentationrequired in the options in this report. As usually conceived, a nationalID card would be an identification document that was issued to all adultAmericans and which had to be carried at all times; yet neither of theseconditions would apply to the kind of documentation discussed in this report.FOID cards or firearm purchase permits would be required only for thosewho wish to purchase firearms and would have to be carried only at thetime of purchase. Legislation could prohibit the use of such cards forunrelated identification purposes.The Use of Biometric DataMany of the options detailed in this report require the collection of biometricdata in the form of fingerprints at some stage in the approval process.Given the traditional association of fingerprints with law enforcement,there may be public resistance to the requirement to provide fingerprintsat a law enforcement agency or at a gun dealership in order to purchasea firearm. Such concern may be heightened if the fingerprints are kepton file, manually or electronically, and are subsequently used for unrelatedinvestigative purposes, criminal or otherwise. As noted earlier, such useof the fingerprints provided in a felon identification system could beprohibited by law.Other biometric technologies, such as retinal scans, could be introducedinto felon identification systems, especially to verify identity againsta biometrically-based identification card. Because some of these technologiesmight be perceived as physically more intrusive than fingerprints, publicopposition to their use may be greater than to the use of fingerprints.On the other hand, this may be counterbalanced by the fact that these newertechnologies are not as closely associated with law enforcement activitiesas fingerprints.Section 1.

Current Practices<ITAG tagnum="81">Federal Control of Firearms</ITAG>The Federal role in the control of firearms is derived primarily from theGun Control Act of 1968 as amended and is overseen at the National levelby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) of the Departmentof the Treasury. BATF has over 40 field offices and 500 field agents usedfor the control of firearms, alcohol, and tobacco; over half of the agentsare devoted to firearms control. There are approximately 270,000 federallylicensed firearm dealers. It is estimated that 60-70% are noncommercialdealers (hobbyists, collectors, etc.) and account for 20-25% of all salesof firearms. Primary control is maintained through the licensing of dealersand the recording of sales.Prospective dealers apply for a license through BATF. Ordinary dealerspay a fee of $10 a year; pawnbrokers pay $25 a year; and gun dealers whosell ``destructive devices'' may be required to pay a fee of up to $1,000a year. Licenses are issued for 3 years after inquiry and investigationhas determined that the applicant is legally qualified. Disqualificationcan be made if the applicant is under 21 years of age, has previously violatedthe laws and regulations governing firearms, or is ineligible to possessa firearm under Federal law. This license may be renewed, but may not betransferred if the business is sold. There are a variety of regulationsthat affect licensees; and licenses may be suspended or revoked for cause.Retail firearm sales require the completion of BATF form 4473 (Exhibit5) for each over-the-counter sale or transfer to an end user. This formrequires the prospective owner's name, address, date and place of birth,height, weight, and race. It also requires a certification that the prospectivebuyer is not prohibited from owning a firearm because of a prior felonyconviction or because he is in one of the several other categories of personswho are precluded from ownership by Federal law_including, among others,those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, habitual drug users,and those who have been committed to a mental institution. The type andserial numbers of any weapons purchased are also recorded. The dealer isrequired to see appropriate identification from the prospective owner,such as a State driver's license, and must make a note of the method ofidentification on the BATF form 4473. There are stiff criminal penaltiesfor false statements on the form_up to 5 years in prison.Records relating to firearm transactions must be retained on the premisesof the dealer for a period of 20 years. If the dealership is sold, therecords must be transferred upon issuance of a new license. If the dealergoes out of business without a successor, the records of transactions mustbe shipped to BATF's long-term storage facility in Landover, MD. BATF agentsmay enter gun dealers' facilities and inspect any or all of the recordsthat are required to be maintained by Federal law. These examinations areconstrained by the law, which spells out in some detail the conditions(frequency and purpose) under which such investigations may be made. Asan example, in the event of a crime involving a firearm, BATF secures adescription of the weapon, including the serial number, and traces it fromthe manufacturer or importer through the distributor to the retail dealerwhere the records of sale are examined in an effort to trace the weaponto the owner of record.Because of limitations in manpower, BATF agents concentrate their examinationof records on high-volume retail stores, dealers who are suspected of illegalgun sales, and other individuals who come to the attention of the agentsthrough other sources. In their examination of these records, the agentsare especially alert to the sale of two or more handguns to the same purchaserwithin 3 days. Other causes for suspicion include sales to suspected gangmembers or sales of high-powered weapons to suspected ``straw purchasers,''those buying guns for others who are ineligible. If an inspection is notsatisfactory, BATF (1) may note the problem and reinspect in about 3 months,(2) notify the dealer that his license is in jeopardy if corrective actionsare not taken, (3) take other administrative action, or (4) initiate criminalproceedings.<ITAG tagnum="81">State Practices Regarding Firearms Sales </ITAG>Currently, 20 States and the District of Columbia, covering 55% of theNation's population, conduct a criminal history check of persons desiringto purchase a handgun prior to allowing that person to take possessionof the weapon (Exhibit 7). Four of these States and D.C. include the purchaseof long guns in this requirement. In 10 States and D.C. the burden of responsibilityfor prepurchase criminal history checks falls solely on local law enforcementagencies (either the police or sheriffs' department); in five States thisresponsibility is solely that of a State agency; and in another five Statesagencies at both State and local levels conduct criminal history checksprior to purchase. The levels of criminal history information accessed in these checks varyamong the States. Eight States access files no higher than those maintainedat the State level; 12 States and D.C. access national criminal historyrecords. In most States this criminal history check is done using name, date ofbirth, and other identifying characteristics such as race and sex, butexcluding fingerprints. In six States and D.C. fingerprints are taken fromthe applicant for use in the criminal history check. In one of these Statesonly a thumbprint is obtained. The criminal history check is conducted as part of an application processinvolving a mandatory waiting period. In 15 States this application processand waiting period are required for each handgun purchase (a permit isobtained through this process in four of these States). In six States asuccessful application for purchase of handguns results in a permit oridentification card which allows purchases for a specified or indefinitetime period. In the four States and D.C. that require criminal historychecks for the purchase of long guns, a successful application resultsin an identification card, permit, or registration certificate. In some instances, a criminal history check is conducted after the purchaserof a handgun has taken possession of the weapon. In Pennsylvania, a postpurchasecheck is conducted by the State agency (in addition to a prepurchase checkconducted locally). Two States (Michigan and South Carolina) conduct acriminal history check on handgun purchasers only after the buyer has takenpossession of the weapon. In Michigan this check is done by the local agency,and in South Carolina it is done by the State agency. State residents making their initial purchase of a handgun in the 20 Statesand D.C. conducting a pre-purchase criminal history check are subject towaiting periods ranging from 2 days to 6 months (Exhibit 8). The two Statesthat conduct only a postpurchase criminal history check on handgun purchasershave no waiting period. One State (Wisconsin) requires a 2-day waitingperiod for handguns, but does not conduct a criminal history check on thepurchasers of handguns. The waiting periods for the purchase of long gunsin the four States and D.C. that require a criminal history check for suchpurchases range from 15 to 60 days. Local jurisdictions in many Statesmay have additional restrictions or requirements for the purchase of handgunsand long guns. <ITAG tagnum="74">Application Requirements for Firearm Purchases in the 10 Largest States</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">(As of April 1989) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">California </ITAG>(pop. 28,074,000) <ITAG tagnum="21">A written application is required to purchase a handgun.

Subsequent appeals must be made through the State Court.If State authorities learn that a FOID cardholder has become ineligible(for example, by a felony conviction), the card is revoked and a voluntaryreturn of the card is requested. The revocation is noted in the State criminalhistory files. If the card is not returned voluntarily, it may be retrievedby the local police.Illinois authorities report that approximately 200,000 FOID cards are issuedannually. An estimated 78% of all cards are issued with the first application;the final rejection rate is about 5%. Illinois officials also report that2,470 individuals were denied a FOID card in 1988 as a consequence of theirfelony convictions. During the same year, 779 FOID cardholders had theircards revoked as a result of felony convictions. The Illinois State Police have noted three problem areas for administrationof the program:1. The identification procedures used do not insure a positive identification;2. Court notification of disposition of felony charges for inclusion incriminal history records has not been accurate or timely; and,3. Private mental health institutions are not required to share informationfor the record check.<ITAG tagnum="81">Virginia's New Point-of-Sale Approval System</ITAG>The following is a summary of procedures being established to implementthe recently enacted Virginia statute requiring felony checks for personswanting to purchase firearms within the State. The legislation was enactedby both houses of the Virginia legislature in February 1989 and was signedby the Governor in April 1989. The system is to be implemented by November1, 1989. All information was obtained from the Virginia Department of StatePolice.The statute applies to:1. Handguns with a barrel of less than 5 inches, and 2. Semiautomatic center fire rifles or pistols that expel projectiles byaction of an explosion, have a magazine that holds more than 20 roundsof ammunition, and are designed by the manufacturer to accommodate silencers,bayonets, bipods, flash suppressors, or folding stock.<T3>Procedures for implementation. </T3>1. The purchaser presents two piecesof ID to the dealer.2. The dealer calls the State Police using a toll-free telephone number.(The system will operate 7 days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The RecordsManagement Division estimates that they will receive 250,000 inquiriesa year.)3. The dealer identifies himself by giving his firearm dealer ID numberand the control number from the State firearm purchaser's application form.4. The State checks the validity of the ID number and confirms that thecontrol number has been assigned to that dealer. (This is designed to preventinvalid inquiries. A microcomputer system is being developed that willcontain dealer identification information and list the control numbersassigned to each dealer.)5. The dealer provides the State Police with the applicant's name, sex,race, date of birth, and Social Security number.6. While the dealer remains on the phone, the State Police make a namecheck against the State index to criminal history records and the Stateand Federal ``wanted persons'' lists. A name, sex, race, and date-of-birthmatch will be required to make a ``hit.'' Virginia estimated that 16-20%of the telephone inquiries will result in a ``hit.'' The total time fora phone call is expected to be about 3 minutes.7. If there is a hit against the State index, the dealer is advised thatthe sale cannot be completed. State Police then have until the dealer'snext close of business day to determine if the applicant was actually convictedof a disqualifying felony. During this time, checks will be made againstthe State criminal history records, and the Interstate Identification Index(III). If no record is found within this time, the dealer is advised thatthe sale may proceed. If a disqualifying felony is found, the dealer isadvised that the sale may not proceed. The dealer then forwards a copyof the State application form to the State Police to permit cross checkingof the control number and an appeal by the applicant.8. If the sale is approved, the application form (with the dealer's controlnumber) is completed and forwarded to the State Police. A check is thenmade to verify the data.9. If there is no ``hit'' against the State index in the initial inquiry,the dealer is advised that the sale may proceed immediately. The Stateapplication form containing the control number is then forwarded to theState Police. The form will have been signed by the applicant attestingto the absence of any disqualifying felonies and providing consent fora criminal history records check. Upon receipt of the application form,a check is initiated against State and Federal criminal history records.If a disqualifying felony record is found, this information and a copyof the application form is forwarded to the dealer and to the chief lawenforcement official in the jurisdiction in which the sale was made. Itis anticipated that the law enforcement official will issue an arrest warrantand initiate efforts to retrieve the firearm.10. Appeals are based on the applicant's general right to inspect and correcthis record. In general, applicants will be directed to the local policedepartment who may take fingerprints to support the record check. (TheState does not require a fingerprint check.) The applicant would also beadvised of any out-of-State records and would be assisted in contactingout-of-State officials.11. The system described above applies to Virginia residents only. Out-of-Stateresidents will undergo a similar process, including a criminal historyrecords check, which may take up to 10 days to complete.<T3>Maintenance of records. </T3>If the applicant is approved, a recordof the inquiry transaction (including the applicant's name) will be maintainedin an active file for 30 days. If the applicant is disapproved, a log of the inquiry will be maintainedfor a 2-year period. The applicant has 30 days to appeal the denial underexisting State law (Virginia Code 9-192) regarding completeness of criminalhistory records.<T3>Estimated cost. </T3>Virginia officials estimate that this system willrequire 16 new full-time personnel and will cost $481,000 for 12 monthsoperation ($90,000 for start-up costs and $391,000 for annual operatingcosts). This will cover staff, space, forms, communications, and equipment.<T3>Differences between the Virginia system and Option A.</T3>1. The Virginiasystem applies only to specific categories of firearms and may be furtherlimited to selected categories of dealers.2. In the Virginia system Federal and interstate criminal history recordsare not checked prior to sale unless there is a ``hit'' against the Stateindex. Under Option A, a check is automatically made against State andFederal records.3. Virginia checks do not require a personal appearance at a law enforcementagency until the final appeal. Under Option A, the secondary verificationon which a disapproval is based is supported by a fingerprint check.4. The Virginia system has strict deadlines for government action, whichare not included in the basic Option A.Section 3. Access to Federal Criminal History RecordsThrough both its Identification Division and the National Crime InformationCenter (NCIC), the FBI serves as a central access point for Federal andState criminal history record information. The Identification Divisionmaintains fingerprint-based criminal history records on approximately 25million individuals who have been arrested at some time in their livesfor a serious offense (felony or serious misdemeanor). These records aredescribed below. In addition, the FBI operates the Interstate IdentificationIndex (III), accessed through the NCIC telecommunications network, whichnotifies law enforcement agencies requesting criminal history informationwhether a record exists in one of the 20 States (listed below) that currentlyparticipate in III. The III is a cooperative Federal-State program forthe interstate exchange of criminal history record information that makesavailable in a timely manner criminal history information to the law enforcementcommunity.III participating States maintain their own computerized criminal history(CCH) files at the State level and provide information from these fileswhen a request comes either through the NCIC network or directly to theState through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS).Most States that do not participate in III also maintain automated CCHsystems, but these are not directly tied into the NCIC system. These data,if automated, can be accessed by a direct request through NLETS. In addition,when a request comes in to the FBI through NCIC, it provides whatever automateddata it has in its Identification Division from nonparticipating States.In order to provide rapid access to these State and Federal criminal historyfiles, the FBI maintains an automated master name index (MNI) of over 12.5million records, with over 70,000 new records being added each month. Anindex record contains an individual's name, aliases, physical description,identifying numbers, fingerprint classification, and the location(s) ofthe criminal history record(s).Criminal history records, sometimes call ``rap sheets,'' are cumulative,name-indexed histories of an individual's involvement in the criminal justicesystem for serious offenses (felonies and serious misdemeanors). Excludedare records on arrests and subsequent dispositions for such offenses asdrunkenness, vagrancy, disturbing the peace, and traffic violations (exceptmanslaughter, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and hit-and-run).Offenses committed by juvenile offenders are excluded unless a juvenileis tried as an adult.Access to these Federal data bases and indexes is through the NCIC system.The NCIC computer equipment is located at FBI headquarters in Washington,DC. Connecting terminals are located throughout the United States, Canada,Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in police departments, sheriff'soffices, State police facilities, Federal law enforcement agencies, andother criminal justice agencies. The system includes 37,000 terminals in17,000 locations and provides uninterrupted service 24 hours a day, 7 daysa week. Over 130 dedicated telecommunications lines link Federal and Stateagencies together. Each State maintains a central Control Terminal Agency(CTA), which is directly connected to NCIC. Telecommunications lines andequipment within the State provide State and local criminal justice agenciesaccess to the control terminal.The NCIC system provides direct, electronic access to the Interstate IdentificationIndex of records maintained in the 20 participating States and to the IdentificationDivision's automated records. This combined index is now known as the AutomatedInformation System-Phase III (AIS-III). Moreover, NCIC maintains severalnational ``hot files.'' These hot files contain identifying informationconcerning wanted and missing persons, stolen vehicles, and identifiablestolen property of several types.In addition to the computerized AIS-III MNI, the Identification Divisionmaintains three criminal history files designed for use by Federal andState agencies:1. An automated criminal history file which contains rap sheet informationon 12.5 million persons arrested for the first time and reported to theFBI since July 1, 1974, or known to the FBI with a year of birth 1956 orlater.2. Manual criminal history records on approximately 8.8 million individualsborn in or after 1929 but arrested at some time before July 1, 1974. Thereis an automated master name index to these data, but it is available onlyfor in-house use and not through the NCIC network. The manual rap sheetjackets are maintained at various locations in the Washington, DC area.Several of the options detailed above require merging the index for theserecords into the AIS-III index.3. Manual criminal history records on about 3.6 million offenders bornbefore 1929 whose files are maintained by the Identification Division.There is no automated index to this older information.In general, indexes at the Federal level are arrest-based files containingonly identifying information on individuals arrested for ``fingerprintable''offenses. See Exhibit 4 for an overview of these indexes and data bases.An authorized criminal justice agency can make an inquiry (a QH message)on name, sex, race, date of birth, and numeric identifiers such as SocialSecurity Number, State Identification Number (SID), or FBI number. Mostinitial searches are on name, sex, race, and date of birth, if known. Inresponse to a QH inquiry, the requester will be provided one of the followingresponses:1. A single matching record response_a ``hit.''2. A multiple matching response, up to a maximum of 15 records_a ``hit.''3. A ``no record'' response_a ``no hit.''A ``no hit'' response does not necessarily mean that there is no criminalhistory record on the individual being investigated. The FBI IdentificationDivision maintains fingerprints on approximately 25 million persons (21million automated). Of these, about half, 12.5 million, are contained inthe AIS-III MNI, discussed above. In order to access the information inthe additional records maintained by the FBI, a law enforcement agencycan submit a fingerprint card, usually through the mail, to the IdentificationDivision for a more detailed search. Additionally, there may be criminalhistory information at the local or State level for which the arrest fingerprintcard was never forwarded to the FBI.As indicated above, a positive response to an NCIC inquiry (called a QHresponse) can result in either a single record response (one individual)or a multiple record response (up to 15 individuals). The response providesthe requester with three types of information:1. The person's name, including aliases, physical descriptors, and numericalidentifiers.2. The identity of the data base(s) containing the criminal history recordinformation.3. The means to be used to obtain the record(s).In order to retrieve a specific criminal history, a criminal history recordrequest (QR message) containing the person's FBI or SID number must beused. The identifiers are obtained from the name-based QH inquiry or fromother sources such as State CCH records or investigative files. The QRmessage will result in an automatic notification to all data bases identifiedas having information on the subject being investigated. The CCH systemsof the States participating in III will be queried and the individual'srap sheet from one or more III States will automatically be forwarded viaNLETS. FBI records on Federal offenders and nonparticipating III Stateswill be sent on-line using NCIC telecommunications.If the automated name index for the records of the 8.8 million personsborn in or after 1929 and arrested before July 1, 1974, is integrated intothe AIS-III index, then under the initial verification procedure proposedin Option A (telephone check by the gun dealer), an NCIC inquiry couldbe conducted within a matter of minutes on approximately 21.3 million individualswho have been arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor.The 20 States participating in III as of June 1989:<ITAG tagnum="42">California</ITAG><P>Colorado</P><P>Connecticut</P><P>Delaware</P><P>Florida</P><P>Georgia</P><P>Idaho</P><P>Michigan</P><P>Minnesota</P><P>Missouri</P><P>New Jersey</P><P>New York</P><P>North Carolina</P><P>Ohio</P><P>Oregon</P><P>Pennsylvania</P><P>South Carolina</P><P>Texas</P><P>Virginia</P><P>Wyoming</P>Section 4. Study of Other Persons Ineligible to PurchaseFirearmsSection 6213(c) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 requires the AttorneyGeneral to conduct a feasibility study to determine whether an effectivemethod can be established for identifying ``other persons'' ineligibleto purchase firearms (that is, other than convicted felons). Such personsinclude: fugitives from justice, those who use or are addicted to illegaldrugs, those who have been adjudicated as mentally defective or have beencommitted to a mental institution, illegal aliens, those dishonorably dischargedfrom the Armed Forces, and those who have renounced their American citizenship.This study must be submitted to Congress by May 18, 1990.The Task Force decided that this parallel activity ought to be initiatedby a private contractor with expertise in criminal justice and informationsystems. In July of this year the Bureau of Justice Statistics contractedwith Enforth Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts to carry out thiswork. The Enforth study will include the following elements:andbullet; The availability of existing data bases that can be utilized toidentify ineligible individuals;andbullet; The quality of these data bases in terms of completeness and accuracyof records;andbullet; The remote accessibility of the data bases through a telecommunicationssystem, particularly, the method and cost of access;andbullet; Legal restrictions on the use of the data and an analysis of therelevant privacy and confidentiality considerations of accessing such data;andandbullet; The feasibility of linking these data bases with a felon identificationsystem.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part V.

Appendix</ITAG>Summary of comments on the Draft Report<ITAG tagnum="74">Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law 100-690,102 Stat. 4360, directed the Attorney General to develop a system for immediateand accurate identification of felons who attempt to purchase firearmsand to report to the Congress a description of that system by 18 November1989. Pursuant to that mandate, the Attorney General requested the AssistantAttorney General of the Office of Justice Programs to establish a TaskForce to develop a range of options that would comport with the statute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On June 26, 1989, the <T3>Draft Report of the Task Force for Identifying Felons Who Attempt toPurchase Firearms</T3> was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 26,902 (1989)). This publication solicitedcomments from interested persons for a 30-day period, though the Task Forcegroup was able to receive, process and analyze a number of comments receivedthereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some 114 comments were received in all, including those from Governorsand other representatives of 20 State governments plus the District ofColumbia and the Territory of Guam (all hereafter referred to as States),from 26 organizations (plus supplemental comments from 2 of them), andfrom 64 persons, including 4 Members of Congress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Of the 26 organizations responding other than the State governments,12 were classified as law enforcement organizations (including 2 municipalpolice departments), 5 as civil liberties organizations (including 3 firearmsrights advocacy groups), 4 as firearms organizations (both sporting andgeneral), 2 as gun control organizations, and 3 as consultants. The followingis a section-by-section summary of the 114 comments received on the June26, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication entitled <T3>Draft Report on Systems for Identifying Felons Who Attempt To PurchaseFirearms.</T3> Some reader comments resulted in changes that have beenincorporated in the Final Report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The reader should keep in mind that this is, after all, intended tobe a general summary, not a summary of each individual comment. An efforthas been made to include representative comments from the entire spectrumof opinion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Just as the Task Force attempted to remain assiduously neutral inpreparing a complete and fair description of various alternatives in the<T3>Draft Report,</T3> so too, the compilers of this summary have donetheir best to employ the same standard of neutrality in preparing thisanalysis of the comments received.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Task Force is grateful to all who have submitted comments andis cognizant of the thousands of hours involved in preparing them.

Supplementary materialsGeneral comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Foreword</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of comments, from both groups and individuals, suggestedthe first step in a project of this nature should be an ambitious, thorougheffort to make criminal record histories accurate and complete. Severalwriters noted this would produce many benefits to the criminal justicesystem beyond felon identification of firearm purchasers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One firearms organization felt that the discussion of the point-of-salevs. pre-approval systems failed to consider developing and enhancing asystem to identify and punish felons who traffic in stolen firearms, aswell as a dealer notification program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the Congressional parameters set forth in the Anti-Drug AbuseAct of 1988 governing the report of the Task Force was that any systemmust be ``immediate.'' The Task Force did not report on any system involvinga waiting period, or cooling off period as it is sometimes called. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some groups and individuals, including a Member of Congress, commentedthat there should be no waiting period. Others favored a waiting period.Times suggested were 5 days, 7 days, 7 or more days, 7 to 10 days, 2 weeks,and 15 days. One individual, a Member of Congress, advocated the immediateimplementation of a 7-day national waiting period. One gun control groupfavored the 15-day waiting period on handguns, but made no waiting periodrecommendation as to long guns. One Governor, whose State has had a 7-daywaiting period of long standing noted that despite the legislative immediacyrequirement governing the Task Force Report, he felt that ultimately Congressshould provide some type of waiting period to curtail firearms purchases,especially handguns, during the ``heat of passion.'' Another State response(from the State public safety commissioner) preferred Option B, but wouldadd a waiting period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the same time, a firearms group asserted that a statement in theForeword of the <T3>Draft Report</T3> puts the waiting-period myth to rest: Waiting periodsconsiderably shorter than the 4 to 6 weeks required for a fingerprint-based,prior-approval system (such as 7 days) would not significantly enhancethe reliability of point-of-sale systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other comments on statements mentioned in the Foreword included anobjection raised by a firearms organization to the <T3>Draft Report</T3> observation that felons may obtain the tools of theirdeadly trade through straw men who lack a criminal record, and thereforemay be eligible to purchase firearms for the felon. Rather, the organizationsaid, felons typically obtained weapons through their own crimes or froma fence or other illicit source. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group believed that the options in the <T3>Draft Report</T3> do not further the goals of the Task Force to ``preservelegitimate rights to privacy and firearms ownership, while at the sametime enhancing the ability of law enforcement to carry out its responsibilityto maintain the domestic peace.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Part I. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Introduction and summary of findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the State comments suggested that the degree of danger generatedby categories of prohibited purchasers in addition to felons (drug users,mental incompetents, illegal aliens, etc.) is of equal importance and itmay be premature to consider systems to prevent firearms from being soldto prohibited purchasers until the May 1990 report on the other groupsis published.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Scope of the problem</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several writers noted that elsewhere (in Sec. II) the <T3>Draft Report</T3> cites a study stating that five out of six felonshave acquired firearms elsewhere than by retail purchase. They were concernedbecause the <T3>Draft</T3> Report addresses only retail sales. Typical of these commentswas one from a State patrol chief, writing for his State at the requestof his Governor, who thought that because so many felons obtained weaponselsewhere, it did not appear to him that the tremendous costs of implementingany system would be cost-effective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One law enforcement organization wondered what percentage of the completedBATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) Forms 4473 has been shownto be falsified. A Governor reported that in his State, officials havenot identified a problem of felons purchasing firearms from dealers. Andone individual writer questioned whether felons ever actually try to buyweapons from licensed gun dealers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A consulting company whose president is a former Federal officialfamiliar with firearms issues suggested that project cost estimates aregreatly inflated by the 60-70% of BATF-licensed dealers who do not in factdepend on the sale of firearms for a significant portion of their income.This writer suggested that BATF remove these pseudo-dealers from the dealercategory by using substantially higher license fees or qualifications basedon volume of business or by establishing a nondealer license category.This would allow BATF to concentrate its resources more effectively, andthus sharply drop costs related to identification systems. Another individualsuggested that BATF recall all licenses that are not being used in a State-,county-, or city-licensed business. And a firearms group suggested it mightbe possible to exempt entirely or apply a special system to low-volumedealers such as hobbyists.One individual noted that computer systems basedon the use of telephone lines would not work at gun shows, where many dealersdo much of their business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Key elements of a felon identification system</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the topic of felon definition, one civil liberties group notedthat it is not easy to find a uniform definition of the term felon andthat this difficulty should be addressed before either general or specificproposals are considered. Another civil liberties group felt that a majorimpairment existed because data bases do not show for how long a personconvicted of a crime could have been imprisoned, and thus it cannot bedetermined if the statutory definition of felon (1 year imprisonment orlonger) had been met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement group believed that BATF should strongly urge theStates to improve their reporting, since it is the responsibility of theStates to report felony convictions accurately.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the issue of immediacy, a firearms organization felt that termmeant 1 to several minutes and that a 4- to 6-week application waitingperiod was not immediate and beyond the congressional mandate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As to accuracy, this same group felt that any system that denied 725,000persons yearly the right to buy firearms was clearly not accurate and thatif the Task Force found an accurate system impossible to devise, it shouldsimply say so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress felt the immediacy requirement precluded implementationof any of the prior-approval options.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">The quality of felony conviction data</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Numerous comments, from both individuals and groups, addressed theissue of the quality of felony conviction data. Some felt that nothingshould be done until this problem was solved. Views expressed includedthe following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Criminal records should be made current before any new laws are enacted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since data on noneligible purchasers are incomplete, the systems proposedwould be ineffectual. The easy availability of guns through other sourceswould create contempt for the law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Innocent people could be prevented from purchasing firearms, and felonscould slip through a system based on these records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congress should focus on the real problem of improving the qualityof criminal records systems at all levels of government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Getting a national criminal history record system operational is imperative.Checking firearms purchasers without one is ludicrous and a mockery ofjustice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The incompleteness of felony records is amazing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The <T3>Draft Report </T3>is to be commended for discovering the appallingcondition of criminal records. Law enforcement must be supported by upgradingcriminal records systems with automation and with accurate, current, anduniform information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although it may be possible to create a computer file of felons, itwill take not less than 10 years to do so. Better recordkeeping at locallevels will be required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress wrote that there was a desperate need for updatingour data bases by including those not now automated (such as for personsborn prior to 1929), identifying whether a conviction disqualifies onefrom a firearms purchase, and by systemizing State criminal reporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One State commented that incomplete criminal history data may poseproblems for States with limited resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties organization felt the Nation's criminal justicerecords are in a woefully inadequate state and strongly recommended theupdating and organizing of all such records prior to implementing any ofthe <T3>Draft Report</T3>'s recommendations. Another civil liberties groupstated that an individual's privacy rights are compromised by release ofinaccurate criminal history records or arrest records without dispositions.And another civil liberties organization said that the greatest and mostsurprising value of the <T3>Draft Report </T3>is the light it sheds on the state of the U.S. criminaljustice reporting system, and that these difficulties should be remediedbefore any proposal to identify felons who attempt to purchase firearmsis considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement group said that criminal records data bases mustbe improved_all of the options in the <T3>Draft Report </T3>depend on good data. Another said that the incompletenessof criminal history records is a critical hindrance. And another said thatsuch incompleteness is a critical impediment and point-of-sale systemsare subject to all the weaknesses of diverse and limited criminal historydata bases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One firearms group asserted that the poor quality of the criminalhistory data base would result in many false hits; that the quality offelony conviction data must be improved; and that it would support legislationto further this goal. Another firearms group suggested that of all criminalhistory records, only final disposition_conviction, acquittal, or restorationof rights_is pertinent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Impediments to creating a perfect system</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The three key elements recited in the <T3>Draft Report </T3>(a complete and accurate automated criminal historydata base, positive identification, and an immediate linkage mechanism)were recognized by a number of comments. Some of the numerous citationsof the problems of the first key element are recited in the previous sectionand will not be repeated here. One individual writer suggested that photographicidentification (which, he said, was adequate for access to classified material)should be sufficient proof of identity for firearms purchasers. Biometricidentification should not be required for firearms purchasers when it isnot required in other sensitive situations, and photographic identification(such as drivers' licenses) are far less expensive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group reiterated the Task Force's conclusion thata perfect system for immediately and accurately identifying felons whoattempt to purchase firearms is not feasible or practical in the near future.And a firearms group, likewise repeating this conclusion of the Task Force,noted that even so, a perfect system should be restricted to identificationof felons, not nonfelon buyers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Practical alternatives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One law enforcement organization, apparently the only responding groupto do so, polled its members as to whether they favored a point-of-salesystem or a prior-approval system. This poll found 49% favoring OptionA, while 46% favored Option B. At the same time, 16% opposed Option A,and 20% opposed Option B. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of commenters suggested modifications to the various modelspresented, indicating that the original options, as modified, would besatisfactory to them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specific comments on Options A and B and their variations will beset forth under the following sections that deal with those options. Writersfelt some of the following to be other practical alternatives, some ofwhich are additional variations of Options A and B:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement organization advocated a purchase certificate systemfor all buyers which would directly involve local police in preapprovingfirearms purchases. This would require the purchaser to apply for a certificatefrom local police, presenting valid and positive identification and payingan appropriate fee. If no disqualifying information were found, a firearmspurchase certificate of limited duration would be issued, which would bepresented along with supporting identification to a gun seller.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual writer suggested a system of bar coding on drivers'licenses, pilots' licenses, and boat licenses following a background checkby police or the Coast Guard on location. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A State suggested that when a person was arrested for a felony, suchinformation would be recorded on a FOID card, just as the data of a motorvehicle violation is recorded and recalled when a driver's license is renewed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One firearms group proposed an instant ID where at the time of receivinga driver's license or State identification card, records would be checkedby State police and an approval or disapproval for firearms purchases wouldbe encoded on the license, visible only under ultraviolet light. At thepoint of sale, the dealer would simply read the license under a speciallight. Since the designation would not generally be visible, confidentialitywould be preserved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In several separate comments, individual writers suggested that nonew Federal felon identification program be implemented. Some thought thatthe public funds that would have been used for this instead be employedfor such things as building more prisons, sending lists of convicted felonsto each gun dealer, or spending more on law enforcement and the judiciary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As mentioned in the comments to the <T3>Draft Report </T3>Foreword, several writers asserted that a waitingor cooling-off period would be an appropriate control, either in lieu ofor in combination with the <T3>Draft Report </T3>options.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Cost estimates</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several writers asserted that the costs of the proposed systems weretoo high. Many seemed concerned about the cost-effectiveness. Some seemedto feel that the benefits of a Federal program probably would be outweighedby the high costs to the public. One individual felt further research shouldbe conducted. Another suggested that cost effectiveness estimates be addressed,such as whether background checks are an effective means of reducing violentcrime compared to other approaches such as increased sentencing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress, citing OMB Circular A-76 as well as these timesof huge Federal deficits, stressed that any system be as cost-effectiveas possible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Considering the state of the criminal justice identification system,it would be unreasonable to expect American taxpayers to pay the high costsestimated in the <T3>Draft Report, </T3>said a civil liberties organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A gun control group noted that felon identification systems in Floridaand Virginia include user fees. It suggested that start-up costs couldcome from a portion of the current tax on firearms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A State patrol commissioner was concerned with the fact the <T3>Draft Report </T3>addressed only retail sales when elsewhere it citeda study stating that five out of six felons have acquired firearms otherthan from a retail outlet.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Governor had serious concerns about initiating any of the optionswith the reported cost projections, adding that additional expendituresof State funds for new systems must be weighed against the existing costof a viable and tested system long in place in his State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One State public safety commissioner noted that costs would vary amongStates depending on their level of automation, their present gun controllegislation, their demographics, and the ability of their personnel toabsorb additional work. He also noted that the cost may pose problems forStates with limited resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Governor reported that due to the budget reductions in the Departmentof Public Safety in his State, it would be difficult to maintain criminalhistories as thoroughly as would be necessary to process firearms applications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization noted that user fees of $7-$9 for Option Aand $27-$32 for Option B would deter the purchase of inexpensive shotgunsand rifles for young people and prevent the elderly living on fixed incomesfrom purchasing handguns for self-protection. These costs, it said, utterlylacked any acceptable cost-benefit ratio.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One writer noted that the cost estimates for the Virginia system areconsiderably lower than those suggested for Option A, as is the fee. Anotherquestioned why the cost for setting up a Federal FOID card system was fiveto six times higher than the Illinois system, which he understood makesa small profit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A consulting group comment and a gun control group comment both feltcost estimates were overstated because of the many hobbyist or other smallvolume BATF-licensed dealers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Implementation issues </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Of the four implementation issues spoken of in the <T3/><T3>Draft Report,</T3> no writer favored a self-standing Federal system,run entirely by Federal officials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One individual writer believed that a federally mandated cooperativeFederal-State system would require a minimum transition period of 2 yearsin States that have their own system. Another felt that if a system wereto be federally mandated, the State would likely demand that the Congresspay for its full cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A gun control organization felt that a handgun purchase-certificatesystem should be a minimum Federal standard, which the States would berequired to adopt if the <T3>Draft Report's</T3> third implementation method were followed (a mandatoryFederal standard which States could meet in different ways).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One individual, opting for the fourth plan (offering the States severaldifferent models for a cooperative Federal-State system, while making Federalresources and leadership available to assist the States), said it is bestto let systems vary from State to State, since each State will know bestwhat will work for it, and also since the States will apparently bear mostof the cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In establishing minimum standards for the States, a State criminaljustice division director urged that State and local efforts not be restrictedwhere they provide greater protection to the public than that minimallyrequired by Congress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the responding Governors said he was in favor of the fourthmethod. And one of the firearms groups also favored this method, but suggestedthat input should be obtained from gun owners, licensees, and law enforcementpersonnel. This group said that the first plan was not viable since recordsare based on State laws and stored in State institutions; that the secondmethod fails to take account of particular State needs; and that the thirdmethod was contrary to the spirit of federalism.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One civil liberties group contended that none of the methods shouldbe implemented as they will undermine individual civil liberties and thwartthe goals of the McCollum amendment. It recommended that the Attorney Generalreport that it is presently impossible to implement the McCollum amendment.The group felt that the floor debate on the McCollum amendment indicatedthat Congress recognized this possibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Legal and policy issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the comments on the seven illustrative legal and policy issuesenumerated by the Task Force are presented elsewhere in this summary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group cited a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court case, <T3>U.S. Department of Justice </T3>v. <T3>Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press, </T3>109 S.Ct. 1468,1485, for the proposition that an individual has a right to privacy regardinghis or her criminal history records and the release of those records toa third party (such as a gun dealer) can reasonably be expected to invadethat person's privacy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group felt that any new legislation should include criminalpenalties for ``lawless government bureaucrats who prevent and impede legitimatefirearm sales, misuse or disclose privacy information, use records to setup a de facto registration system, or otherwise infringe on the secondamendment right to bear arms.'' It also suggested that retention of namesshould be made a violation of law with civil penalties for negligent retentionand criminal penalties for willful retention.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A State Governor observed that Congress would need to enact a statuteto motivate the States to provide for BATF terminal access to State criminalhistory files as a requisite for continued on-line access by the Statesto NCIC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Solving the problem of felons acquiring firearms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One individual writer, repeating the <T3>Draft Report's</T3> quotation of the study finding that about five-sixthsof felons admitting ownership of firearms acquired them elsewhere thanat retail, suggests that research should be conducted to determine thenumber of nonincarcerated felons, the percentage or number of these felonswho are still active, and the percentage or number of them who are knownto use firearms or who may desire a firearm for criminal purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another writer suggested that data be compiled on the illegal firearmsmarket, while still another suggested a study on BATF effectiveness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties organization, reiterating the <T3>Draft Report's</T3> observation that a particularly effective systemmay force even more felons to turn to the black market or to accompliceswithout criminal records for their weapons, felt that the potentially smallgain of developing a system does not justify sweeping changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another writer, citing the same study, believed that while an attemptto prevent retail sales of firearms to criminals and other ineligible personshould be made, a system must take into account the inconvenience, expenseand the burden to firearms retailers, legitimate purchasers, law enforcementagencies and other government functions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other individual writers expressed essentially the same concern. Onesaid that even if a system were implemented, most felons would continueto acquire firearms through illegal means. Another expressed his view thatthe biggest fault with the entire idea (of identifying felons who attemptto purchase firearms) is that it will not reduce crime with firearms oneiota.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Part II. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Options for a felon identification system</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 1. Schematic overview</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress asserted that the legislative intent of Sec.6213 of the Act (the McCollum amendment) was for immediate (point-of-purchase)approval, and none of the preapproval options meets this congressionalmandate. Likewise, he said, Congress did not intend a national waitingperiod nor the issuance of identification cards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization likewise asserted that ``prior approval schemes''are not immediate and fall outside the legislative intent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The same group felt that a required appearance at a law enforcementagency to receive a FOID card is a nonauthorized alternative for the surveillanceof law abiding citizens. A toll-free number could be considered, but onlywhen criminal records are accurate and up to date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The same organization strongly believed that data sources could beused by law enforcement agencies to notify dealers of likely prohibitedpersons attempting to buy guns and also to identify felons buying on theblack market. And in the area of decision organizations, it suggested thattrained persons should interpret conviction data under the laws of eachState.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any appeal, it said, should be a de novo review by State or Federalcourts with attorney fees awarded for the prevailing plaintiff.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 2. Point-of-sale approval systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option A: Telephone check by gun dealer with secondary verification</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Of the many comments on Option A, some dealt with the specific topicscovered by the <T3>Draft Report. </T3>Others introduced new topics or were more generalin nature. This analysis will deal with the former first. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization said that in a telephone check, only conviction-basedindexes, not arrest-based indexes, can be used. It also noted that thereis a danger of creating of a registration system resulting in a loss ofprivacy if the law enforcement agency retains the records of inquiriesfor the purpose of auditing dealers. Retention of names should be madea violation of law with civil penalties for negligent retention and criminalpenalties for willful retention.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the issue of secondary verification, the same organization feltthat requiring a citizen with no known convictions to go to the policestation and give his fingerprints would be a gross violation of privacyand civil liberties. It also observed that a certificate of purchase forno more than 1 year would require the purchaser to undergo the same degradingprocess year after year. Further, the data base would become a registryof gun owners.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the topic of data sources, a State response observed that sincea separate data base would apparently be used at the State level to maintainan applicant's certificate of purchase, there is a concern about subsequentarrests and convictions. Systematic purging would be required every 2 or3 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties organization was concerned over a link-up with theNCIC without providing protection for the privacy interests of prospectivepurchasers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If gun dealers are to be subject to criminal penalties for false inquiriesor unauthorized disclosures, a firearms group felt, then willfulness shouldbe a required element of the offense. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Requiring fingerprints on BATF form 4473 is a violation of privacyand civil liberty, asserted a firearms group and the exercise of a constitutionalright cannot be conditioned on making fingerprints available to police.Further, it said, any system where 50% of the cases receive false hitsdoes not meet the congressional mandates of accuracy and immediacy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As to the <T3>Draft Report's </T3>suggestion that additional efforts to ensure positiveidentification could include the dealer rolling the print of the applicant'sright index finger on the BATF form, one individual writer noted that ittakes training to roll a fingerprint correctly and that a photograph ofthe instant-developing, forgery-resistant type (such as used on driver'slicenses) taken at the point of sale would be superior. A firearms groupalso felt adding a fingerprint to the BATF form was a bad idea, suggestingthat handwriting analysis would be sufficient.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another individual writer felt that most point-of-sale telephone checkswill result in felons escaping identification and the occurrence of falsehits on eligible purchasers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Governor observed that if Option A were adopted, his State's identificationdivision would have to enter several thousand names in the index to updatethe system and that considerably more manpower would be needed for thename index file as well as the AIS-III index. Still, he preferred OptionA over a prior-approval system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A municipal police department felt a point-of-sale approval systemwould result in an estimated 33% increase in volume for that department.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of writers were concerned about cost. Cost was a major concernof the law enforcement organization that took the survey of its members(16% opposed Option A; 20% opposed Option B).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commenting on some of the disadvantages mentioned in the <T3>Draft Report, </T3>several writers have reiterated the <T3>Draft Report's </T3>observation that the validity of a telephone checkis only as reliable as the purchaser's identification documents. One individual,who felt Option A was at best a mediocre system, suggested that it wouldallow an unscrupulous dealer to sell firearms to a felon through use offalse identification. One of the State respondents made the same observation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At least two States have agreed with the <T3>Draft Report's </T3>observation that a major burden would be placedon the State repositories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One individual stated that call-back security could be a problem fordealers at gun shows, for those with more than one store, or for thosewith call-back line breaks. He observed that call-back systems are sometimesnot secure and a feature such as call forwarding could complicate securityeven more.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In response to the <T3>Draft Report's </T3>mention of the disadvantage of occasional technicalfailure, one individual understood that under the new Virginia system,the dealer may proceed with a sale if the State does not respond to a dealerinquiry within a specified time. He believed a similar provision shouldappear in any Federal statute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several comments expressed concerns that a high percentage of falsehits is an invasion of privacy. One suggested that defamation may alsobe a concern.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Of the suggested potential modifications, the one concerning possiblerelaxed point-of-sale procedures in some situations (as at gun shows andfor low-volume dealers) led one Governor to report that numerous indictmentswere recently obtained by prosecutors in his State for the sale of gunsby dealers who allegedly failed to demand presentation of the requiredState FOID cards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization suggested several potential modificationsincluding: (1) Required secondary verification only of persons whom therecords show with disabling convictions, but who claim their identitiesare mistaken; (2) a mere hit on out-of-State records should never shiftthe burden on certifying qualifications to the applicant; limitation ofsecondary verification searches to the State repository of residence maybe sufficiently effective and economical; (3) exemption of all .22 rimfirefirearms; and (4) limited time period for verification, so that qualifiedpurchasers be not unduly delayed, similar to the Virginia provision wherea hit or computer breakdown allows delay for only 1 day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the category of general comments, a civil liberties group expressedits view that Option A seems the most cost-effective and would be acceptableto that organization if it can meet specified criteria: (1) Nonabridgementof any constitutional rights; (2) destruction of records so that therecan in no way be a national registry of firearms owners; (3) accuracy,simplicity, and reasonable fees; (4) costs falling within realistic resourcesand budget limitation of local, State, and Federal governments; and (5)effectiveness in preventing felons from obtaining firearms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress felt that law enforcement agencies, not gun dealers,should access criminal records because of privacy concerns and also becausethose who are about to commit crimes or are mentally unstable might bedeterred from buying a firearm.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group suggested that because of its expertise and prospectiveinvolvement in point-of-sale options, the firearms industry should participatein any further work of the Task Force. This same group is committed tothe development and implementation of a point-of-sale approval system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A consulting firm preferred Option A over Option B because the formeris quick and puts minimum burdens on firearms purchasers, and the informationnecessary to do a point-of-sale approval is already required by the BATFforms. The comment added that Option A is feasible, whereas Option B dependson undeveloped technology, is too costly, and it will take years to getthe bugs out of such a system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However a Member of Congress believed point-of-sale systems will notwork because the technology to make accurate, instant checks at the purchasesite simply does not exist. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement organization noted that Option A provides a backgroundcheck prior to purchase, though there is no waiting period. It providesimmediate information to the gun dealer and the least inconvenience topurchasers. However its reliability caused some members concern becauseof the responsibility it placed on gun dealers and the difficulty of verifyingthe identity of buyers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option A1: Terminal access by gun dealer to disqualifying information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most comments on Option A1 felt it offered no particular advantagesand would be far costlier. However, a consulting organization, which isin favor of point-of-sale approval concepts because they are quick andput minimum burdens on firearms purchasers, recommends a combination ofOptions A1 and A2. This company claims that it has already developed asystem that incorporates both computer terminal access and touch-tone telephoneaccess. The comment maintains this combination cuts the time for a checkfrom 3 minutes using just a telephone to 30 seconds and that its systemwould be less expensive than the $36-$44 million estimate given by the<T3>Draft Report.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option A2: Touch-tone telephone access by gun dealer to disqualifyinginformation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As with Option A1, most of the concern was about the higher cost andrelatively little additional advantage. However, see the comment of a consultingfirm under the previous section for a differing view.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option A3: Live scan of fingerprints by gun dealer</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As with the previous two high-technology options, concern by thosewho commented was centered on the high cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, a Member of Congress suggested that fingerprint identificationby gun dealers is a goal we can achieve. The technology now exists, andthis is a rapidly improving science, he said.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some civil liberties and firearms group responses asserted that therequired fingerprints violate privacy right concepts; that persons shouldnot be required to give fingerprints to exercise a constitutional right.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option A4: Biometric identification  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Reaction to Option A4 was more positive than to the other variationsof Option A.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One firearms group suggested having a card to be read at the pointof sale in a manner similar to the present system of validating creditcard purchases. This system would need to include a method to ensure securityagainst unauthorized access, economic feasibility, a method for identifyingprospective purchasers, an accurate data base of felony convictions andother disqualifying factors, and an appeals system. It cautioned, however,that Americans are legitimately concerned that a screening system not resultin a de facto registration of all firearms complete with a data base ofall firearms owners. Issuance of a card on the Federal level would raiseconcern regarding the infringement of second amendment rights; thus itwould be more acceptable if cards_perhaps a ``smart card''_were issuedby States that could be used as a driver's license and for other purposesas well. Such issuance by the States would have to be federally mandated,and this group would support Federal legislation to this end.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group suggested that at the time of issuing a driver'slicense or State identification card, State police check records, and approvalor disapproval for firearms purchases would be encoded, visible only underultraviolet light. This card would be presented at the time of a firearmspurchase and be read by the dealer. The costs would be low and privacyassured. No master list could be compiled. For a more positive identificationcheck, a fingerprint could be placed on each State driver's license oridentification card.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement organization believed that Option A4 enhanced positiveidentification, but if implemented, the group suggested the biometric cardshould serve as a supplementary process rather than the primary and onlymeans of identification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As to fingerprints being required for the initial issuance of an owner'scard with renewals based on name and date-of-birth search only, it wasnoted by a State Governor that such a system would work only if initialfingerprints were retained on file to ensure that any conviction data wereproperly identified to the card number assigned.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 3. Prior approval systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option B: Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One law enforcement group favored Option B as the most viable andleast intrusive and burdensome for firearms purchasers and, it said, thatoption would offer the advantage of submitted fingerprints rather thanthe more inaccurate name check. Further, there would be adequate time toperform a complete record check and to interpret the criminal history recorddata. Also, it would afford the buyer who has encountered a false hit theopportunity to resolve the misinformation on a one-time basis as opposedto the time-consuming appeals system under Option A.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another law enforcement group liked Option B because it offered fingerprintidentification rather than the more problematic name check identificationmethod. It also said that variations of Option B had been proven effectivein several States, and it was compatible with possible future requirementsfor other disqualifications, such as illegal alien status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One law enforcement group suggested that the Federal Government createfrom its existing resources a felon clearinghouse that would be chargedwith positively identifying felons from any jurisdiction and would alsoinitiate a FOID system and actually issue the FOID cards. These would be``smart cards'' but would be issued only to persons who are eligible topurchase firearms. They would be issued every 5 years, thus reducing thecost, which would be borne by the applicant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One law enforcement group, preferring the more realistic fingerprintidentification check, envisioned the process as taking 2 to 4 weeks, ratherthan 4 to 6 weeks as the <T3>Draft Report </T3>indicated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A director of criminal justice of a State which has for many yearshad a prior-approval system analogous to Option B, strongly encouragedthe Federal Government to follow this general model, but voiced a strenuousobjection to any Federal requirement which would require the State to abandonits system to be replaced by one which would be more costly and at thesame time afford an inadequate opportunity for State law enforcement agenciesto conduct appropriate investigations into an applicant's overall fitnessand eligibility to purchase a firearm under State law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Governor of Illinois, a State that has a preapproval system usinga FOID card, reported that in 1988 2,470 individuals were denied a cardas a consequence of felony convictions, and in the same year 779 cardswere revoked as a result of felony convictions. He also noted that an advantageof a preapproval system is that it places the burden of operating costson those who desire to purchase firearms by imposing on them appropriatefees for operating costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another Governor, however, was concerned at the initial start-up costsof Option B, which he felt would be very expensive for the State's repository,and he estimates it would increase the data there by 55%. This, he feared,would be so costly as to be prohibitive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One civil liberties group suggested that for a more positive identificationcheck, a fingerprint be placed on each State driver's license or identificationcard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most civil liberties groups, however, expressed concern with OptionB. One found it unacceptable because it requires a large monetary investment,creates a bureaucratic nightmare for local law enforcement, requires keepingrecords on those who legitimately own firearms, and creates complicationssuch as a 4- to 6-week waiting period for legitimate gun buyers. It assertedthat a claimed advantage of Option B over A_that B would prevent falserejection based on name similarity_is illusory, because B requires allapplicants to be investigated, not just the 6-8% wrongly accused of havinga criminal history.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And another civil liberties group opposed a system that would requireall individuals to possess a document indicating eligibility to purchasefirearms. It also feared that a centralized data base of information onprospective firearms purchasers would be created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization stated that the FOID card concept violatesthe statutory directive calling for immediacy; that it is nothing lessthan a national registration scheme for nonfelons that forces citizenswho have never committed a crime to appear at police stations to be fingerprintedand photographed. It added that almost all States have rejected the FOIDcard concept and that the States have no constitutional duty to administerand enforce such a scheme.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress, reviewing the statutory history of section 6213,contended that the Congress in passing the amendment rejected any waitingperiod in favor of identifying felons attempting to purchase firearms atthe location of gun dealers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another Member felt that prior approval systems are the correct approachand urges that such a system be recommended to the Congress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A gun control group favored a variation of the prior approval systemoutlined in Option B for the purchase of handguns. It supported a certificate-of-purchasesystem where a prospective handgun purchaser would appear before the localpolice, would present valid photographic identification, and would completea Federal form asserting no impediment to handgun ownership. The applicantwould pay a user fee, be checked through available data bases, and if nodisqualifying conviction were found, would be issued the certificate ofpurchase. At the time of purchase, the buyer would present the certificateto the dealer, who would then be required to verify the purchaser's identityand the certificate's validity by telephoning the local law enforcementagency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option B1: Live scan of fingerprints by local law enforcement andbiometric check by gun dealer</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The State patrol chief of one State preferred Option B1 as being themost effective method of fulfilling the requirements and intent of theproposed goals. He does, however, list some concerns about this option,such as its cost-effectiveness and the financial impact on small dealers.This option would appear to require use of the applicant's fingerprintsin conjunction with an AFIS system, which would then have to be linkedto an automated records data base to comply with the immediacy requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement organization preferred this option above all others.The writer of this comment felt that any felon attempting to purchase firearmswill be identified. He saw no loopholes and believed that although thecost was higher, the lives saved would make it worthwhile.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other comments objected to implementation of this option because ofthe higher cost and the invasion of privacy and traditional notions ofcivil liberties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Option B2: Smart card containing disqualifying information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement organization suggested creating a felon clearinghousewhich would issue a FOID card in the form of a smart card, but unlike OptionB2 it would only be issued to qualified applicants after clearance by theclearinghouse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group stated that the concept of a smart card with positiveand possibly biometric identifiers is one which merits further investigation.Its chief advantage is the elimination of forgery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A State Governor was concerned about the high start-up costs of thisoption to his State's repository.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual advocated a system of placing a bar code on drivers'licenses which he thought would be less costly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group suggested that for more positive identificationa fingerprint could be placed on each State driver's license or identificationcard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, another civil liberties group asserted that the smart cardoption failed to meet the ``compelling interest'' test as laid down bythe U.S. Supreme Court.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another individual was concerned about forgery. He said that in thecase of cryptographically based smart card technology using public keyalgorithms, a compromise of the master encrypt key by any of the Statecenters could jeopardize the entire system's credibility, since forgerieswould be as good as originals in every respect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress suggested that the smart card system may be constitutionallyat-risk and programmatically deficient in numerous respects. Also, he said,the costs seem prohibitive and the potential to expand this system intoa nationalized identification card has serious problems. He also foundtroubling the lack of correct information held on the smart card.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group opposed universal smart cards as being overbroadand invasive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 4. Appeals procedures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group stressed that administrative appeal procedures mustbe quick and inexpensive. Any necessary judicial review must be de novowith attorney's fees awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. Further, it contended,appeal time should not be limited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One writer said his State's appeal system often results in high legalcosts to an applicant who must go through what he felt was a secretiveand lengthy appeals process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual asserted that an appeal procedure must be in place beforeany preapproval system is initiated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group stressed that the right to a judicial appeal is guaranteedby the Due-Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Part III. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Legal and policy issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several groups took exception to the conclusion of SEARCH Group'sstudy that there appear to be no constitutional impediments to the creationof felon identification systems. One firearms group asserted that requiringAmericans to be fingerprinted and interviewed by the police merely to exercisetheir Second Amendment right to keep (and thus acquire) and bear arms isa constitutional infringement. This group criticized the Department ofJustice for failing to discuss or even mention the second amendment, whichfailure, the group said, exhibits insensitivity by a department supposedlydedicated to the protection of the Constitution. The group also objectedto the reliance of the Task Force on the SEARCH study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another civil liberties group emphatically disagreed with the conclusionthat there appeared to be no constitutional impediments. Specifically,it questioned the constitutionality of the required fingerprinting provisionsof the options.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual saw a potential conflict between the right of privacyand an infringement on second amendment rights; however, he suggested thatconstitutional tests might be met if the concept were enlarged to includeother areas requiring background checks such as police or government workers,so that mere possession of an identity card would not automatically identifya firearms owner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group was wary of the Task Force proposals as infringingon a law-abiding citizen's right to privacy, the right to the absence ofunreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to keep and bear arms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another civil liberties group expressed its view that firearms licensure,regulation, and law enforcement responsibilities should remain within thepurview of the States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">A Federal or State system; mandatory or voluntary?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two law enforcement groups feel the implementation approach shouldbe a federally mandated cooperative Federal-State system. An individualasserted that the existence of 20,000 State and local gun laws is a disgraceand recommended Federal preemption of all State and local gun laws.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another individual felt it is best to let systems vary from Stateto State since the States know what will work best and apparently willbear most of the cost. He believed that a federally mandated system wouldrequire a transition period of at least 2 years in States that have theirown systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One State response suggested that a Federal standard be establishedwith Federal dollars to assist States in the implementation phase. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And the Governor of another State (who supports and whose State hasa preapproval system) was convinced the decision should be left to theStates for implementation and operation. He noted that in his State allcriterion arrests are State reported but 27% of these arrests are not furtherreported to the FBI Identification Center.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One Governor said he will not support drastic measures at the Federallevel to further limit the ownership of firearms, nor would he supporta Federal effort to encumber State criminal justice information agencieswith the responsibility of acting as a clearinghouse for the criminal historydata necessary to support a Federal felon identification system as proposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another State respondent noted that the start-up and operating costsare that State's most immediate concerns. The range of costs given in the<T3>Draft Report</T3> suggest an unbearable financial burden on State andlocal law enforcement agencies. More consideration needs to be given bothto the ultimate costs and the sources of funding, he said.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Sources of funding for criminal history checks </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As demonstrated in the previous two paragraphs, several of the Statecomments dealt with concerns about funding. One Governor, noting that costis a major question, felt that large sums of Federal funds would be requiredto assist the States and also local governments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another State concern was that problems would be posed for Stateswith limited resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another Governor observed that one of the advantages of a preapprovalsystem, such as the one his State has, is that it more easily places theburden of operating costs on those who desire to purchase firearms by imposingon them appropriate fees and operating costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group suggested that any system adopted should be fundedby Federal and State appropriations with funds coming from a general appropriationor a special felon tax, which would require felons to pay for the systemby extra fines and costs. This would be a true user fee, the group felt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual agreed with the latter approach, saying that the felon,not the public nor the lawful gun owner, is responsible for society's havingto go to such lengths. He suggested that the cost of the system be averagedover the prison population and added to each criminal's bill, just as restitutionis added at the present time. He stressed that under no circumstances shouldthe cost be passed on to the legitimate gun purchaser.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress believed that a system that has the least costor no cost to dealers and buyers is preferable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However a State director of criminal justice suggested that a userfee structure imposing a processing fee should be explored for fundingthe system rather than the use of tax dollars.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties organization suggested that manufacturers, dealers,and purchasers should share in the costs, though they should be sparedexcessive fees. It added that costs should fall within budget limitationsof local, State, and Federal governments; otherwise any system would beshort-lived and inadequately enforced.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Release of criminal history information to gun dealers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group asserted that an individual has a right toprivacy regarding his or her criminal history records and cited as authoritya 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision, <T3>U.S. Department of Justice </T3>v. <T3>Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press,</T3> 109 S. Ct. 1468,1485. This comment reiterated the <T3>Draft Report'</T3>s observation that learning whether a prospectivepurchaser even had a criminal history record may be viewed as a releaseof criminal history records to non-law-enforcement personnel. Often, thegroup noted, the person would eventually be found not to have a criminalrecord, but merely the same name and date of birth as a felon, which couldharm the person's reputation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual noted that a possible solution to the potential formisuse of criminal history data would be a computer-generated postcardsent to prospective purchasers informing them that a check had been made.Dealers need a similar mechanism to ensure that an employee does not misusethe dealer's number for abusive purposes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress said that law enforcement agencies, not gun dealers,should access criminal records, because of privacy concerns and also becausethose who are about to commit crimes or are mentally unstable might bedeterred from purchasing firearms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One firearms organization said it was not only in favor of, but committedto, an immediate point-of-purchase screening of prospective firearms purchasers.It recommended an electronic screening system in the form of a point-of-purchasecomputer terminal that could operate much like the current system for validationof credit cards. This would require a method such as an access code systemto secure the system from being used for other than its intended purpose.The response to an inquiry should be only an approved or a disapprovednotification without any further information about the reason.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Three individual commenters approved of this same system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">The issue of accuracy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The question of accuracy generated numerous comments, some of whichare set forth above in part I (The quality of felony conviction data) andelsewhere. Accuracy was an important concern of many responding to the<T3>Draft Report.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization contended that a system that turns down 725,000citizens annually, most of whom are not felons, is not accurate. Accuraterecords would aid the criminal justice system in many ways and would allowdistribution of felon lists to dealers, it noted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Creating a data base of firearm purchasers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Creating a data base of firearm purchasers would be dangerous to civiland individual rights, said one individual. A firearms group said thataverage Americans are capable of recognizing the proposals in the <T3>Draft Report</T3> for what they are: attempts to identify the typeand location of firearms with a view toward confiscating some of them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A law enforcement group observed that the ``radical element'' willview the use of a FOID card as the first step towards confiscation of gunsfrom all citizens if the democratic system is overthrown.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group said that while it may be correct ``in the narrowview'' that legal research indicates no apparent conflict between the <T3>Draft Report'</T3>s options and State or Federal law, the data basescreated could be expanded with abhorrent results. Such expansion coupledwith potential creation of a data base of all firearms purchasers and thetracking of all firearms owners raises serious constitutional issues. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group asserted that no permanent records of firearmstransactions should be kept, for such would be dangerous and subject toabuse. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An individual writer was concerned with the invasion of privacy involvedin the <T3>Draft Report'</T3>s proposals. He does not believe that eligible purchasers'names will be deleted from the data base and asserts that his interestin guns is nobody else's business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another civil liberties organization opposed a system that would causethe creation of a centralized data base of information on prospective firearmspurchasers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another firearms organization felt the proposals create a seriousdanger of a central registration system of firearms. The records of anyapproved persons, it says, should be destroyed by the close of the nextbusiness day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Potential ``tracking'' of firearm purchasers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A civil liberties group opposed any system that would allow trackingof individuals through a firearms owners data base.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms group contended that under the <T3>Draft Report'</T3>s proposals, a large data base of citizens who wantto purchase firearms would be created and would be used, among other ways,to interface with other government data bases such as IRS and Social Security.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Issuing documents authorizing firearm purchases</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of commenters, especially those from firearms groups andcivil liberties groups, objected to the prior approval systems as wellas to the point-of-sale systems insofar as the latter require those whofail the test initially to obtain subsequent documentation. These commentsgenerally pointed out that the required documentation unfairly singlesout firearm purchasers because they must prove that they are not felonsbefore otherwise exercising their rights to acquire firearms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Also some of these commenters expressed concern that the two systemsare in fact a method of building data bases containing the names of firearmowners that may later be used for investigative purposes or even to confiscateweapons in the event of civil disorder or the like.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The horrors that are inherent in such a national identification card,said one firearms group, are many. The infringement of civil libertiesimplicit in such proposals must be considered, warned a civil libertiesgroup. Americans are legitimately concerned that a screening system notresult in a de facto registration of all firearms, complete with a database of all firearms owners, said another civil liberties group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">The use of biometric data</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One civil liberties group opposed the routine fingerprinting of allprospective firearm purchasers as an intrusion into their privacy thatis not justified by the small benefit that may result from the systemsin the <T3>Draft Report. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization asserted simply that Americans should notbe routinely fingerprinted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Part IV. Supplementary materials</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 1. Relevant Federal statutes</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Member of Congress expressed his strong concern that the scope ofthe <T3>Draft Report </T3>``far exceeds'' the clear intentions of Congress.He asserted that the floor debate made it clear that the purpose of Sec.6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was to establish an identificationsystem at the point of purchase. It was not intended that this sectionauthorize development of a prior approval system of any kind, he said.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another Member said that he was convinced that the only truly accurateand effective way to keep felons from buying firearms from licensed dealersis to require that comprehensive background checks be undertaken on gunbuyers by the FBI and local police prior to the purchase. Although undersuch a system gun buyers would be required to wait a short time to purchasefirearms, he said he didn't believe such a system would seriously inconveniencelaw-abiding sportsmen and it would curtail crimes of passion and act asan enforcement mechanism to current law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Section 2. Current Practices: State practices regarding firearm sales</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A firearms organization said it believed the new Virginia point-of-saleapproval system is similar to Option A, but offered superior safeguards.This organization understands the Virginia system includes the following:(1) State police must respond during the dealer's call or by return callwithout delay; (2) if a disqualifying criminal record appears, the Statemust notify the dealer by the end of the next day or the sale may be made;(3) the dealer may make a sale after the end of the next business day inthe event of electronic failure; and (4) State police may not maintainrecords of qualified purchasers for more than 30 days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Governor of Illinois, pointing out the results of his State'sprior-approval system, noted that though it is not based on fingerprintdata, 2,470 individuals were denied a FOID card in 1988 as a consequenceof felony convictions and in the same year 779 cards were revoked as aresult of felony convictions.</ITAG>Oregon recently adopted a preclearance identification system that resemblesOption B. It is due to take effect Jan. 1, l990.<ITAG tagnum="74">Section 4. Study of other persons ineligible to purchase firearms</ITAG>A Member of Congress urged that any felon identification system be compatiblewith the system used to identify other prohibited persons such as thosewith mental disabilities or illegal aliens.One law enforcement organization, favoring Option B, noted that this optionwould be compatible with possible future requirements for identifying thosewith other disqualifications. An individual thought it would be extremely difficult to obtain data onpersons with mental deficiencies, as their physicians are rightfully veryprotective of their files.<ITAG tagnum="84">General comments</ITAG>There were numerous comments on the thorough study which the Task Forceundertook. Some examples include:andbullet; The Attorney General and the Task Force staff are to be congratulatedfor dealing extraordinarily well with this extremely sensitive subject,said one firearms group. andbullet; A gun control group said that the <T3>Draft Report</T3> is a significant step forward in the developmentof a responsible, effective, and comprehensive national gun policy. Itwas impressed by the depth and range of the options it contained and congratulatedthe Task Force for the considerable research and careful thought that obviouslywent into this study. andbullet; Another commenter congratulated the Attorney General for his leadershipon this important issue. andbullet; A Member of Congress, complimenting the Task Force on the comprehensiveand thorough nature of the study, said he felt that never before have wehad such a thorough analysis of the possible systems for preventing felonsfrom purchasing firearms. andbullet; A law enforcement organization commended the Task Force for anadmirable job on a difficult assignment. andbullet; Several State Governors made comments along the same lines.Other general comments included:A State criminal justice division director, writing at the request of theState's Governor, said that it was gratifying that the Congress has decidedto establish a Federal system for controlling access to firearms by convictedfelons. For many years his State has had a preapproval system roughly similarto Option B, and he commented that it seems entirely appropriate to discontinuethe practice which exists in some States of relying upon a prospectivefirearm purchaser's unverified assertion that he or she has never beenconvicted of a crime.A firearms group volunteered to help the Department reach the goal of keepingguns out of the hands of criminals without infringing on the right of law-abidingAmericans to own firearms.A number of writers asserted that gun ownership is a fundamental rightthat must not be infringed. One individual stated that the people havea right to rise up in arms and overthrow the government, and feared thatthe restriction of arms is an attempt to restrict the power of the peopleto change the government.A State director of criminal justice observed that some of the optionslack a mechanism to institute revocation proceedings upon a felony conviction.One individual advocated giving military weapons to servicemen leavingtheir military service.A civil liberties group suggested that the Attorney General should reportto Congress that it is not possible to implement the McCollum amendment.A writer believed the laws preventing felons from purchasing weapons areadequate, since they usually steal them.A Governor commented that with sufficient resources, any of these optionscould be made operational. A State director of law enforcement observed that it is obvious that somesystem should be put in place to aid society to keep guns out of the handsof criminals.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-25021 Filed 10-24-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4410-18-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
