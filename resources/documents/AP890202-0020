In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, Drs.Jocelyn M. Hicks of Children's Hospital in Washington and MarietIosefsohn of George Washington University said they askedsecretaries, clerks, messengers and janitors to analyze 200 urinesamples using two brands of home pregnancy kits. Ten percent of theresults of one test and 13 percent of the results of the other werewrong.   However, when a lab technician used the kits, one was 100 percentaccurate. The other kit gave no false results, although the resultswere indeterminate in four cases.   The researchers noted that the manufacturers claim the home kitsare 90 percent accurate.   ``It seems clear from our observations that the discrepantresults produced by laypersons were due more to difficulties inusing the home test kits and interpreting results than to problemswith the kits themselves,'' they wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
