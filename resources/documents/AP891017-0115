Stock of the airline's parent company, UAL Corp., was down$23.87{ to $199 a share by midday today on the New York StockExchange, after plummeting $56.87{ a share on Monday.   A $300-a-share offer by United's pilots and management collapsedand the company's stock price began plunging Friday when banksrefused to finance the $6.75 billion deal.   On Monday, top UAL Corp. executives flew to New York, Washingtonand Europe to meet with legal and financial advisers, bankers andlobbying strategists in an attempt to keep the buyout attempt alive.   Citibank, the New York-based bank that is leading a syndicate oflenders involved in the UAL deal, today confirmed reports that ithad presented potential Japanese lenders with terms for a revisedbid.   ``We have expressions of interest from both the borrower and thebanks,'' said spokeswoman Holly Cherico in New York. ``We do nothave an agreement ... but we are working with both towards comingto a satisfactory resolution with the financing.''   Under the proposed terms, the bid would be lowered to $250 ashare, said Akira Yokoo, a Citicorp spokesman in Tokyo. That wouldvalue UAL at about $5.62 billion.   The terms also called for a higher interest rate on the loan andbigger fees for participating banks, he said today.   United pilots issued a statement denying there was any formaloffer at $250.   ``All Citibank has been doing is sounding out various financialinstitutions to determine the acceptability of various changes fromthe original offer,'' the statement said.   U.S. and international banks have given ``expressions ofinterest'' in lending enough money to finance a UAL buyout, saidRodney F. Ballek, head of Citibank's corporate finance division.   Those expressions, which are not formal commitments, are``significantly in excess of what is required,'' Ballek told TheNew York Times.   However, the newspaper said it was not clear whether the termsof the financing would be acceptable to the management-pilot buyoutgroup.   When the buyout group, which also includes British Airways PLC,announced Friday that financing had not gone through, it helpedtrigger a 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average,the steepest one-day point decline since the 1987 crash.   UAL stock Monday closed at $222.87{, down $56.87{ on the day.   Stephen Dexter, an airline industry analyst with KemperFinancial Services Inc., said that shows that the market ``hasvery, very high doubt as to whether this deal can be consumated.''</TEXT></DOC>
