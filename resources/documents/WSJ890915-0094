The institute, a Washington trade group that reports its weekly findings to the Federal Reserve, said assets grew in all fund categories.    On Wednesday, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said assets in the 389 funds it follows swelled $3.6 billion, to $339.6 billion. The Holliston, Mass., newsletter largely attributed the big run-up to a declining stock market last week.    Donoghue's also said the average seven-day compounded yield rose for the first time since May to 8.61%, from 8.58%. A longer-term yield measure declined.    &quot;The yields on money-market funds inched up from their recent trough, and yield spreads in their favor widened slightly,&quot; said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the institute. &quot;The strength of continuing inflows into money-market funds is particularly noteworthy during this 'back to school' season, when people usually draw their cash balances down.&quot;    The 141 institutional funds increased assets by $79.9 million, to $84.85 billion, according to the institute. The 227 general-purpose funds rose by $805.2 million, to $111.48 billion; the 95 broker-dealer funds grew by $1.53 billion, to $150.74 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
