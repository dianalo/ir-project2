The union members, including 43,300 in the Seattle area, took tothe picket lines after midnight.   At Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., thesecond-largest concentration of union members, pickets letnon-strikers' cars through one at a time after sometimes heatedexchanges. Traffic was backed up about a mile.   The wife of a picket who jumped onto a car entering the plantfell and suffered bruises, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.   In Seattle, pickets shivered in 45-degree weather outside Boeingheadquarters.   ``People are willing to picket, willing to do whatever ittakes,'' said picket Brian McTighe. ``The attitude seems to bemilitant.''   No new talks have been announced.   The strike hits a company struggling to meet delivery schedulesin the midst of its fifth consecutive year of record jetlinerorders.   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' saidTom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751. ``We justwant to go through the good times with them as well as the hardtimes.''   The Machinists voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to reject athree-year contract offer. The union represents the bulk of thecompany's production workers, who perform tasks ranging fromriveting, wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspectionsand machine-tool maintenance.   The Machinists last struck Boeing in 1977, for two months.   Airlines and leasing companies striving to replace their agingfleets and meet a surge in passenger traffic have ordered 736planes worth $38.5 billion so far this year. Though Pentagoncutbacks have reduced military business, Boeing's commercialdivision has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $70billion, with deliveries extending into the mid-1990s.   The backlog has caused embarrassing delays in deliveries of thenew 747-400 jumbo jet, Boeing's first in two decades, and forcedworkers to put in heavy overtime.   ``We're working on airplanes,'' said Dave Branson, a workeroutside the Everett plant. ``We shouldn't be working fatigued. Theypush for quantity, not quality.''   Boeing promised to meet delivery schedules ``to the best of ourability.'' Spokesman Paul Binder said the company was trying tofind supervisors to work assembly lines and keep jets rolling out.He said there were no plans to bring in outsiders.   ``This is a negotiating position,'' Binder said of the company'slatest offer. ``It's not a take-it-or-leave-it.'' He refused tocomment further on the company's reaction to the walkout.   Union spokesman Jack Daniels said it would take two to threeweeks to shut down operations completely because supervisors couldfinish some nearly completed planes with parts on hand.   A shutdown could worsen the U.S. trade deficit. Boeing is thecountry's largest exporter.   Baker said union members were determined to get a better shareof Boeing's record prosperity. The company earned $614 million lastyear on sales of $16.96 billion. Boeing also holds $3.66 billion incash and short-term notes.   The company's three-year offer included an immediate 4 percentraise with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonusesof 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percentthe next.   Workers haven't had an increase in base wages _ which determinepensions and other benefits _ for six years, although Boeing paidbonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988.   The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and thecost-of-living adjustment.   For the average Machinist making $13.39 per hour, the offerwould have given an additional $13,800 in income over the nextthree years.   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdomejeered the offer Tuesday and folded summaries of it into paperairplanes that sailed down from the second and third tiers of theindoor stadium.   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract thistime you'll never get one,'' Justin Ostro, general union vicepresident and bargaining coordinator, told the crowd.   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 inwestern Washington. In addition to the Seattle workers, theMachinists represent 12,000 employees in Wichita, about 1,700workers in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others in California,Hawaii, Montana, Utah and some other states.   Baker said $100 million is available in a strike fund from theparent union, which has been on strike against Eastern Airlinessince March. Strike pay is a flat $100 a week per union member, headded.</TEXT></DOC>
