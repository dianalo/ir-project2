The yen remained dogged byspeculation about interest rates.   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6705 marks,up from 1.6610 marks late Monday in New York.

TheU.S. currency also was trading at 1.6726 marks, up from1.6620 marks Tuesday.   Traders described Monday's softening in the dollar as atechnical correction following last week's virtuallyuninterrupted rise. They said the dollar appears headed for atest of a key resistance level at 1.6800 marks, its high lastweek.   &quot;The dollar has been influenced by chart levels. There'snothing fundamental that's come out to affect the dollar oneway or another,&quot; said Albert Soria, first vice president andforeign-exchange manager in New York for Kansallis OsakePankki, Finland's largest commercial bank.   With no major U.S. economic indicators due beforetomorrow's data on retail sales for February, Mr. Soria saidtrading is likely to be dominated by technical factors. Hesaid he isn't certain if there is enough upward momentum tocarry the dollar to 1.6800 marks before tomorrow.   Retail sales are expected to have increased 0.8% inFebruary, largely due to firmer auto and chain-store sales,according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital MarketsReport. Excluding autos, retail sales are seen rising 0.4%.In January, retail sales picked up 0.6%, as did retail salesexcluding autos.   The dollar gained against the pound after Chancellor ofthe Exchequer Norman Lamont unveiled a fiscal 1993 budgetstatement that was &quot;economically sensible, but politicallydamaging,&quot; according to Mark Biagini, vice president andchief dealer of forward currencies in New York for StandardChartered Bank PLC.   While the budget plan would lift some of the tax burdenfrom individuals and companies, Mr. Biagini said marketparticipants were disappointed that the basic personal taxrate was left unchanged at 25%, and that no tax relief wasprovided for home buyers.   Mr. Lamont forecast that the government's public sectorborrowing requirement would double from a projected #14billion ($24.05 billion) in the current fiscal year endingMarch 31 to #28 billion in fiscal 1993.   Sterling's reaction to the budget announcement left manytraders and analysts uncertain whether there is room for ananticipated cut in the British base lending rate from thecurrent 10.5%.   Some had hoped a bullish budget message might provide theimpetus to ease credit, a move many observers insist theConservative Party must make in order to survive a nationalelection that must be held by July 9.   Although the budget message was regarded as lackluster,Mr. Soria of Kansallis Osake Pankki said expectations for asell-off in sterling might be premature.   Standard Chartered's Mr. Biagini said the budget indicatesthe Conservatives have &quot;given up the opportunity to moveahead and stay ahead of the Labor Party.&quot;   The yen continued to slip, as participants speculatedabout the timing and size of the next cut in Japan's officialdiscount rate.   Although most players have already factored into theirdealings a half-percentage-point cut in the current 4.5%discount rate, traders said talk is growing that Bank ofJapan might have to ease by three-fourths of a point if themove is to be of any help to the ruling Liberal DemocraticParty.   Analysts said 135.00 yen appears to be the next long-termtarget for the dollar, but traders said the U.S. currency mayapproach that level slowly with many players wary of Bank ofJapan intervention around 134.00 yen.   Elsewhere yesterday, the Bank of Canada was seen sellingthe stronger U.S. currency at 1.1963 Canadian dollars in aneffort to slow the Canadian dollar's rapid deterioration. TheCanadian currency has been hurt by recession and lowerinterest rates in Canada, as well as worry over a possibleindependence referendum by the province of Quebec.   Canadian monetary officials need to ease monetary policyto spur a recovery, but &quot;its tough to get rates down whilekeeping the currency firm,&quot; noted Kevin Weir, a vicepresident in New York for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.</TEXT></DOC>
