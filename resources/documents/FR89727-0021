Thewhite cat's paw (<T3>Epioblasma</T3> (=<T3>Dysnomia</T3>) <T3>sulcata delicata</T3>), the northern subspecies of the cat's paw pearlymussel known from the Lake Erie system of the St. Lawrence drainage, waslisted as endangered on June 14, 1976 (41 FR 24064). The purple cat's paw,which is characterized as a large river species (Bates and Dennis 1985),has a medium-size shell that is subquadrate in outline (Bogan and Parmalee1983). The shell has fine, faint, wavy green rays with a smooth and shinysurface. The inside of the shell is purplish to deep purple (the insideshell of the white cat's paw is white). Like other freshwater mussels,the purple cat's paw feeds by filtering food particles from the water.It has a complex reproductive cycle in which the mussel's larvae parasitizefish. The mussel's life span, fish species its larvae parasitize, and otheraspects of its life history are unknown. The purple cat's paw pearly mussel was historically distributed in theOhio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River systems in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana,Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Isom <T3>et al.</T3> 1979, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission 1980, Parmalee<T3>et al.</T3> 1980, Watters 1986, Stansbery 1970). Based on personalcommunication with knowledgeable experts (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson,Tennessee Valley Authority, 1987; Mark Gordon and Robert Anderson, TennesseeTechnological University, 1988; Arthur Bogan, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences,1988; Ronald Cicerello, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission, 1988; DavidStansbery, Ohio State University, 1987) and a review of current literature,the species is known to survive in only two river reaches, but apparentlyas nonreproducing populations. These are located in the Cumberland River,Smith County, Tennessee, and the Green River, Warren and Butler Counties,Kentucky. The continued existence of these two populations is questionable. Unlessreproducing populations can be found or methods can be developed to maintainthese or create new populations, the species will become extinct in theforeseeable future. Any individuals that do still survive in these tworiver reaches are also threatened from other factors. The Green River inKentucky has experienced water quality problems related to the impactsfrom oil and gas production in the watershed. The individuals still survivingin the Cumberland River are potentially threatened by gravel dredging,channel maintenance, and commercial mussel fishing. Although the speciesis not commercially valuable, incidental take of the species does sometimesoccur in the Cumberland River during commercial mussel fishing for otherspecies. The purple cat's paw pearly mussel was recognized by the Service as a category2 species (one that is being considered for possible addition to the FederalList of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife) in a May 22, 1984, notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 21664). On May 2, 1988, and September8, 1988, the Service notified Federal, State, and local governmental agenciesand interested individuals by mail that a status review was being conductedspecifically on the purple cat's paw pearly mussel and that the speciescould be proposed for listing. Since that time, additional contacts withFederal and State agency personnel and the scientific community have occuredconcerning the species' status, its potential for protection under theEndangered Species Act, and possible future recovery actions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531<T3> et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth procedures for adding speciesto the Federal list. A species may be determined to be endangered or threateneddue to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to the purple cat's paw pearly mussel (<T3>Epioblasma</T3> (=<T3>Dysnomia</T3>)<T3> obliquata obliquata</T3> (=<T3>E. sulcata sulcata</T3>)) are as follows:A.<T3> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> The purple cat's paw pearly mussel was onceknown from the large tributaries of the Ohio River system in Ohio, Indiana,Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). However,all but two of the historically known populations were apparently lostdue to conversion of many sections of the bigger rivers to a series oflarge impoundments. This seriously reduced the availability of preferredriverine gravel/sand habitat and likely affected the distribution and availabilityof the mussel's fish host. As a result, the species' distribution has beensubstantially reduced.The State of Indiana has no current records of the species in the State(Indiana Department of Natural Resources, personal communication, 1988).The species has not been collected in Illinois in over 100 years (IllinoisNatural History Survey Division, personal communication, 1988). In Kentuckythe species is now known only from the Green River, Warren and Butler Counties,Kentucky (Kentucky Fish and Wildlife and Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission,personal communication, 1988). This Green River population is representedby only one old but freshly dead individual taken on the Green River inWarren and Butler Counties, Kentucky, in 1988 (Robert Anderson, TennesseeTechnological University, personal communication, 1988). Prior to 1988,the mussel had not been collected in the Green River since 1971 (KentuckyNature Preserves Commission, personal communication, 1988). The middleCumberland River (Smith County, Tennessee) contains the only known livingrepresentative of the purple cat's paw in Tennessee (U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers, personal communication, 1988). The historical collection sitein Alabama (on the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals) is now impounded (Bogenand Parmalee 1983).The two surviving populations are threatened from impacts on their environment.The Green River population is threatened from degradation of water qualityresulting from inadequate environmental controls of oil and gas explorationand production facilities, and from altered stream flows from upstreamreservoirs. The Cumberland River population is potentially threatened byriver channel maintenance, navigation projects, and gravel and sand dredging.B.<T3> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> Although the species is not commercially valuable, it doesexist on harvested mussel beds, and the species is therefore sometimestaken by mussel fishermen. Thus, take does pose some threat to the species.Federal protection would help to control the take of individuals.C.<T3> Disease or predation.</T3> Although the purple cat's paw pearly musselis undoubtedly consumed by predatory animals, there is no evidence thatpredation threatens the species. However, freshwater mussel die-offs haverecently (early to mid-1980s) been reported throughout the MississippiRiver basin, including the Tennessee River and its tributaries (RichardNeves, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, personal communication,1986). The cause of the die-offs has not been determined, but significantlosses have occurred to some populations.D.<T3> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> The Statesof Kentucky and Tennessee prohibit taking fish and wildlife, includingfreshwater mussels, for scientific purposes without a State collectingpermit. However, these States do not protect the species from take forother purposes. Federal listing will provide the species additional protectionunder the Endangered Species Act by requiring Federal permits to take thespecies and by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Service whenprojects they fund, authorize, or carry out may affect the species.E.<T3> Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Neither of the presently known populations is known to be reproducing.Therefore, unless reproducing populations can be found or methods can bedeveloped to maintain existing populations or create new ones, the specieswill be lost in the foreseeable future. In fact, both known populationsmay contain only old individuals that have passed their reproductive age.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the purple cat's paw pearly mussel (<T3>Epioblasma</T3> (=<T3>Dysnomia</T3>)<T3> obliquata obliquata</T3> (=<T3>E. sulcata sulcata</T3>)) as an endangered species. Historical recordsreveal that the species was once much more widely distributed in many ofthe large rivers of the Ohio River system. Presently only two isolated,apparently nonreproducing populations are known to survive. Due to thespecies' history of population losses and the vulnerability of the tworemaining populations, threatened status does not appear appropriate forthis species (see ``Critical Habitat'' section for a discussion of whycritical habitat is not being proposed for the purple cat's paw pearlymussel).<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for the purple cat's paw pearly mussel at this time,owing to the lack of benefits from such designation. The U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Park Serviceare the three Federal agencies most involved, and they, along with theState natural resources agencies in Tennessee and Kentucky, are alreadyaware of the location of the remaining populations that would be affectedby any activities in these river reaches. All the Federal agencies mentionedhave conducted studies in these river basins and are knowledgeable of thefauna and of their projects' impacts. No additional benefits would accruefrom critical habitat designation that would not also accrue from the listingof the species. In addition, this species is so rare that taking for scientificpurposes and private collection could be a threat. The publication of criticalhabitat maps and other publicity accompanying critical habitat designationcould increase that threat. The location of populations of this specieshas consequently been described only in general terms in this proposedrule. Any existing precise locality data would be available to appropriateFederal, State, and local governmental agencies through the Service officedescribed in the <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibition against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.The Service has notified Federal agencies that may have programs that affectthe species. Federal activities that could occur and impact the speciesinclude, but are not limited to, the carrying out or the issuance of permitsfor hydroelectric facility construction and operation, reservoir construction,river channel maintenance, stream alterations, wastewater facilities development,and road and bridge construction. It has been the experience of the Service,however, that nearly all section 7 consultations have been resolved sothat the species has been protected and the project objectives have beenmet. In fact, the areas inhabited by the purple cat's paw pearly musselare also inhabited by other mussels that have been federally listed since1976. The Service has a history of successful resolution of section 7 conflictsthat have protected the species and allowed for project objectives to bemet throughout these areas.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take any listed species, importor export it, ship it in interstate commerce in the course of commercialactivity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce.It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or shipany such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions wouldapply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or forincidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 100Otis Street, Room 224, Asheville, NC 28801.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Bates, J.M., and S.D.
