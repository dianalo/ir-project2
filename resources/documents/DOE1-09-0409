Metallurgical coal accounts for nearly 61% of the internationalcoal market while steam coal's share is about 40%. By year-end 1983,the U.S. was the single largest coal exporter at 77 million tonnes, followedby Australia, 56 million tonnes; Poland, 35 million tonnes; South Africa,28 million tonnes; USSR, 27 million tonnes. Japan is the largest importerof coal, 73.8 million tons in 1983. Although the majority of Japan'simports are metallurgical coal, steam coal imports into Japan increasedseven-fold between 1978 and 1983, from 2 to 14 million tonnes. Australiais the leading exporter of both metallurgical and steam coal to Japan,accounting for 47% and 55% of Japan's coal imports, respectively. TheU.S. is the leading supplier of metallurgical coal and South Africa isthe major supplier of steam coal. The U.S. was not even a factor in theEuropean steam coal market in 1978 and has made inroads during the lastsix years at the expense of Poland and South Africa. The use of coal(solid fuels) as a fuel to produce electricity has had increasing significancefor most of the countries analyzed between 1978 and 1983. The flip sideto this is that oil has lost its share of this market during this timeperiod. Of all the countries selected, only France reported a declinein coal's share of total electricity production. This is a reflectionof France's ambitious nuclear program.</TEXT></DOC>
