This is especially dangerousbecause knock may be inaudible above the other noises from the vehicle,so there is no warning of the impending danger. The aim of Octane Requirement(OR) tests is to determine whether an engine can operate free from knock.This is different from being able to operate satisfactorily without damageon a gasoline of lesser Octane Number (ON). There is no advantage tobe gained from using a gasoline of ON greater than the minimum that anengine can run on satisfactorily. Octane requirement surveys are carriedout in Europe, in the USA, in Japan, and in Australia. There is no similarprogram in the Republic at present.</TEXT></DOC>
