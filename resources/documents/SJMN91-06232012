Plaskett, chairman of Pan American World Airways.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TAKING ON A LATIN ACCENTSLIMMED-DOWN PAN AM PINS HOPES ON ITS LATINAMERICAN ROUTES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The goal of the sale is to entice people to keep flying Pan Am long enoughfor the ailing airline to complete its deal with Delta.;    But Pam Amexecutives also hope to get fliers and the nation's travel industry acquaintedwith a Pan Am that is not only smaller but also refocused -- largely onservice to Latin America.;    Compared with the old Pan Am, a leader incommercial aviation for much of its 64-year history, the portrait that emergesmight seem jolting. And it has not dispelled many of the doubts among industryanalysts and consultants about how long the airline can survive.;    Plaskettinsists the airline will remain a familiar presence on the national scene. Oras he chanted this last week over and over again, almost like a mantra, &quot;It'llstill be a major airline.&quot;;    Certainly, though, not as major as it used tobe. The airline that is expected to emerge from bankruptcy by Dec. 1 lookslike it will have about $1 billion in revenues, roughly one-quarter of whatPan Am took in last year.;    That would make it comparable to mid-sizeairlines like America West or Southwest, placing it about 10th or 11th in thedomestic rankings this year, down from 8th last year.;    Though it will stillfly between its main hub in Miami and 10 U.S. cities, including New York,Boston, Chicago and Washington, the new Pan Am will primarily service SouthAmerica, Central America and the Caribbean.;    Using Miami as its gateway toLatin America, Pan Am will move its Park Avenue headquarters to some vacantoffice space it owns in Miami.;    Plaskett estimated that the move wouldeliminate about 2,200 more jobs from the New York area, on top of the 2,800 orso that were lost as part of a company-wide cutback announced earlier thismonth.;    Another big difference is that the new airline will no longer bepublicly traded. Creditors will own 55 percent of the stock in the reorganizedcompany, and the rest will go to Delta, which has promised to feed connectingpassengers from all over the country into Miami and to use its marketingmuscle to insure the venture's success.;    Because Pan Am's Latin Americandivision has historically operated at a profit, both Pan Am and Delta expectthe new airline to make money from the start.;    The creditors say thatDelta's financial advisers, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., have told them that theairline's after-tax profit could jump from a projected $18 million in 1992 to$83 million in 1995.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910819  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  507  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday August 19, 199100232012,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
