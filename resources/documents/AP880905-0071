Chun Kyong-hwan was sentenced by a three-judge panel of theSeoul District Criminal Court, which also found 11 of hisaccomplices guilty of similar charges and gave them prison termsranging from one to three years. Six other people were givensuspended terms of up to 1{ years and freed.   Chun Kyong-hwan, 46, was convicted of diverting more than $10million in official funds, taking bribes and abusing power to makeillegal profits.   ``The defendants deserve stern punishment for taking personalprofits by abusing power,'' said Senior Judge Park Young-moo inrendering the verdict.   The judge said, ``The defendant, as the younger brother of thethen president who upheld the realization of a society of justice,actually did what was contrary to that.''   ``It is our belief that the defendant should not be givenlenient treatment because of his relation to the ex-president.Likewise, he also should not be punished excessively, simplybecause he is the younger brother of an unpopular president,'' hesaid.   The younger Chun was convicted for using his position as head ofthe semi-official Saemaul (New Community) development group toembezzle official funds, extort contributions from businesses andpeddle government influence.   The prosecution had demanded a 15-year term for Chun.   Prosecutors said Chun took bribes and embezzled millions whilehe headed Saemaul from 1981 to 1987. He was accused of using themoney for stock and land speculation.   Chun, who wore traditional white Korean clothing and prisoners'rubber shoes, appeared calm while the judge read a lengthystatement on the court's decision. After a one-hour hearing, Chunand the other defendants were led to a bus to be sent back toprison as guards held off jeering protesters.   Under Korean law, Chun and the other defendants have one week toappeal their cases for trial by a higher court. Court sources saidboth the defendants and the prosecution are expected to appeal thesentences.   In his final testimony, the younger Chun said he did nothingwrong and claimed that he was being used as a political scapegoat.   He emerged from obsecurity to head the Saemaul program one yearafter his brother seized power with military backing in 1980.   The former president and his family have come under public firefor alleged involvement in major financial scandals.   A parliamentary investigative committee recently demanded theex-president and 15 members of his family be forbidden to leave thecountry while an investigation into alleged corruption is under way.   The government imposed a foreign travel ban on some suspects,but declined to limit the former president's movements.   The governing Democratic Justice Party has also blockedopposition attempts to make the former president testify before theNational Assembly.   Following massive anti-government protest, Chun stepped down atthe end of a seven-year term in February to be replaced byPresident Roh Tae-woo, who won presidential elections over rivalopposition candidates in December.</TEXT></DOC>
