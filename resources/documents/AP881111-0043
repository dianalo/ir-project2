The memory still haunts him a half-century later.   ``I saw the synagogue burning. Our home was destroyed, and booksand precious family heirlooms were thrown out the window,desecrated,'' Mayer said of the night of Nazi terror 50 years ago inhis hometown Worms.   Sitting Thursday in the reconstructed synagogue, Mayer said, ``Iremember that night as if it were yesterday.''   Mayer, of Wayne, N.J., was visiting his birthplace along with 40other members of the New York-based International Memorial Committeefor Jewish Victims of Nazism.   The occasion for the visit, which included several Worms-bornJews from America, was to mark the anniversary of the Kristallnachtpogrom of Nov. 9-10, 1938. Worms is 35 miles southwest of Frankfurt.   On that night, Nazi thugs destroyed hundreds of synagogues,thousands of Jewish homes and businesses, and sent 30,000 Jews toconcentration camps. Ninety-one Jews were killed.   ``The next morning, my mother, brother, sister, aunt, grandfatherand I were sent to a jail with no facilities. About 70 people werecrammed into a small room,'' Mayer told The Associated Press.   ``It was called `protective custody' to protect us from theGerman people, who were supposedly `rightfully' angry at us,'' Mayersaid in English.   His father was sent to Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald, andneither he nor Mayer's mother survived the Holocaust. Their namesare now on a plaque in the synagogue, along with other Jews fromWorms who were systematically murdered.   Mayer later fled to France and eventually the United States. Hesaid he has since visited Worms and other West German cities manytimes, often because of his work as a business consultant.   Before the Holocaust, Worms had a rich Jewish tradition dating tothe Middle Ages.   The 11th-century synagogue and adjoining mikvah, or ritual bath,draws tourists from across the country. A small Jewish museum hasbeen built next to the synagogue and the complex is on a street ofold houses preserved from the neighborhood's long era as a Jewishquarter.   But Worms' Jewish population was nearly wiped out during theThird Reich. City officials say only one or two Jews are living inWorms today, compared to a pre-Nazi Jewish population of about 1,100.   Committee president Gerhard Spies, 72, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., lostnumerous relatives during the Nazi period. He said his father, apresident of Worms' former Jewish Community, was ``a broken man''after internment in Buchenwald.   One important goal of the committee's visits to Worms, Spiessaid, was to talk to West German youth.   ``I have made peace with myself, and when I come here I visitschools and talk to young people. I tell them what a Jew is, what hethinks about different things, and exchange viewpoints,'' Spies said.   Spies said he has been disappointed by most young people's lackof knowledge about Jews.   ``This may be changing now, but even two years ago I found a lackof understanding in many issues concerning Israel and Judaism. Eventhe teachers themselves were sometimes misinformed,'' Spies said.   Another committee member said the situation among youth ischanging for the better.   ``There's been a definite change, an improvement as time goeson,'' said Henry R. Huttenbach, a history professor from Brooklyn,N.Y. ``They're asking questions, healthy questions. The dialogueshows a larger number of concerned kids.''   The committee has participated with the city of Worms in severalevents marking Kristallnacht and similar events throughout WestGermany. But few seemed to think it will have a lasting effect.   ``The extravaganza on national television served the politicians,but it isn't the quiet, patient work needed at the communitylevel,'' Huttenbach said.</TEXT></DOC>
