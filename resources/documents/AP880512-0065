The Nikkei index, the main market barometer, lost as much as194.95 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, dropping belowthe 27,000-level for the first time since April 22. The fall,prompted by the overnight plunge on Wall Street caused by primerate hikes and concern over inflation, turned investors to hunt forbargains, traders said.   ``There are several factors, such as the result of the upcoming30-year bond sale in the quarterly U.S. Treasury refunding, andU.S. trade figures for March, which investors are keeping eyes onin making major moves,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.   The overall buying mood was strong, however, and unlesssomething really surprising happens, the market will maintain itsbullish trend, he said.   Popular issues included shipbuildings and machineries.Chemicals, non-ferrous metals, textiles and rubbers also gainedground. Lower issues were steels and electricals.
