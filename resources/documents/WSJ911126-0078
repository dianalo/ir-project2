With only an inheritedhandful of small media properties to draw on, he fought 17years to rebuild the weaker of Little Rock, Ark.'s twodailies and eventually to vanquish the mighty Gannett Co.   Victory came last month when Gannett, publisher of USAToday and the nation's largest newspaper chain, shut down the172-year-old Arkansas Gazette, whose assets were swallowed byMr. Hussman's Arkansas Democrat. The demise of the Gazette,which 35 years ago played a courageous role in a keyintegration battle, isn't reason to celebrate. Nor is theexistence of another one-daily town. But for a deathstruggle, this had inspirational elements.</LP><TEXT>   In Little Rock, the papers fought and the readers won.Local coverage was deepened, subscription prices were cut andcirculation expanded, advertising was sometimes given awayand political distinctions were sharpened. (The Democrat wasthe conservative choice.) Although it can't be known how muchwill change now that Mr. Hussman rules the roost -- already,most advertising rates have been raised -- the experiencechallenged assumptions that the metropolitan U.S. press isset on superficial sameness.   Above all, the result is spit in the eye of the NewspaperPreservation Act, which fosters joint-operating agreements(JOAs) of supposedly failing papers. Mr. Hussman, whoinitially sought JOA protection after buying the Democrat in1974, now acknowledges that JOAs are for &quot;losers.&quot; He hasbecome a &quot;discomfort&quot; to many other publishers, he says.   The Democrat in the mid-1970s had all the markings ofmortality. It was an afternoon publication and decidedlysecond fiddle, both in advertising and circulation, in amarket of fewer than 500,000 people. Mr. Hussman switched tomorning delivery and initiated free want ads. The ColumbiaMBA grad cracked the Gazette's displayad dominance byenticing Little Rock-based Dillard Department Stores with anovel deal: all the pages you want for a fixed fee. Somethought the open-ended offer wacky, but he knew the retailerhad &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; layout schedules for major and minor ad buysand &quot;I figured they're not going to create a `C' schedulejust for us.&quot;   The Gazette's family owners sued -- unsuccessfully --alleging predatory pricing. But Mr. Hussman maintains, on thebasis of Gazette records he acquired in last month's sale buthas not made public, that the Gazette outspent the Democratby at least $7 million annually prior to Gannett's entrancein 1986.   With similar sunk costs, he says, both papers could havemade perhaps a 10% return on investment if the Gazette hadjust streamlined its operation. Instead, its owners sold for$60 million to Gannett. The stakes ratcheted up, Mr. Hussmanconcluded Gannett would require monopoly profits from theGazette -- and thus the demise of the Democrat -- to return arequisite yield.   The newspaper war thus intensified, and to some in thebusiness it was unseemly. Mr. Hussman and Gannett exchangedfire on fronts near and far. All the while, however, thepeople of Little Rock were probably the best-servedreadership -- per subscription dollar, anyway -- in thenation. If items sometimes were done to death as enlargedreporting staffs tried to one-up each other, so what. TheGazette discounted home delivery to 85 cents a week, but theDemocrat's gimmicks to increase &quot;penetration&quot; were even moreeffective. Its Sunday circulation more than doubled. Againciting the unreleased records, Mr. Hussman says his papergained in the face of what was now a $10 million yearlyoperating disadvantage.   While the Gazette installed a $1.6 millioncomputer-editing system, he claims he bought one used for$50,000 and split it between the Democrat and a sister paper.   With all the chips, the Gazette played the wrong hand, MrHussman says. &quot;Their attitude was, `We're Gannett, we knowhow to put out a more interesting, breezy, readable newspaperbecause we do it in three or four dozen markets.'&quot; But thesplashy color brought &quot;marginal&quot; readers and various changescost the loyalty of upscale households more comfortable withthe traditional Gazette, a paper of record.   &quot;The more fluff they put in the paper, the more we movedinto harder content,&quot; says Mr. Hussman. More than a monthafter his victory, he sounds as combative as ever. Indeed,unusually bad blood remains. Mr. Hussman sees bitternesstoward him and the Democrat shifting onto Gannett, althoughGazette employees &quot;weren't that pleased that we picked up thename in our nameplate.&quot; The day after the deal closed, he waspublishing the Democrat Gazette.   Political philosophy figured in the feud. Under Mr.Hussman, the Democrat raised its conservative voice,attacking Gov. Bill Clinton as well as busing plans andcivil-rights quotas (although the publisher says it promoteseconomic opportunities for blacks). In the Gazette's waningdays, left-liberal Hollywood producer HarryBloodworth-Thomason (&quot;Designing Women&quot;) was among a fewArkansas natives trying to rescue it.   The Democrat fostered the idea that its rival was elitistand talked down to its readership, even while pandering totheir presumed trifling tastes. Mr. Hussman insists, however,that the right-left split wasn't decisive.   Maybe ideology wasn't essential to the outcome, but itcould help to explain why the Democrat's triumph over thegiant outsider has so few in the media-academic world jazzedup. Of course, Arkansas is not on the itinerary of mostnational journalists, so geography can account forinattention to date, as can bad luck: A reporter for thisnewspaper had been preparing a major story on Mr. Hussman'sconquest, only to be aced out when the New York Times drewfirst blood.   Moreover, the Democrat's conservatism is measured. It hasnot been consistently anti-tax, observes Paul Greenberg, anoted editorialist in nearby Pine Bluff. And, as Mr.Hussman's detractors like to mention, he used $7 million inpublicly sponsored revenue bonds to upgrade his Little Rockfacilities. It was good for the economy, he says, andbesides, no bank would lend to him while he was losing money.   Some say Mr. Hussman dropped $100 million to save theDemocrat. He'll only say he lost &quot;much less&quot; than theGazette. On paper, Gannett's minus, even after last month'ssale, would appear to exceed $110 million. That level of redink and other peculiarities suggest readers elsewherecouldn't expect to reap the bonus Little Rock did. ButAnchorage, Alaska, is another small market witnessing aspirited fight between dailies -- in that case, with anenvironmental-liberal insurgent.   Even if papers don't go head-to-head much anymore, Mr.Hussman says his strategy of carving out market share as the&quot;low-cost producer&quot; applies to other industries. TheDemocrat, he boasts, also &quot;put the best product on theporch.&quot; Its thud has largely gone unheard.</TEXT></DOC>
