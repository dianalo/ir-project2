<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0083 </DOCNO><TEXT>History shows that reactor emergencies in the United States are rare andhave very limited consequences, both in the numbers of persons injuredand the magnitude of injuries. The engineering and regulation of nuclearreactors make it extremely unlikely that persons off-site would be significantlycontaminated in the event of malfunction. Utilities have systems in placeto care for personnel who are injured and/or exposed. Evacuation planningfor nuclear facilities appears to be better than for other communityemergencies (eg, earthquakes, hurricanes). In the unlikely event of massivenumbers of off-site injuries such as occurred at Chernobyl, a backupsystem of personnel and equipment is available through federal resources.</TEXT></DOC>
