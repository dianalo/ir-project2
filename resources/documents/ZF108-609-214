GOfer, $79.95, is a 'pop-up' program that stays in thecomputer.andP;  Magellan, $195, can look for near misses.andP;  Routinelysearching through large volumes of information needs a programdedicated to that task.andP;  These programs of information managementand retrieval are also called textbases.andP;  One textbase is askSamfrom askSam Systems.andP;  It can create hypertext links and costs$295.andP;  ZyIndex from ZyLAB is extremely fast and comes in threelevels for DOS: Personal, $95, to search up to 500 files;Professional, $295, to search up to 5,000 files; and Plus, $695,to search up to 15,000 files.andP;  A Unix version costs $695 for asingle-user and $2,495 for up to four concurrent users.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Microlytics Inc.
