In Arkansas, Mr. Clinton is known as &quot;Billion DollarBill,&quot; an appellation both accurate and well-deserved. He is,quite simply, a tax-and-spend liberal of the George McGovernschool. In contrast to his present cry for tax relief for themiddle class, Mr. Clinton has, during his numerous terms asgovernor, tirelessly and successfully pushed through multipletax increases that have hit hard the very people he nowclaims to want to help. Why did he not begin tax relief forthe middle class in the state that he has governed for solong?</LP><TEXT>   His record as the &quot;Education Governor&quot; is also not quiteso praiseworthy. While it is true he has the backing of theNEA, it is not because of the academic accomplishments ofArkansas school-children, but because of his pandering to theeducation lobby's urging to raise taxes to increase teachersalaries. While purchasing the support of thisspecial-interest group with tax dollars, standards have beenlowered, not raised, and many of those students responsiblefor the increased college enrollments must take remedialcourses to teach them such advanced subjects as reading andwriting.   Mr. Clinton has more than &quot;roots on the left,&quot; as Mr.Ferguson states. He is a hardcore, dyed-in-the-wool, bedrockliberal of the worst stripe: a big-government socialistpassing himself off as a moderate.   Finally, he is a blatant liar. During his lastgubernatorial race, he pledged repeatedly not to run for anyother office until he had completed his term. Now he hasrepudiated the duties of the governor's office whilecontinuing to draw his salary, traveling and campaigning attaxpayer expense with his entourage of aides, most of whomare on the state payroll.   David Lay, M.D.   Heber Springs, Ark.   ---   Mr. Ferguson warns the business community to beware ofGov. Clinton because although he sounds good for business,he's a Democrat. So, in other words, no matter what aDemocratic candidate says, the business community shouldsimply vote Republican because . . . because, well becauseRepublicans are automatically good for business, that's all.   I guess that Republican leaders such as President Bush canbe trusted to uphold their campaign pledges. I guess thatRepublican leaders such as President Bush have made sure theeconomy grows, jobs are plentiful and business is good.   Please, Mr. Ferguson, give us businessmen a little creditfor being able to think for ourselves.   Phil Angelides   Chairman   California Democratic Party   Sacramento, Calif.   ---   I don't know where Mr. Ferguson got the idea that J.William Fulbright was Gov. Clinton's hero. As a formerpolitical reporter in Arkansas, I happen to know that thegovernor's hero was that wild-eyed radical Winston Churchill.   Jeff Waggoner   Nassau, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
