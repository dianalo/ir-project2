The adjustment modifies the southern boundaryof this subarea (currently at Klipsan Beach) to Leadbetter Point, Washington,during July 3-10, 1988. The Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (RegionalDirector), has determined, in consultation with representatives of thePacific Fishery Management Council, the Washington Department of Fisheries(WDF), and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), that theadjustment is necessary to prevent a shift in fishing effort into thissubarea and to prolong the recreational fishery.

Robinson at 206-526-6140.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Regulations governing the ocean salmonfisheries are codified at 50 CFR Part 661. Management measures for 1988were effective on May 1, 1988 (53 FR 16002, May 4, 1988). The 1988 recreationalfishery for all salmon species north of Cape Falcon, Oregon, is dividedinto three subareas. From the U.S.-Canada border to the Queets River, Washington(northern subarea) and from the Queets River to Klipsan Beach, Washington(central subarea), the season will open on July 3. From Klipsan Beach toCape Falcon, Oregon (southern subarea), the season will open on July 11.The seasons in all three subareas will continue through the earliest ofSeptember 5, attainment of subarea coho quotas, or attainment of an overallquota of 29,800 chinook salmon for the area between the U.S.-Canada borderto Cape Falcon, Oregon.A shift in fishing effort of vessels that normally operate in the southernsubarea into the central subarea is anticipated during July 3-10, the periodwhen the central subarea is open and the southern subarea is still closed.According to the best available information, this increase in fishing effortcould likely result in earlier closure of the recreational fishery northof Cape Falcon due to a more rapid attainment of the overall chinook quota,with a large portion of the quota of 50,000 coho salmon for the centralsubarea remaining unharvested. By moving the southern boundary of the centralsubarea, which is currently at Klipsan Beach, northward to Leadbetter Point,Washington, the shift in fishing effort should be prevented. This boundarymodification is intended to prolong the recreational fishery and to maximizethe available harvest of chinook and coho salmon in the central subareaas established in the preseason announcement of the 1988 management measures.Therefore, NOAA issues this notice to adjust the recreational salmon fisheryin the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from the Queets River to Klipsan Beach,Washington, by modifying the southern boundary of this subarea (currentlyat Klipsan Beach) to Leadbetter Point, Washington (46anddegrees;38andmin16;10andmin16;andmin16;North latitude) from 0001 hours local time July 3, 1988 through 2400 hourslocal time July 10, 1988. The closure from 6 to 200 nautical miles of shoreremains in effect (53 FR 16002). Beginning at 0001 hours on July 11, 1988,the southern boundary of the central subarea will again be at Klipsan Beach(46anddegrees;28andmin16;12andmin16;andmin16; North latitude).This notice must be issued as soon as possible to provide immediate notificationto fishermen and charter boat operators and to prevent scheduling difficultiesor inopportune charter trip bookings. The Secretary has determined, therefore,that good cause exists to issue this notice immediately without affordinga prior opportunity for public comment. Therefore, this notice is effectiveon the date of filing for public inspection with the Office of the FederalRegister. Public comments on this notice will be received at the aboveaddress for a period of 15 days after the effective date. Federal regulations at andSection; 661.21(b)(1)(v) authorize the modificationof management boundaries if certain findings are made as described in theappendix to 50 CFR Part 661, Section III.B. Accordingly, the Regional Directorhas determined this inseason adjustment is consistent with fishery regimesestablished by the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, ocean escapementgoals, conservation of the salmon resource, any adjudicated Indian fishingrights, and the ocean allocation scheme in the ocean salmon fishery managementplan as revised by the emergency rule implementing the 1988 managementmeasures. This inseason adjustment is based on consideration of the predictedsizes of salmon runs, harvest quotas, and hooking mortality limits forthe area and total allowable impact limitations, and predicted fishingeffort for the area to the end of the scheduled season. This notice does not apply to treaty Indian fisheries or to other fisherieswhich may be operating in other areas. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, WDF, and ODFW regarding an adjustment of the recreationalfishery between the Queets River and Klipsan Beach, Washington. The representativeof WDF confirmed that Washington will manage the recreational fishery instate waters adjacent to this subarea of the EEZ in accordance with thisfederal action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>This action is authorized by andSection; 661.23 and is in compliance withExecutive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ann D.
