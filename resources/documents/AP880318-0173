Under the change in the program _ which has attracted alower-than-anticipated number of applications _ amnesty seekerswill be able to file a skeletal application from April 4 to the May4 deadline without producing back-up documentation and medical datauntil sometime after July 5.   The Reagan administration has said it opposes extending thefiling deadline, despite sentiment in Congress to do so.   ``If any of you have ever filed your income tax on the night ofthe 14th of April, there's usually one document or one fact youdon't get,'' Attorney General Edwin Meese III told reporters at animmigration office in Arlington, Va. ``We want to be sure thatdoesn't stop anybody from this program.''   Just over 1 million amnesty applications have been filed, andalthough a last-minute surge is anticipated, the volume of requestsis likely to fall far below the 2 million estimated as recently asJanuary by Alan Nelson, commission of the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service.   ``Our goal is not two million,'' Meese said. ``Our goal is forevery eligible person to apply.'' If an eligible alien doesn'tapply by May 4, ``that's the person's fault, not ours,'' he added.   Legislation with 60 co-sponsors would extend the filing deadlinefor another year, but Meese opposed the idea of extending it.   ``There's no reason to,'' he said. ``The more confusion andhesitancy ... in the program, the more the temptation is out therethen to postpone and postpone and postpone.''   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced the extensionlegislation, called the change ``virtually meaningless.''   The administration's approach assumes many illegal alienshaven't filed because they lack documentation. But ``many illegalaliens have not stepped forward, because they still fear the INS,''Schumer said. ``To them the INS is the agency that is supposed tothrow them out of the country.''   Meese said that if an extension were granted, at the end of thattime ``people would say they extended it before, they'll probablyextend it again.''   ``It is our hope that on May 4 every single person who iseligible for legalization will have applied,'' the attorney generalsaid.   The application can be completed in less than 30 minutes, Nelsonsaid.   Since the amnesty program began last May 4, INS personnel have``gone the extra mile in all respects and it seems sad at the endnot to deal with it in a little more flexible way,'' said JerryTinker, staff director of the Senate subcommittee on immigrationand refugee policy.   Short of legislation, there were a number of administrativesteps INS could have taken, including deferring the payment of fees_ $420 for families _ to encourage people to apply for amnesty.   Tinker said there were extensive discussions with INS officialsover various administrative moves and ``for them to come forth withthis mouse was disappointing.''   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegalaliens who have lived in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, canbe granted amnesty if they provide documentation supporting theirclaim of having lived here for the past six years.   Meese and Nelson also announced another change in the programthat would give private groups more time to locate aliens eligiblefor amnesty.   In the past, these private groups assisting the immigrationservice collected fees only after they had completed filling outforms for an applicant, a process that can take three hours orlonger.   Under the change, the groups will be given a referral fee foreach applicant as soon as they have directed an alien to an INSlegalization office.</TEXT></DOC>
