Stung by a federal appeals court ruling that has broad implications, the exchanges were forced to disallow any new trading in the products. Investors have at least until Sept. 8 to liquidate their current positions.    The appeals court in Chicago ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission shouldn't have approved the products of the Philadelphia and American exchanges, as well as of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. That's because, the court said, the products by law are properly regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    Important issues are at stake for the stock and futures markets. The new products themselves -- &quot;index participations&quot; that enable an investor to trade a broad cross-section of the stock market -- haven't been blockbusters in their short three months of existence. But they have stirred plenty of controversy as to whether the products should be treated as stocks, futures or something else. This has led to a bitter turf battle between the SEC, which in March approved the products, and the CFTC, which argues that the products should come under its jurisdiction.    The Philadelphia exchange vowed it will resurrect its product if it can, possibly after appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. But traders and brokerage firm executives said, after conversations with American Stock Exchange officials, that it appears the Amex's product most likely will be discontinued. &quot;We are viewing it as 'on hold' at this point,&quot; said Kenneth Liebler, Amex president. a    The court ruling didn't have a direct impact on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The SEC approved that exchange's new basket product along with those of the other two exchanges in March. But the CBOE isn't yet trading the product and &quot;won't be until the lawsuits are resolved,&quot; said Alger &quot;Duke&quot; Chapman, CBOE chairman.    Also, the ruling shouldn't hamper the New York Stock Exchange's proposed Exchange Stock Portfolio basket product, which is awaiting SEC approval. The Chicago Board of Trade and other futures-industry officials who brought the case against the Philadelphia and American exchanges say they have no problem with the Big Board's product because it's clearly not a futures instrument. &quot;We don't anticipate {the appeals-court ruling} impacting our product,&quot; said a Big Board spokeswoman.    Investors in the Philadelphia and American exchanges' products are able to trade such broad indexes as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, taking profits or losses in cash based on the overall performance of the index while never actually owning the underlying stocks. In contrast, the Big Board's products calls for ownership of the actual Sandamp;P 500 stocks.    Nicholas Giordano, Philadelphia exchange president, has been a vocal champion of index participations, even accusing the American exchange of stealing his exchange's idea for the product. Yesterday, Mr. Giordano didn't mask his bitterness. &quot;Something is drastically wrong with the laws in this country that affect securities and commodity trading,&quot; he said. &quot;If products like this automatically default to commodities regulators, then this is an unfortunate scenario for our entire industry.&quot;    Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman and chief executive officer of Options Clearing Corp. in Chicago, which is in charge of clearing transactions in the Philadelphia and American exchange products and has been at the forefront of the legal battle to support them, called the appeals ruling &quot;outrageous.&quot;    &quot;I think all the securities markets have to be concerned about the prospects of creating any type of product that isn't a plain vanilla security,&quot; said Mr. Luthringshausen. &quot;If it smacks of being a future, that means it is CFTC-regulated,&quot; he complained.    SEC officials say they still think the new products are securities, rather than futures products. SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest said the appeals-court decision has implications for &quot;innovation and progress in America's financial markets.&quot; Other SEC officials warned privately of dire consequences if the futures industry gets a monopoly on regulating any new product with futures-like characteristics.    A spokesman for the House finance subcommittee, headed by Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), said the court decision &quot;illuminates the problems&quot; of having regulators battling over turf. &quot;The arcane system of dual regulation does not reflect the realities of the modern market,&quot; he said. Rep. Markey thinks the SEC should regulate index participations.    As the CFTC and the Chicago futures exchanges see it, they're simply trying to protect a right to run their own industry. A CFTC spokeswoman said the Philadelphia and American exchanges can simply ask her agency rather than the SEC for approval, and the CFTC would be &quot;pleased&quot; to issue a ruling.    Not surprisingly, the Board of Trade's chairman, Karsten Mahlmann, praised the appeals-court ruling as reaffirming the &quot;exclusive jurisdiction of our regulator, the CFTC,&quot; over futures-like products.    Supporters of the SEC and the stock exchanges say the issue either will be decided in the Supreme Court, or in Congress. The appeals court in Chicago, while siding with the futures industry, conceded that its interpretation of current law &quot;gives the futures markets the opportunity to block competition from an innovative financial product.&quot;    Said Michael Schwartz, a top options official at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. who has worked with the Amex on its product: &quot;The CFTC won (in the court ruling), but the public lost.&quot;    ---@ 'Basket' Products    The four major exchanges that have devised index-participation, or basket products.    New York Stock Exchange    Exchange Stock Portfolios would allow investors to buy and sell, in $5 million blocks, all the stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 index (including the 38 Sandamp;P stocks not traded on the Big Board). Awaiting SEC approval.    Philadelphia Stock Exchange    Cash Index Participations on Sandamp;P 500 stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 stocks began trading May 12.

American Stock Exchange    Equity Index Participations, similar to the Philadelphia exchange's CIPs on the Sandamp;P 500, also began trading May 12. Exchange has suspended trading, except to liquidate current positions, and isn't expected to resume.    Chicago Board Options Exchange    Value of Index Participations, or VIPs, approved by SEC in March, but never began trading. </TEXT></DOC>
