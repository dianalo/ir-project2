The proposed standard provides a comprehensive regulatory frameworkwithin which the employer can more effectively apply the existing 29 CFRPart 1910 standards to protect employees who work in such confined spaces.The proposed standard introduces the term ``permit required confined space''to cover the particular confined spaces which are to be regulated. Few OSHA standards address confined space hazards in general industry,and these provide only limited protection. OSHA has determined, based onits review of the Agency's fatality and injury data, enforcement experienceand other information, that the existing standards do not adequately protectworkers in confined spaces from atmospheric, mechanical and other hazards.The Agency has further determined that the ongoing need for monitoring,testing and communication at workplaces which contain entry permit confinedspaces can be satisfied only through the implementation of a comprehensiveconfined space entry program.

Background </ITAG>There are confined spaces in many U.S. industrial workplaces. OSHA is concernedthat many of these confined spaces, which for the purposes of this rulemakingOSHA considers to be permit required confined spaces (permit spaces), poseunique problems due to their contents and/or configuration. Some permitspaces, for example, pose entrapment hazards for entrants, while othersrestrict air circulation so that hazardous atmospheres may accumulate quickly.Confinement itself can increase the risk of injury or death by making employeeswork closer to hazards than they would otherwise. Accident investigatorsand OSHA compliance personnel have long recognized and directed employerand employee attention to the special dangers of permit space work. The hazards encountered in permit spaces, such as exposure to electricalshock and contact with chemicals and machinery, are also encountered elsewherein the workplace and are, in general, addressed by existing OSHA standards.OSHA's review of investigation reports covering confined space fatalities(Exs. 10 through 13 and 16), however, indicates that many employers donot seem to appreciate either that these hazards are exacerbated by conditionsof confined space work, or that the current OSHA standards apply to hazardswherever they are found, including confined spaces. This proposed standardwill help correct these problems by clearly stating employer responsibilitieswhen employees are to work inside confined spaces. OSHA has reviewed state safety and health regulations and has found thatmost of the states do not have standards which cover permit spaces. TheAgency has further determined that those states which have addressed permitspaces in general, have, like OSHA, neither adequately identified the potentialhazards nor required the precautions or procedures necessary to protectentrants. The state regulations reviewed also differ regarding the percentageof a substances's lower flammable limit (LFL) at which entry into a potentiallyflammable atmosphere would be barred. For example, New Jersey, Californiaand Kentucky set their limits at 14 percent, 20 percent and 24 percent,respectively. Florida, in turn, simply requires that ``* * * the atmosphereshall be tested first to determine that it is not explosive or flammable.''As noted in proposed paragraph (b), OSHA has determined, based on NFPAguidelines, that employees should be forbidden to enter a permit spacewhen the atmosphere contains 10 percent or more of the LFL for a flammablegas, vapor or mist. Therefore, OSHA has determined that federal regulatoryaction is necessary to protect employees from permit space hazards. On July 24, 1975, OSHA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPR), ``Standard for Work in Confined Spaces,'' to obtain data and informationto develop a confined spaces standard (40 FR 30980). This ANPR sought commentson 14 issues, including problems with existing regulations, confined spaceinjuries or deaths, and control of hazards.The respondents agreed that confined spaces posed significant hazards forworkers, and that the existing OSHA standards addressed the problems inadequately.The commenters generally recommended that OSHA issue a standard which specificallyaddressed confined space hazards. Some commenters suggested that OSHA issuea comprehensive standard which would regulate work in all confined spaces.Other commenters stated that confined space operations which were foundnot to pose hazards should be excluded from the scope of a confined spacestandard. Many commenters stated that OSHA should very specifically define the term``confined space,'' so that the range of conditions confronted would bedefined. Commenters suggested a wide range of definitions. Several commenters suggested that OSHA base any proposed rule on the draftAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard ``Safety Requirementsfor Working in Tanks and Other Confined Spaces,'' which was then underconsideration by the ANSI Z117.1 Committee and was subsequently adoptedas an ANSI Standard in 1977. OSHA notes that ANSI Z117.1-1977 was withdrawn in May 1988, because theZ117 Committee had not completed action to renew or revise the standardwithin the period allotted for such action. OSHA believes that the ANSIstandard provides useful guidance for the protection of employees frompermit space hazards. Therefore, the Agency has based parts of its proposedrule on ANSI Z117.1-1977. Citing both ``the complexity of the issues and the period of time sincethe previous Advance Notice,'' OSHA issued another ANPR, ``Entry and Workin Confined Spaces'' (44 FR 60334), on October 19, 1979. The 24 questionsraised in the 1979 ANPR were similar to, but more detailed than the 14issues raised in the 1975 ANPR. The 1979 ANPR again requested suggestionsfor a definition of ``confined space,'' as well as information regardingthe appropriate procedures for addressing confined space hazards, and thecost of those procedures. OSHA received 68 comments in response to the1979 ANPR. These comments were similar to those received in response tothe 1975 ANPR. However, they provided a broader base of information onwhich to support a standard for confined spaces. The comments focused on the choice between a performance-oriented and aspecification-oriented standard. Most commenters suggested that OSHA developa performance-oriented standard similar to OSHA's ``fire protection standard''(29 CFR Part 1910, Subparts E, H, and L), which was then being revisedand which was subsequently published as a final rule on September 12, 1980(45 FR 60704). Also, many commenters suggested that defining the hazardsconfronted in confined spaces was more important than defining the term``confined space.'' On March 25, 1980, OSHA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(Construction ANPR) ``Entry and Work in Confined Spaces'' (45 FR 19266),to obtain information which could be used ``to revise its existing standardsin order to effectively cover hazards connected with these (confined space)activities in construction.'' The Agency stated its belief that ``the hazardsof work in confined spaces are also significant in the construction industry.''The Construction ANPR posed 31 questions, similar to those presented inthe 1979 General Industry ANPR, regarding the appropriate precautions andprocedures for controlling confined space hazards which construction workersmay confront. The Agency received 75 comments, most of which related togeneral industry concerns. OSHA has not proceeded with rulemaking for theconstruction industry and has not included construction within the scopeof the proposed rule. The Agency has, however, asked, in Issue 6 of thisproposal, for comments and information related to the adequacy of the existingPart 1926 regulatory language. On April 4, 1980, OSHA scheduled public meetings (45 FR 22978) where interestedparties could make oral presentations regarding confined space hazards.Those meetings were held during May 1980 in Houston, Texas; Denver, Colorado;and Washington, DC. There were approximately 30 participants at these meetings.In the course of drafting this proposal, OSHA has studied the confinedspace regulations generated by states and other countries (see References2, 3, 7, 8, 17 and 18); the 1979 NIOSH criteria document (see Reference9); the ANSI Z117.1-1977 standard (see Reference 5); and the guidelinesof other organizations (see References 1, 4, 6, and 14). While the Agencyhas gained some valuable insights from the documents reviewed, OSHA believesthat a number of them are focused too narrowly on atmospheric hazards.As a result, mechanical and physical hazards have received insufficientattention. OSHA notes that NIOSH has focused a substantial effort on investigatingpermit space incidents and on developing guidelines for safe work in permitspaces. In particular, NIOSH produced a Criteria Document for confinedspace work in 1979, an ``Alert'' in 1986, a ``Guide to Safety in ConfinedSpaces'' in 1987 and a number of incident reports up through 1987. Theproposed rule is based, in part, on the materials generated by NIOSH. NIOSH, in its 1979 Criteria Document, raised a number of access and ventilationconsiderations, noted the seriousness of mechanical hazards, and accountedfor different levels of risk and the need to modify work procedures bydistinguishing three ``classes'' of confined spaces. In January 1986, NIOSH, in further recognition that confined spaces continuedto pose serious hazards, issued a ``Request for Assistance in PreventingOccupational Fatalities in Confined Spaces'' (see Reference 16), whichdescribed 16 confined space fatalities. The ``Alert'' also recommendedthat employers increase their efforts to recognize and evaluate hazards,and to take necessary precautions for work in or rescue from confined spaces.Fourteen of the 16 victims included in the NIOSH report died of asphyxiationdue to atmospheric hazards. The materials upon which OSHA has relied in drafting this Notice of ProposedRulemaking, including accident reports, existing regulatory language, responsesto the 1975 and 1979 ANPRs, transcripts of the 1980 public meetings andthe sources listed in the ``References'' section below, are available forreview and copying in the OSHA Docket Office. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Agency Action </ITAG>OSHA has determined, based on consideration of the factors discussed above,that a comprehensive, federal standard for protection of employees whowork in permit spaces is necessary. In this section of the proposal, OSHAdescribes the hazards which confront permit space workers, incidents involvingthose hazards and the chronology of OSHA's efforts to develop a proposedrule. In this way, the Agency seeks to underscore the need for comprehensiveregulation of permit spaces, and to document the significance of the risksto which employees working in permit spaces are exposed. A. <T3>Hazards</T3> OSHA has determined, based on its review of accident data, that asphyxiationis the leading cause of death in confined spaces, and that atmospherichazards cause most confined space asphyxiation fatalities. However, atmospherichazards are not the only causes of asphyxiation fatalities in confinedspaces. For example, employees working in water towers and bulk materialhoppers have slipped or fallen into narrow, tapering, discharge pipes wheredeath resulted from asphyxiation by constriction of the torso.In addition, OSHA has determined that there have been confined space injuriesand fatalities which did not involve asphyxiation. The Agency has, forexample, documented confined space incidents in which victims were burned,ground-up by auger type conveyers, or crushed by rotating or moving partsinside mixers. OSHA observes that, in those cases, the victims were unableeither to avoid the hazards, or to escape from the work area because theconfiguration of the space restricted them to the danger zone. Failureto lock out power to equipment inside the space was also a factor in thoseaccidents. OSHA has addressed some failures to lock out power to equipmentin its proposed rule The Control of Hazardous Energy Sources (Lockout/Tagout)published April 29, 1988 (53 FR 15496). OSHA proposes to use the term ``permit required confined space'' when referringto those spaces where serious hazards such as atmospheric or mechanicalhazards are or may be present. The selection of this term reflects OSHA'sdetermination that employers must implement comprehensive permit programsin order to authorize employee entry where confined spaces contain or couldcontain serious hazards. Under the permit program, employers would firstidentify their entry permit spaces; restrict access so that only authorizedpersonnel may enter; control the hazards in those spaces through engineeringor work practices; and test, monitor or inspect the entry permit spacesto ensure that the hazards remain under control. OSHA believes that compliancewith the proposed requirements will protect employees from the risk ofdeath and injury due to confined space hazards. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Incident Data and Confined Space Hazards Analysis </ITAG>The 1979 NIOSH Criteria document, ``Working in Confined Spaces'' (Reference9), cites a study by the Safety Sciences Division of WSA, Inc., San Diego,California, which was titled ``Search of Fatality and Injury Records forCases Related to Confined Spaces'' (Reference 17). The Safety Sciencesstudy reviewed approximately 20,000 reports covering industrial accidentsnationally in 1974-1977. Even with this limited sample, 276 confined spaceaccidents which resulted in 234 deaths and 193 injuries were identifiedfor the period 1974-1977. Safety Sciences conducted its study to determineif regulatory action was needed to control confined space hazards, notto identify the exact causes of death and injury. OSHA, in turn, has beenunable to connect the 234 fatalities and 193 injuries to specific industrysegments or work activities. More recently, OSHA examined its records of accident investigations forfatal confined space incidents. In particular, OSHA sought to identifythe specific hazards and work activities involved. OSHA determined duringthis review that, where multiple deaths occurred, the majority of the victimsin each event died while trying to rescue the original entrant from a confinedspace. This determination is consistent with the finding by NIOSH in its1986 ``Alert'' (Reference 16) that ``rescuers'' accounted for more than60 percent of confined space fatalities. This evidence indicates that untrainedor poorly trained rescuers constitute an especially important ``group atrisk.'' This group would be protected from permit space hazards under theterms of the proposed rule. OSHA has also gathered incident data from a number of other sources, suchas the Fatal Accidents Circumstances and Epidemiology (FACE) reports producedby NIOSH, and reports produced by the states. That information has beenvery useful to OSHA, even though in some cases there was not enough detailfor OSHA to evaluate the circumstances of the incidents. OSHA requeststhat commenters submit information on permit space incidents in order tofurther document the hazards to which employees have been exposed. The OSHA-investigated cases which OSHA analyzed to determine the causeof death in confined spaces have been compiled in four reports preparedby OSHA's Office of Statistical Studies and Analyses. These are: ``SelectedOccupational Fatalities Related to Fire and/or Explosion in Confined WorkSpaces as Found in Reports of OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations''(April 1982) (Reference 10); ``Selected Occupational Fatalities Relatedto Lockout/Tagout Problems as Found in Reports of OSHA Fatality/CatastropheInvestigations'' (August 1982) (Reference 11); ``Selected OccupationalFatalities Related to Grain Handling as Found in Reports of OSHA Fatality/CatastropheInvestigations'' (January 1983) (Reference 12); and ``Selected OccupationalFatalities Related to Toxic and Asphyxiating Atmospheres in Confined WorkSpaces As Found in Reports of OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations''(July 1985) (Reference 15). These four reports focused on fatalities because OSHA found that the reportingof injuries from permit space incidents was frequently incomplete. OSHAobserves that injuries are most likely to be reported when they occur aspart of an incident where fatalities occur. The Agency anticipates thatthis rulemaking will lead to improved data collection regarding injuriesbecause employers and employees are being clearly alerted to OSHA's concernabout permit space hazards. OSHA has analyzed the studies to determine the underlying causes of theconditions which existed when confined space related accidents occurred.From this information, OSHA developed proposed measures which would haveprevented most of the accidents in the studies, and used those measuresas the basis of its proposed standard. OSHA notes that many of the reportsdid not fully document the circumstances of the accidents covered. TheAgency has determined, however, that the available accident data, despiteits limitations, provides the necessary basis for characterizing permitspace hazards and for proposing protective measures. OSHA will continueto collect accident data in the course of this rulemaking. The Agency requeststhat commenters, especially the states and other governmental entities,submit accident data. OSHA has determined that a variety of confined space hazards have causeddeath and injury. The Agency notes that some of the incidents used as examplesin this proposal date from several years ago. In general, OSHA has documentedthose hazards with summaries which the Agency feels characterize the problemsconfronted by employees who enter permit spaces. OSHA has determined, basedon its review of information in the record and on its enforcement experience,that confined space workers confront significant risks of death, injury,or impairment of health or functional capacity.<T3>Atmospheric Hazards. </T3>OSHA's review of accident data indicatesthat most confined space deaths and injuries are caused by atmospherichazards. OSHA has classified those hazards into three categories: toxic;asphyxiating; and flammable or explosive atmospheres, in order to accountfor their differing effects. Some chemical substances present multiple atmospheric hazards, dependingon their concentration. Methane, for example, is an odorless substancethat is non-toxic and is harmless at some concentrations. Methane, however,can displace all or part of the atmosphere in a confined space. With only10 percent displacement, methane produces an atmosphere which, while adequatefor respiration, can explode violently. With 90 percent displacement, methanewill not burn or explode, but it will asphyxiate an unprotected workerin about five minutes.OSHA is concerned that employees may be exposed to atmospheric hazardsbecause the employer has not properly evaluated the work operations. Problemscould arise, for example, where an employer has not selected the necessaryatmospheric test instruments or has not ensured their proper use. Problemshave arisen because most of the instruments used to test the flammabilityof a permit space atmosphere do not identify specific gases or vapors,nor do they identify oxygen deficient atmospheres. For example, some test instruments would indicate the absence of an explosionhazard simply because the atmosphere did not contain sufficient oxygenfor combustion, but would not indicate that the oxygen deficiency alsoposed an asphyxiation risk. On the other hand, a test performed only todetermine the oxygen level might indicate that conditions are acceptablefor entry without respiratory protection, despite the presence of 10 percentmethane, an explosive level, in the atmosphere. Therefore, OSHA proposesto require that employers test and monitor their entry spaces with instrumentswhich will detect hazardous atmospheres. OSHA presents the following examplesregarding atmospheric hazards to illustrate how a relatively uncomplicatedseries of events can lead to workplace deaths and injuries. In each case,OSHA believes that death and injury would have been prevented if the proceduresand safeguards required in this proposed rule had been used. OSHA notesthat the hazards confronted could only have been controlled effectivelythrough the use of mechanical ventilation. OSHA recognizes that many confinedspace workplaces present situations which are more complex than those describedbelow. a. <T3>Fatalities in asphyxiating atmospheres. </T3>In its analysis of theseconfined space incidents, OSHA uses the term ``asphyxiating atmosphere''when referring to an atmosphere which contains less than 19.5 percent oxygenbecause that is not enough oxygen to supply an entrant's respiratory needswhen performing physical work. These atmospheres need to contain no toxicmaterials_such toxic atmospheres are discussed later. For example, theoxygen in a space may have been absorbed by materials, such as activatedcharcoal, or consumed by a chemical reaction, such as the rusting of avessel or container. In another situation, the original atmosphere mayintentionally have been wholly or partly inerted using such gases as helium,nitrogen, methane, argon, or carbon dioxide. Victims often are unawareof their predicament until they are incapable of saving themselves or evencalling for help. <T3>Example andplusmin;1. </T3>A worker in Oklahoma prepared to enter a molassestank. The atmosphere had not been tested and no respirators, retrievallines or harnesses were provided. Following a longstanding practice atthe company involved, employees removed the tank lid and allowed the tankto ``ventilate naturally'' for several hours before entering. No testingof the tank's atmosphere was undertaken. The first entrant reported feelingill as soon as he entered, and collapsed almost immediately. Two ``standby''workers, required by the plant's ``procedure,'' entered to rescue him.Each of them collapsed after saying they felt dizzy. All three employeesdied. <T3>Example andplusmin;2. </T3>During the same year three workers died ina molasses tank at a Kansas feed mill in circumstances almost identicalto example andplusmin;1. OSHA has determined that these fatalities occurredbecause the oxygen level in each tank was too low to support life. <T3>Example andplusmin;3. </T3>In Oklahoma, a three-man work crew ruptureda water line while boring through a street to prepare the way for extendedwater service. The workers were instructed to close off three valves inorder to cut off water flow to the damaged pipe. The workmen had no personalprotective equipment or training for confined space entry. They were awareof a company policy which required atmospheric testing before entry, butthey decided that shutting off the water was more important. They had notrouble with the first valve pit. However, the employee who entered thesecond pit, which had not been opened in three years, soon called for help.The crew leader entered the pit to assist the initial entrant but was overcome.The third crewman realized that entering the pit was unsafe and went forhelp. Firemen equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus were onthe scene within a few minutes. They entered the second valve pit, dischargedoxygen from cylinders to increase the oxygen level and retrieved the victims.Both victims died shortly afterward, asphyxiated due to oxygen deprivation.The accident report noted that the oxygen level at a valve pit two milesdownstream from the scene of the accident was only three percent. The entry permit program (andSection; 1910.146(c)) required by the proposedstandard is a systems approach which would have prevented all eight ofthe deaths in these three examples. The proposal requires, prior to actual entry, that the person authorizingor in charge of entry determine that the atmosphere in the space is safe.This would include determining that the atmosphere is not oxygen deficient(andSection; 1910.146(g)(1)). Such determinations prior to entry would have shown that the ``naturalventilation'' had not made the tank safe for entry, and the person in chargewould not have allowed entry (andSection; 1910.146 (c)(2) and (g)(1)(ii))until the atmosphere was made safe. Had there been the need for a rescue at a later time, the rescuers wouldhave been notified in advance of the hazards and been available to performrescue (andSection; 1910.146(h)). The attendants themselves would have beentrained not to enter the tank to perform rescue (andSection; 1910.146(f)(3)).The entrants would have been ordered to evacuate as soon as they complainedabout feeling ``dizzy'' (andSection; 1910.146(f)(2)(ii)) and exit would likelyhave been completed before anyone even lost consciousness.b. <T3>Fatalities in toxic atmospheres. </T3>The term ``toxic atmospheres''refers to atmospheres containing gases, vapors or fumes known to have poisonousphysiological effects. The toxic effect is independent of the oxygen concentration,which may in fact be greater than 20 percent. The most commonly encounteredtoxic gases are carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide. Some toxic atmospheres may have severe harmful effects which may not manifestuntil years after exposure, while others may kill quickly. Some can produceboth immediate and delayed effects. For example, while carbon disulfideat low concentrations may exhibit no immediate sign of exposure, it cancause permanent and cumulative brain damage as a result of repeated ``harmless''exposures. At higher concentrations, it can kill quickly. <T3>Example andplusmin;1. </T3>A foreman and a worker entered an unventilatedsewer in Arizona to refuel a gasoline-powered pump. The sewer atmospherewas not tested, and the employer provided no procedures or equipment forrescue. The worker was overcome by carbon monoxide and died. The foremanmanaged to escape from the sewer and call the fire department for help.A ``passerby'' tried to rescue the worker, and was also fatally overcome.Thirty firefighters and eight co-workers were treated for carbon monoxidepoisoning resulting from this single incident.<T3>Example </T3>andplusmin;<T3>2. </T3>An employee (also in Arizona) entered a solvent storage tankto remove toluene residues. The tank was 20 feet tall and 10 feet in diameter.The employer had rented a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) forthis entry and showed the employee how to use it, but again the tank atmospherehad not been tested, nor had any provisions for rescue been made. The employeewas provided with a length of rope for his descent into the tank. The employeecould not fit through the tank's opening while wearing the SCBA, so theemployer decided that the SCBA would be lowered to him, using the samerope, after the employee reached the bottom of the tank. After entry, theemployer lowered the SCBA, but the worker collapsed before he could putit on. A call for help was sent to the city fire department. Because of the small opening, the firemen who responded to the rescue callcould also not enter the tank while wearing SCBA. They decided that onlyby cutting open the tank could they possibly rescue the victim. Despitethe precautions taken by the firemen during the cutting of the tank, thetoluene vapor in the tank ignited. The explosion killed one fireman andinjured 16 others. It was later determined that the entrant was alreadydead due to the toxic effects of toluene and lack of oxygen before theexplosion occurred. Both of these incidents occurred because the hazard was not fully appreciatedby entrants and would-be rescuers, and proper procedures were not followed.The permit program (andSection; 1910.146(c)) and the permit system (andSection;1910.146(d)) would have prevented the deaths and injuries cited in thesetwo examples. In the first example, if the worker's employer had made appropriate rescueprovisions (andSection; 1910.146(c)(8)), the worker could have been rescuedby the foreman. The worker's injuries would most likely have been limitedto abrasions from being dragged through the sewer line. Again, hazard controland verification of safe conditions as required by this standard (andSection;1910.146 (c)(2) and (g)(1)(ii)) would have prevented the unsafe entry inthe first place. In the second example, the standard would require the employer to identifyall of the serious hazards prior to entry (andSection; 1910.146(c)(1)) andtrain his employees in proper entry procedures (andSection; 1910.146(e)).By so doing, the unsafe entry would not have been authorized (andSection;1910.146(g)(1)). Also, if appropriate rescue provisions had been made (andSection;1910.146(c)(8)), the worker could have been rescued without help by thefire department. c. <T3>Fatalities due to flammable or explosive atmospheres. </T3>OSHA definesthe term ``flammable or explosive atmosphere'' as an atmosphere which posesa hazard because flammable gases, vapors or dusts are present at a concentrationgreater than 10 percent of their lower flammable limit. This last subcategoryof hazardous atmospheres includes atmospheres containing gases such asmethane or acetylene; vapors of solvents or fuels such as carbon disulfide,gasoline, kerosine or toluene; or dusts of combustible materials.<T3>Example andplusmin;1.</T3> Workers at a refinery in Puerto Rico werecleaning a large storage tank. Since it had last been cleaned, the tankhad been used at various times to store gasoline, gas oil, and light andheavy crude oils. The employer expected that the tank would contain residuesfrom these liquids. The procedures, tools, and all other equipment to be used for entry wereprescribed by an entry permit prepared by the parent company, not by therefinery. Under the terms of the entry permit, workers were required touse air-supplying respirators, lifelines, explosion-proof lighting, andwere also required to test the atmosphere for flammable conditions beforeand during entry. However, no one at the refinery had been made accountablefor compliance with the permit. Employee accounts indicate that the refinery management had originallyfollowed permit procedures, but that permit requirements were generallyignored the day of the incident. For example, even though it was knownthat the work could generate a flammable atmosphere and that only explosion-prooflighting was allowed where a flammable atmosphere could exist, only twoof the twelve lamps illuminating the inside of the tank were explosion-proof;no lifelines were available; and no atmospheric monitoring was done. Five employees were in the tank when it exploded and burned briefly. Theworkers outside the tank were unable to help them. The fire burned outin just seconds, but by then four of the workers were dead. The fifth entrantdied of massive respiratory injuries several days later. Compliance with the proposed standard would have prevented this incident.The hazard was not controlled (andSection; 1910.146(c)(2)). Prescribed equipmentwas not used, inappropriate equipment was used and proper entry procedureswere not followed (andSection; 1910.146(g)(1)(ii)). Atmospheric testing andmonitoring were not performed (andSection; 1910.146 (g)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)(iii)).There was no clear chain of command or responsibility (andSection; 1910.146(c), (d) and (g)(1)). The refinery personnel were not adequately trained(andSection; 1910.146(c)(6)) and supervised in the appropriate entry procedures(andSection; 1910.146(g)). <T3>Fatalities from engulfment.</T3> ``Engulfment'' refers to situationswhere a confined space entrant is trapped or enveloped, usually by drybulk materials. The engulfed entrant is in danger of asphyxiation, eitherthrough filling of the victim's respiratory system as the engulfing materialis inhaled, or through compression of the torso by the engulfing material.In some cases, the engulfing materials may be so hot or corrosive thatthe victims sustain fatal chemical or thermal burns, but are never buriedbelow a point at which they can breathe. <T3>Example andplusmin;1.</T3> A group of employees of a Nebraska sawmillentered a 40 foot high storage tank, thought to be nearly full of sawdust.Entry was made through a small opening near the top. One of these workerssuddenly disappeared. He had fallen into an air pocket in the sawdust.Rescue operations began immediately, but the worker died of asphyxiationby the time his body was recovered. Two years earlier, this same employee had narrowly escaped death in a similarincident only because his foreman had seen him sinking into the sawdustand managed to grab his hand and pull him out. OSHA's report on the fatal incident quotes the sawmill's report of itsown investigation of the earlier, non-fatal incident, which concluded thatthe company ``decided for bin workers to use a safety rope * * *.'' Theonly ``rope'' on hand at the time of the fatal incident was a cord formedby knotted-together pieces of rotted sash cord. The employees did not usethis rope because they recognized that it was useless and also, in thewords of the employees, ``because it was too much trouble.'' <T3>Example andplusmin;2.</T3> A truck driver was draining sawdust from a22-foot high bin in Pennsylvania when he noticed that the flow had prematurelyslowed to a trickle, indicating that the sawdust had probably stuck tothe walls of the bin. Following the usual practice, he took a pipe, climbedto the top of the bin and climbed inside to knock the sawdust loose. Theowner of the bin and the entrant had previously discussed the hazards involvedin entering the bin. While no formal procedures had been set, the ownerhad provided a safety line for use when entering the bin. The entrant didnot use the safety line on this occasion. As he was banging the walls,the sawdust beneath him gave way and he was engulfed in sawdust. Abouttwo hours later, the owner noticed that the man was missing and checkedthe bin. The victim's body was discovered and removed. It was determinedthat the entrant had died of asphyxiation. In the first example the employer did not appreciate how severe the hazardwas. As a result his employees did not know there was a serious hazard,what the hazard was, nor how to protect themselves from it. Compliancewith the proposed standard would have prevented this incident because theemployer would have ensured that the proper procedures and equipment wereused (andSection; 1910.146(c)) before allowing entry (andSection; 1910.146(g)(1)).In the second example, if the employer had followed the entry permit programand the permit system required by the proposed standard (andSection; 1910.146(c)and (d)), the need to dislodge the bridged sawdust from outside the tank,and the need to make appropriate provision for rescue would have been recognized.<T3>Fatalities due to mechanical hazards.</T3> OSHA has determined thataccidents have resulted in confined spaces when employers failed to isolateequipment from sources of mechanical or electrical energy. In each casereviewed, death resulted from mechanical force injury, such as the crushingof the victim. OSHA has determined from its review of accidents involvingmechanical hazards that the correct preventive action is to secure themachinery or equipment so that it will not be inadvertently activated whileemployees are in the confined space. This procedure is commonly called``lockout.'' <T3>Example.</T3> A workman entered the bag house in the dust collectionsystem of an Ohio basic-oxygen steelmaking furnace to check the conditionof the bags. He stepped onto the dust conveyer, which was not supposedto be operating at the time, and was caught in the machinery. The employeedied before rescuers could remove him from the auger pipe conveyer. As required by the standard, the hazards would have been identified (andSection;1910.146(c)(1)) and entry could not have been authorized (andSection;andSection;1910.146 (d) and (g)(1)) until both the conveyor had been locked out, andthe environmental conditions were acceptable for entry. <T3>Fatalities among untrained rescuers.</T3> As noted above, OSHA hasdetermined that a high percentage of confined space accident victims havebeen untrained rescuers. Indeed, in some cases the unsuccessful rescuersdie, while the initial entrant recovers. The likelihood that good intentionsand poor preparation will lead to tragedy has led the Agency to establishcriteria for rescue which would protect co-workers or volunteers from accidentalinjury or death. The following summaries illustrate how would-be rescuershave created problems for themselves and for the initial victims they soughtto rescue.<T3>Example </T3>andplusmin;<T3>1. </T3>A Connecticut fuel company owner sent an employee into a largeunderground vault. The vault's only means of access and ventilation wasstraight down through six feet of 30-inch steel culvert pipe. The employerreportedly told police that ``he heard a clunk'' soon after his employeedescended into the vault. Concerned because he had lost contact with thisemployee, he sent in a second employee. This rescuer collapsed at the footof the ladder. The employer then directed a third employee to go in andhelp the others. The second rescuer collapsed before he got to the bottomof the ladder, with one leg caught between two ladder rungs. This hungthe employee upside-down, interfering with rescue efforts by the firemenwho were summoned to the scene. Both ``rescuers'' were pronounced dead at the scene. The initial entrantdied two days later from massive brain damage caused by prolonged oxygendeprivation. OSHA subsequently learned from police department records that about sixyears earlier, two employees were overcome by lack of oxygen in a similarvault operated by the same employer. In that case, the entrants were rescuedwithout loss of life. Unfortunately, the employer had not taken advantageof the close call warning by implementing procedures which would have preventedsubsequent incidents. Because the proposed standard embodies a systems safety approach, trainedrescuers would have been available and would have been equipped with properrespiratory protection (andSection;andSection; 1910.146 (c)(8), (d)(2)(Vi)and (h)(1)). In addition, the proposed standard requires verification thatthe vault atmosphere is safe prior to entry (andSection; 1910.146(g)(1)(ii)).<T3>Example </T3>andplusmin;<T3>2.</T3> An employee of a septic tank cleaning company in Georgia entereda waste tank at a chicken hatchery to remove sludge. Three other employeeswere on hand during the job. None of the four had training or equipmentfor dealing with confined space hazards. There was no atmospheric testingof the space. The septic tank clean-out procedure had been used for fiveyears without mishap, so it is unlikely that the employees expected toface an uncontrolled hazard. Unfortunately, unknown to the contractor,the chicken hatchery had just changed its chlorine compounds used for cleaningthe hatchery, creating a hazard from exposure to chlorine gas. The firstentrant was overcome by toxic gases almost as soon as he entered the tank.Two of his co-workers tried to rescue him, but were themselves overcome.The fourth worker ran for help, then returned to the tank and attemptedrescue. He, too, was overcome. Firemen wearing protective gear and self-containedbreathing apparatus retrieved the victims. The initial entrant and thefirst two would-be rescuers died from chlorine exposure. The fourth employeesustained permanent severe brain damage. The firm that hired the septic tank cleaning company had a written confinedspace entry program which specified atmospheric testing, ventilation, specialequipment and training for any of its own employees who would enter thesespaces. Included in the firm's program was a total ban on confined spaceentry by its own employees. The septic tank cleaning firm had no program. The proposed standard couldhave prevented this incident by requiring the employer to inform the contractorof the confined space hazards (andSection; 1910.146(c)(10)). In addition,the proposed standard makes it clear that the contractor, like any otheremployer whose employees may be exposed to confined space hazards, mustimplement a confined space entry program (andSection; 1910.146(c)). B. Need for Proposed Standard Based on its investigations and studies of confined space incidents, itsreview of the published literature, and its accumulated knowledge of confinedspace hazards, OSHA has determined that employees who are required to workin confined spaces face a significant risk of injury or death. The Agency believes that many employers have not adequately protected theiremployees from confined space hazards, despite warnings and accidents theymay have experienced, and that employee protection will not improve sufficientlyin the absence of comprehensive OSHA regulation. As discussed in SectionVI of the Preamble, below, there is a sizable worker population exposedto permit space hazards, and a significant annual injury and death toll.Therefore, OSHA has decided to initiate rulemaking by issuing this proposedstandard, which includes provisions for procedures, training and safeguardsto minimize the potential for confined space injuries and deaths. The Agencyinvites comments and information regarding confined space hazards, injuriesand accidents. OSHA believes that only through the implementation of comprehensive entrypermit programs will employees receive the necessary protection from permitspace hazards. The Agency anticipates that compliance with the proposedstandard will compel employers to think through and implement entry precautionsand procedures which ensure that any entry to a permit space can be performedsafely. Furthermore, OSHA believes that the implementation of an entrypermit program which includes written procedures will enable employersand employees to review their entry procedures critically so that unsafepractices can be recognized and corrected before an incident occurs. Also,if an incident does occur, the permit and written procedures will providemanagement with appropriate tools for rescuing entrants and for determiningboth what caused the incident, and how to prevent a recurrence. On August 1, 1983, OSHA began distributing a first draft of this proposedstandard to all the parties who had submitted comments in response to eitherof the ANPR's or who had testified at the public meetings, as well as tothe OSHA Regional Offices, the State Plan States, and parties who requesteda copy of the 1983 draft. The 1983 draft was extensively revised basedon comments from the more than 120 reviewers and, on February 1, 1984,OSHA began distributing a second draft to interested parties, requestingcomments and suggestions. These responses were also considered in the preparationof this proposed standard. In summary, OSHA has obtained a wide range of inputs from interested partiesfor developing this proposal and its appendices. OSHA believes that employeeswho work in entry permit confined spaces face significant risks from safetyand health hazards, and that this proposal is required to better controlor eliminate these hazards. OSHA believes strongly that compliance withthese proposed requirements would greatly reduce the number of deaths orinjuries in permit required confined spaces. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Issues </ITAG>In drafting this standard, OSHA has identified several areas of concernwhich are not presently addressed in this proposed standard, but whichmerit additional consideration. In addition, there are several subjectscovered by the standard for which OSHA requests more information to developa more complete rulemaking record. Therefore, OSHA has developed the followingissues for which it requests comments. Please support your comments with information identifying industries, spaces,and the nature of the work requiring entry into these spaces and any availableaccident data. 1. In this proposed rule, OSHA has established training requirements forentrants, attendants, and also for those persons to whom the employer woulddelegate authority to be in charge of an entry or to authorize entry(ies).OSHA has not specified or suggested the experience or training necessaryfor the individual who would initially evaluate spaces, identify theirhazards, and formulate the requirements (including means of isolation tobe used, acceptable environmental conditions, types of environmental testingand frequency of testing) and the procedures that must be used for safeentry into those spaces identified as permit spaces. Likewise, OSHA hasnot specified what experience or training would be necessary to qualifya person to perform pre-entry testing and verification of permit conditionsthat would allow entry to commence. Should OSHA set experience, proficiency, or other criteria to qualify individualswho are expected to initially evaluate spaces and develop appropriate entryprocedures? If so, what should these criteria be? Should persons with thetraining and experience equivalent of a certified safety professional,a registered professional safety engineer, an industrial hygienist, ora marine chemist qualify? What should small employers do that do not havesuch professionals? Should OSHA specify experience and training requirementsfor persons who perform the pre-entry tests and monitor conditions duringentry? If so, what would persons performing these tests need to know andunderstand? Is it essential that they know field calibration procedures,and should they be trained to interpret the results of the testing?2. OSHA based the proposed standard on its analysis of hundreds of confinedspace fatality incidents. Most of these are in the public record. The proposedrule takes a performance oriented ``systems'' approach, and for this reasoncontains redundancies to protect confined space workers. Based on the redundancies of the ``systems'' approach, OSHA estimates theproposal to be 80 percent to 90 percent effective in reducing fatalities,assuming compliance with these requirements. Is the assumption of 80 percentto 90 percent effectiveness valid? Should it be higher or lower? If so,why should the estimated level of effectiveness be changed? Does the proposalcontain enough safeguards for permit space entrants, or are there redundancieswhich should be eliminated? If so, which requirements are considered redundantand why? Please support your comments with injury information or otherrelevant documentation. 3. OSHA has proposed a definition for ``permit required confined space''(permit space) (andSection; 1910.146(b)(10)) in order to state clearly thecriteria by which employers must evaluate their workplaces to determineif they contain permit spaces. Is the definition clear? Are there circumstanceswhere the application of the proposed definition would either include workareas that should be excluded, or exclude work areas that should be includedwithin the scope of this proposal? OSHA requests input on the adequacyof the proposed definition, including suggestions, accompanied by supportinginformation, for additional or alternative definitional language. (Pleasealso see issue 17.) 4. OSHA is aware from sources such as its Fatality and Catastrophe Reportsthat a significant number of deaths and injuries occur in spaces whichthe Agency proposes to regulate as permit required confined spaces. ``Minorinjuries,'' often called ``near misses'' in the confined space context,are usually not reported or otherwise available to OSHA. (These ``events''generally involve entrants recognizing their unsafe situation while theyare still capable of unassisted escape, or can escape with help from others.Often they recover without hospitalization or seeking medical attention.)In order to assist the Agency in estimating the benefits of implementingthis proposal, OSHA requests that information and available documentationon all confined space incidents be submitted, including those incidentswith non-fatal and noncatastrophic consequences. Please identify the spaceinvolved and the industry or type of workplace in which it is located.5. OSHA proposes (andSection; 1910.146(d)(3)), to require that, unless theperson who authorizes the entry assumes direct charge of the entry forits duration, employers prepare a permit which specifies the place, time,purpose, personnel assigned for the entry and ensure that the signature,together with the legibly marked name, of the authorizing person is placedon the permit. Is it appropriate for employers to supervise entry operations in lieu ofputting this additional information on a permit? Would the combinationof a permit which satisfies proposed paragraph (d)(2) and the employersdirect supervision provide adequate employee protection? How useful wouldit be to allow such an approach? To what extent would allowing an employerto supervise entry instead of issuing a more complete permit be cost-effective?OSHA requests that commenters submit information on any projected costsavings, any workplace experience which would indicate the extent to whichthe proposed provision would be appropriate, and examples of proceduresand permits which have been used. 6. OSHA proposes (andSection; 1910.146(f)) certain duties for an individualwho would serve as an attendant outside a permit required confined space.Should OSHA add a requirement that such individuals perform no other workwhen they are working as attendants? Should activities directly relatedto the entry, such as passing tools or other materials to entrants be allowedto be performed by attendants? How much attention, if any, should an attendantbe permitted to spare for other activities? In its cost analysis, OSHAhas assumed employers would use less experienced (and thus lower paid)workers as attendants. Is this realistic? Please support your commentswith information on experiences of attendants who have or have not beenassigned other duties. 7. The proposed standard emphasizes that both equipment and proceduresare necessary to protect employees from atmospheric hazards. What additionalprovisions or revisions would be appropriate to protect employees fromhazards such as nipping or crushing? Please submit information on equipmentand procedures used to control physical and mechanical hazards.8. OSHA has proposed to exclude the agriculture, construction and maritimeindustries from the scope of this rulemaking, based on the determinationthat ``permit space'' entrants in those industries are protected by existingregulatory language. Do these regulations provide adequate protection?Please submit information on injury and fatality data and workplace experiencewith the ``permit space'' standards for those industries. 9. The proposed standard uses performance-oriented language, except ina few cases where OSHA would set the permissible levels for certain substancesin the workplace atmosphere. OSHA has chosen this approach in order toprovide employers with maximum flexibility in determining how to protecttheir employees. Is this approach appropriate? Are there proposed provisionsusing performance-oriented language which should be revised to use specificationlanguage? Are there provisions using specification language where the specifiedlevels should be changed or where performance-oriented language shouldbe substituted? OSHA requests supporting information for suggestions andthat information be submitted on the impact that any such revisions wouldhave on the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed rule. 10. OSHA anticipates that the cost of employee training will contributemost of the initial cost burden for the proposed standard. The Agency expectsthat a one hour training session will be adequate for all employees whohave duties under the entry permit program. Would this amount of time beadequate to train the employees properly? What features should be addedto or removed from the proposed training requirements? Please submit informationon existing programs. 11. OSHA has determined that there are permit spaces which, while subjectto the proposed standard, either pose such a low level of risk or havehad their hazards so controlled that they could be safely entered withoutan attendant on hand under a permit which could last as long as a year(proposed paragraph (i)). To what extent should OSHA differentiate permitrequirements based on level of risk? Should OSHA limit an employer's abilityto qualify for use of a special permit once he or she has had a specialpermit revoked? What criteria should an employer use to determine if theuse of a special permit is appropriate? 12. OSHA anticipates that many employers will use retrieval lines for rescueof entrants, but also understands that employers might use other rescuemethods, particularly when retrieval lines would pose an entanglement hazard.OSHA is interested in receiving information on the various nonentry rescuemethods, particularly regarding their costs and any experience using them.13. OSHA is considering adding a non-mandatory appendix as a source ofgeneral guidance for employers in understanding and complying with theproposed standard. Are there subjects, such as classification of permitspaces, rescue procedures, and the selection, maintenance and use of personalprotective equipment, which should be added to such an appendix? Specificrecommendations for material to include in an appendix are requested. 14. In addition, the Agency would be interested to learn if there are anyindustries or employees within industries covered by this proposed standardwhich, due to their size, would lack the resources to develop their ownentry permit programs. OSHA is considering adding additional material toa nonmandatory appendix which would provide examples of specific proceduresto aid employers in complying with the proposed standard. Please submitany sample procedures which it is felt would be appropriate for considerationas guidelines in a non-mandatory appendix. 15. In this proposal (and in conjunction with current OSHA Standards) OSHAwould require employees to wear atmosphere supplying respirators when workingin atmospheres containing less than 19.5 percent oxygen when employeesmust enter spaces with reduced oxygen content. Please submit informationon: (1) The estimated number of employees who work in such atmospheres;(2) the actual oxygen content of the atmospheres in which they work; and(3) any effects this reduced oxygen content has been shown to have on unprotectedemployees (who may have entered the spaces without realizing that the spacecontained a reduced oxygen content). 16. OSHA requests information, based on actual recorded atmospheric measurements,on any physical or physiological effects caused by rapid transition frombreathing normal air (21 percent oxygen content) to breathing atmospherescontaining less than normal oxygen content (such as the transition of anyemployee inhaling air outside a permit space and then inhaling air frominside the space) particularly when vertical entry is made into a spacecontaining such an atmosphere. 17. OSHA recognizes that the hazards associated with particular permitspaces will differ in nature and degree according to the type of spacebeing entered. In this rulemaking, the Agency has proposed to allow employersthe flexibility to tailor their entry permit programs so that the particularconditions encountered are taken into account. In addition, OSHA has proposedsomewhat different requirements for the two categories of spaces (permitrequired confined spaces and permit required low-hazard permit spaces)identified by the Agency. Are there permit space areas or operations, whichhave unique worker protection needs not addressed by the proposed standard?Are there, on the other hand, work areas which, while considered permitspaces under the definition proposed (See Issue 3) would not need to haveall of the protective measures which are required by the proposed standardin order to ensure safe entry? For example, OSHA has no accident or fatalitydata, related to confined space work, for several industries (see AverageAnnual Fatality table). Is this lack of injury data due to data collectionproblems or does it indicate that permit spaces in those  industries areinherently safer than spaces for which OSHA has accident or fatality data?Or does the data indicate that proper confined space entry procedures,such as those proposed by OSHA, are being followed in those industries?The Average Annual Fatality table shows the relative cost-effectivenessof the rule in the various SIC classifications. This table shows tremendousvariation in the ``cost per fatality prevented'' from SIC to SIC. If thisanalysis is correct, this rule, as proposed, would be much more cost-effectivein some industries than in other industries. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Average Annual Fatality Table</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Average Annual Fatalities in Permit Spaces and Annualized ComplianceCosts of the Proposed Standard, and Cost per Fatality Prevented, by Industry\1\]</ITAG><H1>Industry</H1><H1>(a) Average annual fatalities</H1><H1>(b) Annualized compliance costs</H1><H1>(c) Cost per fatality prevented ((a)/(b)) \2\</H1><H1>(d) Annual cost limit per fatality prevented \3\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Elec, Gas, Sanitary Services <D>6.8 </D><D>53,084,362 </D><D>6,978,058 </D><D>6,978,058</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wholesale Trade/Nondurable <D>1.3 </D><D>16,819,521 </D><D>11,957,629 </D><D>11,957,629</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Electric/Electronic Equipment <D>0.3 </D><D>16,241,658 </D><D>55,424,659 </D><D>16,241,658</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Food and Kindred Products <D>4.7 </D><D>14,098,949 </D><D>2,696,898 </D><D>2,696,898</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation Equipment <D>2.0 </D><D>11,064,207 </D><D>4,865,542 </D><D>4,865,542</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Agricultural Services <D>0.0 </D><D>7,488,232 </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fabricated Metal Products <D>0.7 </D><D>6,578,192 </D><D>9,051,645 </D><D>6,578,192</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Primary Metals Industry <D>2.3 </D><D>5,804,593 </D><D>2,256,056 </D><D>2,256,056</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stone, Clay, Glass andamp; Concrete <D>0.3 </D><D>5,148,490 </D><D>17,569,221 </D><D>5,148,490</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rubber Products <D>0.7 </D><D>4,646,280 </D><D>6,393,318 </D><D>4,646,280</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paper Products <D>1.9 </D><D>4,358,625 </D><D>2,094,902 </D><D>2,094,902</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Health Services <D>0.0 </D><D>4,023,918 </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Motor Freight Transportation <D>1.1 </D><D>3,598,841 </D><D>2,966,436 </D><D>2,966,436</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Machinery, Except Electrical <D>0.5 </D><D>2,058,862 </D><D>3,860,365 </D><D>2,058,862</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Petrim Ref andamp; Related Industry <D>0.7 </D><D>1,615,992 </D><D>2,088,853 </D><D>1,615,992</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Furniture and Fixtures <D>0.0 </D><D>1,509,409 </D><D> </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chemicals andamp; Allied Products <D>5.3 </D><D>1,382,040 </D><D>234,171 </D><D>234,171</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wood Products (Less Furniture) <D>0.2 </D><D>1,140,080 </D><D>5,894,734 </D><D>1,140,080</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Misc.

In other words, it suggeststhat OSHA has not adequately distinguished between low-risk confined spacesand high-risk confined spaces. Such variations in cost-effectiveness could also mean that more intensiveregulation in some SICs (where the rule is more cost-effective) and lessintensive regulation in other SICs (where the rule is less cost-effective)would increase the number of fatalities prevented and reduce the overallcost of the rule. How can the definition of ``confined space'' be improvedor the rule's provisions modified to increase the overall cost-effectivenessof the final rule?

In proposed paragraph (c)(10), OSHA requires employers who controla workplace which contains permit spaces to inform contractors who wouldhave employees enter those spaces of any existing or potential hazardsand of any measures taken to protect entrants. The Agency would like toknow if the term ``contractor'' is sufficiently inclusive to ensure thatall employers who have permit space operations in workplaces they do notcontrol benefit from the proposed paragraph. Are there employers who, whileneither contractors nor in control of the workplace, would have employeesenter permit spaces? Please describe any circumstances, arrangements andprocedures under which such employers have operated in permit spaces. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal </ITAG>OSHA proposes to add a new andSection; 1910.146 to Subpart J of 29 CFR Part1910 which addresses the hazards confronting employees who enter ``permitrequired confined spaces (permit spaces). The proposed standard providesa comprehensive regulatory framework within which employers can apply theexisting 29 CFR Part 1910 standards to protect employees who work in confinedspaces. The Agency has proposed a definition for the term ``permit requiredconfined space'' to state clearly which work spaces OSHA would considersubject to the proposed standard. Paragraph (a) sets forth the scope and application of the proposed standard.OSHA has specifically excluded the agriculture, construction and maritimeindustries from the scope of this standard. As noted above in Issue 5,while OSHA believes that those industries are appropriately covered underthe existing industry-specific regulations, the Agency is interested inpublic input on the need for additional employee protection in those areas.OSHA notes that the existing regulations for welding (andSection; 1910.251);pulp, paper and paperboard mills (andSection; 1910.261); and grain handlingfacilities (andSection; 1910.272) contain provisions which require employersto protect employees from hazards which the Agency proposes, in this rulemaking,to regulate as permit space hazards. OSHA's approach to such situationsis to have the industry-specific provisions take precedence over the proposedgeneric permit space provisions, insofar as the two cover the same subjectmatters (with the same level of detail). In a case where the generic standardprovides the only coverage for a particular subject matter, OSHA wouldapply the generic standard. OSHA believes that this approach strikes theappropriate balance between crediting efforts to develop a standard whichmeets the needs of a particular industry and ensuring that all employersprotect their employees from workplace hazards, wherever those dangersarise. In paragraph (b), OSHA is proposing a number of definitions which clearlystate the meaning, for the purposes of this standard, of certain terms.OSHA has included this paragraph in the proposal because the Agency recognizesthat some of the terms used in the proposed rule may be unfamiliar, ormay have meanings which differ from their meaning in this proposal. While most of the proposed definitions are self-explanatory, OSHA believesthat an expanded discussion would be appropriate for several of them. Forexample, OSHA has proposed a definition for the term ``entry'' in orderto indicate exactly when OSHA considers a person to have entered a permitspace. Under the proposed definition, entry has begun as soon as an entrant'sface breaks the plane of the permit space's opening and the entrant isbreathing the atmosphere of that permit space. The Agency has proposed this definition in recognition of the atmospherichazards to which an entrant could be exposed even before the employee hadcompletely entered and begun work in the permit space. Indeed, OSHA anticipatesthat, in the absence of the proposed standard, an employee could stickhis or her head inside the permit space, be overcome by an atmospherichazard and suffer death or injury due either to the direct effects of theatmospheric hazard or to falling into or near the permit space. In proposed paragraph (b)(10) OSHA introduces and defines the term ``permitrequired confined space'' (permit space). Under the proposed definition,a permit space is: (1) Difficult to enter and leave; (2) not intended foremployee occupancy except to perform repair or maintenance type tasks;and (3) presents or potentially presents serious hazards, including atmospherichazards, and serious recognized hazards to any occupants. OSHA notes that,for the purposes of proposed paragraph (b)(10)(ii), doorways and otherportals through which a person can walk are not considered to be limitedmeans for entry or exit. The Agency emphasizes that this proposed standardis directed towards work areas, such as those with hatches and narrow passageways,whose configurations exacerbate employee risk by slowing evacuations andrescues. In addition, OSHA proposes paragraph (b)(10)(iii) to make it clear thatthe work areas covered by this standard are unsuitable, by nature for continuousemployee occupancy, because those spaces were created to contain such thingsas degreasers, sawdust and sewage, not to accommodate people. Indeed, underthe proposed standard, an employer is required to ensure that a permitspace is safe for entry only at the time that the entry could occur. OSHAanticipates that few, if any, employers whose workplaces contain permitspaces could both maintain those spaces safe for entry and use the permitspaces for their intended purposes. OSHA considers the hazardous atmosphere element of the permit space definitionto be so important that the five conditions that make a ``hazardous atmosphere''are specifically enumerated in paragraph (b)(13). Two of the conditionslisted in the definition of ``hazardous atmosphere'' are discussed here.Under the proposed definition, a ``hazardous atmosphere'' may occur dueto a concentration of airborne combustible dust that obscures vision ata distance of five feet (1.52 m) or less. This proposed language is basedon eyewitness observations gathered during OSHA investigations of dustexplosions. A statement found in almost every report describes the situationpreceding the initial blast is ``* * * the dust was so thick you couldnot see your hand in front of your face.'' OSHA specified the distanceas five feet or less in order to provide employers with clear guidanceas to the point at which a combustibility hazard might be present, giventhat there are no recognized explosibility ratings for combustible dustsand there is no reliable equipment available to measure all combustibledust concentrations. The proposed language is readily understood and canbe applied with minimal training and with no equipment required. Proposed paragraph (b)(13)(iv), describes another hazardous atmospherecondition as an atmospheric concentration of any toxic, corrosive, or asphyxiantsubstance which exceeds, or could reasonably exceed, the permissible exposurelimit for that substance specified in Subpart Z of 29 CFR Part 1910. Inaddition, if the substance does not have a permissible exposure limit specifiedin Subpart Z, then OSHA recommends the use of the exposure limits set forthat substance in the ``NIOSH Recommendations for Occupational Health Standards''dated 1986, the limits set for that substance as specified by the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in their publication ``ThresholdLimit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1986-87'' dated 1986,or other references such as material safety data sheets. The term ``low hazard permit space'' means a permit space where there isan extremely low likelihood that an IDLH or engulfment hazard could bepresent, and where all other serious hazards have been controlled. OSHAproposes this definition in order to provide clear guidance for employerswho may decide that compliance with proposed paragraph (i) is an appropriatealternative to providing an attendant throughout an entry. The Agency hasproposed paragraph (i) in recognition that there may be spaces, which qualifyonly marginally as permit spaces and which have virtually no potentialto pose IDLH or engulfment hazards, where the employer could ensure safeentry without an attendant on duty. OSHA distinguishes between IDLH andengulfment hazards on the one hand, and other serious hazards, requiringthat the former be extremely unlikely, while requiring that the other hazardsbe controlled before an employer could choose to comply with paragraph(i) instead of paragraph (f). OSHA believes that permit spaces should bemost closely scrutinized to determine  if IDLH and engulfment hazards areor may be present, because those hazards can kill quickly and without notice.Once IDLH and engulfment hazards have been identified as occurring in aspace, proposed paragraph (i) would be inapplicable. OSHA recognizes thatit is impossible to completely rule out the possibility that an IDLH conditionwill arise, but requires that employers seeking to follow paragraph (i)make every reasonable effort to determine if IDLH hazards may arise inthe permit space. Other hazards, once detected, can usually be reliablycontrolled. Therefore, the employer who can virtually rule out the possibilityof IDLH or engulfment hazards and control any other serious hazards wouldbe able to follow proposed paragraph (i). OSHA solicits comments on howbest to define or explain this term. The term ``retrieval line,'' which appears in paragraph (b)(25), is definedas a line attached to a lifting device or an anchorage, with the otherend attached to a worker, which can be used to pull the worker from a permitspace. Retrieval lines often differ from lifelines in several respects.The retrieval line is used for retrieving an entrant to whom it is attachedfrom a permit space, whereas a lifeline is used for fall arrest. Becausethe retrieval line needs only to be strong enough for that purpose, itmay be handier to use, thinner, and a less expensive line than that usedfor lifelines. Unless the permit space contains the potential for a seriousfall, the retrieval line would not need to withstand the impact loadingassociated with fall arrest, nor would the elasticity of a lifeline, whichis desirable in arresting falls, be necessary. However, a lifeline maybe used as a retrieval line if desired. The primary purpose of the retrievalline, as defined, is that the line is attached to the entrant and can beused for immediate rescue without exposing anyone else to conditions thatdisabled the entrant. Using the retrieval line with a powered winch isrecommended and makes a much quicker rescue possible. Proposed paragraph (c) requires employers to ensure that any permit spacesin their workplaces are identified, and that appropriate measures are takento protect workers from permit space hazards. If an employer finds, uponcompletion of his or her initial investigation, that the workplace containsno permit spaces, the proposed standard imposes no further responsibility,except to ensure that any change in the workplace which creates potentialfor permit space hazards is detected in time for the appropriate measuresto be taken. On the other hand, if the employer determines that permit spaces are presentin the workplace, then he or she has additional responsibilities dependingupon the potential actions of his or her employees with regard to the permitspaces. If the employer determines that no one will ever enter the permitspaces, the employer could satisfy the proposed standard by permanentlyshutting off the space in question and ensuring that no one could enter.If an employer finds that the workplace contains permit spaces, but determinesthat those spaces will not be entered by his or her employees, the employercould satisfy the proposed standard by taking whatever measures are necessaryto ensure that his or her employees do not enter the spaces, such as byposting signs or by closing off the spaces; and by providing other employers,such as contractors who plan to have employees perform work in that permitspace, with the information specified in proposed paragraph (c)(10), below.Finally, where the employer determines that the workplace contains permitspaces, and that his or her employees will enter those spaces, the employerwould ensure that any work in a permit space be performed in compliancewith an appropriately protective entry permit program. The elements ofsuch a program are discussed below. In recognition of the diversity ofpermit spaces, OSHA has drafted the proposed provisions in performance-orientedlanguage so that employers can implement effective programs which are compatiblewith their operations. The Agency has arranged the provisions so they fitthe logical sequence employers would follow in implementing the program.Proposed paragraph (c)(1) requires employers to identify the potentialpermit space hazards that their employees could confront. OSHA is concernedthat employees who do not know what hazards may appear in their permitspaces will be unable to protect their employees adequately. Indeed, OSHAnotes that failure to identify potential hazards was a factor in severalof the incidents reported in the Hazards section, above. Therefore, theAgency believes that compliance with the proposed paragraph will ensurethat employers obtain the information needed to implement an effectiveentry permit program. Proposed paragraph (c)(2) requires employers to establish and implementmeans, procedures and practices for control of the identified permit spacehazards. OSHA notes, based on the incident reports, that employees do notbenefit from the identification of permit spaces and the hazards associatedwith them unless employers follow through systematically to implement hazardcontrols. OSHA believes that authorized entrants are particularly dependentupon hazard controls for their protection because the nature of permitspace work, especially the way permit space configurations exacerbate hazards,tends to rule out reliance on personal protective equipment. OSHA requestsinformation on the engineering and work practice controls which have beenused to protect employees who enter permit spaces. In implementing proposed paragraph (c)(2), the employer must ensure thatemployees are not exposed to substances whose concentrations exceed thepermissible exposure limits (PELs) listed in andSection; 1910.1000. OSHArecognizes that the ``Z Tables'' allow exposure to concentrations exceedingthe numerical value of the time weighted average (TWA) listed, providedtheir ceiling values and their short term exposure limits (STELs)    (forsubstances with a ``C'' notation in Table Z-1-A, or listed in Table Z-2)are not exceeded, and provided the duration of such exposure is short enoughthat the exposure during an eight hour period does not exceed the TWA forthat substance. For example, if a substance regulated in Subpart Z has an 8-hour TWA ofone part per million (ppm), it would be permissible for an employee tobe exposed to two ppm for up to four hours, or four ppm for two hours,etc., provided the employee has no other exposures and the ceiling andSTEL values are not exceeded. However, OSHA is concerned about the procedures that employers will useto comply with the PELs during confined space entry. Specifically, theAgency feels that, in many cases, employers should not characterize concentrationsof a substance in a confined space on the basis of a single sample, andthen calculate the duration that workers would be permitted to remain inthe space without any protection other than by controlling the durationof exposure only, so that (at least theoretically) the PEL would not beexceeded. The Agency believes, in many cases, that there are too many uncertainvariables in entering confined spaces which would make such a procedureunwise. For example, the restricted air circulation and non-homogenousatmosphere that characterize so many confined spaces might not be properlycharacterized by one, or perhaps even several, samplings of the atmospherein the area where the entry work will be performed. Also, either the entrytask or even the entry itself may ``stir up''    contaminants so that theambient air concentration may rise and the PELs exceeded. In addition,exit from a confined space in many cases is very difficult which may resultin unanticipated delays in workers leaving the space causing them to beexposed above the PEL. Lastly, the cause (e.g., a leaking valve gland)of the initial low to moderate reading may suddenly and unexpectedly deterioratefurther (e.g., leak becomes a blowout), causing a sudden, very high exposure.For these reasons OSHA generally recommends, as a procedure, that whereconditions would tend to higher or unexpected exposures, employers needto take precautions, such as mechanical ventilation, personal protectiveequipment, or other measures, when employees enter confined spaces wherethe readings exceed the values listed for the 8-hour TWAs in andSection;1910.1000. OSHA requests comments on this recommended procedure. Proposed paragraph (c)(3) requires employers to establish a written permitsystem under which entry permits would be properly prepared, issued andimplemented. The Agency believes that compliance with the proposed requirementwould ensure that permit space entry took place only after all actionsand conditions necessary for the protection of authorized entrants havebeen performed. In particular, OSHA believes that requiring a written systemwould provide the best assurance that an employer systematically addressedpermit space concerns while implementing the entry permit program and whilereviewing the program in light of entry    experience. The provisions ofthe permit system appear in proposed paragraph (d). OSHA requests thatcommenters submit examples of permit systems for permit space entry. Proposed paragraph (c)(4) requires employers to post signs near the permitspaces to notify employees what hazards may be present and that only authorizedentrants may enter the permit spaces. The Agency believes that employeesneed this information to understand the seriousness of potential hazardsin the workplace. The Agency anticipates that compliance with this requirementwould ensure that employees who are not involved in permit space operationswould be sufficiently informed so that they would not attempt to enterpermit spaces. OSHA notes that only personnel who work with permit spaceswould need to know more about the potential hazards. Proposed paragraph (c)(5) requires employers to prevent unauthorized permitspace entry. In addition, the proposed paragraph mentions training andthe posting of signs and barriers as examples of means by which employerscould comply with this provision. OSHA is concerned that personnel whoare not authorized to enter a permit space are unlikely to know of or totake the necessary precautions for safe entry. Therefore, the Agency believesthat it is essential for employers to prevent unauthorized entry. OSHArequests that commenters submit information on methods used to preventunauthorized entry and the effectiveness of those methods. Proposed paragraph (c)(6) requires employers to train employees so theycan safely perform their entry permit    program duties. OSHA notes thatinadequate training was an important factor in virtually all of the incidentsreported in the Hazards section, above. The Agency has proposed this generalrequirement, in addition to the specific training requirements in proposedparagraphs (e) through (i), in order to emphasize that proper trainingis essential for safe permit space operations. OSHA requests that commenterssubmit information on training provided to employees working in permitspace operations, including information on provisions for retraining. Proposed paragraph (c)(7) requires employers to provide, maintain and ensurethe proper use of the equipment necessary for safe entry, such as testing,monitoring, communication and personal protective equipment. This provisioncovers equipment which detects hazards before or during entry; which enablesattendants to contact authorized entrants or rescue services; and whichprotects authorized entrants from any permit space hazards which may arise.OSHA believes, even though the proposal places primary reliance on hazardcontrols, that it is appropriate to require additional equipment and proceduresto ensure employee protection in case hazard controls are inadequate. TheAgency requests that commenters submit information on the equipment andprocedures they have used. Proposed paragraph (c)(8) requires employers to implement the equipmentand procedures necessary to rescue entrants from permit spaces. OSHA notesthat in most of the permit space    incidents reported the entrants wouldnot have been harmed if the proper rescue equipment and procedures hadbeen available and used. Indeed, the incident reports indicate that manyemployers have made no provision for the rescue of entrants, and that thishas resulted in fatalities among the would-be rescuers. Therefore, OSHAbelieves that this proposed paragraph is needed to ensure that employersmake the necessary rescue equipment, such as retrieval lines, availableand establish appropriate rescue procedures. OSHA requests informationfrom commenters on the equipment and procedures which have been used forrescue. Proposed paragraph (c)(9) requires employers to ensure that all barriersnecessary to protect authorized entrants from external hazards, such asvehicles or unauthorized entrants, are provided. OSHA is concerned thatauthorized entrants are extremely vulnerable to hazards, due to the natureof the spaces where they work, and that those hazards originate both insideand outside the permit space. The Agency notes that often protection hasfocused too strongly on hazards which arise inside the space. OSHA, therefore,believes that a specific requirement to prevent external hazards from endangeringentrants would be appropriate to reflect the importance which OSHA attachesto effective control of all potential permit space hazards. OSHA requestsinformation on barriers or other means which have been used to protectauthorized entrants from external hazards. Proposed (c)(10) requires individuals who control permit spaces (host employer)to provide contractors (or similar employers) who plan to have employeesenter these permit spaces with all available information on permit spacehazards; on efforts to comply with the standard; and on any other hazards,safety rules or emergency procedures. OSHA believes that contractors wouldneed that information in order to comply with the proposed standard. Asindicated by the preface to proposed paragraph (c), OSHA anticipates thatcompliance with the proposed provision would be particularly importantwhere an employer identifies permit spaces, and then decides to have acontractor instead of his or her own employees perform permit space work.OSHA notes that a contractor whose employees enter permit spaces wouldbe under the same obligation as any other employer to comply with thisstandard. However, OSHA believes that a contractor who is unfamiliar witha particular workplace may be seriously hampered in his or her effortsto identify and control potential hazards. Indeed, that difficulty couldbe exacerbated where the party retaining a contractor assumes that thecontractor knows how to operate safely in a particular space because thecontractor has a particular professional expertise. In addition, as describedabove in the incident reports, contractor employees have been endangeredwhere the host employer makes changes in workplace operations which createhazards, but does not inform the contractor. Further, once a contractor'semployees have confronted a hazard, employees of the host employer andmembers of an emergency rescue team could be killed or injured trying tosave the initial entrants. Therefore, OSHA has determined that proposedparagraph (c)(10) is needed to ensure that contractors offset any disadvantagethey might otherwise face in complying with this standard. Proposed paragraph (d) requires employers who plan to have employees enterpermit spaces to establish a system under which entry will be authorized,supervised and terminated, as necessary, to ensure protection of employees.In particular, the proposed paragraph requires employees to document certaincritical elements of their compliance with the proposed standard. OSHArecognizes that the employers covered by this proposed standard are diversein their activities, resources and safety concerns. Accordingly, the Agencyhas determined that this proposed paragraph should allow employers someflexibility in deciding how to comply with the proposed documentation requirements.The three compliance approaches which OSHA would consider appropriate are,as follows: andbullet; Preparation of a written permit at the time entry is authorizedwhich contains all of the information needed to document compliance withthe proposed standard; andbullet; Preparation of a written permit at the time entry is authorizedwhich identifies the place, date and time of the entry and the personnelwho are involved in the entry, along with a checklist portion of the permit(which may be pre-printed) which specifies the hazards potentially presentand the precautions which have been taken to protect entrants; andbullet; Direct supervision of the entry by the person authorizing entryusing a checklist-type permit, in lieu of a more complete written permit,which specifies the hazards potentially present and the precautions whichhave been taken to protect entrants. In addition, OSHA would not require employers to prepare a permit whenthe personnel entering a space are members of a rescue team summoned incompliance with this standard. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) requires employers to provide a permit(s) throughwhich the employers identify all conditions which must be evaluated toensure safe entry. OSHA is concerned, based on the incidents reported,that employers have not been sufficiently careful about authorizing permitspace entry, and believes that only a systematic approach will ensure thatentrants receive the necessary protection. The Agency has not specifieda format for employers to use in complying with the proposed paragraph,because OSHA anticipates that individual companies or industries wouldhave approaches which are attuned to their particular circumstances. TheAgency has included sample permit system format(s) as a non-mandatory appendixto this rule. OSHA requests that commenters submit other samples of permitsystem formats which have already been in use. Proposed paragraph (d)(2) specifies the required information on permitspace hazards and entry precautions which the employer must include aspart of a permit. OSHA recognizes that much of the information generatedby employers planning permit space entries is unchanged from one entryto the next. In particular, this is the case with the identification ofthe potential hazard(s) and with the description of the measures that arenecessary to protect entrants. Therefore, the Agency would accept the useof a pre-printed permit containing the required information in order tospare employers an unnecessarily repetitive burden. OSHA notes that allowingthe use of a pre-printed permit would not reduce the employer's responsibilityto ensure that the recorded information is accurate. Proposed paragraph (d)(3) specifies the additional minimum informationOSHA would require in an entry permit for entries not directly supervisedby the individual authorizing the permit. OSHA believes that preparinga contemporaneous record of the entry place, purpose, time, date and personnelwould ensure that the person authorizing an entry gave appropriate considerationto the precautions needed for that entry. OSHA notes that the requirementto identify the attendant does not apply when entry is performed withoutan attendant, pursuant to proposed paragraph (i), below. Proposed paragraph (d)(4) requires that an employer who plans to have hotwork, such as welding, done in a permit space detail that ventilation orother measures have been taken to ensure that authorized entrants wouldbe protected from potential hot work hazards, such as fire or asphyxiation.This information could appear either in a permit or in a separate hot workpermit which is attached to the permit. OSHA is not concerned about howthe information is presented, as long as it is readily available. The Agencyrecognizes that requiring employers to copy hot work permit informationonto a separate entry permit would impose an unnecessary burden on employers.Proposed paragraph (d)(5) requires that, after all actions and conditionsnecessary for safe entry into a permit space have been performed, the personauthorizing entry shall sign or initial the permit as applicable, and thenallow entry to begin. OSHA has proposed this common sense requirement here,as well as in paragraph (g), in order to impress on employers that compliancewith the proposed entry permit program requirements, and verification ofthat compliance in the permit, are prerequisites for entry. The Agencywants employers to take their responsibilities under the proposed standardvery seriously, so that they sign off on an entry permit only if they arecertain that the standard has been followed. Proposed paragraph (d)(6) requires that, upon completion of the work forwhich the entry was required and after all authorized entrants have exitedthe permit space, the person who authorized the entry shall cancel thepermit. Again, OSHA has proposed a common sense requirement, which alsoappears in paragraph (g). In this case, the Agency simply intends to provideclear guidance on what to do with a permit after the authorized work hasbeen completed. OSHA notes that permits can remain valid for up to oneyear so long as the conditions under which the permit was issued are maintained.In addition, this proposed provision underscores the Agency's view thatthe authorization of entry is one part of a larger ongoing process by whichemployers ensure that their employees are protected from permit space hazards.OSHA anticipates that compliance with this paragraph would help to ensurethat employers give due attention to all phases of the entry permit program.OSHA anticipates that the information generated in complying with proposedparagraph (d) would be useful in ensuring the safety of particular entries,and also when employers review their entry procedures in light of theirentry experiences, especially where employers are investigating incidents.Proposed paragraph (e) requires employers to train and supervise the employeesthey assign to work as authorized entrants so that the entrants performtheir work safely. OSHA notes that the provisions covering authorized entrantsand attendants are very similar. This reflects the Agency's perceptionthat authorized entrants and attendants have complementary responsibilities.OSHA believes that employers who cultivate a spirit of mutual trust andcooperation between entrants and attendants will maximize safety and workefficiency.In addition, OSHA observes that a given employee could be assigned to performany of the duties set out in the proposed rule, as long as that employeehas the requisite training. Many employers may elect to alternate workersbetween entrant and attendant duties. As a result, employees can developa clear understanding of how the attendant's vigilance and the entrant'sresponsiveness combine to ensure workplace safety. Proposed paragraph (e)(1) requires employers to ensure that authorizedentrants know and can recognize the effects of the hazards they may confront,and that they understand the consequences of hazard exposure. As indicatedby the injury and fatality data, permit space hazards often give very littlewarning before entrants are endangered. Therefore, OSHA believes that familiarizingauthorized entrants with potential hazards will significantly increasethe likelihood that an entrant would detect a hazard in time for successfulescape or rescue. Proposed paragraph (e)(2) requires that employers ensure that authorizedentrants use the means furnished for communicating with attendants. Inmany cases, attendants will depend on information from entrants in determiningwhether it is safe to continue the entry. Indeed, OSHA anticipates thatan entrant's failure to maintain contact, or that behavioral changes detectedin communications from entrants, will indicate to the attendant that anentry should be terminated immediately. The proposed paragraph also requires entrants to notify  the attendantif they initiate evacuation. In this way, the attendant would be alertedto perform any assigned rescue-related duties, such as using a winch tohaul entrants out or summoning a rescue team. OSHA believes that signalingthe attendant would greatly improve the entrant's chances of exiting thespace safely. Proposed paragraph (e)(3) requires that employers provide and ensure theproper use of the personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary for safeentry. OSHA notes that the failure to provide and ensure the proper useof the appropriate personal protective equipment was a major factor inmany of the incidents reported in the Hazards section, above. The Agencybelieves, therefore, that compliance with this proposed paragraph wouldprevent the recurrence of these reported incidents. Proposed paragraph (e)(4) requires employers to ensure that their employeeswho work as authorized entrants exit a permit space without assistance(self-rescue), insofar as it is physically possible, in the appropriatecircumstances. OSHA believes that self-rescue will often provide the entrant'sbest chance of escaping a space when a hazard is present. The time lostwaiting for the attendant to summon rescuers, waiting for the rescue teamto arrive, or waiting for the attendant to perform any other rescue dutiescan be the difference between life and death. Also, the Agency notes thatthe narrowly configured openings of many confined spaces can make it verydifficult for rescuers to pull or to carry out victims of permit spacehazards. Therefore, while OSHA recognizes that self-rescue will sometimesbe impossible, the Agency stresses the importance of self-rescue as a meansof saving lives and minimizing injuries. (f) <T3>Traininq and duties of the attendant. </T3>Proposed paragraph (f) requiresemployers to train and supervise attendants so they perform their workproperly. As noted above, the provisions covering attendants and authorizedentrants are designed to complement each other. The attendant's role inthis relationship is particularly important where one attendant is assignedto monitor more than one entrant working in one or more permit spaces.The Agency observes that, in a setting where employees may be called uponto make split-second decisions, the employer who conscientiously trainsand supervises attendants significantly reduces the likelihood that hazards,employee errors, or confusion will endanger authorized entrants. Proposed paragraph (f) focuses the attendant's attention on detecting andresponding to hazards. OSHA has not, however, proposed to prohibit theattendant from performing other assigned duties. The Agency believes thatattendants could perform other duties as long as those other duties donot interfere with the requirements of proposed paragraph (f). OSHA envisionscircumstances, for example, where attendants pass or receive equipmentand materials to and from authorized entrants. OSHA has specifically requestedpublic input on this matter in Issue 3 of this proposal. Proposed paragraph (f)(1) requires employers to ensure that the attendantknows, at all times during the entry, how many persons are in the permitspace so that no one is accidentally left in the space when it is returnedto service. In event of an emergency in the space, the attendant also needsto know the number of entrants so that there are neither any entrants needinghelp left in the space, nor are there any useless search and rescue entriesconducted for persons who have already left the space. Proposed paragraph (f)(2) requires employers to ensure that attendantsknow and can recognize the effects of the hazards entrants may confrontin a space. The attendants would be required to monitor the permit spaceto ensure that any hazard was detected. In this way, authorized entrants,whose efficiency might suffer if they were preoccupied by efforts to detecthazards, could work carefully with the confidence that the attendant woulddetect any hazard which eluded their attention. OSHA also proposes to haveattendants watch out for any entry space hazards which might originateoutside the permit space. Proposed paragraph (f)(3) requires employers to ensure that attendantsmaintain contact with authorized entrants. In addition, the attendant would,when necessary, order evacuation, deal with unauthorized persons in ornear the space, and summon rescue and other emergency services. OSHA notesthat establishing a routine for maintaining contact between attendantsand entrants would help attendants detect    problems within a space, becausean entrant when first affected by a permit space hazard might signal theattendant erratically. The Agency has not prescribed any particular meansor procedure for communication, because OSHA anticipates that the approacheschosen will have to vary according to the circumstances of the particularworkplaces. The Agency's sole concern is that the means of communicationchosen enable the attendants and the entrants to maintain effective andcontinuous contact. Proposed paragraph (f)(4) requires employers to ensure that attendantsproperly perform any assigned rescue duties. OSHA is particularly concernedthat employers prohibit attendants from entering a permit space to attemptrescue. There are numerous reports of attendants who died as would-be rescuersbecause they were unprepared for the hazards within the spaces. The Agencybelieves that the attendant does the most good for entrants by workingfrom the outside, such as by attempting rescue through the use of retrievallines or by contacting trained rescuers, and by being on hand to informthe rescuers of what has happened in the space. Furthermore, OSHA believesthat the training of attendants should include simulated rescues, so thatattendants can develop a systematic approach for summoning and dealingwith rescuers, and for performing any assigned rescue duties. Proposed paragraph (g) prescribes the training and duties of individualswho authorize entry or who are in charge of an entry. Individuals who mayauthorize an entry may also assume    the duty of either attendant or entrantif they have the proper training. OSHA believes that the successful performanceof these roles is crucial to the success of the employer's efforts to ensuresafe entry. Proposed paragraph (g)(1) requires employers to ensure that individualswho authorize or take charge of entry operations make the necessary determinationthat acceptable entry conditions are present, that the entry permit orchecklist is prepared correctly, and that entry authorization is terminatedif acceptable entry conditions are not present. OSHA believes that the proposed requirements are needed to ensure thatentries take place only after certain findings have been made and aftercertain actions have been taken. The Agency notes that failure to followthrough with entry procedures contributed to some of the incidents reportedin the Hazards section, above. The proposed provisions clearly assign responsibilityfor verifying compliance to the individual who authorizes or is in chargeof entry. OSHA observes that a single individual might both authorize andtake charge of an entry. Indeed, that individual might also serve as theattendant. Proposed paragraph (g)(2) requires employers to ensure that individualsauthorizing or in charge of entry take the necessary measures to removeunauthorized individuals who are in or near entry permit spaces. OSHA isconcerned that unauthorized individuals who get in or near a permit spacemay endanger themselves, as well as authorized entrants and    personnelwho may be needed to rescue the unauthorized individuals from entry spacehazards. The Agency believes that the person authorizing or in charge ofentry is in the best position to take the necessary action to deal withunauthorized individuals. Proposed paragraph (h) sets out the requirements for in-house and outsiderescue teams. The employer would choose whichever type of rescue team bestsuits his or her circumstances. The Agency is aware that, while promptaction by an in-plant rescue team may make the difference between a successfuland a failed rescue, many employers may not have the resources to maintaina rescue team. Proposed paragraph (h)(1) lists the minimum requirements for an in-houserescue team. The standard would require that employers provide the rescueteam with the equipment for rescue, and train the team in proper rescuetechniques, as well as in entry procedures. At least one member of theteam would be required to maintain certification in basic first aid andcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Proposed paragraph (h)(2) requires employers who choose to use outsiderescue services to ensure that the outside rescuers are informed of thehazards they may confront so they can equip and conduct themselves appropriately.Given that the employer has no control over outside rescuers, OSHA believesit is very important that employers keep designated rescuers informed ofpotential rescue needs. Proposed paragraph (i) contains provisions under which    employers couldissue ``special permits'' which would authorize employees to enter low-hazardpermit spaces without an attendant. Low-hazard permit spaces, as definedin proposed paragraph (b), pose an extremely low risk of posing IDLH orengulfment hazards and have had all other serious hazards controlled. OSHAbelieves that this divergence from the proposed paragraph (f) requirementfor an attendant is justified where entrants routinely enter permit spacesto perform checking and inspecting, minor maintenance work and diked areawork, because authorized entrants would be adequately protected from anypossible atmospheric hazards through the proposed testing, monitoring andventilation requirements and through the other proposed provisions. TheAgency notes that employers who assign employees to enter permit spaces,which qualify only marginally as permit spaces, could find proposed paragraph(i) a reasonable alternative to complying with proposed paragraph (f).OSHA proposes to limit the effective life of a special permit to one year.OSHA has not limited the effective life of entry permits when entry isto be performed with an attendant on hand. The Agency believes that anemployer who complies with the requirements of the proposed standard, includingthe requirements for attendants, has provided sufficient assurance thatentrants would be protected to justify permitting the employer to set theduration of the permit at the length appropriate to complete the pertinentwork. On the other hand, OSHA believes that the authorization    of entrywithout an attendant may provide less assurance that the necessary conditionsfor safe entry would be maintained. Therefore, the Agency would requireemployers who follow proposed paragraph (i) to reevaluate and reissue theirentry permits at least once a year to ensure that employers authorize non-attendantentry only when the necessary conditions and actions have been performed.Proposed paragraph (i) covers situations in which employers who authorizeentry with special permits, and who then revoke those permits because unacceptableentry conditions have arisen. These employers cannot allow entry into thosespaces by special permit until the conditions of that space which allowedfor special permit entry have been restored and the employer reevaluatesthe space and makes a new determination that the space may again be treatedas a special permit (low hazard) space. This requirement reflects OSHA'sconcern that employees would be endangered if the employer was again allowedto authorize entry without an attendant and unacceptable entry conditionsagain arose. The Agency has serious doubts as to the likelihood that anemployer could establish that a permit space for which a special permithas been revoked should continue to be treated as a low-hazard permit space.This provision also reflects OSHA's view that proposed paragraph (i) shouldonly be available where employers can provide clear assurance that employeeprotection will not be compromised by absence of an attendant. Proposed paragraph (i)(1) presents the additional requirements which employersmust satisfy if they decide to have employees perform checking or inspectingduties inside a low-hazard permit space without having an attendant stationedoutside. OSHA believes that there are situations where an employer couldappropriately decide that an entry performed simply to check or inspectequipment did not require the stationing of an attendant, based on: andbullet; The circumstances of the permit space, such as the nature of theidentified hazards and the likelihood that authorized entrants would generateor confront hazards; andbullet; The employer's and authorized entrant's experience with entryto that permit space; andbullet; The routine, repetitive and nondisruptive nature of the entry;and andbullet; The ability to comply with the special provisions of proposedparagraph (i)(1). OSHA remains sufficiently concerned that an IDLH atmosphere could arisein a ``low-hazard permit space'' that the Agency would require employersto ensure that the permit space atmosphere is tested immediately priorto entry and that authorized entrants who would move beyond the area whichcould be tested from outside the space be appropriately equipped, trainedand supervised to ensure that they test the atmosphere, as necessary, toensure that conditions are acceptable for continued entry. Proposed paragraph (i)(2) presents the additional requirements which employersmust satisfy if they decide to have employees perform minor maintenanceduties inside a low-hazard permit space without having an attendant stationedoutside. OSHA believes that there are situations where an employer couldappropriately decide, based on the factors discussed above under proposedparagraph (i)(1), that minor maintenance work on equipment within the permitspace could be performed safely without having an attendant on hand. The key difference between proposed paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) is thatentrants performing minor maintenance would bring materials into the permitspace and perform work in the permit space which could change the conditionsin the space. Under the proposal, the employer must ensure that any suchchange in the permit space would not generate a serious hazard. OSHA stressesthat, where the employer cannot ensure that maintenance work would proceedwithout generating a serious hazard in a permit space, the employer wouldbe required to comply with the requirements for attendants in proposedparagraph (f). OSHA also notes that, as discussed above under proposed paragraph (i)(1),proposed paragraph (i)(2) requires employers to ensure that any potentialIDLH hazard is controlled or detected prior to entry. Again this provisionindicates the Agency's concern that however low the probability, authorizedentrants in a low-hazard permit space may be exposed to atmospheric hazardsdue, for example, to changes in the space. Therefore, the Agency proposesthat employers ensure the safety of authorized entrants by testing, monitoringor ventilating, as appropriate under the given circumstances. Proposed paragraph (i)(3) presents the additional requirements which employersmust satisfy if they decide to have employees perform work in diked areaswhich are six feet or more in height and are regulated as permit spaceswithout having an attendant stationed outside. OSHA believes that thereare situations where the employer could appropriately decide, based againon the factors discussed above under proposed paragraph (i)(1), that workin a diked area could be performed safely without an attendant on hand.The work contemplated under proposed paragraph (i)(3) could be similarto that which would be authorized under proposed paragraph (i)(1) and (i)(2),and could also include regular maintenance or repair work. In any case,OSHA would require that entry could proceed without an attendant only ifthe employer ensured that the necessary procedures to prevent generationof a hazard were in effect before and throughout the entry. OSHA specificallynoted linebreaking as an activity performed in diked areas for which appropriateprocedures, including the preparation of a permit to authorize linebreaking,would be required to protect authorized entrants. OSHA solicits commentson the appropriateness of allowing employers to authorize entry withoutproviding an attendant. In addition, as noted in Issue 8, OSHA requeststhat commenters submit suggested criteria through which employers couldassess the applicability of proposed paragraph (i) to their operationsand could determine how best to comply with proposed paragraph (i). Costs vs. Risk Reduction The U.S. Supreme Court, in <T3>American Textile Manufacturers Institute </T3>v. <T3>Donovan</T3>, 452 U.S. 490 (1981), determined that for standards dealingwith toxic substances or harmful physical agents (``section 6(b)(5) standards''),once OSHA determines that there is a ``significant risk'' to employees,the standards may not be based on a balancing of costs and benefits; rather,the standards must reduce the risk ``to the extent feasible.'' The decisionin <T3>American Textile </T3>did not reach the issue of whether cost-benefitanalysis is either required or permitted in the issuance of other typesof standards under the OSH Act. In a recent decision on OSHA's grain handling standard, <T3>National Grain and Feed Association </T3>v. <T3>OSHA</T3>, 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir., 1989), the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit held that the grain standard did not deal with atoxic substance or harmful physical agent within the contemplation of section6(b)(5), and that it was not subject to the ``feasibility mandate'' underthe <T3>American Textiles </T3>decision. In <T3>National grain</T3>, the Fifth Circuit found that standards other thansection 6(b)(5) standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate''to protect employee safety, and that, in contrast to 6(b)(5) standards,``[t]his determination encompasses a specie of cost-benefit justification.''866 F.2d at 733. Citing its previous decision in <T3>Texas Independent Ginners </T3>v. <T3>Marshall</T3>, 630 F.2d 398 (1980), the Court determined that ``[t]hereasonably necessary requirement . . . only demands that the expected costsof OSHA regulations be reasonably related to the expected benefits, leavingconsiderable discretion for the agency as long as it is exercised on substantialevidence and with an adequate statement of reasons. 630 F.2d [398] at 411n. 44[.]'' 866 F.2d at 733. OSHA believes that its proposed rule on confinedspaces readily meets the test set forth by the Fifth Circuit in <T3>National Grain</T3>, insofar as that test is applicable and requestspublic comment on the requirements in its proposed rule. Appendices OSHA would propose to include three non-mandatory appendices (AppendixA, Appendix B and Appendix C) with the standard. The purpose of these appendicesis to provide information useful to the employer in complying with thestandard. Subjects of these appendices would be: Appendix A_Decision logic flowchart. Appendix B_References. Appendix C_Permit and associated checklist examples. OSHA would welcome examples of confined space entry procedures and permitsas well as other useful information which could be included in these appendicesto serve as guidelines for employers.<ITAG tagnum="74">V.

Background </ITAG>Based largely on an industry report prepared by the CONSAD Research Corporation(CONSAD), OSHA estimates that the proposed confined space standard willhave a cost impact on at least 30 two-digit Standard Industrial Classification(SIC) industry groups covered by the proposal. In manufacturing industries, examples of permit spaces include storagevessels, furnaces, railroad tank cars and aircraft sections being manufactured.In non-manufacturing industries, permit spaces include manholes servicedin the Utilities Industry (SIC 49) and autoclaves cleaned and maintainedin hospitals (SIC 806). OSHA estimates that about 224,000 establishmentshave permit spaces, that about 7.2 million production workers are employedat these establishments, and about 2.1 million workers enter permit spacesannually. Table I presents the number of establishments with permit spacesand the number of production workers and permit space entrants by majorindustry group. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Number of Establishments With Permit Spaces and Number of Workers andScheduled Entrants at Those Plants</T4><H1>SIC Industry/Category</H1><H1>Number of establishments with permit spaces</H1><H1>Total production workers</H1><H1>Number of entrants (annual) \2\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">07 Agricultural Services<D>10,656</D><D>\1\ 60,966</D><D>25,361</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13 Oil andamp; Gas Extraction<D>681</D><D>13,620</D><D>681</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 Food and Kindred Products<D>8,148</D><D>399,487</D><D>81,887</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21 Tobacco Manufacturers<D>88</D><D>34,803</D><D>2,468</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22 Textile Mill Products<D>1,585</D><D>162,230</D><D>29,133</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24 Wood Products (Less Furniture)<D>6,298</D><D>118,228</D><D>26,640</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25 Furniture and Fixtures<D>5,256</D><D>186,102</D><D>36,212</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26 Paper Products<D>4,404</D><D>318,030</D><D>45,930</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27 Printing and Publishing<D>41</D><D>530</D><D>82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28 Chemicals andamp; Allied Products<D>8,015</D><D>342,829</D><D>72,935</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29 Petrlm Ref andamp; Related Industry<D>1,741</D><D>92,800</D><D>18,368</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 Rubber Products<D>5,991</D><D>232,818</D><D>132,287</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31 Leather and Leather Products<D>110</D><D>5,650</D><D>767</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32 Stone, Clay, Glass andamp; Concrete<D>13,610</D><D>333,587</D><D>147,802</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33 Primary Metals Industry<D>3,210</D><D>305,527</D><D>59,481</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">34 Fabricated Metal Products<D>7,058</D><D>193,018</D><D>36,983</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35 Machinery, Except Electrical<D>4,317</D><D>233,430</D><D>120,105</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">36 Electric/Electronic Equipment<D>8,612</D><D>673,856</D><D>137,195</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">37 Transportation Equipment<D>3,514</D><D>609,118</D><D>44,908</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38 Instruments andamp; Related Prdts<D>35</D><D>2,824</D><D>285</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">39 Misc.

OSHAhas determined that most employee injuries and deaths occur in toxic orasphyxiating atmospheres. The Agency has found that confined space entrantsare also injured and killed due to engulfment by fine particulate matter,fire, explosion and mechanical hazards. In addition, when personnel outsidea confined space become aware that an entrant is experiencing difficulties,those personnel often attempt to rescue the entrant. Often these would-berescuers are unaware of or not equipped for the hazard encountered andare overcome along with the initial entrant. Most permit spaces are entered infrequently. Periodic entries may be madeinto those spaces to inspect, clean or repair equipment. Some productsare considered permit spaces while they are being built, and entries byworkers are required as part of the manufacturing process. Entry into thesepermit spaces is often frequent. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Nonregulatory Alternatives </ITAG>The objective of OSHA's proposed standard for confined spaces is to reducethe number of employee injuries resulting from unsafe entry into confinedspaces. OSHA believes that the present risk to employees is excessive andthat compliance with the proposed standard will prevent nearly all of thework-related accidents. OSHA examined the nonregulatory approaches forpromoting adequate levels of workplace safety for promoting adequate levelsof workplace safety in confined spaces, including (1) economic forces generatedby the private market system, (2) incentives created by Workers' Compensationprograms or the threat of private suits, and (3) related activities ofother private or government agencies. As a result of this review, OSHAhas determined that the need for government regulation arises from thesignificant risk of job-related injury or death caused by the inadequaterate of optional private hazard-abatement expenditure in establishmentswith confined spaces. Private markets fail to provide enough safety and health resources dueto the imperfect distribution of risk information, the immobility of labor,and the externalization of some of the social costs of worker injuriesand deaths. Workers' Compensation systems do not offer an adequate remedybecause the premiums do not reflect workplace risk, and liability claimsare restricted by state statutes preventing employees from suing theiremployers. While there are some voluntary industry-generated standardsand some state regulation, OSHA believes that these measures, because theytend to be incomplete, inconsistent and lacking in guidance for employers,do not provide adequate protection for all workers. In addition, OSHA hasrepeatedly cited employers under the general duty clause, section 5(a)(1)of the OSH Act, for confined space workplace conditions which the Agencydetermined violated the basic requirement that employers provide theiremployees with workplaces free from recognized hazards. This indicatesto OSHA that employees working in confined spaces confront significantsafety and health hazards frequently enough to justify the issuance ofa standard specifically designed to address those hazards. Therefore, OSHAhas determined that a comprehensive federal standard is necessary to protectconfined space workers.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Technological Feasibility </ITAG>OSHA has determined that it is technologically feasible to implement theproposed standard. The technology that would be required by the provisionsin the proposed standard is now used by some employers in all industriescovered by the proposal. Based on the current use of atmospheric testinginstruments, ventilation equipment, respirators, and retrieval devices,OSHA believes that all employers would be able to implement existing technologyto comply with the proposal. No new technological developments would beneeded for firms to reach compliance with the proposed standard. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Benefits </ITAG>While there are limitations to available data, OSHA estimates that 80 to90 percent of the accidents in confined spaces would be avoided by compliancewith the proposed standard. OSHA estimates that 31 to 35 fatalities, 2,220to 2,497 lost workday injuries, and 2,532 to 2,849 non-lost workday injurieswould be prevented. However, given the uncertainty over the precise numberof injuries occurring annually in confined spaces, a sensitivity analysisof benefits, based on varying assumptions, is provided in Tables II-A andII-B. The accident reports indicate that most fatalities and injuries occurbecause employees are unaware of the hazards in the permit spaces and areinadequately equipped to manage the hazardous situations. The objectiveof the proposed standard is to correct both of these situations. By loweringthe accident rate of employees who make work-related entries, the standardwill also reduce the number of emergency situations where injured workersare incapacitated inside permit spaces. Rescuers would make fewer entries,thereby reducing their exposure to confined spaces and preventing additionalinjuries and deaths.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table II-A._Sensitivity Analysis of Estimated Prevented Fatalities</T4><H1>Sector</H1><H1>Current</H1><H1>Prevented</H1><H2>80% </H2><H2>90%</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Oil andamp; Gas Extraction<D>2.9</D><D>2.3</D><D>2.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Manufacturing<D>20.6</D><D>16.5</D><D>18.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation andamp; Public Utilities<D>7.9</D><D>6.3</D><D>7.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wholesale And Retail Trade<D>1.3</D><D>1.0</D><D>1.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Services<D>0.3</D><D>0.2</D><D>0.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Host Employer Unidentified<D>6.1</D><D>4.9</D><D>5.5</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>39.1</D><D>31.3</D><D>35.2</D><F>\1\ Includes .4 average annual fatalities in Lockout/tagout situations.</F><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table II-B._Lost Workday Injuries </T4><H1>Sector </H1><H1>Number of injuries at 5, 10, and 20 percent of BLS ratio of injuriesto fatalities \1\ and estimated injuries prevented at 80 and 90 percenteffectiveness level </H1><H2>Current </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><H2>Prevented (80%) </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><H2>Prevented (90%) </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><ITAG tagnum="1">Oil andamp; Gas Extraction <D>103 </D><D>206 </D><D>412 </D><D>82 </D><D>165 </D><D>329 </D><D>93 </D><D>185 </D><D>371 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Manufacturing <D>731 </D><D>1,462 </D><D>2,924 </D><D>585 </D><D>1,170 </D><D>2,339 </D><D>658 </D><D>1,316 </D><D>2,632 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation andamp; Public Utilities <D>280 </D><D>561 </D><D>1,122 </D><D>224 </D><D>449 </D><D>897 </D><D>252 </D><D>505 </D><D>1,010 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wholesale and Retail Trade <D>46 </D><D>92 </D><D>185 </D><D>37 </D><D>74 </D><D>148 </D><D>42 </D><D>83 </D><D>166 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Services <D>10 </D><D>20 </D><D>40 </D><D>8 </D><D>16 </D><D>32 </D><D>9 </D><D>18 </D><D>36 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Host Employer Unidentified <D>217 </D><D>433 </D><D>866 </D><D>173 </D><D>346 </D><D>693 </D><D>195 </D><D>390 </D><D>780 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>1,387 </D><D>2,774 </D><D>5,549 </D><D>1,110 </D><D>2,220 </D><D>4,439 </D><D>1,248 </D><D>2,497 </D><D>4,994 </D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>10,L2,i1,s50,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7 </C><T4>Table II-C_Non-Lost Workday Injuries </T4><H1>Sector </H1><H1>Number of injuries at 5, 10, and 20 percent of BLS ratio of injuriesto fatalities \1\ and estimated injuries prevented at 80 and 90 percenteffectiveness level </H1><H2>Current </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><H2>Prevented (80%) </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><H2>Prevented (90%) </H2><H3>5% </H3><H3>10% </H3><H3>20% </H3><ITAG tagnum="1">Oil andamp; Gas Extraction <D>117 </D><D>235 </D><D>470 </D><D>94 </D><D>188 </D><D>376 </D><D>106 </D><D>211 </D><D>423 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Manufacturing <D>834 </D><D>1,668 </D><D>3,336 </D><D>667 </D><D>1,334 </D><D>2,669 </D><D>751 </D><D>1,501 </D><D>3,003 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation andamp; Public Utiliities <D>320 </D><D>640 </D><D>1,280 </D><D>256 </D><D>512 </D><D>1,024 </D><D>288 </D><D>576 </D><D>1,152 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wholesale and Retail Trade <D>53 </D><D>105 </D><D>211 </D><D>42 </D><D>84 </D><D>168 </D><D>47 </D><D>95 </D><D>190 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Services <D>11 </D><D>23 </D><D>46 </D><D>9 </D><D>18 </D><D>37 </D><D>10 </D><D>21 </D><D>41 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Host Employer Unidentified <D>247 </D><D>494 </D><D>988 </D><D>198 </D><D>395 </D><D>791 </D><D>222 </D><D>445 </D><D>889 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>1,583 </D><D>3,165 </D><D>6,330 </D><D>1,266 </D><D>2,532 </D><D>5,064 </D><D>1,424 </D><D>2,849 </D><D>5,697 </D><F>\1\ To estimate injuries, OSHA employed the ratio of BLS estimated injuriesto fatalities in manufacturing and utilities. However, because confinedspace accidents are typically more catastrophic in nature, a lower ratiowould be expected. For this reason, OSHA has estimated the number of injuriesat 5, 10 and 20 percent of the BLS ratio. OSHA has employed 10 percentfor its calculation of benefits. This modified ratio was then multipliedby the number of fatalities recorded in confined spaces in OHSA data (asrepresented in Table II-A). </F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>In addition, OSHA expects the rules to save productive time that wouldbe lost due to these accidents and administrative time spent filing accidentreports and replacing injured workers. Based upon an estimated value of$4,000 per lost-workday injury avoided, and $350 per non-lost workday injuryavoided, employer benefits (cost savings) are estimated to have a monetizedvalue of $9.9 to $11.1 million. Further, based upon willingness to payestimates of $33,000 per lost-workday injury and $320 per non-lost-workdayinjury, the total value of reduced non-fatal accidents to society is estimatedto be approximately $85 to $94 million. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Estimated Costs of the Proposed Standard </ITAG>OSHA estimates that compliance with the proposed permit required confinedspace standard will impose start-up costs of $36.9 million and recurringannualized costs of $160.0 million. Annualizing the start-up costs producesa total annualized cost of $166.0 million. Factoring in the non-fatalitybenefits to society noted above, OSHA estimates the net cost per fatalityavoided is between $2.0 and $2.5 million. OSHA also calculated the costs of compliance by provision for each affectedindustry. As shown in Table III, the highest initial cost of any provision,$25.8 million, is for training. This cost is due to the large number ofproduction workers to be trained. The highest annual cost, to provide anattendant during entries, is $54.7 million a year. There are also significantannual costs to provide respiratory protection and to perform atmospherictesting. As shown in Table IV, the industry group with the highest estimated initialcost, $8.0 million, is the utilities industry (SIC 49). The utilities industryalso has the highest estimated annual cost, $52 million, mainly due tothe large number of confined space entries made each year. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s300,12,12 </C><T4>Table III._Summary of Initial and Total Compliance Costs by Provision($)</T4><H1>Provision </H1><H1>Total initial costs </H1><H1>Total annual costs </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Establish Permit Entry Program/System <D>9,162,226 </D><D>39,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Issue Permits <D>0 </D><D>11,744,418 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Training <D>25,828,964 </D><D>3,099,436 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inform Non-Entrants <D>6,357 </D><D>2,701,120 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atmospheric Testing <D>0 </D><D>36,506,187 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mechanical Ventilation <D>0 </D><D>13,128,908 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Respiratory Protection <D>0 </D><D>29,177,494 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Retrieval Devices <D>1,882,242 </D><D>2,224,340 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Isolation Procedures \1\ <D>0 </D><D>3,144,304 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Protective Clothing <D>0 </D><D>3,338,158 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vehicle andamp; Pedestrian Guards <D>0 </D><D>126,244 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Attendant <D>0 </D><D>54,747,406 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>36,879,788 </D><D>159,977,015 </D><F>\1\ Includes $1 million for control of hazardous energy sources thatwill be required under a separate rule, once final. </F><F/></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table IV._Summary of Initial and Total Compliance Costs of the ConfinedSpaces Standard by Industry (4)</T4><H1>SIC Industry</H1><H1>Total initial costs</H1><H1>Total annual costs</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">07 Agricultural Services<D>2,743,417</D><D>7,127,545</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13 Oil andamp; Gas Extraction<D>0</D><D>585,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 Food and Kindred Products<D>2,368,152</D><D>13,787,599</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21 Tobacco Manufacturers<D>33,294</D><D>43,870</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22 Textile Mill Products<D>387,187</D><D>777,118</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24 Wood Products (less Furniture)<D>1,511,643</D><D>941,339</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25 Furniture and Fixtures<D>901,605</D><D>1,390,871</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26 Paper Products<D>1,525,518</D><D>4,158,059</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27 Printing and Publishing<D>760</D><D>832</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28 Chemicals andamp; Allied Products<D>1,476,496</D><D>1,187,919</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29 Petrlm Ref andamp; Related Industry<D>132,641</D><D>1,598,553</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 Rubber Products<D>596,747</D><D>4,567,823</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31 Leather and Leather Products<D>19,412</D><D>16,357</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32 Stone, Clay, Glass andamp; Concrete<D>1,992,046</D><D>4,886,588</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33 Primary Metals Industry<D>1,011,200</D><D>5,671,647</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">34 Fabricated Metal Products<D>2,247,886</D><D>6,282,654</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35 Machinery, Except Electrical<D>543,968</D><D>1,987,344</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">36 Electric/Electronic Equipment<D>2,808,893</D><D>15,872,363</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">37 Transportation Equipment<D>1,157,633</D><D>10,912,009</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38 Instruments andamp; Related Products<D>2,274</D><D>338</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">39 Miscellaneous Manufacturing Industry<D>100,473</D><D>1,057,983</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">42 Motor Freight Transportation<D>2,330,464</D><D>3,219,569</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">49 Elec, Gas, Sanitary Services<D>8,025,120</D><D>52,029,269</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51 Wholesale Trade/Nondurable<D>3,602,372</D><D>16,345,904</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">59 Miscellaneous Retail<D>322,123</D><D>258,334</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70 Hotels and Other Lodging<D>72,880</D><D>726,439</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">72 Personal Services<D>423,383</D><D>32,980</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">78 Motion Pictures<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">80 Health Services<D>263,251</D><D>3,989,307</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">84 Museums, Botanical, Zoo<D>877</D><D>219</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Boilers in Commercial Buildings <D>291,693</D><D>532,845</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>36,879,788</D><D>159,977,015</D><F>\1\ Numbers may not total precisely due to rounding.</F><F/></ITAG></ITAG>Various other proposed OSHA standards would overlap with certain provisionsand industries covered by this standard. In this analysis, as noted inTables IIA and III, OSHA has assumed costs and benefits attributable tocontrol of hazardous power sources in confined spaces. Similarly, costsand benefits related to mitigating hazards in confined spaces in electricalpower generating facilities have also been included. When these rules becomefinal, these costs and benefits will no longer apply to this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Economic and Other Impacts</ITAG>OSHA believes that none of the 30 industry groups having costs imposedby the proposal would experience significant economic impacts because thecompliance costs can be passed through to consumers or absorbed from profits.OSHA estimates that the average price increase needed to maintain profitsin the affected industries would be less than one hundredth of a percent(ratio of compliance costs to the value of shipments). The maximum priceincrease in any one of the 30 industries was estimated to be less than0.2 percent. OSHA also estimated the economic consequences of the assumptionthat all of the costs would be absorbed from industry profits and not passedon to consumers. By comparing the estimated compliance costs to estimatedprofits for each industry, OSHA estimated that the overall profit reductionfor the 30 affected industries was less than 0.1 percent. Therefore, OSHAexpects that the proposed standard will not have a significant economicimpact.

Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (<T3>5 </T3>U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>), OSHA has assessed the expected impact of the proposedstandard on small entities in each of the affected industries. OSHA hasconcluded that the proposed standard will not significantly burden smallbusinesses. This assessment was based on a comparison of estimated compliancecosts and value of shipments for those small plants where data were available.In no industry would the small business segment have to increase pricesby more than two-tenths of one percent to offset the costs. The majorityof the industry increases are below one hundredth of a percent (see TableVI). The highest estimated price increase would be 0.12 percent in Stone,Clay, and Glass Products (SIC 32). In addition, the use of performancelanguage in the proposed standard would facilitate compliance by smallfirms. The flexibility in meeting requirements allows smaller plants tohave lower compliance costs for some provisions.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table VI.-Maximum Price Increase for Small Entities</T4><H1>SIC Industry </H1><H1>Maximum price increase (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">07 Agricultural Services<D>NA</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13 Oil andamp; Gas Extraction<D>NA</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 Food and Kindred Products<D>0.0022</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21 Tobacco Manufacturers<D>.0276</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22 Textile Mill Products<D>.0007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24 Lumber and Wood Products<D>.0182</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25 Furniture and Fixtures<D>.0044</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26 Paper and Allied Products<D>.0057</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27 Printing and Publishing<D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28 Chemicals and Allied Products<D>.0003</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29 Petroleum and Coal Products<D>.0049</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 Rubber and Misc.

Environmental Impact AssessmentThe proposed rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality(CEQ) (40 CFR Parts 1500-1577), and the Department of Labor's (DOL) NEPAprocedures (29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the AssistantSecretary for OSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significantenvironmental impact. The proposed standard is designed to reduce employee accidents and injuriesby such means as work practices, engineering controls, training, atmospherictesting, personal protective equipment, and the implementation of rescueprocedures. Such procedures and applications do not impact on air, wateror soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land or other aspectsof the environment. Therefore, this proposed standard is categorized asan excluded action according to Subpart B, andSection; 11.10 of the DOL NEPAregulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Recordkeeping </ITAG>The proposed standard contains ``collection of information'' (recordkeeping)requirements pertaining to establishing permits, the employer-specifiedentry conditions, and conditions that actually existed at the time of entry.OSHA estimates that these documents, the entry permit and entry permitsystem would be required to be maintained by the employer. The Agency believesthat the entry permit would not be retained by employers for more than30 days after completion of the entry if no deaths, injuries or serious,adverse health effects resulted from that entry. We estimate that for the ``worst case scenario'', an employer with no existingprogram, it will take an average of 9 hours per establishment per year,including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burdenestimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, includingsuggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Management and Budget,Paperwork Reduction Project (1218-AA51), Washington, DC 20503, and to theDocket Office, Docket No. S-019, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,Room N2634, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20210, for inclusion in the record for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Federalism</ITAG>This proposed regulation has been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, regarding Federalism. The regulation is drafted so that employeesentering confined spaces in every state would be protected by general,performance oriented standards. To the extent that there are state or regionalpeculiarities caused by the types of spaces to be entered, the terrain,the climate or other factors, states would be able, under the OSH Act,to develop their own state standards to address any special problems. And,under the Act, if a state develops its own, approved state program, itcould impose additional requirements in its standards. Moreover, the performancenature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibilityby states and employers to provide as much safety as possible using varyingmethods consonant with conditions in each state.In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safetyand health in entering confined spaces. While the individual states, ifall acted, collectively might be able to address the safety problems involved,most have not elected to do so in the 17 years since the enactment of theOSH Act. Those states which have elected to participate under the statutewould not be preempted by this proposed regulation, and would be able toaddress special, local conditions within the framework provided by thisperformance oriented standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Public Participation</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and argumentswith respect to this proposal. These comments must be postmarked by August4, 1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket S-019,Room N2634, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. Written submissionsmust clearly identify the issues or specific provisions of the proposalwhich are addressed and the position taken with respect to each issue orprovision.The data, views and arguments that are submitted will be available forpublic inspection and copying at the above address. All timely submissionsreceived will be made a part of the record of this proceeding. The preliminaryregulatory assessment and the exhibits cited in this document will be availablefor public inspection and copying at the above address. OSHA invites commentsconcerning the conclusions reached in the regulatory impact assessment.Additionally, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSHA Act and 29 CFR 1911.11,interested persons may file objections to the proposal and request an informalhearing. The objections and hearing requests should be submitted in quadruplicateto the Docket Office at the above address and must comply with the followingcondition:1. The objections and hearing requests must include the name and addressof the objector;2. The objections and hearing requests must be postmarked on or beforeAugust 4, 1989.3. The objections and hearing requests must specify with particularitythe provisions of the proposed rule to which objection is taken and muststate the grounds therefore;4. Each objection and hearing request must be separately stated and numbered;and5. The objections and hearing requests must be accompanied by a detailedsummary of the evidence proposed to be adduced at the requested hearing.OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons who, through theirknowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved, wouldwish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHA welcomessuch supportive comments, including any pertinent accident data or costinformation which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemakingwill present a balanced picture of the public response on the issue involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. State Plan Standards</ITAG>The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupationalsafety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within six monthsof the publication date of a final standard. These 25 states are: Alaska,Arizona, California, Connecticut, New York (for state and local governmentemployees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina,Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming.Until such time as a state standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provideinterim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI.

An attendantmay monitor not more entrants nor more permit spaces than the entry permitspecifically authorizes.(3) ``Authorized entrant'' means an employee who is authorized by the employerto enter an permit required confined space. Authorized entrants may rotateduties, serving as attendants if the permit program and the entry permitso state. Any properly trained person with the authority to authorize entryby other persons may enter the permit space during the term of the permitprovided the attendant is informed of that entry.(4) ``Blanking'' or ``blinding'' means the absolute closure of a pipe,line or duct, by fastening across its bore a solid plate or ``cap'' whichcompletely covers the bore; which extends at least to the outer edge ofthe flange at which it is attached; and which is capable of withstandingthe maximum upstream pressure.(5) ``Double block and bleed'' means the closure of a line, duct or pipeby locking and tagging a drain or vent which is open to the atmospherein the line between two locked-closed valves.(6) ``Emergency'' means any occurrence (including any failure of hazardcontrol or monitoring equipment) or event(s) internal or external to theconfined space which could endanger entrants.(7) ``Engulfment'' means the surrounding and effective capture of a personby a liquid or finely divided solid substance.(8) ``Entry'' means the act by which a person intentionally passes throughan opening into an permit required confined space, and includes ensuingwork activities in that space.
