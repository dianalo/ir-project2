<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-1027 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since a considerable number of workers at Oak Ridge National Laboratorywork with compounds of transuranic elements, computer techniques havebeen developed to evaluate phoswich spectra in order to determine lungburdens following accidental inhalation of {sup 239}Pu, {sup 241}Am,{sup 244}Cm or other isotopes. Two unfolding methods which have beenfound useful in the analysis of such cases are presented and discussed.These techniques have been used successfully to detect low levels of{sup 239}Pu, {sup 241}Am, {sup 244}Cm, {sup 233}U, {sup 90}Sr, and {sup153}Gd in contaminated workers; but because of the current importanceof {sup 239}Pu, emphasis is placed on detection of that isotope in thepresence of {sup 241}Am and natural human background. In the health physicstradition of emphasizing benefit vs. risk, the authors also analyze uncertaintiesinherent in external counting of the actinides from the viewpoint ofstatistical risk analysis an derive decision criteria which are usefulin determining whether various radioactive species have, in fact, beendetected. These criteria are somewhat different from those encounteredusing traditional counting statistics and derive from the realizationthat some errors will always be made in scanning large numbers of radiationworkers. The optimum decision strategy for the determination of lungburden is, therefore, one which minimizes the long-term risk of error.The usefulness of this approach to whole body counting will be discussedand analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
