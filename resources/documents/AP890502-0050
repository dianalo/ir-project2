The Shanghai students set out in the early afternoon from FudanUniversity and East China Teachers University and marched to thedowntown People's Square.   The official Xinhua News Agency said they carried bannersreading ``Give us democracy and freedom,'' ``Oppose privileges''and ``Media must tell the truth.'' It said they planned to presenta petition to local officials.   In Beijing, a delegation of 65 students from 33 schoolsdelivered an ultimatum to China's legislature, Cabinet and theCentral Committee of the ruling Communist Party.   The students are demanding the government recognize and holdtalks with independent associations they have set up during their2-week-old pro-democracy campaign. They want a free press, freedomof assembly and publication and an end to official corruption.   Wang Dan, a student leader from Beijing University, said thegovernment had agreed to respond by the deadline, noon Wednesday.   Beijing students already have defied police warnings and marchedfive times since April 17 to Tiananmen Square, the country'ssymbolic seat of power. About 70,000 students at 41 colleges alsohave been boycotting class since April 24.   After a march on Thursday drew cheers and applause from tens ofthousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetingswith invited students.   However, most of the invited students have been members ofofficially established unions that student protesters have rejectedsince the demonstrations started. The government has said thestudents' new associations are illegal.   Representatives of the United Association of BeijingUniversities, an umbrella group for the new student groups, saidtheir ultimatum listed 12 conditions for a dialogue, beginning withrecognition of the association.   Other conditions included government willingness to discuss afree press and disclosure by officials of their financial records.   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and city party chief Li Ximing toldinvited students at a meeting Sunday that they each earn about $80a month, abut 50 percent more than the average factory worker.   But students later complained that Chen and Li did not mentionjob perks, including comfortable apartments, free meals and use ofgovernment cars.   If the government refuses to recognize the United Association,Beijing students will hold another march on Thursday, studentactivists said.   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of China's first democraticmovement, in which about 3,000 Beijing students marched to protestJapanese occupation of Chinese territory. The students also calledthen for democratic and scientific reforms to strengthen thecountry against foreign encroachment.   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and ordinary citizensmarched through Beijing in the biggest demonstration in 40 years ofCommunist rule.   Student activists said they don't expect as large a turnout ifthey march again this week. Many students have gone home for theMay Day holiday and are not expected to return until next week,said one student at People's University whose red armband markedhim as an activist.   ``Student emotions are relatively calm now, but they will beeasily aroused,'' he said.   Student posters at Beijing University called for a lettercampaign to protest the dismissal of World Economic Herald editorQin Benli.   He was fired from the Shanghai weekly after rejecting governmentorders not to publish articles calling for a reassessment of formerCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang, who was ousted in 1987 for beingtoo liberal. Hu's death on April 15 triggered the student protests.   A telegram sent to Shanghai officials by Chinese Academy ofScience researchers warned, ``Anyone who blocks the course ofdemocratization in China will be judged severely by the people.''</TEXT></DOC>
