Daiei and the smaller chain, Chujitsuya Co., said theyhave agreed to open talks on a potential business link, astep that could result in Daiei's acquiring the hostile 33.8%stake in Chujitsuya held by Shuwa Corp., a once high-flyingJapanese real-estate company.</LP><TEXT>   At the current market price, the stake is valued at about100 billion yen ($774 million). But the price has yet to benegotiated and may be below the market value.   The drama, which has been unfolding over the past twoyears, involves two of Japan's best-known executives. IsaoNakauchi, Daiei's chairman, drew international attention inthe 1970s when he shook up Japan's stodgy retailing industryby selling low-priced imports and turning his smallOsaka-area business into a national chain. And ShigeruKobayashi, Shuwa's president, gained international notorietyin the 1980s by spending billions of dollars on some of themost prominent office buildings in the U.S.   Mr. Nakauchi indicated at a news conference Thursday thatDaiei, which had consolidated operating profit of 2.284trillion yen for its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, probably willmake a friendly takeover bid for the shares of Chujitsuya,whose sales for the same year were 315.47 billion yen. Butthat is expected to be largely a legal formality. Becausenearly all the shares that aren't controlled by Shuwa arebelieved to be held by shareholders loyal to Chujitsuyamanagement, the bid is likely to boil down to negotiationsbetween Daiei and Shuwa over the price of its stake, analystssaid.   Just two years ago, Shuwa was talking boldly of parlayingits stakes in several Tokyo-area retailers into a powerfulnew chain that would spur a restructuring of Japan'sretailing industry. Cynical observers suspected the real aimof Shuwa's Mr. Kobayashi wasn't to run a retail empirehimself but to sell his holdings at a profit to existingretail companies, such as Daiei.   In any case, like the U.S. and Japanese real-estatemarkets in which it invested so heavily, Shuwa has fallen onhard times. Almost exactly one year ago, Shuwa turned toDaiei for large-scale loans and pledged its Chujitsuya sharesas its major collateral.   Not long after, Mr. Nakauchi indicated he would like tobuy Shuwa's Chujitsuya shares, but, in keeping with theJapanese bias against hostile takeovers, only withChujitsuya's blessing.   At the time, Chujitsuya's cooperation didn't seem to be inthe cards. Chujitsuya's founder and then-president, YoshitomoTakagi, wanted the company to remain independent, as did itslabor unions. But the situation has changed since Mr.Takagi's death in June.   At a news conference following Mr. Nakauchi's, ChujitsuyaPresident Shigeyuki Tanishima said the Shuwa hostile stakehas crimped Chujitsuya's ability to raise equity capital andhas left the company &quot;half-paralyzed.&quot;   Mr. Nakauchi said the terms and timing of the bid remainto be worked out. But he said the price would have to be a&quot;socially reasonable&quot; one. Analysts interpreted that to meana price that wouldn't seem to reward Mr. Kobayashi, who isperceived by some as a would-be greenmailer who inflatedChujitsuya's price by soaking up all the available shares.Greenmail refers to a company's buying back stock from anunwanted suitor at a higher-than-market price.   Mr. Nakauchi's comments seemed to suggest that his idea ofa reasonable price might fall well below Wednesday's closingprice of 3,290 yen a share. Even Mr. Tanishima, in his newsconference, described the latest quoted price as &quot;beyond(Chujitsuya's) actual strength.&quot; Trading in the stock wassuspended Thursday morning, pending the late-afternoonannouncements. Two years ago, Chujitsuya's stock hovered ataround 5,000 yen a share.   Shuwa's borrowings from Daiei group companies now total110 billion yen. Even at the latest closing price, the 30.6million shares would fetch less than that amount, althoughShuwa also pledged other retailers' stocks as collateral. Akey question in Daiei's takeover calculations, Mr. Nakauchiindicated, will be &quot;at what price Kobayashi will besatisfied.&quot;   Joy Walbert, an analyst for Baring Securities (Japan)Ltd., said Chujitsuya's decision to agree to a &quot;rescue&quot; byDaiei represents a &quot;realistic&quot; response to its own financialweakness and a more competitive environment. Chujitsuya has&quot;fantastic&quot; locations in the Tokyo area but lacks the capitalneeded to upgrade the outlets, she said.   The families that run many of Japan's regional storechains have traditionally resisted alliances, but that ischanging, Ms. Walbert noted. As stores and chains growbigger, partly because of liberalization of the nation'sretailing laws, more companies are striking alliances to keeppace with competitors.   For Daiei, the affiliation with Chujitsuya could provide astronger presence in Tokyo, where its network is stillrelatively weak. But Daiei is among the more heavily indebtedof Japan's retail groups, analysts say, so it isn't clear howquickly it would be able to invest in upgrading Chujitsuya'schain.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          DAIEI INC. had consolidated operating revenue of 2.284trillion yen ($17.75 billion) for the year ended Feb. 28.
