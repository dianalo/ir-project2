Schmitt   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/07/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C8</SO><IN>INSURANCE (INS)</IN><LP>   A Los Angeles judge invalidated regulations implementing akey aspect of Proposition 103, giving the insurance industryanother victory in its legal attack on the reformist voterinitiative.   The regulations attempted to limit the ability ofinsurance companies to use place of residence when computingautomobile insurance rates for the state's 16 million insureddrivers. The issue is hot in California, where motorists inurban centers can pay several times the rate for suburban andrural drivers, and was a major driving force behind the voterrevolt that resulted in Proposition 103's passage in November1988. Proponents also believe that insurers have used such&quot;territorial pricing&quot; to discriminate against the poor andminorities.</LP><TEXT>   But Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel preliminarilyenjoined the regulations, finding that they conflicted with aseparate provision of Proposition 103 that prohibits&quot;excessive, inadequate or discriminatory&quot; rates. Insurancecompanies had argued that limiting their ability toincorporate territory-related factors in setting rates wouldbe unfair because they are valid in determining potentiallosses.   &quot;This strikes at the very core of Proposition 103,&quot; saidKarl Rubenstein, special counsel to the state insurancecommissioner, who said he plans to appeal the decision. &quot;Ourmajor complaint over the ruling is that it is not based onany ascertainable facts&quot; that the new regulations would havecaused insurers actual losses.   &quot;It is a travesty of justice,&quot; added Harvey Rosenfield, aLos Angeles consumer activist who organized the initiative'scampaign drive.   Reflecting the intent of Proposition 103's framers, theregulations ordered insurers to fix rates primarily based ondriving record, experience and annual mileage driven, anapproach that is at odds with rate-making policies used bymost insurance companies across the country. The regulationsalso barred insurers from using gender or age in computing arate, but the judge rejected that position, too, citingevidence that such factors were actuarially valid inpredicting future accidents.   The immediate effect of the decision is that the state'sautomobile insurers can ignore a deadline of this Friday whennew rating plans in accordance with the regulations wereoriginally due. Judge Vogel said insurers could continue touse their old rates, but continued a temporary freeze thatstate insurance regulators ordered last October.   Some observers said they expected the industry, havingincurred losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars sincethe initiative's adoption, to begin pushing for emergencyrate increases in court. But such efforts didn't appearimminent. For instance, Marc Fairman, a San Francisco lawyerfor Allstate Insurance Co., said, &quot;We may at some point askfor preliminary relief while we work through theadministrative process.&quot;   The decision also ensures months of additional legalwarfare over the initiative, which, because of its ownambiguous language, regulatory delays and industry legalchallenges, has stalled short of expectations since itspassage 18 months ago. For instance, Proposition 103's mosthighly publicized feature, a 20% rollback in rates, wasundermined by a state Supreme Court decision last year.   &quot;The commissioner is going to have a very difficult timewriting regulations that are constitutional, nonconfiscatoryand don't violate other provisions of the laws,&quot; predictedJessica Pers, a San Francisco lawyer for State Farm MutualAutomobile Insurance Co., the state's largest automobileinsurer.   Judge Vogel's decision, if upheld, could be potentiallygood news for nonurban drivers in the state. Insurancecompanies had argued that the new regulations, while likelyto force down rates in urban areas, would cause large,offsetting increases elsewhere. Indeed, State InsuranceCommissioner Roxani Gillespie, herself fearful of big rateincreases, had ordered a rate ceiling as part of theregulations, which was also struck down as part of JudgeVogel's order.   But Mr. Rosenfield and other proponents maintained thatany increases would be confined mostly to bad drivers, andthat rates in general would decline as stricter regulationunder Proposition 103 made insurers more efficient.   &quot;It is certainly a problematically written piece oflegislation which has ambiguities and inconsistencies,&quot; addedMr. Rubenstein. &quot;But we felt that the regulations validlyimplemented the spirit and intent of the law.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
