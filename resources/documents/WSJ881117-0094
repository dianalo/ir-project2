The report, called &quot;Reducing the Rate of Global Warming,&quot; fingers electricity generation as the single biggest industrial source of fossil fuel emissions, accounting for 33.4% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 1986, with transportation sources and industrial and commercial sources not far behind.    According to the report, Texas emitted 154.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 1986, nearly twice as much as second-place California, which emitted 85.2 million metric tons. Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Louisiana finished third through sixth, respectively, each emitting more than 50 million metric tons.    Emitting the least amount of carbon dioxide was Vermont, followed by Rhode Island, Idaho and South Dakota, each emitting less than three million metric tons.    Texas's top ranking appears to reflect its high number of petrochemical plants. Roughly half of all statewide emissions were from oil. California's emissions, too, were mostly from oil, while virtually all of Ohio's carbon dioxide emissions came from its coal-burning power plants. But while Texas's emissions have about doubled over the past 20 years, California and Ohio have managed to pretty much hold the line, the report notes.    The environmental group called for a rapid and large reduction in burning oil and coal. They also called for much greater emphasis on energy efficiency and &quot;renewable&quot; energy sources such as solar and wind power.    While solar, wind, geothermal and other &quot;alternative&quot; energy sources have never competed financially with fossil fuels, some utility executives say they are starting to be competitive in parts of the U.S. as the technologies improve.    Meanwhile, natural gas, a fossil fuel that, when burned, emits only about half as much carbon dioxide as oil and coal, is seen by Renew America as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the fossil fuel-based economy of today and a renewable resource-based economy of tomorrow. However, the report doesn't address recent forecasts indicating that significant new demand could cause a natural-gas shortage in the U.S. starting around 1990.    Recently, other groups and individuals, including Sens. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.) acting jointly, have made similar proposals to cut fossil-fuel use. Each has been in response to scientific warnings that the earth may be undergoing a rapid warming trend as a result of gases in the atmosphere trapping heat.    ---           U.S. Carbon Emissions by Sector in 1986    As percent of U.S. total emissions from fossil fuels.
