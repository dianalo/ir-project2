The Moslem guerrillas _ known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic``holy warriors'' _ launched the attack in early June on the airportat Mazar-i-Sharif, the insurgents' Afghan News Agency said.   The city is the capital of northern Balkh province and a majormilitary base of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government.   During the fighting, 7,400 tons of ammunition stored in a depotexploded, destroying weaponry, vehicles and 170 tanks, the agencysaid. It said it was unclear if the arsenal was exploded by therebels or if it was sabotaged to keep weapons out of guerrilla hands.   About 300 government troops were killed in the blast andsubsequent fighting, the agency reported.   It was not possible to independently confirm the guerrilla report.   Battlefield claims by each side are difficult to verify, andcasualty counts frequently are released several days after clashes.   Mazar-i-Sharif, 35 miles south of the Soviet border, is the majormilitary supply hub for Kabul, the Afghan capital.   Guerrilla and Western diplomatic sources say the communistgovernment has prepared the city as a fallback position in the eventKabul is taken by the rebels, who are backed primarily by Pakistanand the United States.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islamirebel group, told civilians Sunday to evacuate the southeastern cityof Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest, before an imminentguerrilla attack.   Communist government forces still hold the country's major citiesfollowing the withdrawal earlier this year of Soviet troops helpingthe Marxist government. But the guerrilla fighters have control ofmost of the countryside.   A commander in Hekmatyar's group issued a similar warning toKabul citizens in May, but the offensive has yet to materialize.   Guerrilla sources who demanded anonymity said rebel leaders planto focus their firepower mainly on eastern Afghan cities near thePakistan border.   Capture of a major eastern city would provide a capital for theguerrillas' government-in-exile and provide them a staging base fortheir ultimate objective, Kabul.   But Jalalabad, the guerrillas' first target just 40 miles fromthe Pakistan frontier, remains in government hands despite threemonths of rebel attacks.   The rebels want to rid the country of Marxists and establish anindependent, Islamic republic of Afghanistan. They have rejectedrepeated peace overtures from the Kabul government.   Pakistan, which shelters more than 3 million Afghan war refugees,and the United States have announced they will continue supportingthe guerrillas but with an eye to pursuing a political solution ofthe war.   Hard-line guerrilla leaders such as Hekmatyar along with andhawks in Islamabad and Washington advocate fighting on for amilitary victory.</TEXT></DOC>
