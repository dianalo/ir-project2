The FAA received 106 comments in response to the ANPRM. An overwhelmingmajority of the commenters supported the intent of the proposal to reorganizepart 91. However, there were numerous problem areas identified by the commentersrelating to the proposed changes that were considered substantive. On November 18, 1980, the FAA formed a part 91 Working Group to analyzethe AOPA proposal and comments received on the ANPRM. It was determinedthat certain technical and administrative problems existed and that itwas not feasible to undertake a substantive revision of part 91 at thattime. Subsequently, AOPA withdrew its petition. However, review of AOPA'sproposal to reorganize and renumber part 91 revealed that many of the changeshad merit and could be implemented. The FAA part 91 Working Group concludedthat the reorganization and renumbering of part 91 would be the first stepto improve the regulation and make it more understandable and easier touse. Consequently, the FAA published NPRM No. 79-2A (46 FR 45256; September10, 1981), which proposed to reorganize and realign the general operatingand flight rules to make them more understandable and easier to use. Otherproposals were made to delete redundancies and obsolete compliance datesand to make other minor changes. Notice No. 79-2A did not contain any substantive changes; however, it didinform the public that the FAA considered that notice to be the first stepin a regulatory review of part 91 consistent with the objective of ExecutiveOrder 12291. With this in mind, the FAA invited additional specific commentsto help identify substantive areas to be reviewed and possibly includedin subsequent proposals concerning part 91. The notice further stated thatthe FAA would not take final action concerning the reorganization untilsubstantive changes were proposed and the public had been given an opportunityto comment on those proposals. The FAA published Notice No. 79-2B (46 FR 60461; December 10, 1981) toextend the comment period for Notice No. 79-2A by 120 days. That noticewas issued in response to a petition from the National Business AircraftAssociation to allow additional time for commenters to prepare substantivecomments.The FAA received 69 comments in response to Notice No. 79-2A. The majorityof these comments favored the proposal and were discussed in Notice No.79-2C (50 FR 11292; March 20, 1985). Notice 79-2C proposed four substantive changes in addition to the numerouschanges made to reorganize and clarify existing rules. Two of these changeswere made in response to comments received from the public. These changesare as follows: (1) <T3>Section 91.117.</T3> Allows reciprocating-powered aircraft to be operatedat 200 knots in an airport traffic area; (2) <T3>Section 91.135. </T3>Allows operators desiring authorizations to deviatefrom positive control area and route segment requirements to utilize a48-hour oral notification system; (3) <T3>Section 91.409. </T3>Allows operators of turbine-powered rotorcraftto use an alternate inspection program, such as an FAA-approved inspectionprogram; and (4) <T3>Sections 91.205, 91.509, and 91.511. </T3>Defines ``shore'' as it isused in these sections to exclude tidal flats. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>Forty-seven comments were received in response to Notice No. 79-2C. A numberof commenters recommended regulations that were not proposed in the notice.Because such comments discuss matters which the public has not had an opportunityto consider, they are beyond the scope of the notice and cannot be consideredwithout further notice and public participation. Some of these commentsconcern proposals that will be considered by the FAA in future rulemakingand, therefore, could be published in a future notice. There were two areas in particular where several proposals were receivedthat are not within the scope of the notice. First, 11 comments specificallyrequest that balloons be excepted from certain requirements now pertainingto aircraft in general. These comments seek substantive change to the existingregulations not proposed in the notice. Second, a number of commenters propose substantive changes to the regulationswith regard to rotorcraft. Although these comments are not within the scopeof this rulemaking, they were considered in the Rotorcraft Regulatory ReviewProgram, Notice No. 5. Two commenters are opposed to changing masculine references to ``airman''to read ``he or she.'' One commenter states that this would keep the textshorter and speed up the reading of the text. The other commenter statesthat andSection; 1.3(a)(3) already provides that ``words importing the masculinegender include the feminine,'' and the better course would be to referto the ``person,'' or the ``pilot.'' The FAA agrees with these commenters.Accordingly, references throughout part 91 that use the words ``he'' or``she'' have been changed to refer to the ``person,'' the ``pilot,'' the``crewmember,'' or the ``Administrator.'' One commenter writes that the use of ``pilot in command'' and ``PIC'' isinconsistent in the proposed rules. The FAA agrees with this commenterand, accordingly, has changed references to ``PIC'' in andSection;andSection;91.123(a) and 91.129(b) to ``pilot in command'' to make their use consistentthroughout part 91. A commenter suggests that all references to distances expressed in milesshould state whether they are statute or nautical miles. The FAA agreesthat such references should be clear. Accordingly, references to distanceexpressed in miles in andSection;andSection; 91.171(b)(4)(ii) and 91.207(e)(3)are changed by adding the word ``nautical'' to reflect that the distancesare expressed in nautical miles since they reference ground-measured distance.References to visibilities in andSection;andSection; 91.155(b), 91.167(b)(2)(ii),and 91.303(e) are changed by adding the word ``statute'' to reflect thatvisibilities are expressed in statute miles. Several commenters state that the proposed wording for andSection; 91.1 impliesthat operations of moored balloons, kites, unmanned rockets, and unmannedfree balloons are governed by part 103. This comment has merit and andSection;91.1 is revised by adding a specific reference to part 101 after the phrase``unmanned free balloons'' to make clear that moored balloons, kites, unmannedrockets, and unmanned free balloons operate under part 101. Another commenter requests clarification of the discussion of andSection;91.7 in Notice No. 79-2C, where the FAA states that there is no provisionfor the use of an approved Minimum Equipment List (MEL) in part 91 operations,whereas andSection; 91.213 permits the use of an approved MEL. The FAA pointsout that at the time Notice No. 79-2C was published, the effective dateof current andSection; 91.30 (proposed andSection; 91.213) was stayed indefinitely(44 FR 62884; November 1, 1979). Amendment No. 91-192 (50 FR 51188; December13, 1985) which took effect on March 13, 1986, terminated the stay. Section 91.7(b), which was proposed without substantive change from existingandSection; 91.29, provides that a flight should be discontinued when unairworthymechanical or structural conditions occur. One commenter suggests thatthis be changed by deleting ``mechanical or structural'' and making itmore general so as to provide for a possible unairworthy electrical system.This suggestion raises a valid point; however, the FAA has determined thatthe rule should be amended to explicitly reference mechanical, electrical,or structural conditions. Therefore, andSection; 91.7(b) is amended accordingly.As suggested by one commenter, andSection; 91.21(a)(1) is amended by deletingreference to a ``commercial operator.'' This revision conforms andSection;91.21(a)(1) with SFAR 38-2 and part 125 which do not provide for a commercialoperator's certificate and, instead, provide for the issuance of eitheran ``air carrier operating certificate'' or an ``operating certificate.''One commenter states that consideration should be given to better defining``appropriately rated pilot'' in andSection; 91.109 and provide a definition.The FAA agrees that the phrase ``appropriately rated pilot'' should bedefined better.The preamble to Amendment No. 91-36 (32 FR 260; January 11, 1967 statesthat an ``appropriately rated pilot'' in andSection; 91.21(b) requires aprivate pilot certificate with an airplane category rating, a multiengineclass rating for a small multiengine land plane, and a type rating fora large airplane or a turbojet-powered airplane (large or small). Accordingly andSection; 91.109(b)(1) is amended to require that the safetypilot hold at least a private pilot certificate with category and classratings appropriate to the aircraft being flown. One commenter urges the FAA to reinsert the current rule regarding visualdescent points (VDPs) (current andSection; 91.116). VDPs are not an integralpart of the approach procedure. An aircraft that is not equipped to identifya VDP has the same approach minima as a similar aircraft that is equippedto identify the VDP. Mandatory use of VDPs is considered inappropriate for a number of reasons:(1) VDPs that use Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) fixes may, becauseof displacement factors and/or fix errors, result in descent angles thatare either too shallow or too steep for the approach. (2) A mandatory VDP rule discourages the purchase and use of the very equipmentnecessary to identify the VDP. This is so because compliance can only berequired of those aircraft that are equipped to identify the VDP. For these reasons, the final rule, like the NPRM, does not include a mandatoryVDP requirement.Notice No. 79-2C proposed that andSection; 91.175(a) read: ``Unless otherwiseauthorized by ATC, when an instrument letdown to a civil airport is necessary,each person operating an aircraft except a military aircraft of the UnitedStates, shall use a standard instrument approach procedure prescribed forthe airport in Part 97 of this chapter.'' The lead-in clause is changedto read, ``Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator,'' becauseATC does not have the authority to approve a person's noncompliance withthis rule. Several commenters raise objections to proposed andSection; 91.203(a)(2),which would prevent an aircraft from operating outside of the United Statesunder the temporary authority of the pink copy of the Aircraft RegistrationApplication as provided in andSection; 47.31(b). The commenters assert thatthe proposal is a substantive change and not a clarification of the presentrule; and that the FAA should consider the economic impact on the industry,the consumers, and the historical precedence of past practices. These commenterssuggest that the FAA withdraw the proposal and acknowledge the pink copyof the application as a temporary certificate of registration. Another commenter is of the opinion that the FAA has not provided discussion,as required by Executive Order 12291, on the economic impacts that wouldresult from the delay between application for an issuance or denial ofthe registration certificate, under the proposals, in the NPRM. The commentermaintains that future investment purchases and leases would also be adverselyaffected. Several commenters also question the regulatory consistency thatthe FAA claims as the basis for the change. These comments were responded to in full in a Notice of Legal Opinion issuedDecember 1988 (53 FR 50208; December 14, 1988). That Notice of Legal Opinionstated that the limitation of temporary authority to operate an aircraftwithout registration to domestic operations (as also provided in new andSection;91.203(a)(2)) reflects current U.S. law and practice. Concerning the economicimpact of this ruling, the FAA in that Notice of Legal Opinion answered:<ITAG tagnum="21">The aviation community has always been able to transfer ownershipand register their aircraft with minimal difficulty. In order to mitigatethe potential hardship that could result from grounding an aircraft usedin international operations, pending receipt of a registration certificate,the Registry will, upon request, telex a copy of the Certificate of AircraftRegistration to the individual whose name appears on the application asthe registered owner of the aircraft. The telex copy is issued after confirmationof the information contained on an Aircraft Registration Application anddetermination of eligibility for registration. The telex, which reflectscritical and verified information resulting from the evaluation by theRegistry of an application for aircraft registration, may be used as atemporary Certificate of Aircraft Registration until the original certificateis forwarded for carriage in the aircraft. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This telex certificate will assist owners who submit an applicationfor aircraft registration and who wish to operate the aircraft as soonas possible in international operations. Since the telex, by its terms,is a form of registration certificate, the aircraft may be operated ininternational air navigation consistent with Article 29 of the Convention[Convention on International Civil Aviation (61 Stat. 1180; T.I.A.S. 1591;15 U.N.T.S. 295)]. The Registry will telex this copy within a matter ofdays_often within 48 hours_to be kept in the aircraft until the originalCertificate of Aircraft Registration (AC Form 8050-3) is forwarded to theregistered owner.</ITAG>Accordingly, the FAA has determined that the rule should be amended asproposed, and consistent with the Chief Counsel's legal opinion, to provideexplicitly that operations of aircraft outside the United States for whichan application for registration has been submitted but a certificate ofregistration has not been issued are not authorized under the Federal AviationRegulations. Several judicial decisions have defined the ``shore'' as including tidalflats. In some parts of the United States, these tidal flats can extendfor several miles and, because of the extreme tides prevalent in theseareas, the land may be submerged under as much as 25 to 35 feet of waterduring periods of high tide. The intent of the rule is to require operatorscarrying passengers for hire over these areas to equip their aircraft withthe necessary flotation gear and pyrotechnic devices. Therefore, ``shore,''when it is used in andSection;andSection; 91.205, 91.509, and 91.511, is definedto exclude land areas, such as tidal flats, which are intermittently underwater. An incorrect reference to ``andSection; 91.169'' was used in proposed andSection;91.409(e), which has been corrected to ``andSection; 91.409'' in the finalrule It was pointed out by several commenters that the word ``stop'' in andSection;91.605(c)(2) was inadvertently included in the proposal and should be deleted.The commenters are correct, and the final rule has been amended accordingly.Also, the word ``if'' following the word ``distance'' in that same sentencehas been corrected to read ``is.'' In addition to the specific changes discussed above, minor changes havebeen made in the wording of the regulations proposed in Notice No. 72-2C.In andSection; 91.3(b), the word ``in-flight'' has been inserted to clarifythat the deviation authority of andSection; 91.3 applies only to in-flightemergencies which affect the safe completion of the flight. The original intent of andSection; 91.3 was to allow the pilot in commandto deviate from certain regulations in the event of an in-flight emergency.Over time, regulations involving non-flight items were inserted into subpartsA and B, while flight-related regulations were inserted in other subparts.Therefore, the word ``in-flight'' is being added to return the languageto its original intent. Other changes are nonsubstantive in nature. Except for such minor revisions,those parts of the proposal for which there were no comments are adoptedas proposed. Finally, all other sections of Part 91 remain unchanged exceptfor renumbering (see the cross-reference lists below). Several amendments to part 91 adopted since Notice No. 79-2C were publishedare reflected in the final rule. Where reference to other sections of thispart were set forth in an amendment, the references have been changed toreflect the appropriate sections as used in the final rule. Those requiredchanges published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> prior to June 19, 1989 are discussed below. Amendment No. 91-188, (50 FR 15380; April 17, 1985) amended current andSection;91.11, which governs the use of alcohol or drugs by any crewmember performingduty during the operation of an aircraft. This amendment took effect onJune 17, 1985. Subsequently, Amendment No. 91-194 (51 FR 1229; January9, 1986) amended andSection; 91.11(c) to impose a requirement for a crewmemberto furnish the results of any test that indicates percentage by weightof alcohol in a crewmember's blood. This amendment took effect on April9, 1986. Proposed andSection; 91.17 has been revised accordingly. Amendment No. 91-189 (50 FR 31588; August 5, 1985) removed references to``expect approach clearance time'' in andSection; 91.127. This amendmenttook effect on September 4, 1985. Section 91.185 reflects this amendment.Amendment No. 91-190 (50 FR 45602; November 1, 1985) added a new paragraph(c) to current andSection; 91.24. This amendment took effect on December2, 1985. This new paragraph required all aircraft equipped with an operableradar beacon transponder be turned on while airborne in controlled airspace.Subsequently, andSection; 91.24(c) was amended by Amendment No. 91-203 (53FR 23374; June 21, 1988). Proposed andSection; 91.215(c) has been redesignatedas paragraph (d) and the changes brought about by Amendment Nos. 91-190and 91-203 have been incorporated into revised andSection; 91.215(c). Amendment No. 91-191 (50 FR 46877; November 13, 1985) amended current andSection;91.14 (proposed andSection; 91.107) by revising the title and the sectionto include reference to shoulder harnesses. This amendment took effecton December 12, 1985. Section 91.107 has been revised accordingly. AmendmentNo. 91-191 also added a new paragraph to current andSection; 91.33 whichrequires a shoulder harness for specified seats in normal, utility, andacrobatic category airplanes with a seating configuration, excluding pilotseats, of nine or less, manufactured after December 12, 1986. This paragraphappears as andSection; 91.205(b)(15). Amendment No. 91-192 (50 FR 51189; December 13, 1985) terminated the suspensionof Amendment No. 91-157 (44 FR 43714; July 26, 1979) staying the effectivedate of current andSection; 91.30. This amendment took effect on March 31,1986. Subsequently, Amendment No. 206 (53 FR 50195; December 13, 1988)amended andSection; 91.30. Section 91.213 reflects these amendments.Amendment No. 91-193 (50 FR 51193; December 13, 1985) changed the FAA'sdescription of North Atlantic (NAT) Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications(MNPS) airspace to coincide with the International Civil Aviation Organization's(ICAO's) description of the NAT MNPS airspace. This has been reflectedaccordingly in Section 1 of Appendix C of this final rule. Amendment No. 91-195 (51 FR 31098; September 2, 1986) corrects the referenceto the Department of Defense office in current andSection; 91.102 restrictingthe flight of aircraft near space flight operations. This amendment tookeffect on September 15, 1986. Section 91.143 reflects this amendment. Amendment No. 91-196 (51 FR 40692; November 7, 1986) upgraded rotorcraftcertification and operational requirements, thus effecting amendments toseveral FARs. This amendment took effect on January 6, 1987. Current andSection;91.2 was amended to afford small helicopter operators the opportunity toapply for Category II instrument approach authorization. Proposed andSection;91.193 has been revised accordingly. Current andSection; 91.23 was amendedto reduce the IFR reserve fuel requirement for helicopters from 45 to 30minutes. Proposed andSection; 91.167 has been amended to reflect this change.Current andSection; 91.116 (proposed andSection; 91.175) was amended to establisha separate takeoff minimum for helicopters under IFR, of one-half milevisibility. Current andSection; 91.171 was amended to include helicoptersin the altimeter system and altitude reporting equipment tests and inspectionrequirements. Proposed andSection; 91.411 has been amended to reflect thischange. In order to enable rotorcraft to perform Category II operations,Amendment No. 91-196 also amended appendix A in part 91 by removing theword ``airplane'' and replacing it with the word ``aircraft'' whereverit appears. Amendment No. 91-197 (52 FR 1836; January 15, 1987) revises the authoritycitation for part 91 and adds a new paragraph to current andSection; 91.213which states that a commuter category airplane must have a pilot designatedas second in command, unless the airplane has a passenger seating configuration,excluding pilot seats, of nine or less seats, and is type certificatedfor operations with one pilot. This amendment took effect on February 17,1987. This rule now appears as andSection; 91.531(a)(3). Amendment No. 91-198, (52 FR 3391; February 3, 1987) amended current andSection;91.24(a) and (b) on ATC transponder and altitude reporting equipment anduse. This amendment took effect on April 6, 1987. Subsequently, AmendmentNo. 91-203 (53 FR 23374; June 21, 1988) amended andSection; 91.24(b) and(c) and Amendment No. 91-210 (54 FR 25682; June 16, 1989) revised andSection;91.24(a).  Proposed andSection; 91.215 has been revised accordingly. AmendmentNo. 91-198 also revised paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of current andSection; 91.90to allow operations conducted prior to December 1, 1987, in Group II TCAs,to be exempt from the new equipment requirements of current andSection; 91.24.Amendment No. 91-203 (53 FR 23374; June 21, 1988) subsequently revisedandSection; 91.90, effective July 21, 1988. Amendment No. 91-205 (53 FR 40323;October 14, 1988) further revised andSection; 91.90 in its entirety effectiveJanuary 12, 1989. Amendment No. 90-209 (54 FR 24883; June 9, 1989) amendedandSection; 91.90 by delaying the effective date of the section for helicopteroperations. The rule, covering all amendments to date, appears in thisrevision as andSection; 91.131.Amendment No. 91-199, (52 FR 9636; March 25, 1987) amended current andSection;91.35 by renumbering the paragraphs and adding a new paragraph that requiresany operator who has installed approved flight recorders and approved cockpitvoice recorders to keep the recorded information for at least 60 days,or longer, if requested by the Administrator or the National TransportationSafety Board. This amendment took effect on May 26, 1987. The amended rulenow appears as andSection; 91.609.Amendment No. 91-200, (52 FR 17277; May 6, 1987) amended current andSection;91.173 by requiring each registered aircraft owner or operator to keep``preventive maintenance'' records as well as maintenance, alteration,and records of the 100-hour annual, progressive, and other required orapproved inspections, as appropriate, for each engine, propeller, rotor,and appliance of an aircraft. This amendment took effect on June 5, 1987.This amended rule now appears as andSection; 91.417(a)(1). Amendment No. 91-201, (52 FR 20028; May 26, 1987) adds the reference topart 129 to the exception in current andSection; 91.161(b) from the requirementsof andSection;andSection; 91.165, 91.165, 91.171, 91.173, and 91.174 for aircraftmaintained in accordance with a continuous maintenance program as providedfor in part 129. The amendment took effect on August 25, 1987. This amendedrule now appears as andSection; 91.401(b). Amendment No. 91-202, (52 FR 34102; September 9, 1987 and 52 FR 35234;September 18, 1987) amended current andSection; 91.27 on civil aircraft certificationrequirements by adding a new paragraph (c) to require that a copy of theform which authorized the alteration of an aircraft with fuel tanks withinthe passenger or a baggage compartment be kept on board the modified aircraft.This new rule now appears as andSection; 91.203(c). Current andSection; 91.173on maintenance records was revised by requiring that such records be madeavailable to the Administrator or an authorized representative of the NationalTransportation Safety Board and when such a fuel tank is installed as setforth in andSection; 91.35 as amended pursuant to part 43, a copy of theFAA Form 337 be kept on board the modified aircraft. This new rule appearsas andSection; 91.417(b) and (c). This amendment took effect on December8, 1987. Amendment No. 91-203, (53 FR 23374; June 21, 1988, 53 FR 25050; July 1,1988, and 53 FR 26592; July 14, 1988) amended or revised andSection;andSection;91.24 (ATC transponder and altitude reporting equipment and use), 91.88(Airport radar service areas), and 91.90 (Terminal control areas), andby adding a new appendix D entitled ``Airports/Locations Where the TransponderRequirements of andSection; 91.24(b)(5)(ii) Apply,'' regarding use of transponderswith automatic altitude reporting. This amendment took effect on July 21,1988. Amendment No. 91-205 (53 FR 40323; October 14, 1988) revised andSection;91.90 in its entirety effective January 12, 1989. Amendment No. 91-209(54 FR 24883; June 9, 1989) amended andSection; 91.90 by delaying the effectivedate of the section for helicopter operations. These rules now appear inthis revision as andSection;andSection; 91.215, 91.130, 91.131, and new appendixD to Part 91, respectively. Amendment No. 91-204, (53 FR 26145; July 11, 1988) amended current andSection;91.35 on flight recorders and cockpit voice recorders to require digitalflight recorders and voice recorders to be installed on selected aircraftoperated in general aviation. The specifications for such recorders areset forth in a new Appendix E to Part 91 for airplanes and in a new appendixF to Part 91 for helicopters. The amendment is reflected as andSection; 91.609(b),(c), (d), and (e), and new appendixes E and F to part 91. This amendmentbecomes effective on October 11, 1991. Amendment No. 91-205 (53 FR 40323; October 14, 1988) revised the classificationand pilot and equipment requirements for conducting operations in terminalcontrol areas (TCA's) by amending andSection; 91.90 to establish a single-classTCA; require the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft to hold at leasta private pilot certificate, except for a student pilot who has receivedcertain documented training; and, to eliminate the helicopter exceptionfrom the minimum equipment requirement. The amendment was effective onJanuary 12, 1989. Subsequently, Amendment No. 91-209 (54 FR 24883; June9, 1989) amended andSection; 91.90(c)(1) by delaying the application of thesection for helicopter operations for one year. Revised andSection; 91.131covers these amendments. Amendment No. 91-206 (53 FR 50195; December 13, 1988) amended andSection;91.30 to permit rotorcraft, nonturbine-powered airplanes, gliders, andlighter-than-air aircraft, for which an approved Master Minimum EquipmentList has not been developed, to be operated with inoperative instrumentsand equipment not essential for the safe operation of the aircraft. Theamendment also permits general aviation operators of small rotorcraft,nonturbine-powered small airplanes, gliders, and lighter-than-air aircraftfor which a Master Minimum Equipment List has been developed, the optionof operating under the minimum equipment list concept, or under other conditionsas set forth in the amendment. Amendment No. 91-206 also amended andSection;91.165 to require that any inoperative instrument or item of equipmentpermitted to be inoperative under the new amended andSection; 91.30 to berepaired, replaced, removed, or inspected at the next required inspectionfor the aircraft. These amendments became effective on December 13, 1988and appear as andSection;andSection; 91.213 and 91.405 of this revision topart 91.Amendment No. 91-207 (54 FR 265; January 4, 1989) amended andSection;andSection;91.1 and 91.61 to extend the controlled airspace and the applicabilityof certain air traffic rules to coincide with presidential action to extendthe territorial sea of the United States for international purposes, from3 to 12 nautical miles from the U.S. coast. This amendment became effectiveon December 27, 1988. These amended rules now appear as andSection;andSection;91.1 and 91.101. Amendment No. 91-208 (54 FR 950; January 10, 1989) added a new andSection;91.26 to require that any traffic alert and collision avoidance systeminstalled in a U.S. registered civil aircraft must be approved by the Administrator,and if installed, must be on and operating during the aircraft's operation.The amendment became effective on February 9, 1989. The amendment appearsherein as andSection; 91.221. Amendment No. 91-209 (54 FR 24883; June 9, 1989) delays the effective dateof certain navigational equipment requirements of helicopter operationsin a Terminal Control Area (TCA) by the amendment of andSection; 91.91.90(c)(1).The amendment became effective on June 6, 1989. Section 91.131 covers thisamendment. Amendment No. 91-210 (54 FR 25682; June 16, 1989), effective June 16, 1989,amended andSection; 91.24(a) to allow certain aircraft operators to installnon-Mode S transponders in aircraft until July 1, 1992, instead of untilJanuary 1, 1992, provided that such transponders are manufactured priorto January 1, 1991, instead of prior to January 1, 1990. This amendmentappears as andSection; 91.215(a). References to part 91 found in other sections of the Federal Aviation Regulationshave also been amended to incorporate the revised numbering of part 91.These miscellaneous amendments are found at the end of the amendments topart 91. Furthermore, andSection;andSection; 91.615 through 91.645 as identified inNotice No. 79-2C (50 FR 11292; March 20, 1985) now appear in this finalrule as andSection;andSection; 91.503 through 91.533. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>FAA analysis indicates that these amendments will not have a significantimpact on the public or any level of government on an annual basis. Thefinal rule includes changes to clarify the existing rules by simplifyingthe language, deleting obsolete requirements, consolidating similar regulations,updating equipment requirements to reflect the state-of-the-art, and relaxingcertain operating and flight rule requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Benefits </ITAG>Section 91.117 allows reciprocating-powered aircraft to be operated inan airport traffic area at indicated airspeeds not greater than 200 knots.The FAA is unable to determine operator time and fuel cost savings becausethey will largely depend on the type of aircraft involved, desired speed,and weather and traffic conditions. The aggregate annual cost savings tothese operators will not be significant because: (1) The normal cruisespeed for most single engine reciprocating-powered aircraft does not exceed156 knots, and (2) pilots of most multiengine reciprocating-powered aircraft,while operating within an airport traffic area, will not exceed the normalaircraft cruising speed which is not significantly greater than 156 knotsin many of these aircraft. Section 91.135 provides for a 2-day advance oral notification for submittingrequests for authorizations to deviate from positive control area and routesegment requirements. The old rule required a 4-day advance written notificationof the proposed operation to ATC. A request for an authorization to deviatefrom these requirements is an infrequent occurrence. Consequently, thenew rule will have minor benefits in terms of cost savings. Sections 91.205, 91.509, and 91.511 clarify the definition of ``shore''as that area of land adjacent to the water which is above the high watermark, thereby excluding tidal flats. From a safety standpoint, a tidalarea covered with water is not as safe an emergency landing place as adry shoreline. The main benefit is improved survivability from accidentsin areas where for-hire operators may not be in compliance with the intentof the present rule. There is insufficient information in accident recordsto be able to estimate how many deaths could have been avoided throughthe use of life jackets and pyrotechnic signaling devices in these instances.<ITAG tagnum="84">Costs </ITAG>Any cost associated with defining ``shore'' in andSection; 91.205 as thehigh water line is expected to be negligible. The only parties potentiallyaffected are small for-hire operators who do not  comply with the obviousintention of the rule as presently worded. The FAA believes these operatorsare very few (probably less than 20 operators) in number. Such operatorsare likely to be traversing tidal flats in areas like Alaska. If such operatorsdo not comply with the rule as written now, then the cost of compliancewould be a maximum of about $105 per year per aircraft. This assumes a$50 cost for an approved flotation device per seat and a flotation deviceuseful life of 5 years ($10 per passenger seat per year), 10 seats peraircraft for these specific operators, plus $5 per year per aircraft fora pyrotechnic signaling device. Section 91.409 allows operators of turbine-powered rotorcraft to use alternateinspection programs such as inspections under an FAA-approved continuousairworthiness maintenance program. The operators may now schedule inspectionsin a manner that allows the highest level of utilization of their rotorcraft.The FAA estimates that in 1984 there were approximately 3,000 active turbine-poweredrotorcraft in non-air taxi use. The FAA assumes that about one-half ofthe operators of these aircraft would use the new inspection options. The value of using these options is difficult to estimate. At a minimum,the major effect of this proposed rule would be one additional day peryear of rotorcraft utility. The usefulness of this can be set at leastat the cost of capital for 1 day. Using an average aircraft value of $300,000and a use of 250 days per year, the cost of capital can be estimated at$180 per day ($300,000 at 15 percent interest divided by 250 days). Thus,the minimum benefit is approximately $0.27 million per year (half the fleet,1500 turbine-powered rotorcraft times $180). As the fleet grows, the valueof this benefit also increases. Because of the reorganization and resulting renumbering of provisions,persons who regularly refer to existing part 91 must familiarize themselveswith the new structure. It is also recognized that many non-regulatorymaterials containing references to present part 91 sections may have tobe modified. To assist in reference to the new provisions, a redesignationtable, similar to the cross-reference table published herein, will be includedin subsequent editions of the Code of Federal Regulations. The FAA believesthat any short-term costs associated with transition to the reorganizedpart 91 will be outweighed by the benefits inherent in a more logicallyorganized set of regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact </ITAG>The FAA has determined that this regulation will have no impact on internationaltrade.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 was enacted by Congress inorder to insure, among other things, that small entities are not disproportionatelyaffected by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to reviewrules which may have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.'' As discussed above, the regulatory evaluation forpart 91 indicates that there are no negative or significant economic impactsassociated with the proposed rule. All but four of the changes to part 91 are editorial or clarifying changes.Three of the four changes result only in minimal benefits being applied.The other is a change to andSection; 91.205 which, while it is basicallyclarifying, may involve some minimal cost and benefit. Any economic impactwould be minor_approximately $100 per aircraft per year and would affectonly a few small for-hire operators in Alaska who do not comply with theintent of the rule as presently worded. Thus, the change could not be construedto cause ``significant economic impact on a substantial number'' of smallentities within the meaning of the RFA. Therefore, this rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The FAA has determined that this document is not considered major underExecutive Order 12291 or significant under Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Itcauses only four minor changes, three of which will provide benefits withno additional costs to the aviation public. The fourth will impose negligiblecosts which are substantially outweighed by the benefits provided. Otheramendments provide general benefits by deleting obsolete requirements,relaxing certain operating and flight rule requirements, and updating andclarifying the text. Under the provisions of Executive Order 12291, theamendments in this final rule will not have a major economic effect onconsumers; industries; Federal, State, or local government agencies; orgeographic regions. There will be no significant effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovations, or the ability of U.S.-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or importmarkets. It is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.
