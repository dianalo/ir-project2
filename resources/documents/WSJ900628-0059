Exile organizations and personalities in Miami have rushedto take sides. The Cuban American National Foundation, whichhas the most influence in Washington, strongly backs Mr.Valladares. It's the latest brouhaha to shake thisCuban-exile capital. But, say many Cuban experts, it is muchmore important than it seems.   The emergence of Mr. Arcos could lead to a change inWashington's tough Cuban policy, dominated for years by thevoting power of nearly one million conservative Cubans, mostof them Republicans, in the key state of Florida.   At issue is whether the U.S. will back Cuba's internalopposition, as it has done in Eastern Europe, Nicaragua andChile, in a bid to bring democracy to the island, or whetherU.S. policy will continue to be dominated by exile groups.Mr. Valladares speaks for the exiles, who fear that after 30years in the anti-Castro trenches they may be left out in thecold if Cuba joins the march away from communism.   Havana's response has been mixed. First, a deputy foreignminister called the dispute a power struggle betweentraitors. But on Tuesday another top official said Cuba wasready to talk with &quot;dissidents and discontents&quot; but not withthe Miami exiles. President Bush told Hispanic journalists inWashington Tuesday that he would welcome exile talks with Mr.Castro if the exile community so desired.   For a quarter century, U.S. policy has aimed to punish theCastro regime rather than replace it, says HarvardCubanologist Jorge Dominguez. But the Castro government isgood at keeping dissent in check during hard times, he says,and despite increasing hardships, the regime isn't about tofade away.   &quot;Democracies don't happen,&quot; says Mr. Dominguez. &quot;They haveto be made.&quot;   Mr. Dominguez says the collapse of communist regimes inEastern Europe shows that dialogue between opposition andgovernment was a key factor in bringing about a democratictransition everywhere but in Romania and Bulgaria. &quot;Arcos'sstrategy isn't crazy,&quot; says Mr. Dominguez. &quot;It leads tovictory.&quot;   Carlos Alberto Montaner, an influential exile writerliving in Spain, says some Cuban exiles don't realize thatmost of the gains in Eastern Europe were obtained throughnegotiation. &quot;The same thing could happen in Cuba,&quot; he says.   Mr. Arcos's background makes him a potential mediator. Hehas credentials as a revolutionary and courageous opponent ofthe Castro government. Some exiles think he could play a keyrole in a post-Castro transition. Now dismissed by Havana asa traitor, the same epithet used by Mr. Valladares, Mr. Arcoswas Mr. Castro's companion-in-arms against dictator FulgencioBatista. After Mr. Castro's triumph, Mr. Arcos was ambassadorto Belgium but became disenchanted with the revolution andwas imprisoned, off and on, for 10 years.   Mr. Arcos's call for discussions has been backed by theinternational Christian Democratic organization. The LatinAmerican Workers' Central, a 12 million-member laborconfederation aligned internationally with the ChristianDemocratic movement, has asked Poland's Lech Walesa tonominate Mr. Arcos for the Nobel Peace Prize. Otherparliamentary groups in Latin America and Europe are alsoworking for his nomination.   Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida InternationalUniversity, says Mr. Valladares's attacks on Mr. Arcos aremore understandable when another lesson from Eastern Europeis drawn: exile communities had little to do with thecollapse of those regimes.   &quot;Groups outside of Cuba have to be jealous,&quot; says Mr.Perez. &quot;In the sense that if Arcos's project is successful,then it will exclude exile proponents of continuing Cuba'sisolation.&quot;   Emotions are running high. Recently in Miami, a bombheavily damaged a museum associated with exiles thought tofavor a dialogue with Mr. Castro. Also, radio station WQBAfired a commentator and terminated a contract with tworesearchers, all human rights advocates supporting Mr. Arcos.The three say the station gave in to political pressure,which the station strongly denies.   Mr. Perez warns that the bomb that damaged the museummight be the first of many. &quot;As a segment of the exilecommunity becomes more isolated, terrorism will increase inMiami.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
