<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0308 </DOCNO><TEXT>The processes of radiation defect formation in n-type silicon are studiedat various irradiation temperatures (T/sub irr/ = 20 to 400 /sup 0/C)during 640 MeV proton or 10 MeV electron bombardment. The results areobtained from the analysis of the temperature dependences of charge carrierconcentration in crystals irradiated at various temperatures and investigatingsamples (which are not irradiated but subjected to similar thermal treatment).It is established that production efficiencies for main radiation defects(A-, E-centres, divacancies, complexes of carbon-oxygen-divacancy) arecomplicated functions of T/sub irr/, however the form of these functionsappear to be different for the two types of irradiation used. The resultsobtained are interpreted taking into account the fact that during cascadedefect formation (in the case of proton irradiation) the effect of T/subirr/ is due to the probabilities of secondary processes (dissociationand formation of complexes) changing with temperature, while in the caseof diffusive mechanism (electron irradiation) the irradiation temperatureT/sub irr/ has also an influence on the direct annihilation of Frenkelpairs generated by irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
