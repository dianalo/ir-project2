JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush called on Thursday for quickaction in Congress to combat acid rain and for a re-examination ofoff-shore oil drilling projects in several environmentally sensitiveareas.   Bush, proposing his first budget to Congress, said he iscommitted to ending ``the long debate on acid rain'' by proposinglegislation aimed at revising the Clean Air Act to significantlyreduce industrial emissions that cause the problem. ``The time foraction has come,'' declared the president's budget summary.   ``If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude aboutthe environment. We must protect the air we breathe,'' Bush said ina nationally televised address.   In his speech, Bush touched on other environmental issues thathad been a frequent theme during his presidential campaign.   ``We must not neglect our parks. So I am asking to fund newacquisitions under the land and water conservation fund,'' he said.``We must protect our oceans ... The age of the needle on the beachmust end,'' he said, referring to hospital wastes that washed up onbeaches in the Northeast last year.   The proposed budget sks for $710 million _ nearly triple lastyear's amount _ in the next fiscal year to develop clean coaltechnology as part of the effort to deal with acid rain, whichdamages lakes and vegetation.   But Bush suggested some of the most important environmentalissues go beyond national boundaries. To solve those problems, heannounced he will convene an international conference to discusssuch issues as global warming, ocean pollution and the loss oftropical rain forests.   The budget also call for $191 million, a 43 percent increase, forresearch to examine the effects of pollutants on global warmingthrough a so-called ``greenhouse'' effect.   On off-shore oil drilling, Bush said he remains committed tocontinuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if they are``prudent and environmentally sound.''   But Bush singled out three regions _ two off the California coastand one off the southern Florida coast _ where the administrationplans to postpone lease sales pending reviews by a special taskforce that is to report to the president by Jan. 1, l990.   The action is a break from the Reagan administration which hadsought to push ahead with the controversial leases despiteobjections of environmentalists and residents of the regions.   The president said oil and gas lease sales covering 1.2 millionacres off the northern California coast, which were scheduled forlater this year, would be ``indefinitely postponed'' pending theenvironmental review, as would a lease sale off the southern Floridacoast.   The sale of leases covering another 5 million acres off thesouthern California coast, scheduled for l990, also would bereviewed.   The action on the oil leases was immediately hailed by Sen. PeteWilson, R-Calif., who said it ``demonstrates that Bush is a man ofhis word'' because he had promised review of the California leases.   Bush also promised to pursue an aggressive hazardous wastecleanup effort with increased emphasis on enforcement and actionagainst those who dump wastes illegally.   But the budget produced no additional funds for the Superfundtoxic waste cleanup program beyond the $175 million increaseoutlined in the fiscal l990 budget submitted by former PresidentReagan last month. The Superfund program would receive $1.75 billionfor the fiscal year.   The budget called, however, for sharp increases in spending bythe Energy Department for cleanup and improved operations at thedepartment's nuclear weapons plants.   Cleanup costs at the plants for fiscal l990 were placed at $401million, a 150 percent increase in spending over this year.   The Bush budget also calls for:   _ A commitment to halting ocean pollution.   _ Establishment of a ``national goal'' to maintain the country'swetlands.   _ A promise to increase research into ways to reduce the growingvolume of garbage.</TEXT></DOC>
