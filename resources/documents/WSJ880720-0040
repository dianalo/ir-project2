<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880720-0040 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Entertainment Publications Inc. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> EPUB </CO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   Entertainment Publications Inc. said that, for the second time in 10 months, a leveraged buy-out attempt had fallen through.    The publisher of discount coupon books said the management proposal &quot;has been withdrawn due to a number of factors.&quot; A spokesman declined to elaborate.    However, the Birmingham, Mich.-based company said it is considering &quot;other alternatives&quot; to &quot;maximize shareholder value&quot; while increasing management ownership of the company.    One alternative would be a &quot;leveraged recapitalization&quot; in which shareholders get a large cash payout and executives get options on more stock. The spokesman said the company hadn't decided what approach to pursue, but one securities analyst said executives told him they did plan to go ahead with the alternative plans. He said today's announcement should be viewed as a shift in strategy, rather than a decision to drop the buy-out completely.    In May, Entertainment Publications said its managment, assisted by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., would take the company private for $23 a share, or $110 million, in cash and stock. Last fall, the company received a similar proposal valued at $26 a share, or $129 million, but that fell apart after the stock market crash.    Entertainment Publications closed yesterday at $19.50, down $1.50, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
