The genetic probe detects a cancer-causing gene that has been activated to cause chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer that afflicts about 20,000 people and strikes 5,000 new patients each year.    The new test is the first genetic probe for cancer to reach the market. It is a predecessor of what may become a broad range of tests for genes that either cause cancer or predispose a person to developing cancer in the future. </TEXT></DOC>
