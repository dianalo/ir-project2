Sacks of sugar. Bayonets. Submachine guns. Hand grenades. &quot;These just in from Iran,&quot; he says, proudly handing his visitor a plump, green explosive. &quot;For you I make a special deal.&quot;    Trading in weapons large and small is part of everyday commerce in North Yemen, a rugged, underdeveloped country at the base of the Arabian Peninsula. In desert and mountain areas, everything from a Turkish musket to a mortar can be purchased over the counter, sometimes at an open-air bazaar, or &quot;souk.&quot;    A Soviet-designed Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle, the weapon of choice in rural Yemen, sells for as little as $750 -- subject to haggling. Some tribal leaders supplement their arsenals with bazookas, rockets and tanks. And for men throughout the country, a nine-inch dagger, or &quot;jambiya,&quot; is an essential accessory.    &quot;A Yemeni without his gun and jambiya is like a man with no clothes,&quot; says Monsoor al-Maghripi, a government worker in the northern town of Saada who wears Western dress to his office and a robe with a dagger strapped to his waist in the evening.    The arms aren't just for show. Asked whether his gun is loaded, a 13-year-old goatherd shrugs and empties his AK-47 into an abandoned roadside hut.    Mr. al-Maghripi has witnessed several shoot-outs in the four years since he came to Saada, which may be Yemen's answer to Dodge City. One involved a passenger in his car, who returned fire from another vehicle in a gun battle that eventually claimed six lives. &quot;I think this is too much,&quot; says Mr. al-Maghripi, who, unlike his passenger, survived the exchange.    Too much for him perhaps, but for many Yemenis it just means another shopping trip to resupply ammunition. Despite a quiet government campaign to control the flow of arms from the East bloc and elsewhere, weapons are readily available throughout the country's north and east.    At al-Harf, a man peddles machine guns and mortars from the first floor of his mud-brick home. In the village of Huth, hand grenades sell like tomatoes at the weekly market. Khamir's weapons shop, just off the souk, is the most convenient of all, with Kalashnikovs and Belgian FN assault rifles visible from the street. And at Raydah, revolvers are displayed on the toiletries shelf of a small grocery between the hair tonic and air freshener.    &quot;For grenades you must go to the auto-parts store, four doors down,&quot; says the proprietor, who also sells three types of machine gun.    As part of the government's continuing gun-control drive, a weapons souk in the Saada region, once considered the Sears Roebuck of armaments, was closed. Shoppers browsed for grenades and machine guns at the souk in the village of al-Tahl, which also is known for its handwoven baskets. Heavy artillery -- and according to some sources, tanks -- could have been ordered a week in advance.    But steps to limit the supply apparently haven't dented the demand for weapons, particularly in the north, where scattered tribes have always governed themselves. Living in distant stone and mud villages ruled by local sheiks, these independent-minded farmers have often opposed central governments based in cities to the south. Sacking the city of Sanaa, now the capital, was a favored means of political expression as recently as 1948. In 1860, one Sanaa governor became so weary of the attacks that he closed the northern gate of the mud-walled city, declaring: &quot;Nothing but evil comes through here.&quot;    Urban living has become less precarious in recent decades -- visiting tribesmen now are asked to check their guns at military roadblocks outside major towns -- but arms control remains tenuous in more rural areas, where 80% of Yemenis live.    Alfred Hubschen still turns a little pale when he talks about Sheik Two Fingers of Wadi Habab, in the central highlands. Last year, the German-born engineer was building an oil pipeline through some of Yemen's toughest terrain. About 10 miles of pipe traversed the lands of Sheik Hantash, who is said to have gained his nickname after tossing a grenade a little too slowly at an enemy tribesman.    The sheik, who has been spotted with a dozen retainers toting machine guns, wasn't interested in any agreements between the government and pipeline contractors. &quot;He would just say, 'Government? What government? I'm the government here,'&quot; recalls Mr. Hubschen.    To get the pipeline through, the contractors eventually agreed to build roads, fix rock terraces and construct fences all over the sheik's domain.    Sheik Two Fingers is believed to command a private army of 500. This is modest by Yemen's standards. Defense analysts say that one sheik in the north can call on as many as 30,000 men. Yemen's official armed forces number about 37,000.    Fortunately for the government, most of the tribes' arsenals are aimed at each other. Some tribal boundaries are better defined than Yemen's own borders, and squabbles over land and water rights are common.    Westerners who have lived in remote areas, however, say that most disputes end with negotiations rather than gunfire. &quot;A sheep is slaughtered, some money is paid,&quot; says Jeffrey Meissner, an anthropologist and director of the American Institute for Yemeni Studies. If violence does occur, he says, a designated &quot;wound assessor&quot; judges the severity of injuries and calculates &quot;blood money&quot; accordingly. &quot;I feel safer here than in New York,&quot; Mr. Meissner adds. &quot;With everyone armed to the teeth, people have to be restrained.&quot;    This theory of mutually assured destruction doesn't always deter fighting. Doctors at Saada's al-Salaam (Peace) Hospital treat two to three gunshot cases a week and almost as many jambiya wounds. One feud even spilled into the hospital parking lot when a clan tried to take revenge as rival tribesmen carried their wounded to the emergency room.    All this made U.S. Secret Service agents feel somewhat underdressed when they accompanied Vice President George Bush on a 1986 visit to Yemen, officially named the Yemen Arab Republic. &quot;Let's just say they were a little nervous,&quot; says a Pentagon official.    After all, adds a Western diplomat in Sanaa, &quot;the last two presidents {of Yemen} weren't so fortunate in their retirement programs.&quot; One was shot in a coup in October 1977. His successor died eight months later when a bomb exploded in his office. The current president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, packs a pistol under his business suit and has survived several assassination attempts during his more than nine years in office.    But Westerners working in Yemen say they eventually get used to seeing men loading shopping bags with grenades or popping bottle tops with machine-gun barrels. &quot;They carry a gun like we carry a wallet,&quot; says E. Anthony Copp, a corporate finance executive with Hunt Consolidated Inc., a Dallas-based oil company. &quot;It adds to the charm of the place.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
