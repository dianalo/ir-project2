Here is how lunch goes in the storefront office of the Kentucky Right-to-Life Association:    Michael Logsdon, a nurse's assistant, talks about how his peace-oriented innercity church is working against U.S. military involvement in Central America, while Frank Simon, an allergist, argues for military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, so they &quot;can defend themselves and push Communists into the sea.&quot;    Diane Monahan, a physical therapist, declares that eliminating the death penalty is a logical extension of the &quot;pro-life&quot; movement, while James Howland, a church janitor and lay minister, argues that murderers forfeit their own right to life. And Kaye Myers, a bank auditor, challenges the view of Cecilia Lawrence, who has 15 children, that men should work and married women should stay home with the children.    &quot;The man is the warrior and provider,&quot; says Mrs. Lawrence.    Rejoins Ms. Myers, who has two children: &quot;I haven't needed to be defended recently from anything outside the cave.&quot;    Like millions across the country, these activists who gathered in Louisville the other day for pizza and salad, have come together on a single issue. But often the people fighting abortion fight themselves.    &quot;There's a good reason these people don't take a position on much but abortion,&quot; says Glen Halva-Neubauer, a political scientist at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., who specializes in the politics of abortion. &quot;They don't agree on anything else.&quot;    The unusual coalition began to form 16 years ago, when the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade recognized a right to abortion. Since the current court this summer opened the way for states to restrict abortion, the anti-abortion movement has been pressing lawmakers in statehouses across the nation to enact laws that discourage or prohibit the deliberate termination of pregnancies. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the movement isn't monolithic and that it defies easy stereotyping.    &quot;The opposition tries to portray us as conservatives who belong to the National Rifle Association, want the death penalty, want to keep women down and pray all the time,&quot; says Anna Sullivan, president of the Rhode Island Right-to-Life Committee. Her own view, however, is that &quot;it's the most unusual group of allies imaginable.&quot;    This is a movement whose elements include civic leaders and people who bomb abortion clinics. There are Catholics and evangelical Protestants. There are pacifists and people who want military action against communism. Some anti-abortionists are as passionate about protecting animal rights as they are about protecting the unborn.    &quot;This is exemplary of single-issue politics,&quot; says Faye Ginsburg, a New York University anthropologist who has studied organized opponents of abortion. &quot;These groups don't want to publicly renounce each other because they need each other's help. But there is enormous uneasiness within this coalition.&quot;    Right now, the movement is trying to play down internal disagreement and to mobilize forces for state legislative battles in the fall and for critical gubernatorial elections next year. &quot;We have differences -- real differences,&quot; says Court Wiedenmayer, chapter development director for the National Right to Life Committee in California. &quot;But we put them aside. We agree on protecting life -- and that life is the most important issue.&quot;    A consequence of the strains: The anti-abortion movement has little chance of becoming a broader political force. &quot;This is not a normal political movement, and it can survive only as long as the issue is alive,&quot; says Thomas Mann, the director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &quot;There is nothing to hold them together once the issue is taken off the agenda. When it is, the movement will wither and die.&quot;    Both houses of the Kentucky legislature, which is to meet in Frankfort in January, are considered to be in the anti-abortion camp, and Democratic Gov. Wallace Wilkinson says he supports new, restrictive legislation. But even as they gird themselves for these battles, the people around the lunch table in a Louisville neighborhood called St. Matthews -- like other activists across the country -- aren't at all comfortable with some of the things their own allies believe.    &quot;There are people I had a revulsion to,&quot; says Paulette Joyer, a Minneapolis lawyer prominent in the Feminists for Life group. &quot;But for my own mental health, I had to train myself to concentrate on this issue, not on others that we had so many disagreements over.&quot;    Some Protestant fundamentalists, for example, are troubled that groups such as Operation Rescue, which blockades abortion clinics, make a street brawl of a dispute over morality. Feminists find that their other views almost always clash with those of conservatives. And New Right advocates who support a defense buildup and an activist foreign policy are uncomfortable with the pacifists.    &quot;I'm almost always working with people I disagree with,&quot; says John Cavanaugh O'Keefe, a Laytonsville, Md., pacifist who edits a newsletter about Third World children and who says he sees a connection between abortion and violence. He acknowledges that at first he resisted the movement because, as he puts it, &quot;I was too much of a snob to associate with right-wing, up-tight reactionaries.&quot;    &quot;My concern is that some of the pacifists are into this movement to co-opt it,&quot; says Howard Deaver, an insurance claims manager from Omaha and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association who says that a few years ago he became outraged at what he considers the taking of innocent life. &quot;They're more interested in disarming the U.S. and providing a safe place for world socialism and saving the whales. I object to drawing a parallel between saving babies and protecting animals.&quot;    Although liberal abortion laws date to the 1960s, anti-abortion activists operated in relative obscurity until the Supreme Court, by identifying a right to abortion in Roe vs. Wade, transformed an interest group into a movement. &quot;Without that rallying point, they'd never be where they are now,&quot; says Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. &quot;The court created the pro-life movement as we know it.&quot;    Opponents of abortion provided critical support to Ronald Reagan in his campaign for the GOP nomination in 1980. With his judicial appointments, President Reagan paved the way for this summer's Supreme Court decision giving states room to restrict abortion. Meanwhile, the movement, with help from the Catholic Church and evangelicals, but predominantly from relentless grass-roots organizing, grew slowly but steadily.    &quot;They've had a fervor they've been able to maintain and even pass to a second generation,&quot; says Linda DiVall, a Republican political consultant. &quot;A lot of splinter coalitions break apart, but they've been able to maintain a fever pitch for 16 years.&quot;    Some students of the phenomenon have concluded that members of the anti-abortion coalition share a broad, coherent world view. &quot;These people believe that . . . the purpose of sexuality is to be procreative,&quot; says Kristin Luker, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley.    In recent years, however, the strains within the movement have become rather pronounced. The most overt dispute is less philosophical than tactical. The ascension of activists who are impatient with the movement's failure to make progress in traditional political forums and who are willing to take their efforts beyond marches and organizing has created enormous tensions.    &quot;People who will not even acknowledge that there's another facet to the pro-life movement, who won't leave room for activism, are wimpy,&quot; says Joseph Scheidler, who heads the Pro Life Action League in Chicago and who has been arrested a dozen times. &quot;No social movement goes anywhere without conflict and confrontation, some sort of 'barricade action' that draws in recruits.&quot;    Randall Terry, who heads Operation Rescue, believes the problem with the movement &quot;is that it has tried to be too respectable.&quot; In a telephone interview from the Fulton County Prison (after being arrested in an anti-abortion protest), Mr. Terry argues that the abortion battle &quot;isn't a political debate like an argument over the minimum wage,&quot; adding: &quot;It's murder, life and death, broken bodies. If there's no passion in the people who fight it, how do they expect to convince anyone?&quot;    A frequent object of this derision is the National Right to Life Committee, the moderate, methodical but highly successful group with 50 state affiliates and 3,000 chapters across the country.    &quot;We made a decision to work within the law to change the law,&quot; says David O'Steen, the executive director of the group. &quot;We want to make a difference, not a statement. We're not into hysteria.&quot;    Other disputes go just as deep. A significant splinter of the movement, for example, believes that the &quot;pro-life ethos&quot; is a &quot;seamless garment,&quot; espousing nonviolence rather than peace through strength and opposing the death penalty.    &quot;I argue that the term 'pro-life' is broader than just abortion,&quot; says Mr. Logsdon, the Louisville nurse's assistant. &quot;A lot of pro-life people are peeved about that. The movement can't be around one issue.&quot;    But every time the movement tries to reach much beyond abortion, disputes break out over just what &quot;pro-life&quot; means. &quot;Pick a subject, any subject,&quot; says Ms. Myers, &quot;and we'll disagree -- except on abortion.&quot;    The result is that when Ms. Myers, a feminist, sits down with her allies in the abortion fight, she is &quot;sitting at a table next to the people I'd been challenging politically all of my life.&quot;    She fumes when she hears Mrs. Lawrence say that the Equal Rights Amendment &quot;stands for destroying the family, the basic structure of society.&quot; And when Albert Arbogast, the former president of the Kentucky Right-to-Life Association, asserts that &quot;the state gets its authority from God to conduct capital punishment,&quot; Ms. Myers blurts out: &quot;I'm scared to death of people who say the state acts as God.&quot;    But the internal disagreements -- and the arguments at lunch here -- are only part of the agonies of such activists. Sometimes accommodation, though painful, is necessary. A longtime supporter of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and political opponent of President Reagan, Ms. Myers felt the strain last November. But with a choice to make, she voted for George Bush. &quot;I've become a single-issue voter,&quot; she says.    ---@ The Abortion Fight @ Milestones in the dispute over abortion:    1967: Colorado passes first law legalizing abortion. Modeled on a recommendation by the American Law Institute, it permits abortion, with restrictions, in cases where there would be grave impairment to the mother's physical or mental health, severe fetal defects or in cases of rape and incest.    1970: New York legalizes abortion through 24th week of a pregnancy.    1973: Supreme Court, in Roe vs. Wade, recognizes a right to abortion. The decision gives impetus to the anti-abortion movement.    1977: Hyde amendment goes into effect, cutting off Medicaid for abortions.    1980: Supreme Court, in Harris vs. McRae, Upholds Hyde amendment.    1981: Ronald Reagan, with a vigorous anti-abortion position, becomes president.    1982: Anti-abortion constitutional amendment is withdrawn from Senate consideration and legislative attempt to criminalize abortion by statute is defeated in Senate.    1983: Supreme Court, in Akron case, throws out city restrictions on abortion. But new Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissent, says that Roe's framework &quot;is on a collision course with itself.&quot;    1985: Abortion debate takes on a higher emotional tint with &quot;The Silent Scream,&quot; a video showing an abortion.    1988: Confirmation of Anthony Kennedy gives anti-abortion forces hope they have a majority on the Supreme Court.    1989: Supreme Court, in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, permits states to regulate abortion. </TEXT></DOC>
