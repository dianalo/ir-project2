It is shownthat redox reaction proceeds between dirhenium (3) bromoformate complexesand Et/sub 3/Al, that is followed by splitting of Re/sub R/e bond indirhenium complex and formation of stable one-dimensional paramagneticcomplex characterized by S=1/2 spin. It is supposed that paramagneticcomplex represents a Re(O) complex with square-pyramidal configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
