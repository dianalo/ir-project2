(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer ``vaccine'' that would blockthe invasion of a computer virus like the one that swept the nationthis week is under development by scientists at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory.   Los Alamos' computer security officer Jimmy McClary said two mainefforts are under way to guard against future viral attacks, both``using computers more to get to people who are attackingcomputers.''   ``The first is to use computers to guard computers againstviruses _ enhanced intrusion detection techniques that let you lookfor unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computersystem,'' he said Friday.   ``The other approach ... is to develop anti-viral code _vaccines, if you like, to carry the analogy further _ that amount toself-examining code, so the code itself will know if someone makesan unauthorized change to it.''   Computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenientfor researchers at universities and research centers, but did noknown permanent damage and did not enter classified computers.   The New York Times reported today that the virus was created byRobert T. Morris Jr., 23, a Cornell University graduate student.   Morris' father, chief scientist of the National Security Agency'sNational Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., said the viruscould ``make people more careful and more attentive tovulnerabilities in the future.''   The younger Morris could not be reached for comment.   McClary said scientists at Los Alamos, a federal nuclear weaponsresearch center, were able to identify the virus and cleanse it fromthe lab's system.   ``The most useful aspect of these sort of events is that theyoccur in an unclassified, non-sensitive environment that lets uslook at the techniques used to introduce these viruses,'' saidMcClary.   The virus infiltrated the Defense Department network that linkscomputers at scientific laboratories nationwide, infecting LosAlamos, its sister Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory inCalifornia, and numerous other government and private researchcenters.   ``This is the largest-scale virus attack that I have seen thatwas distributed across the country,'' McClary said.   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs bymodifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from onecomputer to another and alter or destroy data. This virus did itsdamage by making repeated copies of itself, slowing computerprocessing and eating up computer memory space.   Viruses usually are communicated by data transmission over phonelines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into acomputer.   McClary said scientists working at remote terminals, all usingthe Unix operating system, began experiencing delays in gainingaccess to their research data late Wednesday. He said he believesthe first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered thecomputers.   Thursday morning, laboratory scientists disconnected the accessroute of the virus, the electronic mail system by which scientificdata is transmitted among research institutions, he said.   Later that morning, the U.S. Department of Energy informed thelab the computer virus existed.   Los Alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus codeto determine its source, McClary said.   ``What they'll have to do is follow each path that they're ableto pick up at some point and go back along that path,'' he said.``Generally, you can trace back. We don't know yet enough about thisone. This one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself.''</TEXT></DOC>
