Tanks with their guns fixed and armored personnel carriers blockintersections.   Young soldiers clutching Kalashnikov rifles in one hand andplastic prayer beads in the other patrol the streets and stand guardon rooftops.   Helicopter gunships chug along the snow-covered mountains linedwith radar installations.   The Moslem guerrillas battling the forces of Afghanistan'sSoviet-style government are hiding beyond the ridges that form abowl around Kabul, the capital city of 2.25 million. Theyperiodically launch a few rockets into the capital.   There's little feeling of imminent danger in the marketplaces,where merchants wrapped in tattered brown shawls and dingy whiteturbans sit cross-legged on the ground in front of huge piles offruits and vegetables.   But rumor and speculation are as plentiful now as Russian caviarand vodka were before the Soviet army pulled out last month.   ``It's the weather. They (the guerrillas) are waiting forspring,'' said one vendor, Zahir.   ``It's the shura,'' added another, Ibrahim, referring to aguerrilla meeting in Pakistan and suggesting the fighters are toopreoccupied setting up a government-in-exile to launch majorassaults.   Moscow pulled out the last of its 115,000 troops and ended itsnine-year military involvement in Afghanistan on Feb. 15, leavingthe Afghan forces alone to battle the U.S.-backed guerrillas.   The departure of the last Soviet soldier passed without muchnotice in Afghanistan. Most people seemed more concerned about foodshortages and the lack of fuel to heat their mud brick homes on thefreezing winter nights.   There were no official ceremonies and only the barestacknowledgment by the Kabul government of the Kremlin's involvementin a war that killed 13,000 Soviet soldiers.   The Soviets have worked tenaciously to ensure that a friendlygovernment remains in power in Kabul, and they have backed severalineffective measures aimed at drawing the rebels into a coalitiongovernment.   President Najib outlined what he called a government of nationalreconciliation, urging unity with the guerrillas who have battledthe Kabul regime since a few party members engineered an April 1978coup and began trying to radically alter the economic, social,political and religious life of Afghanistan.   The guerrillas rejected Najib's peace overtures and vowed todestroy his government.   The president has in turn tightened his grip on power.   He declared a state of emergency and suspended many individualrights. He purged his Cabinet of some members who were not from hisPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, replacing them with hismost trusted advisers. And he placed the fate of the country in thehands of a 21-member military council.   The government said the actions did not close the door tonegotiations with the guerrillas.   ``We have to move more cautiously now than ever. But we stillwant negotiations. We want a rainbow coalition that represents allsegments of Afghan society,'' said Abdul Fatah Weidi, the ForeignMinistry's information chief.   Some diplomats and observers believe the guerrillas may be on thethreshold of power.   But bitter divisions among the guerrilla factions are evident,with some supporting establishment of a strict Islamic republic andothers supporting a more broadbased government.   Many observers believe a power struggle similar to that which hasplagued Najib's party could break out among the guerrillas.   Pressure has been increasing for policymakers from Westerncountries to help mold the guerrillas into a more responsible,coherent group. But observers in Kabul doubt it will happen.   ``Outside interference in Afghanistan has historically been adisaster _ both for the Afghans and for the outside powers. TheRussians ignored this reality,'' said one U.N. official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Afghanistan was one of the world's poorest countries before civilwar erupted 10 years ago. Relief officials say it will take yearsand billions of dollars just to restore it to its prewar state.   They estimate they will need $1.6 billion for the first 18 months.   The country has the world's lowest average life expectancy _ 42years _ and the highest child mortality rate _ 30 percent of allchildren die before the age of 5, according to UNICEF.   Late last year, a U.N. convoy carrying wheat seeds and fertilizertook off from Kabul for the guerrilla-controlled Panjsher Valley,where thousands of farmers hoped to begin planting for the firsttime in 10 years.   It was the first such international effort and was a major testof whether the country was stable enough to begin rehabilitationwork.   Several hours outside Kabul, the convoy was hijacked by a rivalguerrilla group. Several U.N. staff members were taken hostage.   Afghan and Soviet troops responded with tanks, artillery and airbombardments.   No was was injured, and the workers were released after fourdays. But any illusions relief workers might have had about a quickand easy end to the suffering were shattered.   ``We were anxious to do some real rehabilitation work,'' saidRoss Mountain, deputy director of the U.N. Development Program.   ``But we learned the hard way that there are many, many differentgroups out there. It looks like things will have to shake down somemore,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
