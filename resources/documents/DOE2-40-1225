One of these incentives lies in writeoffs of capital costsavailable under Class 34 of the Income Tax Act, and the other in researchand development credits and deductions available for activities at earlierstages. Despite the fact that these are valuable incentives, the Canadianwind power industry is not using them to any great extent. The reasonswhy Class 34 is sparsely used are discussed. The most critical reasonis a lack of agressiveness on the part of the industry in going afterthis benefit, which is economically equivalent to a cash grant of 40-45cents on the dollar against the cost of a wind installation. The researchand development tax credits and deductions have an even larger equivalentbenefit, but the delaying and obscuring of access to opinions on thetechnical qualification of projects under Revenue Canada's rules, andthe low credibility of research and development programs in the investmentcommunity, create barriers to use of these incentives by the industry.The paper also discusses the impact of tax reform on the wind power industry.One aspect of the reform is that it has restricted tax incentives toessentially just the two previousy mentioned. A negative effect of thereform is that, in reducing tax rates, the attractiveness of tax deductionsfor investors has also been reduced. Two technical changes proposed intax reform will also have an impact: issue costs will no longer be deductibleimmediately, but will be spread over 5 years; and the timing of the acquisitionof capital properties has been changed.</TEXT></DOC>
