As for their fading numbers, it's an old story that was repeatedagain last year when an estimated 240,000 people left the land,dropping the nation's farm population to the lowest level sincebefore the Civil War.   Officials said an average of 4,986,000 people _ one out of every49 Americans _ lived on farms in 1987, representing 2 percent ofthe U.S. population of 243.4 million.   That compared with 5,226,000 farm residents in 1986, which was2.2 percent of the national population of 241.1 million.   The figures were derived from an annual survey by the CensusBureau that was released jointly on Tuesday with the AgricultureDepartment. A preliminary report was issued on Feb. 8.   Although the 1987 farm population estimate was down by 240,000people, the report said that represented ``no statisticallysignificant change'' from 1986. The one-year decline would have hadto have been at least 275,000 for it be statistically significant,the report said.   From 1981 through 1987, the farm population declined an averageof 2.5 percent annually, the report said. In the previous decade,the annual decline averaged 2.9 percent.   The report said the 1920 census is regarded as the beginning ofthe government's official nose count of the farm population,although estimates go back much earlier.   In one table, for example, figures on the number of Americans in``farm occupations'' go back to 1820, when farm people werereported at less than 2.1 million, making up about 72 percent ofthe U.S. work force of 2.9 million.   By 1850, there were 4.9 million farm people, representing about64 percent of the nation's 7.7 million workers.   The farm population in 1920, when the official census databegan, was nearly 32 million, or 30.2 percent of the U.S.population of 105.7 million, the report showed.   According to USDA estimates going back to 1910, however, thefarm population peaked at 32.5 million people in 1916 during WorldWar I, making up 32 percent of the population of 101.6 million.   Despite a general downward trend since World War I, the farmpopulation has had a few short-lived surges, including one duringthe Great Depression when it grew to 31.2 million in 1933,comprising 24.9 percent of the U.S. population of 125.4 millionthat year.   Another slight bulge appeared in 1983 as thousands shifted fromcity living to the countryside, raising the farm population to morethan 7 million from 6.88 million in 1982.   Some other observations included in the 1987 farm populationreport:   _Half of the total farm population lives in the Midwest. TheSouth has 29 percent; the West, 15 percent; and the Northeast, 6percent. Officials said reliable state and local farm popuationfigures were not available.   At midcentury, about a third of all farm people lived in theMidwest, while slightly more than half were in the South. A rapiddecline of the South's farm population, rather than any growth inthe Midwest, led to the shift.   _As compared with the non-farm population, the farm populationhas a higher proportion of whites, 97 percent. Blacks are 2.5percent of the farm population and ``other'' races, 0.6 percent.Those are approximate figures. Hispanics, who may be of any race,made up 2.7 percent of the farm population, the report said.   Comparatively, the U.S. non-farm population last year was 84.4percent white, 12.3 percent black, and 3.3 percent other races, theCensus Bureau said. Hispanics comprised 8.1 percent.   _The median age of farm residents was 37.6 years in 1987, which``is significantly higher'' than the non-farm median of 32 years.The median age is that from which half of the people are older andhalf are younger.   ``In the 1920 census, when data on the farm population werefirst collected, their median age was 20.7 years, lower than themedians for the rural total and the urban population,'' the reportsaid.   _Last year, there were 109 males per 100 females living onfarms, compared with just 93 males per 100 females in the non-farmpopulation. In 1920, the farm ratio was the same, while thenon-farm ratio was 102 males per 100 females.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A major association of country banks says itsupports drought-aid legislation in Congress that would pour up to$7 billion into stricken areas to help farmers recover from cropand livestock losses.   The Independent Bankers Association of America, which says thathalf its members are agricultural banks, sent letters to members ofthe Senate and House agricultural committees in support of billsawaiting final action when Congress returns to work on July 26.   A version approved by the Senate committee would providepayments of up to $100,000 to drought-stricken farmers. PresidentReagan has indicated he would sign such legislation.   Association president-elect O. Jay Tomson, Charles City, Iowa,said Tuesday a special committee concluded that ``the legislationdeserves our full support and prompt enactment.''   Basically, the legislation would replace a major portion of theincome lost by crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought byreallocating money that would otherwise have gone to farmers as``deficiency'' payments to compensate them for low commodity prices.   Drought has cut production and forced up prices, meaning thepayments will be less. Thus, the ``savings'' would be used tofinance the drought benefits.   In addition, livestock, dairy and poultry producers would beprovided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and helpthem keep their foundation stock.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Milk production may not increase this year asmuch as forecast earlier, the Agriculture Department says in a newoutlook report.   ``For all of 1988, milk production probably will total about 1percent more than 1987's 142.5 billion pounds,'' the department'sEconomic Research Service said Tuesday.   Earlier, the agency said the increase could be in the range of 1percent to 3 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
