The companies said they entered into a definitive mergeragreement under which Mips's shareholders will receiveSilicon Graphics stock. Silicon Graphics will be thesurviving entity of the merger, which is expected to becompleted in June. The agreement, which took most industrywatchers by surprise, wasn't well received by Wall Street,where Silicon Graphics shares fell 18%.</LP><TEXT>   The merger proposal follows growing worries among computermakers using Mips-designed chips that Mips's recent financialtroubles would affect its ability to turn out new innovationsof its chips. Mips had net losses in three of the past fivequarters.   Those worries were compounded earlier this year whenDigital Equipment Corp., a big Mips-chip user and owner of 5%of Mips's stock, unveiled a chip that may eventually competewith Mips chips. Adding to the clouds over Mips were severaldefections from Mips chips and nagging questions aboutwhether an alliance of computer companies that planned acomputer standard centered on Mips chips, called the AdvancedComputer Environment, would stick together.   &quot;There's no secret that Mips's financial performance wasspotty,&quot; said Edward McCracken, chief executive officer ofSilicon Graphics. The merger provides &quot;a stable financialplatform from which an architecture can operate.&quot;   Bringing stability to Mips is crucial for SiliconGraphics, which uses Mips chips in all of its workstations.Indeed, Mips's chief executive officer, Robert Miller, saidthe merger was necessary to give Mips the money it needed tokeep developing new chips. Mips has been spending about 20%of revenue on research and development, he said, far morethan the industry average of 12% and too high a level tomaintain as an independent company.   &quot;This is a marriage born of necessity,&quot; said DavidBurdick, an analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market-researchfirm.   The merger is at least a partial defeat for Mips and forMr. Miller, Mips's chief executive since 1987, when he joinedthe company from Data General Corp. Mips, like SiliconGraphics, grew out of work at Stanford University in theearly 1980s on a new chip technology calledreduced-instruction-set computing, or Risc. After Mipslanguished for several years, Mr. Miller joined it and beganturning the company around, taking it public with muchfanfare from Wall Street in December 1989.   Mips, which designs processor chips that become the&quot;brains&quot; of computers, was seen as proof that anentrepreneurial startup could still play with the big boys inthe computer market. Mips grew rapidly and today has a 35%share of the market for Risc microprocessors in computers,according to Dataquest. But recent financial troubles anddelays in introducing new chips plague the Sunnyvale, Calif.,company, whose stock closed at $11 Tuesday, down from a highof $27.75 three months after its public offering. Mips'sshares yesterday closed at $13.50, up $2.50, in nationalover-the-counter trading.   &quot;It's a sad thing in a certain way,&quot; said WillemRoelandts, a Hewlett-Packard Co. vice president who overseesthat company's workstation business. &quot;This was the highflierof a couple of years ago. It proves again that it's tough toremain at the top. The stakes in the Risc-development raceare so high (that) small companies just don't have theresources to do so.&quot;   Indeed, the merger makes Silicon Graphics look a lot morelike its bigger competitors, including H-P, Sun MicrosystemsInc., International Business Machines Corp. and others.Silicon Graphics has grown rapidly because of its expertisein three-dimensional graphics and software but is still adistant sixth in market share in workstations, according toDataquest. Meanwhile, each of the top five workstation makershas its own in-house Risc chip, while Silicon Graphicsdidn't.   The ultimate benefit of bringing Mips architecturein-house, said Mr. McCracken, is that it makes the chip amore viable alternative to Intel Corp.'s chips, whichdominate the huge market for personal computers. &quot;We like toview this as directly competitive to Intel's microprocessoractivity, rather than to H-P or Sun,&quot; he said.   That might be a conflict for Mips chip users, who willdepend on Silicon Graphics, now a competitor, to give themnew innovations they need in chips. While companies such asLSI Logic Corp. and Japan's NEC Corp. will keep makingMips-designed chips, companies such as Compaq Computer Corp.and Sony Corp. that use the chips must depend on SiliconGraphics for new versions.   &quot;I don't believe small systems companies like SGI shouldbe in this business, trying to be suppliers of both chiparchitectures and systems,&quot; said Vicki Brown, an analyst atInternational Data Corp., a market-research firm.   To waylay such fears, the merger calls for the formationof a subsidiary, Mips Technologies Inc., that will deal withMips's chip customers and the companies that make Mips chips.Mr. Miller, who will become the chief executive of thesubsidiary, said the separation of the chip technology fromthe parent company will ensure it is independent.   The deal calls for Mips stockholders to receive 0.61Silicon Graphics share for each of Mips's 25 million sharesoutstanding, giving former Mips shareholders a 23.5% interestin Silicon Graphics. Silicon Graphics said it must issuebetween 3.9 million and 5.4 million new shares or equivalentconvertible securities to complete the deal. Kubota Corp., aJapanese tractor maker that has invested in several Americanhigh-technology companies, currently has a 16.2% stake inMips. A Kubota spokesman said the company had no comment onthe merger.   Wall Street wasn't so optimistic. While Mr. McCracken saidthe merger would actually increase earnings per share,analysts said it probably would be dilutive. As a result,many took Silicon Graphics off their &quot;buy&quot; lists, and thestock plummeted $4.75 to $21.875 in New York Stock Exchangetrading yesterday.   Mr. McCracken said Silicon Graphics &quot;is willing to takesteps to make this antidilutive through 1993.&quot; While theMountain View, Calif., company will take a charge in thequarter ending June 30 to cover the merger, most of Mips's700 employees will be hired into Silicon Graphics' rapidlygrowing work force, he said, and growth from SiliconGraphics' workstation lines will counterbalance Mips'smoney-losing computer lines.</TEXT></DOC>
