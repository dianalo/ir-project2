In a proposed deal to revive First Mutual Bank forSavings, a Boston bank with $1.2 billion in assets,regulators are discussing a combination of capital from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. with an investment from agroup led by Boston leveraged buy-out investor Thomas H. Lee,according to people close to the negotiations.</LP><TEXT>   The federal government tried such capital infusions --called open bank assistance, because they are designed tokeep troubled banks open -- in Texas in the 1980s. But thepolicy is controversial because many recipients of assistancefailed anyway, at a higher cost to the government than ifthey had been allowed to fail in the first place.   Nonetheless, FDIC Chairman William Seidman recently hassuggested a marriage of public and private capital as a wayto assist some New England banks before their conditiondeteriorates too much. Among other proposals, New Hampshireofficials and federal regulators have discussed the idea ofusing combinations of public and private capital to save somebanks in the state and help others merge. The goal is to finda way to avoid bank closings in the region that would disruptthe already weakened economy.   For First Mutual, which like other New England banks hasbeen weakened by problem real estate loans, a public-privatecapital infusion would increase its chances of survival.   As of Sept. 30, First Mutual had capital of $33.8 million,or 2.8% of assets. Fourth-quarter results aren't yetavailable, but any loss for the period would have reduced itscapital further. Healthy institutions have capital levels of5% or more. Although the specifics haven't been decided andthere isn't any guarantee that a deal will be completed, anyagreement likely would involve roughly equal amounts of newprivate and public capital.   &quot;The discussions are evolving and we've not yet filed anopen bank application with the FDIC,&quot; said First MutualPresident Gerald Mulligan, a former Massachusetts bankingcommissioner. He noted that, in addition to Mr. Lee's group,another investor group is also in discussions with the bank.   In Texas and elsewhere, the federal government providedopen bank assistance to many savings and loan associationsand a few banks, sometimes with but usually without a privatecapital infusion. But many institutions propped up withfederal money ended up failing, costing the government boththe initial capital infusion and the expenses of taking overthe banks.   The FDIC was involved in the 1980s in about a dozen openbank assistance programs for banks of $1 billion or more inassets. Though most didn't involve private capital, severalthat did ended up with the banks failing. For instance, aninfusion in 1987 of $150 million in public capital and $50million in private capital in BancTexas Group Inc., aDallas-based bank, ended with the bank failing anyway.   &quot;In most of the failures, it was either the problems ofthe banks or the economy they were operating in turning outto be worse than we anticipated,&quot; said Roger Watson, directorof research for the FDIC. &quot;Are there any guarantees thatwon't happen in New England? No.&quot;   Despite the earlier problems, regulators are willing totry open assistance in New England because they need privatecapital. &quot;With the situation in New England and the FDIC's{deposit insurance} fund depleted, the FDIC needs freshprivate capital rushed in,&quot; said Christie Sciacca, managingdirector of the Secura Group, a Washington-based bankconsulting firm.   One obstacle to public-private capital infusions, an FDICofficial said, is that &quot;many investors are just unrealistic,wanting us to put in 90% of the needed capital while they putin 10%. I don't think any deals less than 50-50 will fly.&quot;   For First Mutual, a 50-50 deal would mean a substantialprivate investment. At Sept. 30, 1990, the bank hadnonperforming assets of $226.4 million. It had a net loss of$25 million for the first nine months of 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
