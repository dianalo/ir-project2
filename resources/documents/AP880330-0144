Reagan said he was supporting an ally and warning theSandinistas. Skeptics in Washington and Tegucigalpa said thepurpose was to drum up aid for Nicaraguan rebels, which Congresshad rejected.   Arrival of the first American troops March 17 coincided withreports from Washington that Nicaragua had built up a force of4,500 troops in the Bocay border region.   They said up to 2,000 Sandinista soldiers with Soviet-madeartillery and aircraft had crossed into the jungles of easternHonduras, pursuing Contra rebels, and President Jose Azcona Hoyowas asking for help.   High-ranking Honduran military sources said about 4,000Hondurans had surrounded the 2,000 Nicaraguans but no fighting wasreported. They said Honduras was sending more troops to the region.   No casualty figures were reported during the crisis, which beganMarch 15 and lasted 10 days. Nicaragua said its soldiers did notcross the border.   Now that the men of the 82nd Airborne Division and the 7th LightInfantry Division have gone home, questions remain about thedisplay of American might.   The Reagan administration said the soldiers would conductexercises in a show of force designed as a measured response to thecrisis. Some of them trained 40 miles from the border and 70 milesfrom where fighting was said to have occurred.   Azcona said in a March 18 news conference that he counted onsupport from the United States in case of more Sandinistaaggression. His press secretary, Lisandro Quesada, then told TheAssociated Press in an interview: ``This is nothing more than anexercise in case Honduras enters into war.''   Gen. Policarpo Paz Garcia, a former Honduran chief of state,said this week: ``I think the Sandinistas did not intend to invadeHonduran territory. What happened is that Nicaraguan troops were inpursuit of the Contras and committed the error.''   Paz, who governed in 1979-1981 before civilian rule wasrestored, said the Honduran army ``is prepared to repel anyaggression. ... I wouldn't have asked the United States forsoldiers.'' He spoke in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday.   According to a survey published Wednesday in El Heraldo, 42 percent of Tegucigalpa residents polled agreed with the U.S. decisionto sent troops and 47 percent opposed it.   As the white parachutes of hundreds of American paratroopersfilled the sky over Palmerola air base March 17, the Reagandecision was being challenged here and in Washington.   It came when the Sandinistas and U.S.-supported Contra rebelshad announced plans for direct cease-fire negotiations in Nicaragua.   Although there were charges that the U.S. troops were sent as aploy to get more Contra aid, Azcona told The AP he asked for helpbecause his country was in danger.   On Monday, he said in a telephone conversation: ``At no timewere there pressures from the United States that my government askfor help (with) the incursion of Sandinista troops in ourterritory.''   Honduran congressmen said at the time that they were notinformed of a Sandinista incursion and learned through the newsmedia that Azcona had requested help.   Newspapers published editorial cartoons questioning theoperation.   La Prensa depicted Uncle Sam telling Azcona and other leaders:``There's an invasion in Honduras'' while they looked aroundsaying, ``Where, where, where?''   Ruben Palma, president of the small opposition ChristianDemocratic Party, declared: ``The United States is provoking adirect confrontation betwen Nicaragua and Honduras with thestrategic aim of obtaining aid for the anti-Sandinistacounterrevolutionaries.''   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said the same.   Despite denials from Managua of an incursion, U.S. congressmenon a fact-finding mission in Honduras said they had proof.   A well-informed source in Tegucigalpa said the Sandinistaspursued about 600 rebels into Honduras and nearly captured a Contrasupply depot before two bombing raids by the Honduran air forcedrove them back.   ``The presence of the United States troops was beneficial forHonduras _ for our people and for the national security,'' Azconasaid as the first Americans left for home Monday.   The last of the Sandinistas had retreated into Honduras byThursday of last week, the day after Ortega's government and Contraleadership signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement.   Azcona expressed support for peace efforts in Nicaragua.   ``We're friends of dialogue and peace,'' he said. ``If theNicaraguan want to reach an agreement and there are no more shotsor conflicts in our neighboring country, then the Hondurans will bethe first to benefit.''</TEXT></DOC>
