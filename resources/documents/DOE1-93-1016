Because of the new terms,a model for the mean reaction rate, which is not necessary for a constantflame, was introduced by converting the model corresponding to the constantthickness flame to a cylindrical coordonate. The caluculated resultspredicts correctly the qualitative tendency of experimental data of theflame thickening measured by Cheng and agreed well except near the alreadyburned side boundary. The influence increasing the reaction band thicknesswas studied by calculating the flame of constant thickness. (12 figs,1 tab, 29 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
