The man -- who has been looking increasingly harassed recently -- is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, and the explanations he gives are not always consistent or easy to follow. &quot;You never know exactly where he's going. I just can't read him,&quot; says a leading economist, Edmar Bacha, who worked for several months with Mr. Funaro on the country's Cruzado anti-inflation plan.    This critical view of the inscrutable 53-year-old minister is widely shared. Economists and Sao Paulo business executives blame him for the collapse of the Cruzado plan and the return of high inflation. The central bank governor, Fernao Bracher, resigned this week because he could not work with him. His relations with Planning Minister Joao Sayad are severely strained. &quot;There have been several personality clashes (with Mr. Funaro),&quot; says Deputy Planning Minister Henri Reichstuhl.    And yet, this handsome Sao Paulo businessman, who has interests in the toy industry, has just emerged strengthened, at least for the next few months.    The departure of Mr. Bracher and the nomination of a personal friend, Francisco Roberto Gros, to head the central bank have left Mr. Funaro with overwhelming control over economic policy. Not since the days of Antonio Delfim Netto, the economics &quot;czar&quot; who presided over Brazil's economic expansion in the 1970s, has one man held such influence over economic decision-making.    His resilience, despite spiraling inflation, a trade slump, falling reserves and a general evaporation of confidence, seems tied to three main factors: a close friendship with President Jose Sarney, a political gift for encapsulating Brazil's profound economic nationalism and an intense sense of mission that many link to a recent bout with cancer.    It was Mr. Sarney, in the first ministerial appointment he made, who chose Mr. Funaro in August 1985. And it was in Mr. Funaro that the president found his chief ally for delaying the relaxation of the Cruzado plan's popular price freeze in order to ensure the victory of government parties in elections last November. Despite the sharp economic deterioration that resulted from this use of the plan for political ends, the two men have remained very close, according to government sources.    Their intimacy is partly tied to similar views. Although neither is an economist -- Mr. Funaro is an engineer and Mr. Sarney is a poet -- they have strong economic convictions. Both believe that Brazil must continue to shun the International Monetary Fund, that economic growth cannot be sacrificed to payments on the country's $108 billion foreign debt and that priority must be given to reducing the huge gulf between rich and poor in Brazil.    Mr. Funaro seldom fails to allude to these themes in his TV appearances. With the departure of Mr. Bracher and the arrival of a more pliable central bank governor, they are likely to be reflected more transparently in economic policy.    Most analysts believe Mr. Funaro will try to lower interest rates, now running at more than 600% annually, because he is convinced the alternative is recession.    They also say Brazil's current debt talks will be tougher because Mr. Gros and the minister will be less prepared to make sacrifices and more ready to hold out the threat of unilateral action. Specifically, Mr. Funaro is known to think that a trade surplus of $8 billion is all that bankers can expect, whereas Mr. Bracher thought the country must make sacrifices to ensure an $11 billion surplus.    In these policies, he is certain to have a faithful ally in Mr. Gros. Trained in the U.S. at Princeton and Columbia, this 42-year-old banker with experience at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. is an old friend of Mr. Funaro and was personally chosen by him over several more experienced rivals. &quot;Mr. Gros is absolutely in the minister's confidence,&quot; says Brazil's leading economic journalist, Celso Pinto.    Critics charge that this new partnership could give dangerous rein to what many see as Mr. Funaro's obsessive sense that he knows what is best. &quot;He's always convinced that he's right, although he has so often been proved wrong,&quot; says Lawrence Pih, one of Sao Paulo's leading businessmen. &quot;Some mystic internal force seems to galvanize him.&quot;    Most people who know him well speak of this almost messianic drive, which they say emerged after a bout of cancer in 1983. He works late and on weekends, and often appears exhausted and curiously introspective in his television appearances.    His spokesman, Marco Antonio Brandao, says the minister remains convinced of the eventual success of his economic policies. He is believed to be contemplating a new wage and price freeze to beat inflation once current price distortions have been eliminated. But the overall thrust of his policies remains obscure to most observers as the country hovers on the brink of hyperinflation. </TEXT></DOC>
