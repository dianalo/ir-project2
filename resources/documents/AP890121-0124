One gun dealer said he plans to stop stocking the weapon, andconcerns that distribution will be further restricted prompted thesales surge, sellers said.   ``The gun was already a popular gun,'' Al Campbell, generalmanager of Western Surplus, said Friday. ``Now, everyone wants toget it before the distribution is stopped. It's having a profoundeffect on sales.''   Patrick Purdy, 24, used a semi-automatic, Soviet-designed AK-47rifle to shoot up an elementary schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., onTuesday. Five pupils were killed. Twenty-nine pupils and one teacherwere wounded.   Purdy fired more than 100 rounds from the rifle and then killedhimself with a handgun.   Since then there have been calls to either ban the sale of suchhigh-powered semiautomatic rifles or subject buyers to the samebackground check and waiting period required of handgun buyers.   Campbell said he used to sell three AK-47s a week but now isselling at least one a day.   Art Noroian, who said he sells the rifle for $349 at Art's Gunsin Reseda, estimated the price could go as high as $800 if sales arerestricted or the Legislature passes a law banning the gun.   ``It's trendy,'' Noroian said. ``Everybody wants to buy the gun.They're fun to shoot. They're outstanding to shoot. It'sexhilarating. It's just a lot of fun.''   He said his sales of the gun also increased after the shooting,but declined to provide figures.   Bob Kahn, owner of Bandamp;B Sales in North Hollywood and Westminster,said he sold 4,500 AK-47s over the last year. Most of the volume waswholesale to other dealers but there also were many retail sales, hesaid.   Sales increased as soon as the public perceived through the pressthat they might be restricted, Kahn said Saturday.   Kahn said veterans of Korea and Vietnam buy AK-47s as nostalgiaitems for display and many people buy paramilitary-style weaponsbecause they are the latest in technology and use them for familyoutings to shooting ranges.   One Orange County dealer, Randy Garell, said he would quitstocking the rifle at The Grant Boys store in Costa Mesa.   ``The handwriting is on the wall that these types of weapons withmassive firepower have little true purpose,'' said Garell, who alsosells camping and outdoor gear. ``I believe they are going to bebanned eventually.''</TEXT></DOC>
