Mike Espy (D., Miss.) testified, but addedthat even Mississippi's governor and secretary of state weremissed. &quot;If the preliminary numbers are any indication, wemay be on the verge of the most inaccurate count in history,&quot;he said.   The preliminary count, the bureau insists, is incompleteand designed to be only one step in the long process toward afull count. Nonetheless, many cities and some rural areas areup in arms as lower-than-expected figures threatencongressional apportionment and federal spending.   While the current round of accusations may have littleeffect on the final 1990 count, it presages a lengthy seasonof litigation ahead. The Commerce Department, which hasauthority over the Census Bureau, was sued 52 times overalleged errors in the count and bureau's methods in the 1980census.   On Monday, some cities and localities returned their ownestimates of how many housing units the bureau supposedlymissed. The process, known as post-census local review, givescities and localities 15 days to review the bureau'spreliminary figures so they can tell the bureau where theymay have missed housing units. The census bureau thenrecanvasses some of those areas.   For confidentiality and other reasons, the bureau releasesto local officials only the number of housing units withinblocks the bureau itself designates, rather than the numberof people within each block. This presents an importantobstacle in redressing the count, local officials say,because a missed unit -- such as a college dormitory or agroup house -- often misses many people, magnifying errorsand omissions.   Officials said the 15-day review period isn't enough. Theyalso said that advanced survey methodology has rendered theconstitutionally mandated head count obsolete. &quot;The fact ofthe matter is, we have reached the point where scientificprojections are more accurate than counting,&quot; Baltimore MayorKurt Schmoke said.   Barbara Bryant, director of the Census Bureau, addressedmany of the concerns during her testimony and defended thebureau's integrity. &quot;We sympathized with those officials whohave to govern cities losing or not gaining population andtax base,&quot; she said, &quot;but we should not be blamed for suchchanges. In effect, there should be no shooting of theproverbial messenger in anticipation of bad news.&quot;   Mr. Schmoke expressed the desire of many of the mayorswhen he called on the Census Bureau to allow the cities onelast chance to correct the count before it goes to thepresident next spring. But Ms. Bryant said that wouldn't bepossible because federal law requires that the final count bedone by the federal government alone: &quot;This,&quot; she said inreference to the local review, &quot;was their chance to givetheir counts.&quot;   According to Ms. Bryant, seven cities have contested thehousing count in at least 2,000 blocks. The seven areAtlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, New York andPhiladelphia. New York has voiced the loudest complaint ofthe major cities, claiming that more than 250,000 housingunits and as many as one million people were missed in thepreliminary count.</TEXT></DOC>
