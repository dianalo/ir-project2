The council's new annual report diplomatically avoidsdirect criticism of the Fed. But in a briefing with a smallgroup of reporters, Chairman Michael Boskin said, &quot;Probablywith the benefit of hindsight, they might have been a bit toorestrictive and perhaps should have eased a bit more,sooner.&quot; He praised recent Fed actions, however.</LP><TEXT>   The report gives the administration's most detailedcritique of Fed policy to date, emphasizing that &quot;it isessential that money growth stay well within&quot; the Fed'starget ranges. In recent months, the money supply has beengrowing hardly at all. The Fed's goal is to increase itbetween 2 1/2% and 6 1/2% this year.   Interest rates have declined over the past six months. Butthe council says that &quot;a decline in interest rates during adownturn may not be a sign of monetary easing, especially ifthe growth of money and credit has slowed.&quot;   &quot;Keeping money supply growth from falling in the face of adownturn . . . caused by an oil price shock is essential topreventing an unnecessarily large and prolonged decline ineconomic growth,&quot; the report adds.   In congressional testimony yesterday, Mr. Boskin added,&quot;There is some room for interest rates to come down. . . . Ithink the Fed will act accordingly.&quot;   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that the central bankcan't offset the blow to the economy of higher oil prices andthat, even in retrospect, he doesn't think the Fed made anymajor policy mistakes last year.   Mr. Greenspan also has said the Fed is determined to spurmoney-supply growth, which he says has been lagging becausebanks are unusually reluctant to lend. Citing &quot;historicalexperience and research,&quot; the president's economists say theFed can help overcome the credit crunch by simply supplyingmore credit.   Although Mr. Bush's economists don't blame the Fed for therecession -- they pin that on Saddam Hussein -- Mr. Boskinsays Fed policy contributed to &quot;very sluggish&quot; economicgrowth even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last summer.   President Bush, in his traditional message to Congressthat serves as an introduction to the report, also emphasizesthe importance of sustained growth in money and credit. Hepredicts that the recession will be &quot;mild and brief byhistorical standards&quot; and should end by midyear. Thepresident says his economic policies &quot;are designed both tomitigate the current downturn and provide for a solidrecovery,&quot; and underscores his view that the private sector-- not government -- is &quot;the engine of economic growth.&quot;   The 263-page report is a wide-ranging celebration of thestrengths of the U.S. economy and the virtues of unfetteredmarkets. Reflecting mainstream thinking in the economicsprofession, the advisers warn against policies they thinkwould be bad for the economy, such as a return to the energyregulation of the 1970s.   The council opposes any special aid to workers orcompanies hurt by the decline in defense spending. Such aidwould be &quot;extremely unfair to workers in other sectors&quot; and&quot;would also make it difficult and costly for the federalgovernment to change spending patterns in response to changesin society's needs,&quot; it says.   The advisers also argue that the rise of foreign directinvestment in the U.S. &quot;is a sign of strength, not ofweakness.&quot; They note that the U.S. remains both the world'slargest source of foreign investment and the largestrecipient of foreign investment.   The report contains new figures showing that foreignmultinational companies operating in the U.S. pay theirworkers about 8% less, on average, than U.S. companies andimport far more of their parts and services than U.S.companies. But the figures also show that foreign companiesin the U.S. are, over time, becoming more like U.S.companies. They import less now than they did a decade ago.   The amount of so-called local content in the productsforeign-owned companies make has risen to 81% in 1987 from79% in 1977 -- although it was still far below the 95% localcontent in goods and services produced by U.S. companies.</TEXT></DOC>
