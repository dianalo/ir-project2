Sims, IRMS' deputy assistantcommissioner for policy.andP;  &quot;We're looking at alternatives and are consideringchanges we'd like to make.andP;  But we don't know how that will come out, and wedon't want to throw out any misleading information to agencies.&quot;andM;The Federal Equipment Data Center (FEDC) in Arlington, Va., serves as thegovernment's ADPE clearinghouse, compiling summary data on agency computersystems, peripheral equipment, central processors, storage devices, relatedcontrols and input/output devices.andM;Agencies are required to report on a system if it has a purchase value ofmore than $50,000 or a monthly rental fee of more than $1,667.andP;  The centersupplies data for IRMS' obsolescence reports, and GSA and OMB officials usecenter data in developing IRM policies.andM;The center currently has a time-sharing contract with Computer NetworkServices Inc. of Washington for use of an IBM mainframe to process agencyinventory records.andP;  Its software consists of antiquated Cobol programs withnon-modular code.andM;IRMS officials have talked about upgrading the center's system for the pastthree years but never issued a plan.andP;  Now they may put in place a databasemanagement system that would enable center employees to do processing atworkstations.andM;Bernard Abeshouse, chief of IRMS' Acquisition Evaluation and Analysis Branch,which oversees the center, said the agency owns the software, and programmersfrom GSA's Office of IRM could help with a conversion effort.andP;  Abeshouse saidthat ending the time-sharing agreement and moving to government-ownedhardware would produce substantial savings.andM;Any changes will be based on making the system easier to use, he said.andM;&quot;We're definitely working to simplify the system to make it easier foragencies to use,&quot; Abeshouse said.andP;  &quot;We're working on new software, and theagencies will be working with us.andP;  When we go to a new system we'll go for anew inventory.'andM;Another major concern is improving accuracy.andP;  The center has been hampered byagency filing errors and an overall lack of support.andM;For example, some past reports have listed large agencies as having no orvery little ADPE worth $50,000.andM;Conyers' bill would require agencies to submit inventory reports every threemonths with more information on mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers,peripherals and database software.andP;  But IRMS may reduce the number of dataelements gathered from 20 today to about six.andM;One proposal being considered would require agencies to identify the originof their inventory data by having regional offices include zip codes asidentifiers in their reports.andP;  This would enable the center to trace reportsand do more thorough audits.andM;Other possible changes include tracking processing power as measured inmillions of instructions per second, rather than original machine costs andmanufacture date.andP;  Agencies have suggested raising the reporting threshold to$100,000, limiting filings to once a year, using on-line inputs and edits andhaving an on-line error suspense file instead of disregarding faulty records.andM;Abeshouse said he is aware of the problems in obtaining accurate data, andany upgrade plan will include stronger internal controls.andM;&quot;We've talked a great deal about quality control and will look at that veryclosely,&quot; Abeshouse said.andP;  &quot;We may eventually have more people at the FEDC,and we will spend a lot of time on auditing.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
