(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oregon Democrats have rejected a plank intheir state party platform that would have called for reducedcriminal penalties for growing and possessing marijuana.   In the past, state Democrats have approved platform planksadvocating both outright legalization of marijuana and lesseningcriminal penalties, arguing that the money would be better spentfighting ``hard'' drugs.   ``We're cleaning up our act,'' James Klonoski, a past stateDemocratic party chair, said after the marijuana plank was rejectedSunday. ``In the old days, we used to embarrass our electedofficials. We don't do that anymore.''   Tom Alexander, a Benton County state convention delegate whowanted the marijuana plank in platform, said the main oppositionwas from Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and other elected Democrats worriedabout the party's image and the upcoming elections.   ``The problem is that the Democratic party leaders, because theRepublicans have shifted so far to the right, think we have to playto the Republican moderates for votes,'' Alexander said.</TEXT><BYLINE>---</BYLINE><HEAD>Gore Opposes Reagan Plan for Mideast Talks</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., after meeting with IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, says he prefers ``directnegotiations'' between Israel and its Arab neighbors rather thanthe Reagan administration's plan for an international Middle Eastpeace conference.   ``I think there are questions that have been given short shriftthat deserve a more careful study,'' the Tennessee Democrat toldreporters after meeting with Shamir here Sunday. ``What would therole of the Soviet Union be in the conference?''   Shamir maintained his opposition to an international peaceconference in meetings with President Reagan last week, saying aSoviet presence in the talks would bring more pressure on Israel togive up land captured from the Arabs during the 1967 Middle EastWar.   Gore spent Sunday here campaigning for support in New York'sApril 19 presidential primary. He addressed about 1,200 people atthe annual dinner of the Council of Jewish Organizations of BoroughPark, an umbrella organization for 190 groups in a neighborhoodthat is home to 100,000 Hasidic Jews.</TEXT></DOC>
