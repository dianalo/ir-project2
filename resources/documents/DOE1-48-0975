This propertyraises mathematical problems for the construction of a gas of interactinginstantons and anti-instantons and complicates the physical interpretationof such a gas. If a field theory in D spacetime dimensions is embeddedin a (D+1)-dimensional spacetime, the instanton gas in D dimensions appearsas a soliton gas of the (D+1)-dimensional theory. We find, in specificexamples, that this soliton gas is physically reasonable and free ofany mathematical ambiguities. By taking a high-temperature, weak-couplinglimit of the (D+1)-dimensional theory we recover the original theoryin D dimensions. The mathematical difficulties of the original theoryrelate to the fact that theories with real instantons have perturbationseries which are not Borel summable. Our approach thus provides an alternativeto analytic continuation in the coupling parameter for defining theorieswith non-Borel-summable perturbation series. The specific examples withwhich we deal involve quantum-mechanical potential models, which we presentas field theories with D = 1. We study, in particular, a cosine potentialand the associated sine-Gordon field theory in two-dimensional spacetime.Neither the exact solvability nor the restricted dimensionality of thesine-Gordon model is crucial for obtaining our results, and we believethat our approach should be applicable to a general theory in D spacetimedimensions.</TEXT></DOC>
