The findings of this study indicate thatthe residential energy tax credit has had minimal effect on major insulationpurchase decisions. Not one respondent considered the tax credit so importantthat the purchase would not have been made without its existence. Knowledgeof the tax credit appeared very limited; despite the average $428 expenditurein the study population, only 61% of repondents had acquired any informationabout the credit prior to the final purchase decision. The purchase decisionwould appear to be such that the amount of consumer purchase is dictatedby the need and ability to make the purchase. This study also supportsthe contention that tax credits do not benefit lower-income familiesas equally as higher-income families. 10 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
