The computer giant said the chip contains 50 times more optical and electronic components than any similar chip, further demonstrating the feasibility of such optoelectronic devices. The devices will become increasingly important in coming years because they allow data transmission of at least one billion bits per second -- the information equivalent of a good-sized set of encyclopedias. That transmission rate is as much as 10 times faster than currently possible on fiber-optic lines, which are already many times faster than conventional wires.    IBM also said its scientists had demonstrated a similar chip for use in transmitting data. Being able to handle transmission and reception with just two chips should make the devices faster, by cutting the distance the signals have to travel. That should also make them less expensive and more reliable, because there will be fewer parts.    The chips combine the optical and electronic parts so that data, normally transmitted electronically, can be changed into pulses of light. Other companies have announced development of optoelectronic chips, but progress has been limited because the combination of the different types of devices can be tricky. In addition, the &quot;quantum well&quot; technology used to generate light pulses in the gallium arsenide chips is still esoteric.    Few computer networks need this sort of speed at the moment, but the time is coming. Computers' power continues to double every couple of years, and people are increasingly transmitting graphics, which require far more data than does text. In any case, the IBM chips are experimental, so it will take some years for them to reach the market. </TEXT></DOC>
