In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6660marks and 132.94 yen, down from 1.6703 marks and 133.15 yenlate Friday. Sterling was trading at $1.7500, up from$1.7435.</LP><TEXT>   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quotedat 132.95, unchanged from its Tokyo close Monday. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.6688 marks, up from 1.6665marks.   &quot;The {U.S.} economy is in terrible shape,&quot; said AlbertSoria, a first vice president and foreign exchange manager inNew York for Kansallis Osake Pankki, Finland's largestcommercial bank. &quot;It needs a shock treatment of some sort.&quot;   The market is bracing for the U.S. Federal Reserve to cutanother quarter percentage point from the 5.25% federal fundsrate, the rate that banks charge each other for overnightloans.   Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominatedinvestments less attractive to overseas investors.   The Fed last cut rates Sept. 13, when it reduced thediscount rate it charges on loans to banks to 5% from 5.5%and cut the federal funds rate to 5.25% from 5.5%.   The Fed isn't expected to ease before Friday, when theU.S. Labor Department is scheduled to release the Septemberemployment report.   But anticipation of a U.S. rate cut has been weighing onthe dollar for weeks. The dollar has slid about 1.4% from1.6900 marks when the Fed last cut rates. In the last twosessions, the dollar has given up 1.3% of its value againstits German counterpart, leading some market watchers to seethe currency as oversold.   Players also are expecting to sell the dollar if itrallies, using the higher price to establish short positionsin anticipation of further declines. A short position is abet the currency will fall, allowing the trader to buy itback for less than the selling price. Since many playersalready have established short positions, there is less roomfor more dollar sales, Mr. Soria noted.   Even though the market expects the dollar to move lower,and rebounds will be opportunities to sell, &quot;I wouldn't getoverly aggressively bearish on the dollar here,&quot; Mr. Soriasaid.   If economic indicators this week suggest a turnaround inthe economy, &quot;the market could turn on a dime&quot; and movehigher, he added.   Traders expect the dollar to stay between 1.6520 and1.6735 marks and between 131.80 yen and 133.80 yen today.   The level of 1.6500 marks hasn't been breached since thedollar traded at 1.6477 marks on Feb. 25.   The dollar could move more sharply today, however, if theAugust index of leading indicators or the September nationalpurchasing managers' index are far out of line withexpectations.   Leading indicators are expected to be down 0.1% in August,after gains of 1.2% in July, 0.6% in June and 0.7% in May,according to a poll of some economists.   The National Association of Purchasing Management's indexis expected to fall to 54.3% in September from 54.8% inAugust. A reading above 50% indicates expansion in themanufacturing sector and a reading below 50% indicatescontraction.   Dollar selling in Asian and early European dealings drovethe currency down to an intraday low of 1.6580 marks, a levelnot seen since the dollar touched that level on April 10. Thedollar also fell to an intraday low of 132.53 yen.   Traders said the Chicago purchasing managers' index helpedthe dollar to remain above its low. The index rose to 56% inSeptember on an unadjusted basis, from an unrevised 54.7% inAugust and from 48% in July. But on an adjusted basis, theChicago index fell to 55.3% in September, compared with a56.6% reading for August.   The U.S. unit moved slightly higher as European traderswound up their day, and activity tapered off.   Many players were absent, preferring to avoid risk at theend of the month and quarter. The end of the fiscal half yearin Japan dulled dealing in Asian markets.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $354 an ounce, up $4.90. Estimated volumewas a moderate 4.2 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $353.30 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
