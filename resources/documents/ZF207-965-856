 * OPERATING SYSTEM  DOS with MSCDEXextensions.andP;  * PRICE  4,800 pound sterling per annum (includes six updates)andM;* PC USER VERDICT  The ideal tool for anyone needing access to companyinformation.andP;  Could prove a cost-effective alternative to on-line service.andM;CD-ROM is certainly not a new technology -- it's been around for over fiveyears.andP;  What's new, however, is the application of CD-ROM technology toUK-specific products.andP;  Although there have been over 3,000 CD-ROM titlespublished worldwide, only about 300 of these are pertinent to the UK market.andM;Recently, though, there's been a great upsurge of interest in CD-ROM in theUK.andP;  Two new products from respected sources of information have recentlybeen launched that could herald the belated arrival of CD-ROM for UK computerusers.andP;  The first of these is the BSI Perinorm International Standards disc.andO;The second, and of immediate interest to a wider range of potential users, isthe Jordans' FAME (Financial Analysis Made Easy) disc.andM;Jordan's FAME CD-ROM is an extract of the well known Jordans on-linefinancial database.andP;  The CD-ROM version offers up to five years of financialinformation on 125,000 of the top UK companies.andP;  Jordans' main databasecontains information on every one of the 2.3 million limited companies in theUK.andP;  This information is compiled from the company accounts filed annually atCompanies House in Cardiff, Edinburgh and London, and it's supplemented byfurther miscellaneous information gathered from the Edinburgh and LondonGazettes.andM;The FAME database requires users to have access to an IBM PC or compatiblewith a CD-ROM drive, MS-DOS and the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions V2.XX, (formost potential users this represents a one time investment of around 700pound sterling for the hardware, or alternatively Jordans will hire out aCD-ROM drive for 300 pound sterling per annum -- less than the cost of adecent modem).andP;  Jordans can come and install the system for you if required,so there should be no problems getting up and running.andM;FAME is actually supplied with an 'intelligent' installation program thatcreates two sub-directories on the hard disk, one for the FAME searchsoftware, the other for the FAMEFAS analysis software.andP;  The wholeinstallation procedure is quite painless and explains what's happening at alltimes.andP;  It's worth mentioning at this point that through the review it wasonly necessary to refer to the manual once, and that was simply to confirmthe printer support offered by the on-screen menu.andM;It's difficult to do justice to the enormous power and capacity of the FAMEdatabase in words -- it really is something you need to try for yourself toappreciate (Jordans will extend an offer of a three-week free trial period tointerested corporate users).andP;  The information contained on FAME is ofinterest to any medium- to large-size company or organization intending to dobusiness in the UK.andP;  There are over 60 specific facts listed for eachcompany, including, in most cases, profit and loss accounts for the last fiveyears, registered addresses, trading addresses, directors and SIC code.andM;It's possible to locate a particular company, or group of companies, by anycombination of up to 63 different criteria.andP;  Perhaps the most importantconsequence of this is that it allows users to browse through a vast amountof data without having to pay any on-line charges.andP;  Users can carry out amore thorough search without having to worry about increased cost, and as thedata is contained in a local database, there's no possibility of line noisecausing data corruption.andM;The other big advantage is access speed.andP;  Because the actual databasequerying and manipulation is being done locally (meaning on your own PC), youavoid the time delays normally associated with on-line systems.andP;  While FAMEwill locate a particular company as quickly as you can type the name, asearch for multiple companies (meaning all those involved with computermanufacturing) can take some time.andP;  Even so, it's currently the fastest andmost economical way of getting the information.andM;The power of FAME lies in its ease of use -- it's totally menu-driven and, assuch, can be used by almost anyone.andP;  FAME can be used in two basic ways,either to locate information on a particular company, simply by entering thecompany name, or to identify certain types of company by building up a searchprofile.andP;  A search for a certain type of company can be made up of manystages, each narrowing down the number of companies selected.andP;  It's possible,for instance, to select all printing companies in East Anglia with over 100staff and a turnover of more than 5 pound sterling million.andM;At each stage of a search operation all available options are clearlyindicated on screen, with users being prompted either to select an optionfrom a list or to enter a range of values.andP;  Users can store complete searchsequences so that they can be used with later editions of the database, whichcan save a lot of time, especially if you're monitoring a particular marketsector.andM;Having located the company or companies you're interested in, it's thenpossible either to view selected parts of the stored data, to print the data,save it to disk for later use, or to transfer it to a disk file for use withthe FAME analysis software.andM;It's important to remember that each company record can take up to 7Kb, sotransfering 150 records can use up to 1Mb of disk space.andP;  This makes a harddisk essential for using FAME, especially if users intend to make use of theanalysis software.andM;The FAMEFAS analysis software is the single most powerful part of thispackage.andP;  Once a section of the database has been transferred to hard disk itcan then be analysed using a variety of criteria.andP;  For example, it's possibleto transfer across all companies involved in forestry and then rank them byprofitability or employee remuneration.andM;It's also possible to carry out growth trend analyses on either a singlecompany or a group of companies.andP;  There's virtually no limit to the number ofways in which users can analyse their selected data, and it's in this areathat FAME breaks important new ground for PC users.andP;  FAME brings mainframedata storage capacity to the desktop, with powerful retrieval and analysissoftware.andP;  Once the analysis has been carried out you can display or printthe results either as a table or in graphical format.andP;  The graphics arepretty basic, but include bar and pie charts as well as Lorenz curves.andM;The graphics printing utility supports either Hewlett-Packard Laserjet orEpson compatibles which enables it to print to most currently used printers.andM;It would have been handy to be able to add a title to the graph or even to beable to export the graph in one of the more common graphics formats for usewithin other packages.andP;  It's possible however to export the data into eithera Lotus or dBase-standard format to allow more in depth analysis, orcomparison with existing data.andP;  This would also be a way of producing betterquality graphics.andM;FAME is one of the first UK-oriented CD-ROM databases to become available andhas to be good news for PC users.andM;At the moment FAME seems to have the market to itself.andP;  It's a good productwith a simple user interface that could be used by anyone already usng a PC.andO;I would wholeheartedly recomend FAME to anyone thinking of using a companiesdatabase service.andP;  The fact that there's a fixed price for a yearlysubscription should help when it comes to budgeting for a company financialservice, while the data integrity gained from using a local database is anadded benefit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
