(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mitsubishi's entry into the hotly contested 286 laptop market, the MP 286L,should not be lightly dismissed.andP;  At $4,795 fully loaded, the AC-poweredsystem boasts a fast hard disk, decent screen, an above average keyboard, andgreat software.andM;The clamshell MP 286L comes in several guises: 210, 220, 220VP, 240, and the240EVP, the model tested.andP;  All feature the same 11-inch diagonal screen,1.44MB floppy disk drive, enclosed in a 3.5- by 12.3- by 14-inch (HWD) sleekblack case.andP;  While the 220 and the 220EVP have backlit CGA LCD screens, therest of the range uses a backlit EGA LCD.andP;  Mitsubishi's design does not allowthe user to pry open the case; instead, the company includes a tool forinstalling the optional proprietary memory and video boards.andM;Standard equipment for the 240EVP includes 640K RAM on the motherboard,expandable to 2MB, switchable 12- or 8Mhz speeds  with one or zero waitstates), Phoenix BIOS, a NEC 40MB hard disk, an external port for a CGA orEGA monitor, Microsoft Windows, Super PC-Kwik, DOS 3.3, GW-BASIC,Mitsubishi's own expanded memory manager, a math coprocessor, and a one-yearwarranty.andM;While the screen itself is eminently readable, it is difficult to adjust.andO;Brightness and contrast are set by two flat thumbscrews that can't be setonce and ignored because the screen changes with every application.andP;  Too bad;while text characters, slightly rounder and larger than the norm, are verylegible, graphics can be wrecked by blooming and streaking.andM;The MP 286L's 84-key keyboard is a fair example of the breed: the completeset of function and cursor keys are arranged along the top in two rows ofhalf-sized keys that are fiddly to use and not wholly logical in execution.andO;Interestingly, there is an unlabeled key at the bottom of the keyboardbetween the Alt and Ctrl keys that will perform the backslash function.andP;  It'sconvenient but odd, particularly since the manual doesn't mention it.andM;At almost 16 pounds, users could be forgiven for thinking that the Mitsubishiis packing a sizable battery to back up its AC capability.andP;  When Mitsubishidesigned the MP 286L two years ago, the company looked at a number ofthird-party battery sources but opted out.andP;  Mitsubishi currently does notplan to offer an MP 286L model with a battery.andM;The Mitsubishi MP 286L/240EVP turned in respectable results during testing,but it shouldn't be judged on that alone.andP;  It is very rugged; a lifetime ofhard use won't faze it.andP;  The lack of battery power will affect only those whoabsolutely cannot live without it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
