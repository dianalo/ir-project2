This week's radical tax reform in Britain, slashing top income-tax rates to 40% from 60%, beckons all the celebrities and tycoons who have fled the sceptered isles over the past two decades. Actor Michael Caine, after moving back to Britain from California last year, will benefit from the fruits of the lower taxes. Others may follow his lead.    Accountants and lawyers say the tax changes will make Britain as tax-cheap as New York City and not much more expensive than Los Angeles. Tax havens like Monaco still will be tax havens, but the changes greatly reduce the appeal of living abroad for rich Britons.    The tax cuts will &quot;make one hell of a difference,&quot; says Derek Nash, senior tax manager at the accounting firm Coopers andamp; Lybrand in London. The 20-percentage-point cut in the top rate &quot;is enough to make these people consider {coming} back,&quot; he says.    Not only jet setters will benefit. For multinational companies and banks, the tax overhaul sharply reduces the cost of keeping expatriate executives in London. Britain could lure more multinationals from higher-tax locations elsewhere in Europe. Both developments could reinforce London's role as a banking and communications center.    A London-based executive, married and taking average deductions and earning $135,000 a year, will find his British tax bill slashed to the equivalent of $45,841 a year from $61,886, or only $858 more than he would pay in New York, Coopers andamp; Lybrand says. For an executive earning $180,000, the difference narrows to $428.    While top U.S. personal income-tax rates of 35% still are lower than Britain's, hefty local taxes in some parts of the U.S. make up for most of the difference.    Britain's new top tax charges are less than half the 83% rate levied on the richest Britons in 1979, when the Conservative Party came to power. Years of rising taxes under both Labor and Conservative governments drove many Britons abroad. The list of well-known emigre Britons includes Roger Moore, Sean Connery, and Jackie and Joan Collins.    Others -- including business executives with duties in Britain -- have tried to spend as much time as possible outside the country to reduce their income-tax burden.    Nobody has started packing yet, including Mr. Bowie, who resides in Lucerne, Switzerland. But Jonathan Morrish, a spokesman for Sony Corp.'s CBS Records unit in London, thinks it only may be a matter of time before tax exiles move back. &quot;I'm hard-pressed to think of any major British recording artist who hasn't spent time outside the U.K.&quot; for tax reasons in recent years, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
