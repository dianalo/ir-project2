The guidelines were developed in responseto tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved hunting rights,and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate huntingby both tribal and nontribal members throughout their reservations. Theguidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting by bothtribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members on somereservations to take place within Federal frameworks, but on dates differentfrom those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation huntingby tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for seasondates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3) off-reservationhunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework datesand season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possessionlimits. In all cases, the regulations established under the guidelineswould have to be consistent with the March 10 to September 1 closed seasonmandated by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada. The guidelinesare capable of application to those tribes that have reserved hunting rightson Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands)and ceded lands. They also apply to establishing migratory bird huntingregulations for nontribal members on all lands within the exterior boundariesof reservations where tribes have full wildlife management authority oversuch hunting, or where the tribes and affected States othewise have reachedagreement over hunting by nontribal members on non-Indian lands. Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting bynonmembers on Indian-owned reservation lands, subject to Service approval.The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that includelands owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States haveestablished or intend to establish regulations governing hunting by non-Indianson these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and Statesto reach agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations.When appropriate, the Service will consult with a tribe and State withthe aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointlywith tribal and State officials in the affected States where tribes maywish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal members on cededlands. One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of waterfowland other migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations whereit is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, providedit does not take place during the closed season required by the 1916 CanadianMigratory Bird Treaty, and it is not so large as to adversely affect thestatus of the migratory bird resource. Prior to the 1987-88 and 1988-89hunting seasons, the Service reached an agreement with the Mille Lacs Bandof Chippewa Indians for hunting by tribal members on their lands in Minnesota.A similar agreement was reached with the Yankton Sioux Tribe in South Dakotafor the 1988-89 hunting season. The Service is pleased with these accordsand will continue to consult with tribes that wish to reach a mutual agreementon migratory bird hunting regulations for on-reservation hunting by tribalmembers. The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible. Nevertheless, the Servicebelieves that they provide appropriate opportunity to accommodate the reservedhunting rights and management authority of Indian tribes while ensuringthat the migratory bird resource receives necessary protection. The conservationof this important international resource is paramount. Use of the guidelinesis not required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations establishedby the State(s) in which the reservation is located.<ITAG tagnum="84">Details Needed in Tribal Proposals</ITAG>Tribes that wish to use the guidelines to establish special hunting regulationsfor the 1989-90 hunting season must submit a proposal that includes: (1)The requested hunting season dates and other details regarding regulationsto be observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations;(3) methods that will be employed to measure or monitor harvest (mail-questionnairesurvey, bag checks, etc.); (4) steps that will be taken to limit levelof harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvestwould impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilitiesto establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations.The regulations that will be established for Indian tribes will includeboth early and late hunting seasons. The early season begins on September1 each year and includes species such as mourning doves and white-wingeddoves. The late season usually begins on or near October 1 and includesmost waterfowl species. Because final regulations for tribes for the 1989-90hunting season must be established by September 1, 1989, the proposed andfinal rules for most tribal waterfowl seasons will be described in relationto the season dates, season length, and limits that will be permitted whenfinal waterfowl hunting season frameworks are announced. For example, thedaily bag and possession limits for ducks on most reservations in the PacificFlyway will be shown as ``Same as permitted Pacific Flyway States underfinal Federal frameworks.'' This procedure is necessary because the earlyseason will be underway before final frameworks for the late season areannounced. The final rule for tribes will include the actual season dates,bag limits, etc., for species included in the early season because thefinal Federal frameworks will be established in time to include them inthe final rule for tribes. In some instances, specific waterfowl regulationsfor a particular tribe or reservation also may be shown because they willbe within the final Federal frameworks that will be established. However,for the reasons shown above, final regulations for most tribes will notinclude exact details for waterfowl.The Service notes that duck hunting regulations for the 1988-89 huntingseason were much more restrictive than in recent years because of the seriousdecline in duck populations caused by a lengthy period of drought in theprairie region of Canada and the United States. The drought was especiallysevere in 1988, and several years of favorable environmental conditionsprobably will be required before ducks will be able to nest successfullyagain in many prairie areas. Consequently, for conservation purposes, duckhunting regulations likely will be conservative again in the 1989-90 huntingseason, and tribes should bear this in mind when preparing proposals.A tribe that desires the earliest possible opening of the waterfowl seasonshould specify this in the proposal, rather than request a date that mightnot be within the final Federal frameworks. Similarly, unless a tribe wishesto set more restrictive regulations than Federal regulations will permit,the proposal should request the same daily bag and possession limits andseason length for ducks and geese that Federal regulations will permitthe States in the flyway in which the reservation is located.The Service notes also that because of a long-term decline of mourningdoves in the Western Management Unit, the 1988-89 hunting regulations forstates in the unit were more restrictive than usual. Similar regulationslikely will be established in the unit for this species for the 1989-90hunting season, with the aim of increasing the size of the population.Pertinent details in proposals received from tribes will be published forpublic review in a later <T4>Federal Register</T4> document. Because of the time required for Serviceand public review, Indian tribes that desire special migratory bird huntingregulations for the 1989-90 hunting season should submit their proposalsas soon as possible, but not later than June 5, 1989. Tribal inquiriesregarding the guidelines and proposals should be directed to the appropriateService Regional Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Offices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(Address Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s100,r100,15</C><H1>States </H1><H1>Address </H1><H1>Telephone No.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington <D>Lloyd 500 Bldg., Suite 1692, 500 NE.
