<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0063 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) is conducting a research programto evaluate the appropriateness of criteria in the ANSI draft StandardN13.30, &quot;Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay.&quot; The evaluation hasprogressed parallel with the preparation of the Standard by evaluatingthe performance of existing bioassay laboratories against the criteriaspecified. Recommendations for revision of the Standard and implementationof a testing/accreditation program have been formulated based on studyresults. The current performance testing program includes both in-vivocounting and in-vitro sample measurements. Test criteria specified inthe Standard include relative bias, relative precision, and acceptableminimum detectable activity (AMDA). Results indicate that the acceptancecriteria in the Standard are appropriate for the existing state of theindustry and are achievable by a majority of the participating laboratories.3 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
