Attracted by any change tolink technical skills with the impulse to be useful, the authors havespent a major part of their professional lives trying to make this happen.They know that a lot of the effort goes for naught. Even worse, someof it gets misused by the policy-making process in the pursuit of policiesthat we believe misguided. Many of us are frustrated by this gap betweenaspiration and reality in what we do - together with our conviction thatthe gap is usually contrary to the public interest. In IIASA's terms,we sense the existence of a &quot;universal&quot; problem here and, by poolingour experience, we hope to find some avenues that offer us real prospectsof solving it. As a rather tentative step in such a direction, this chapterstarts by very briefly reviewing policy analysis as an ideal and indicatinghow this idea is manifested in the five case studies. It then considersthe &quot;real world&quot; of policy analysis - how the process usually works inpractice - and how this process differs from the ideal, using the casestudies as examples. Finally, it suggests some directions for closingthe gap between theory and practice in policy analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
