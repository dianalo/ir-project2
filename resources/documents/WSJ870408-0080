The company has said for some time that it would consider using part of a $1.3 billion payment from Cie. Generale d'Electricite of France to buy back shares. ITT said directors authorized the buyback &quot;as market conditions warrant.&quot;    The announcement was made after the stock markets closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, ITT common stock closed at $63.50, up $1, on heavy volume of just over a million shares. At that price, a purchase of 10 million ITT shares would cost about $635 million. Repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares, ITT said.    As of March 13, ITT had 141.8 million common shares outstanding.    Separately, ITT said it would redeem three series of preferred shares at a price of $100 a share plus dividends accrued to the date of redemption, June 8.    In its proxy statement for the 1987 annual meeting, which was made available yesterday, ITT showed substantial increases in cash compensation for principal officers, including a 66% increase for Rand V. Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer. Last year, Mr. Araskog received $1,665,000 in cash compensation, as compared with $1,003,229 in 1985.    Cash compensation increases for ITT's four other top officers ranged from a 38% increase, to $812,500, for M. Cabell Woodward, Jr., vice chairman and chief financial officer, to 19.5%, to $670,000, for Howard J. Aibel, senior vice president and general counsel.    ITT also renewed Mr. Araskog's seven-year contract through 1994, but five-year contracts with 12 other top executives weren't renewed, the proxy statement said. Those executives' contracts won't be renewed until two years remain on the contracts and then renewals will be for only three years, the statement said. Former ITT executives have said the company has been trying to reduce the number of long-term employment contracts with its top executives.    In addition to increases in cash payments, Mr. Araskog and seven other top executives got 125,000 restricted shares of stock, which they don't have to pay for, but which they can't sell or transfer for a period of between two and five years. The executives getting the shares must be employed by ITT for three years before the restrictions lapse. According to the proxy statement, Mr. Araskog got 60,000 such restricted shares. Last year, the restricted stock plan was amended to allow all restrictions to lapse &quot;upon the occurrence of certain events with respect to corporate ownership or control.&quot;    Mr. Araskog and the other top 16 executives also last year were awarded 236,192 units in the company's long-term performance plan. The value of the units is tied to the company' earnings; they are vested after three years and compensation can be awarded in cash, ITT shares or a combination, the proxy statement said.    Mr. Araskog and other ITT executives recently have enjoyed a balmy relationship with security analysts who have liked the divestiture last year of the company's telecommunications equipment business. That business was divested into a joint venture with CGE of France called Alcatel N.V., relieving ITT of debt and some future research and development costs.    An ITT spokesman said senior executive compensation is determined by an outside committee of directors. &quot;The role our senior management played in the dramatic events of 1986, including a massive corporate restructuring, the joint venture agreement with CGE of France and solid financial performance, obviously were recognized and duly rewarded by the committee.&quot;    Separately, ITT named Samuel L. Simmons as senior vice presdient and director of corporate development, succeeding Robert Smith, 59 years old, who took early retirement. During the CGE negotiations last year, Mr. Smith had favored selling ITT's telecommunications equipment business to a company other than CGE, fearing the transaction with the French wouldn't close, ITT has said. Mr. Simmons was most recently senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary of Revlon Inc., a cosmetics company. </TEXT></DOC>
