The IR spectra of aluminum hydroxide in the range 3800-1400cm{sup -1} were studied. The compound adsorption band 2300-1800 cm{sup-1} was assigned to the vibrations of the interlayer hydroxide groups,bonded by a H-bond. The bands in the range 3700-3000 cm{sup -1} are dueto the vibrations of the free OH{sup -} ions.</TEXT></DOC>
