The respected oil industry newsletter said that, according torevised estimates, reserves for the ``big six'' in the last fiveyears has risen from 308 billion barrels to a total of 699 billionbarrels.   It listed Saudi Arabia with 255 billion barrels, Iraq with 100billion, the United Arab Emirates with 98 billion, Kuwait with 95billion, Iran with 93 billion and Venezuela with 58 billion.   The five Persian Gulf states alone account for nearly two-thirdsof the world's proven reserves.   Saudi Arabia last week upgraded its reserves by 85 billionbarrels to 255 billion following a six-year study.   The Arabian American Oil Co. noted that with additionaldevelopment and exploration their ``remaining reserves could be ashigh as 313 billion barrels of oil.''   Describing the Saudi revision as ``a staggering increase,'' theNicosia-based survey noted: ``The reassessment of reserves in SaudiArabia represents the latest stage of a truly massive upwardrevision of proven oil reserves by the major OPEC countries inrecent years.''   In other OPEC news Monday, Venezuelan president-elect CarlosAndres Perez arrived in Abu Dhabi as part of a Gulf swing designedto bolster unity within OPEC and stablize oil prices.   He said he would discuss with Gulf leaders the possibility of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries holding a summit. Sucha summit, if held, would be the second since 1975.   However, U.A.E. oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba, who isparticipating in the talks with Perez, said he believes that such asummit is premature.   During his gulf tour, Perez was scheduled to visit Iraq and Iran,OPEC members who have been at war for eight years until a cease-fireagreement was reached in August.   The U.A.E. has been one of the OPEC states often accused ofovershooting OPEC production quotas and contributing to the glutthat weakened oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
