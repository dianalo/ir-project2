Intel arbitration A decision has been announcedin the first phase of the AMD vs.andP;  Intel arbitration.andP;  Intel and AMD hadentered into a ten-year technology exchange agreement, which originated whenIntel wanted AMD to become a supplier of the 8086 and 8088 microprocessors.andO;Before this agreement, AMD had aggressively promoted the Z8000 as a superioralternative to the 8086 family.andP;  AMD did get rights to the 80186 and 80286under the agreement, but Intel balked at turning over the 80386.andP;  Thisresulted in the collapse of the agreement.andM;Because of the complexity of the issues under arbitration, it has beendivided into modules.andP;  The decision announced last month covers only thefirst module, which addresses the issue of whether or not Intel was obligatedto accept AMD's QPDM (quad pixel data manager) under the agreement.andP;  Intel'sacceptance of the QPDM would give AMD enough &quot;points&quot; to entitle them to the386 design.andP;  At issue in this module was whether Intel had agreed to the QPDMspecifications, and was therefore obligated to accept the part.andM;Judge J. Barton Phelps, the retired Superior Court judge serving asarbitrator, ruled that Intel had not agreed to the specifications, but Intelhad &quot;...andP;  breached its implied covenant to negotiate reasonably to furtherthe goals of the relationship between the parties and it breached the impliedcovenant of good faith and fair dealing ...&quot;andP;  As to the remedy, the decisionstates that &quot;...andP;  AMD, though not entitled to specific performance, isentitled to provable contract damages from Intel for the latter's breaches ofthe covenants enumerated in this decision.&quot;andP;  The term &quot;specific performance&quot;refers, in this case, to requiring Intel to provide the 386 design to AMD.andO;In essence, the arbitrator ruled that AMD is entitled to monetary damages,but not to the rights to the 386.andP;  While it thus seems unlikely that AMD willbe granted rights to the 386, this is only one module of the arbitration, andit is possible that a decision in other modules may grant AMD this right.andM;The amount of fundamentally non-productive effort being expended on legalsquabbles among chip companies is staggering.andP;  This case began two years ago,and, in the words of the arbitrator, &quot;The end of the arbitration is not insight; for we have not yet considered many of the issues referred toarbitration.&quot;andP;  Already, there have been 181 days of testimony, 29 witnesses,1,182 exhibits, 25,416 pages of transcript of evidence, and more than 800pages of briefs.andM;NEC pursues damages claim against Intel...andM;Meanwhile, the NEC vs.andP;  Intel battle isn't over yet.andP;  Bolstered by JudgeGray's decision that NEC's microcode did not infringe (and that Intel hadsacrificed their copyright in any case), NEC had decided to move ahead withtheir unfair competition claim.andP;  With nearly 30 million 8086 and 8088processors having been sold, if NEC can convince the judge that even a smallportion of those sales should have been theirs, many millions of dollarscould be at stake.andP;  While it is widely believed that the suit had adevastating impact on NEC's sales, proving and quantifying that impact willbe difficult.andM;The proceedings are not expected to begin for at least six months, and anyruling in favor of NEC is likely to be appealed, so a final decision may beyears away.andM;Intel lost copyright protection for the 8086/88 microcode because of theirfailure to require copyright notices on chips made by alternate sources.andO;Ironically, the U.S.andP;  last month joined the Berne Convention, adopting aninternational copyright treaty which does not require that copyright noticesbe affixed to gain copyright protection.andM;...While Intel sues ULSI's lawyersandM;Intel's loss in the NEC case does not seem to have dampened their aggressivelegal approach.andP;  As reported last month, Intel is suing ULSI, a startupdeveloping a 387-compatible chip, for theft of trade secrets.andP;  ULSI presidentGeorge Hwang and engineer Alfred Chan also face criminal charges ofconspiracy and theft.andM;Intel has now added ULSI's original law firm, Skjerven, Morrill, MacPherson,Franklin, and Friel, as a defendant in the suit against ULSI.andO;(Coincidentally, this is the firm that represented NEC against Intel, but thesuit is unrelated to the NEC case.)andP;  ULSI engineer Chan allegedly took fromIntel a copy of the 387 &quot;T-spec&quot; (target specification).andP;  Hwang claims thatwhen he became aware of the document, he immediately returned it to Intel,through the law firm.andP;  The law firm kept a copy of the document, which theypromised to keep secret.andP;  However, Intel claims that the firm allowedattorneys for AMD and a consultant to review the document.andM;Coming attractionsandM;Intel is about to face cloners on several fronts.andP;  Nexgen hopes to ship386-compatible systems early next year, and Intel could well decide to sueNexgen over the 286 memory management patent (and perhaps others).andO;Pin-compatible math coprocessor chips will also appear shortly, and it willbe interesting to see how Intel reacts.andP;  As Intel has illustrated in the NECcase, they can severely damage chances for a chip's success by launching alawsuit, even if they ultimately lose the suit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
