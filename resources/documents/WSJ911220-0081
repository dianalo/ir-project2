That battle, until now largely confined to seminar roomsand think tanks, is about to move onto a new front -- to theveterans' halls and slushy streets of New Hampshire.</LP><TEXT>   Rather than concede the political right to television andnewspaper commentator Patrick Buchanan, the Bushadministration now plans to engage him directly, arguing thathis view of conservatism is narrow and outmoded. PresidentBush is dispatching Vice President Dan Quayle, his chiefliaison with conservatives, to New Hampshire early next monthto deliver that message personally -- and to argue that Mr.Bush, not Mr. Buchanan, is the true apostle of modernconservatism.   The success or failure of the administration's effortcould affect the terms of political debate for years to come.For decades, opposition to Soviet Communism was the commonthread that bound an otherwise disparate collection oflibertarians, social-issue conservatives, supply-siders, foesof big government and civil-rights opponents into a cohesivepolitical force.   Today conservatives are struggling to reinvent theirmovement without either a unifying message or a messenger.&quot;Right now there isn't a conservative movement to grab holdof,&quot; says John Sears, Ronald Reagan's one-time campaignmanager. With some conservative goals having been achievedduring the Reagan presidency, others stalemated by Democratsin Congress, and still others rendered moot by Sovietdisintegration, the future direction is &quot;pretty much up forgrabs,&quot; Mr. Sears says.   As a result, many true believers find themselves torn bythe choice between Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan. Tommy Thomas, aformer Florida GOP chairman and longtime Ronald Reaganbacker, supported George Bush's presidential candidacy in1988 and will again. But this year, Mr. Thomas is writing anextra check -- to Mr. Buchanan.   &quot;I'm going to give Pat some money,&quot; says Mr. Thomas, aChevrolet dealer whose business has been hurt during theeconomic slump. &quot;He's going to make the president listen andhe's going to make some of those guys around the presidentlisten. They've been very smug.&quot;   That attitude is echoed throughout the country. Manyconservatives -- furious over Mr. Bush's failure to addresspressing economic problems, his support for tax increases inthe 1990 deficit-reduction deal with Congress and hiscompromise with Democrats on civil-rights legislation -- aredebating whether Mr. Buchanan's campaign is the wake-up callthe administration needs. And in an extraordinary step,Clayton Yeutter, Mr. Bush's hand-picked Republican NationalChairman, chided the president in an interview with theWashington Times this week for making &quot;too many moderationsof his conservative philosophy.   &quot;A lot of conservatives are glad that somebody isrunning,&quot; says conservative activist Paul Weyrich, who sayshe himself hasn't chosen sides. &quot;Perhaps they wish there werea better-known candidate or somebody with governmentexperience. But the calls I get so far indicate there is alot of interest, a lot of discussion.&quot;   Some conservatives believe the current debate representswhat Edwin Feulner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation,calls a period of &quot;redefinition.&quot; Mr. Feulner adds: &quot;Rightnow we don't have a national spokesman who's articulating thevalues we believe in.&quot;   That's where Mr. Quayle, a man in search of a mission thatwill elevate his political standing, comes in. The Buchananchallenge has prompted him to develop as coherent adefinition of conservatism -- on foreign policy, at least --as anyone in the administration.   &quot;A conservative foreign policy recognizes we have a globaleconomy, that we need to maintain a policy of engagement,&quot;Mr. Quayle said in a luncheon interview with reporters thisweek. &quot;A conservative foreign policy is predicated on havinga strong national defense as well as a strong political will.A conservative foreign policy views America as being No. 1and leading in the world, and not retreating.&quot;   Mr. Quayle singles out Mr. Buchanan for criticism andargues that as a former member of the House and Senate who,unlike Mr. Buchanan, has faced the voters, &quot;I know whatconservatives want, what they stand for.&quot;   Both Mr. Buchanan and former Ku Klux Klansman David Dukepose huge problems for many conservatives. Mr. Duke'srace-based appeals have brought strong denunciations fromRepublican leaders from President Bush on down, with someworried that he will damage efforts to broaden the party'sappeal to minority groups and others who might otherwise beattracted to its economic philosophy.   And far from embracing Mr. Buchanan, some conservativeactivists repudiate what they believe is his politicallylethal combination of foreign-policy isolationism, tradeprotection and nativist views on immigration. National ReviewEditor William F. Buckley weighed in this week with atreatise criticizing Mr. Buchanan for anti-Semitic remarks.   &quot;He's out of the mainstream of conservative thought inAmerica,&quot; says Karl Rove, a GOP consultant with close ties toconservative Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. &quot;I don't want hiscandidacy to be taken as a measuring stick of the weight andinfluence of conservatives within the Republican Party,because he doesn't represent us.&quot;   By running for president, Mr. Buchanan is seeking tobecome the head of the conservative movement, if not thecountry. But at the same time, says GOP Rep. Vin Weber ofMinnesota, Mr. Buchanan is also &quot;leading an assault on themovement.&quot;   Mr. Weber says modern conservatism rests on three pillars:economic growth, traditional values and internationalism.Bush administration Budget Director Richard Darman andCalifornia Gov. Pete Wilson are undermining the first two,Rep. Weber says, and Mr. Buchanan's challenge to the third is&quot;every bit as serious.&quot;   Hard times assure that parts of Mr. Buchanan's messagewill find an audience. On the stump he excoriates Mr. Bushfor the &quot;seedy back-room deal&quot; that raised taxes at the 1990budget summit, which remains the greatest source ofconservative disillusionment with the White House. And his&quot;America First&quot; theme may be especially potent amongworking-class voters in New Hampshire and perhaps elsewherewho blame their economic difficulties on foreign competition.   Even if conservative leaders reject Mr. Buchanan'smessage, &quot;at the grass-roots level, I'm worried {Mr.Buchanan} will find fertile ground,&quot; Rep. Weber says.   But political consultants like Mr. Rove envision a retortthat could turn those bluecollar workers against Mr.Buchanan: the argument that he was one of the fewconservatives who opposed the Persian Gulf War. &quot;Pat Buchanandidn't want the U.S. to kick Saddam Hussein's butt out ofKuwait,&quot; he says.   &quot;There's lots of anti-Bush votes,&quot; agrees Republicanconsultant Eddie Mahe, &quot;but there are not that many votes fora philosophy like Buchanan's. It's just too much over on theedge.&quot;   Even among people more sympathetic to Mr. Buchanan,there's ambivalence. To become the leader of U.S.conservatism, Mr. Buchanan &quot;has got to modify thosepositions&quot; on trade and the U.S. role in the world, saysJeffrey Hart, a Dartmouth College professor who once workedalongside him as a Nixon White House speech writer.   At a recent meeting of leaders of conservativeorganizations, political consultant Donald Devine conducted astraw poll about Mr. Buchanan. The result: Five openly backedMr. Buchanan, two privately supported him, and the other sixwere glad he's running. Not one said he didn't support Mr.Buchanan at all.   &quot;Even the ones not supporting {Mr. Buchanan} hope to sendBush a message -- hope to see him get back on the righttrack,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;I guess that's where I come down.&quot;   ---   David Shribman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
