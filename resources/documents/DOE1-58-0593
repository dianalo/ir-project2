The algorithm is basedon critical path analysis, some allocation heuristics, and the executiongranularity of nodes in a program graph. These factors, and the structureof interprocessor communication network, influence the allocation. Toachieve realistic estimations of the executive durations of allocations,the algorithm considers the fact that nodes in a program graph have tocommunicate through varying numbers of tokens. Coarse and fine granularitieshave been implemented, with interprocessor token-communication duration,varying from zero up to values comparable to the execution durationsof individual nodes. The effect on allocation of communication networkstructures is demonstrated by performing allocations for crossbar (non-blocking)and star (blocking) networks. The algorithm assumes the availabilityof as many processors as it needs for the optimal allocation of any programgraph. Hence, the focus of allocation has been on varying token-communicationdurations rather than varying the number of processors. The algorithmalways utilizes as many processors as necessary for the optimal allocationof any program graph, depending upon granularity and characteristicsof the interprocessor communication network.</TEXT></DOC>
