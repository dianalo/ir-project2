JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of governors and former governors urgedthe Bush adminstration Wednesday to propose acid rain legislationthat would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 10 milliontons by the end of this century.   Such emission reductions are needed for the legislation ``to betaken serously in the acid rain debate,'' Gov. Rudy Perpich ofMinnesota, one of the meeting participants, told a news conference.   Perpich is the new chairman of the Alliance for Acid RainControl, a coalition of governors, industry representatives andenvironmentalists working toward reducing acid rain, which is causedlargely by industrial pollution and emissions from coal-burningpower plants.   But Perpich and Anthony Earl, former governor of Wisconsin, saidthe meeting with Richard K. Reilly, head of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, produced no firm commitment from Reilly onspecific pollution reductions the administration might seek.   Nevertheless, said Perpich, ``we are optimistic that this is theyear for acid rain legislation'' and an end to ``years of acrimonyand deadlock on this issue.''   President Bush has said that one of his top environmentalpriorities is to submit to Congress legislation aimed at reducingthe industrial and other pollutants that cause acid rain.Congressional leaders have said they expect to vote on an acid rainbill by summer.   But some of the governors expressed concern that federallegislation might punish states that already have taken aggressiveaction or producers of western, low-sulphur coal.   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who also participated in the meeting,said that federal legislastion should include ``flexibility'' fordifferent states to meet the emission reductions.   For example, the governors said, the coalition opposed a federalrequirement for utilities to install expensive ``scrubbers'' toreduce sulphur emissions or for the federal government to providesubsidies for the installation of such scrubbers.   Perpich said the group told Reilly that requiring scrubbers``will double the cost of cleanup, ... weaken political support inthe West and South and increase global warming problems'' because ofincreased carbon dioxide emissions.   The governor declined to provide specific provisions they wouldwant to see in federal acid rain legislation except to say that itshould require specific emission-reduction requirements.   Whatever acid rain legislation emerges from Congress, itsprovisions must be strictly enforced, Perpich said the group toldReilly.   ``If utilities don't reduce their pollution as the law requires,they should pay stiff taxes based on the amount of pollution theyare releasing into the air. We need to make the punishment fit thecrime,'' he added.   Among those who met with Reilly were Scott Matheson, formergovernor of Utah; Hugh Carey, former governor of New York and now anexecutive at W.R. Grace Co.; Ned Helme, executive director of theCenter for Clean Air Policy; and former Wisconsin Sen. GaylordNelson, an official of the Wilderness Society.</TEXT></DOC>
