(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker authorized the $265,000 payoffin PTL funds to Jessica Hahn to keep her quiet about their sexualtryst, Bakker's former top executive testified Thursday.   Richard Dortch, former PTL executive vice president, said thetelevision evangelist told him: ```I have not raped anyone orassaulted anyone, but there is a problem. ... Do what you have to doto get it solved.'''   Dortch told U.S. District Court jurors at Bakker's fraud andconspiracy trial that he told Bakker about calls from Ms. Hahnthreatening a lawsuit over a 1980 sexual encounter she had withBakker in a Florida hotel room.   Earlier, Dortch testified that Bakker oversold lifetimepartnerships that had become the ministry's primary source of incomeused for operating expenses, but did not build lodging as promised.   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to four fraud and conspiracycounts in a plea-bargain exchange for his testimony against Bakker,said he paid Ms. Hahn $2,000 from his own pocket and later borrowed$10,000 from another PTL employee for Ms. Hahn in 1984.   Dortch arranged a February 1985 meeting in Los Angeles with Ms.Hahn's lawyer and handed over $265,000. The money came from RoeMessner, PTL's contractor, who later billed the ministry for worknever completed on PTL's Passion Play amphitheater.   After the Los Angeles meeting, Dortch said he saw Bakker atHeritage USA's Main Street shopping arcade and told him about thepayoff. He testified Bakker said, ``I don't want to know and I don'twant to hear about it.''   During a meeting in Palm Springs, Calif., Dortch said Bakker toldhim: ``I hate to give them anything. I hate to give them a dime.''He said he believed Bakker when he said he hadn't assaulted Ms. Hahn.   During the testimony, Bakker looked briefly at Dortch, but spentmost of his time staring at papers. Dortch avoided eye contact withBakker except for one brief glance.   Dortch earlier said Bakker pushed the partnerships because ``heneeded the money.''   ``We had come to the point where the primary income to theministry were the lifetime partnerships.''   The trial included testimony from former partners who said theysent Bakker $1,000 for lodging but were turned away when they triedto claim their rooms.   Dortch also said Bakker knew daily the amount of money raised atall PTL operations and that only a few insiders knew the realfinancial and partnership figures.   Dortch, who was indicted for fraud and conspiracy along withBakker, testified he first heard of the partnerships about threeweeks after joining PTL in December 1983. PTL promoted 11 differentpartnership programs between 1984 and 1987, offering supporters fourdays and three nights of free lodging each year for life in exchangefor $1,000.   Dortch also testified that he once asked Bakker about salariespaid to PTL executives and Bakker told him ``as long as he paidincome taxes he'd take whatever he needed.''   Dortch said he should have told the PTL board that the ministrycouldn't afford the bonuses given the Bakkers.   Dortch, released a week ago from a hospital where he was treatedfor an undisclosed ailment, said he once objected to using the word``investment'' in a brochure advertising the partnerships, butBakker insisted on it to lure contributors.   Bakker's secretary every day listed in a notebook contributionsand the number of partnerships sold, Dortch testified. Duringtelethons to sell partnerships, Bakker was given the latest figureswhile on the air.   Bakker and Dortch, on PTL television shows, told viewers that alimit of 30,000 partnerships would be sold, but more than 65,000eventually were sold from 1984 to 1987, prosecutors contend.   Dortch said the ministry kept two sets of figures for the numberof partnerships sold _ a secret set with the actual numbers and asecond set of lower numbers to be used on the television show.   Prosecutors contend Bakker took for his own use nearly $4 millionraised through partnership sales at PTL's Heritage USA theme parkand religious retreat near Fort Mill, S.C. If found guilty of the 24counts of fraud and conspiracy he could be sentenced to 120 years inprison and fined more than $5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
