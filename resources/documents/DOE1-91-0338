It isespecially designed to enhance the art of digital subtraction angiography.It is different from the angiography beamlines presently in operationthat scan the X-ray picture line by line, in that it will take both thehigh and low energy angiography X-ray pictures simultaneously as fullframe pictures. Pictures with 0.25 mm resolution and good signal to noisewill be possible with 2 ms exposure times. This is possible because ofthe increase in flux that is available at the APS. The source of the33 keV photons is a special high intensity wiggler. The photon beam isseparated into two parts, spread out in the vertical direction, and monochromatizedwith two convex bent crystals. These two crystals are bent in an non-uniformway that allows one to both make the photon flux uniform over the 15cm x 15 cm examining area and stabilize the shape of the surface of thediffraction crystal against distortion caused by the heat load on thecrystal. Most of the energy of the photon beam is absorbed by a fastshutter placed in font of the crystals. The two images at the two differentenergies are recorded in two large position-sensitive detectors.</TEXT></DOC>
