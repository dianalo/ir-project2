The Swedish government, a frequent Euromarket borrower, issued 50 billion yen ($395.9 million) of five-year bonds through Nomura International Ltd. It was one of the largest issues recently in any currency.    Bankers estimated Sweden's cost of funding at 40 to 45 basis points under the London interbank offered rate, roughly the same as through a swapped dollar transaction. But with the U.S. currency's outlook considered uncertain, a dollar issue that big might not have been well-received, dealers said.    &quot;The potential problems of the dollar have come to the fore,&quot; said an official at one U.S. securities firm. &quot;Investors are reluctant to increase their commitment to dollar securities unless they see something cheap enough to justify the risk.&quot;    The dollar and Eurodollar bonds closed little changed in Europe, however. Trading was light, with many participants continuing to watch for developments from Washington, where officials of the Group of Seven major industrial nations were expected to discuss dollar-stabilization efforts.    Activity also is subdued this week because of tomorrow's scheduled release of U.S. merchandise trade data for February.    Sweden's issue was considered attractive, but not because of pricing. Its net yield of about 4.70% only equaled those of comparable issues, such as the European Community's 5 3/8% bond due 1992, a Japanese bank syndicate manager said. Often, large Eurobond transactions pay slightly higher yields to make initial placement easier.    However, the bank official added, &quot;People are looking for liquid, triple-A paper, and there is a fair amount of bullishness (about the yen) at the moment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
