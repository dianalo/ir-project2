BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced today that topmanagers are considering offering to buy the consumer-productsgiant for almost $17 billion, a deal that would be the largestcorporate acquisition ever.   The announcement of a possible $75-a-share offer for the firmthat manufactures Oreo cookies and Winston cigarettes underscoredthe soaring interest in food companies and well-known brand names.It came just three days after Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered tobuy processed foods manufacturer Kraft Inc. for $11 billion and twodays after Pillsbury Co. rejected a $5.23 billion bid from theBritish firm Grand Metropolitan PLC.   Wall Street apparently expected a higher offer for RJR Nabisco.The company's stock surged higher after the news broke, climbing$19.75 a share to $75.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading. Morethan 5.6 million shares had been traded by early afternoon, makingit the most active stock on the Big Board.   RJR Nabisco said President F. Ross Johnson and Edward A.Horrigan Jr., chief executive of the company's tobacco business,had notified Nabisco that they ``intend to seek to develop, with afinancial partner, a proposal to acquire RJR Nabisco in a leveragedbuyout merger transaction.''   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. later confirmed it was the financialpartner and was providing equity financing and advice to themanagement group.   ``Any proposal, if made, would be reviewed by a specialcommittee composed of outside directors which has been establishedby the board,'' RJR Nabisco said in a statement.   The group said they estimated they would offer $75 in cash foreach of the company's approximately 225 million common sharesoutstanding.   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer borrows the money to buy thecompany, then pay off the debt either through company revenue orselling off parts of the operation.   If such a deal were completed, it would be the biggest leveragedbuyout of an American corporation by far. The biggest LBO was the$6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. by an investment group led byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1986.   It also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition, the$13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.   One Wall Street analyst, Pavlos Alexandrakis of Argus ResearchCorp., said a $75-a-share bid would be low.   ``Valuing Nabisco, as a food company and discounting the tobaccooperation, I arrive at a value somewhere between $85 and $90,'' hesaid.   RJR Nabisco was formed when the tobacco company R.J. ReynoldsIndustries Inc. bought Nabisco Brands Inc., the food and consumerproducts giant, for $4.9 billion in 1985.   The company's products are some of the best-known in thecountry, and also include Ritz crackers, Camel and Salemcigarettes, Del Monte vegetables and Milk-Bone dog biscuits.   It is currently test-marketing a smokeless cigarette, Premier.   RJR Nabisco had 1987 profits of $1.18 billion on sales of $15.77billion. Food products accounted for 59.7 percent of the company'srevenue, while tobacco products brought in 40.3 percent of itssales.   Earlier this year, the company announced a reorganization of itsfood business, separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisionsinto two free-standing operating companies. RJR Nabisco said themove would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace.   In the past few years, the company has sold off divisions thatdid not fit with its long-range plans, including Kentucky FriedChicken.   Philip Morris, which like RJR Nabisco has tobacco and foodbusinesses, offered to buy Kraft for $90 a share or a total of $11billion. Kraft said it was studying the offer and expected to makea recommendation to its shareholders by Oct. 31.   Wall Street analysts said it would be difficult for Kraft toturn down the Philip Morris bid.   Pillsbury said Grand Metropolitan's $60-a-share offer wasinadequate, and that it was exploring options in response to thebid.</TEXT></DOC>
