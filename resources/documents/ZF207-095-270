 Whilethese measures are directed at weapon systems procurement, they could beextended to DOD's procurement of computers and telecommunications systems.andM;For that matter, similar legislation could be proposed to cover the non-DODagencies.andP;  Whether this would be a good idea needs to be examined.andM;Certain of these measures deal with using procurement-related information asa means of controlling and correcting the problems of bribery and influencepeddling.andP;  These issues are ethical and legal in nature and will be discussedin this column at another time.andP;  For now, the proposed measures concernedwith the efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement process are thesubject of interest.andM;These measures seek to improve the quality and reduce the cost of weapons,military supplies and services by eliminating duplication and competitionamong the armed services.andP;  This would be accomplished by creating aprofessional acquisition corps, separate from the services.andM;To understand if the acquisition of information resources would benefit fromsuch a move, consider how the acquisition of computers and telecommunicationsproducts both differs from and is similar to that of weapon systems.andM;The government's general policy in procuring information resources is to buycommercially available hardware and software.andP;  As the government is arelatively small part of the market, it benefits from volume production ofcommercial products.andP;  It also benefits from the latest technology that isconstantly being introduced into the commercial marketplace.andM;Because of the diversity of commercial products, a government agency can findparticular products to satisfy its unique needs.andP;  Even if it buys in smallquantities, it can get the lowest commercial price a vendor offers itscommercial customers by buying through GSA's Multiple Award Schedulecontracts.andM;Aggregating RequirementsandM;On the other hand, by aggregating its requirements and competing themseparately, the government agency can take advantage of its purchasing powerto get prices significantly lower than the commercial prices.andP;  The AirForce's PC procurement is a good example.andP;  Even aggregation of many agencies'common requiremetns at the governmentwide level is possible to good effect,as illustrated by the recent FTS 2000 awards.andM;Clearly the market for commercial information technology products is unlikethat of weapon systems.andP;  However, in the area of software development andsystems integration, the information technology acquisition problems aresimilar to those of weapon systems procurement.andM;Poor quality, meaning products that do not satisfy the agency's need; overduedelivery, often caused by changes in specifications; and increased costsbecause of slipped schedules and missed delivery dates are not uncommon.andM;In this area, the government appears not to know how to define what it wantsto buy, or how it will test the delivered product to be sure that it getswhat it wants.andP;  Agencies end up paying for people time and computer timeinstead of for the custom-built products they thought they were buying.andM;Vendors appear to be more concerned about the evaluation factors to be usedin awarding a contract than in the product specification in the request forproposals, and government contracting officers end up awarding cost-plusinstead of fixed-price contracts.andM;These problems cited, however, are not the responsibility of a procurementstaff.andP;  They are problems in defining user needs and technicalspecifications, and only the users and their information technology supportorganizations can bring about the improvements desired.andM;How the Other Half BuysandM;The government is admonished constantly to operate in a more businesslikemanner, so we might well ask how the private sector deals with theseproblems.andM;Those that are successful appear to follow a strategy of evolving systemsrather than making wholesale replacements, awarding fixed-price contracts forwell-defined subsystems and maintaining larger, technically qualified coresystems and programming staffs to develop specifications and to programin-house their more critical system applications.andM;But these solutions are the province of the users and informationtechnologists, not the procurement specialists.andM;Would a large conglomerate in the private sector create a single procurementorganization to deal with these problems?andP;  No.andP;  Most corporations todayoperate on the principle that its division heads are responsible for resultsand they should be able to get whatever resources they need to meet theirobjectives.andM;While federal information resources managemetn is far from reaching thisideal, it moves in that direction as agencies demonstrate their capacity toperform.andP;  Any proposal to centralize the procurement of information resourcesand to divorce it from systems planning and operations would be a large stepbackward.andM;At the risk of straying too far from the IRM field, there are some questionsthat might be asked about these procurement centralization porposals.andP;  Theiradvocates point to the French and British acquisition systems as models forgetting high-quality items that arrive on schedule and at a good price.andM;One would like to know what the French and British critics, and there must besome, think of their systems.andP;  How would they change them and why?andP;  How muchdo history and culture affect their way of doing things?andP;  And how do theirorganizations compare in size with the proposed DOD procurement corps.?andM;Too Much of a Good Thing?andM;In a recent Washington POst article, former Navy Secretary John Lehman arguedthat the Defense Department is too big; that in terms of the assets itmanages, it is the equal of the total of the top 30 companies on the Fortune500 list.andP;  Another revealing comparison is that in terms of militarypersonnel, even our smallest military service is twice the size of theBritish forces in total.andM;Lehman recommends &quot;stronger centralization of defense policy-making and majordecentralization of the day-to-day management and operations.&quot;andP;  That is alsoa good policy for IRM in every major agency, department and bureau, as wellas the federal government as a whole.andM;The Bush administration has all the earmarks of a reform administration.andP;  Itseeks a change for the better by correcting evils or abuses in the system, asopposed to making revolutionary changes.andP;  It is a reflection of an insider'sview of Washington that understands that the news is always about the bad butthat much of the underlying process in government is good and no one wants tothrow out the baby with the bath water.andM;These procurement reform proposals do more than simply correct the evils andabuses we read about in weapon systems procurement, and they are morerevolutionary than reform in nature.andP;  They have the power to do harm as wellas good.andP;  Extreme caution is dictated before moving ahead with them,especially as they relate to information resources procurement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
