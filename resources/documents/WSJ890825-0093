But in the renewed spirit of defiance sweeping South Africa these days, Cassim Saloojee retrieved the photo for another look.    In the picture, Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, is instructing the first group of volunteers for the ANC's 1952 defiance campaign against the government's policies of racial segregation known as apartheid. Mr. Saloojee, only 17 years old at the time, is there, too, standing in the back and holding a placard protesting, &quot;Down with the Ghetto Act.&quot;    &quot;As schoolchildren, our minds were fired by Mandela and the idea of defiance,&quot; Mr. Saloojee remembers. Since then, the ANC has been banned, Mr. Mandela has been jailed for life and photos of him outlawed, and the Ghetto Act, now known as the Group Areas Act, is still ordering neighborhoods by race.    But Mr. Saloojee hasn't lost the fire of resistance. Today, as the president of the Transvaal Indian Congress, he is standing out front as the anti-apartheid movement wages its second defiance campaign, challenging the continued segregation of South African society.    &quot;The government goes around the world saying apartheid is dead, but we know the reality of apartheid in our land,&quot; Mr. Saloojee tells a cheering crowd of about 800 people jammed into a downtown Johannesburg hall. &quot;We say that the beaches of this country are ours, the hospitals are ours, and we are going to live the way we want to. We will go on resisting until we break the walls of apartheid.&quot;    Those walls have proved sturdy during the 37 years between defiance campaigns. Every time a new flicker of resistance appeared, the government snuffed it out. But this time, despite a state of emergency that has banned dozens of organizations and restricted hundreds of individuals, veteran activists like Mr. Saloojee say some cracks are starting to appear. The National Party, which has governed South Africa with unchallenged power for 41 years, is coming under unprecedented pressure from white parties to both its left and its right in the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. In their campaigning, government candidates talk about the need to shed apartheid legislation and begin negotiations with black leaders for a new constitution. And in an effort to improve the country's international image and relieve the pressure of economic sanctions, Acting President and National Party leader F.W. de Klerk is promising world leaders that he will build a &quot;new, totally changed&quot; South Africa free of racial oppression.    With their defiance campaign -- which involves desegregating whites-only facilities, defying state-of-emergency restrictions and bans, and protesting the elections, which exclude the black majority -- the anti-apartheid movement is trying to put the spotlight on the government's claims of reform and hold the current leadership to them.    &quot;By coming out against our restrictions, we're not seeking confrontation, but expressing our legitimate right to organize our own people should negotiations come about,&quot; says Cassim Coovadia, a defiance organizer and supporter of the banned United Democratic Front, or UDF, the largest coalition of anti-apartheid groups. &quot;If the state doesn't give us space to exercise that right, then we see that the state isn't serious about negotiations.&quot;    Similarly, he says, the campaigns to have non-white patients treated at whites-only hospitals and to open segregated schools and beaches to all races are designed &quot;to help the government end apartheid.&quot; He explains: &quot;We've seen that doctors are willing to treat patients regardless of race. If people are refused treatment in the future, we've now isolated the state as the stumbling block.&quot;    In the 1950s, the government had no qualms about crushing the defiance campaign, but this time the authorities are caught in a dilemma. For instance, while threatening to arrest and detain the anti-apartheid protesters, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok is telling campaign crowds that apartheid is &quot;an albatross&quot; around the country's neck.    Thus, while police in Cape Town used dogs and whips to chase blacks off an all-white beach, police in Durban and Johannesburg stood idly by while non-whites reported for treatment at white hospitals. Though scores of workers have been arrested for singing liberation songs on commuter trains, students have paraded freely with an ANC flag. While some rallies have been banned or broken up by tear gas, others have been allowed to proceed. Some activists have been detained for violating their restriction orders, but others work in the open wearing T-shirts of their banned organizations.    &quot;The National Party accepts that it can't intellectually defend apartheid anymore,&quot; says Mr. Saloojee. &quot;The conditions in the country now are such that there is no going backward to the primitive segregation system. We can only move forward, and it can be done without violence.&quot;    This, of course, remains to be seen, as the defiance organizers continue their push forward and the police stand poised to resist. But should large-scale violence be avoided, the anti-apartheid movement will claim a big victory.    &quot;While the defiance campaign of the '50s was intended to simply defy the apartheid laws, this one is intended to also show an alternative to apartheid,&quot; says Mr. Coovadia. &quot;People will see that the opening of facilities {to all races} won't bring Armageddon to South Africa.&quot;    Still, a lot of convincing lies ahead. When members of the banned Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee, an affiliate of the UDF, recently sold T-shirts and distributed anti-apartheid leaflets at a table in an upscale shopping center in the city's white suburbs, they were confronted by an angry group of old-car enthusiasts who were promoting their hobby at the same shopping center.    While a string quartet played chamber music, officials of the Piston Ring Club lobbied police to remove the anti-apartheid group's pamphleteers, who eventually left on their own. &quot;They're getting in our way,&quot; complained the owner of a 1960 Lancia Appia, the car nearest the table. &quot;Why can't they go and defy somewhere else?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
