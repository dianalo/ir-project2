Thereare two types of routes to chaos depending on the modulation frequency.When the modulation frequency is at least 1.7 times higher than the relaxationfrequency, period-two instabilities are easily induced the period-twoand the period-four instabilities are observed on the way to chaos.</TEXT></DOC>
