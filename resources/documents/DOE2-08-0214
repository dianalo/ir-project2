<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-0214 </DOCNO><TEXT>Within a non-markovian theory of collective nuclear motion large-amplitudegiant vibrations occur in the initial stage of nucleus-nucleus collisions.These vibrations give rise to a probability of the order 10/sup -6/ forthe emission of a giant quadrupole gamma with about 22 MeV in the fusionprocess of Zr + Zr at low energies. In central collisions of Pb on Snabove the barrier a quasi-elastic recoil is predicted. Further effectsrelated to giant modes in nucleus-nucleus collisions are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
