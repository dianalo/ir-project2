Given the clearincentive to revitalize the sluggish nuclear industries, their modularreactor approach is intended to create trouble-less, low management-riskreactors. Their major goals seem to be a low management risk, suitabilityfor export, and shortened construction schedule. Modular reactors appearto have many advantages over large reactors that can apply not only tothe U.S. but to Japan as well, serving for improvement of manufactures'productivity, significant saving of engineering costs, design simplification,reduction of licensing procedures and plant site work, improvement ofplant availability, high export potential, significant reduction of totallearning costs, expanded selection of plant sites, market-proximate anddispersed siting, reasonable reduction of required isolation distance,and creation of competitive environs. In Japan, most of the R and D itemsscheduled for the next decade are geared towards large reactors. Theadvantages of modular reactors, however, would be far-reaching even inJapan, and it would be desirable that their design details and characteristicsbe evaluated immediately, based on which appropriate follow-on activitiesshould be initiated.
