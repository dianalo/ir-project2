(products).andO;Product:   Ami (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationSoftware Packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ami: Samna's $200 Windows-based Word Processor Goes for Style Writing is atext-centered activity.andP;  Microsoft Windows is a graphical environment.andP;  Sowhy write under Windows?andP;  Two of the better reasons are to getgraphics-assisted (WYSIWYG) formatting and to take advantage of Window'sDynamic Data Exchange capability.andM;The newest Windows-based word processor, Samna's Ami, Version 1.0, ignoresDDE; you won't be able to program &quot;live&quot; connections between Ami documentsand, say, your favorite Windows database program.andP;  But Ami is long onformatting services, and--particularly for those who write short documentsthat need a lot of visual punch--its formatting strength compensates nicelyfor the slowness inherent in the graphics environment.andM;Ami's formatting capability is built on two constructs: style sheet andframe.andP;  A style sheet is a stored set of formatting instructions.andP;  A frame isan island within a document--a region whose formatting is not affected bythat of the main document.andP;  Frames let you import graphics into Ami documentsand flow text around them.andM;The style sheet concept will be familiar to Microsoft Word users, but Ami'sstyle sheets differ significantly from Word's.andP;  First, every Ami document isattached to some style sheet; the new-file command automatically presents youwith a dialog box forcing you to choose from a list of style sheets.andP;  Second,Ami style sheets can include text as well as formatting.andM;Having text built into the style sheet violates the principle of separatingtext and formatting, but the violation makes sense.andP;  Samna has correctlyperceived that in many standard documents (memos, for example) certain textelements (such as the to, from, date, and subject headings) belong to thedocument's skeleton, not to its flesh.andP;  Those Ami style sheets that doinclude text may be used either with or without their verbal contents, so Amilets you have it both ways.andM;The style sheet's contents may include bullets and numbers for numberedlists.andP;  The latter are really numeric variables; Ami displays and prints thecorrect numbers no matter how you rearrange the list.andM;Samna includes 26 predefined style sheets along with a booklet describingtheir use.andP;  The included style sheets are designed for memoranda, reports,overheads, newsletters, proposals, press releases, and books; within eachcategory are sheets for casual (and dot matrix) use and others for formalpresentations.andP;  The booklet effectively demonstrates Ami's power to makebueatiful documents and gently points out some aesthetic do's and don't's.andM;Using Ami's style sheets is a snap.andP;  A windows &quot;child window&quot; lists the styleelements defined in the current style sheet.andP;  To assign a style element to aparagraph, you just put the cursor anywhere in the paragraph and click themouse on the desired element (or press the function key that you've assignedto that element).andP;  Changing style parameters and creating new style sheets isjust as easy.andP;  Gorgoeus dialog boxes guide you through the entire process andlet you see the effect of any changes before you return to the document.andM;One important shortcoming in Ami's style-sheet implementation: nothing in thenormal screen display tells you the name of the current style sheet.andM;Frames in Ami can hold either text or graphics.andP;  The program supports the.PCX Version 3 and .TIF Version 4 file formats, as well as all graphicformats supported by the Windows Clipboard.andP;  Putting text in a frame is handyfor such things as making drop capitals to mark the beginning of majordocument sections.andM;When you create a frame, Ami presents you with a small box in the center ofthe screen.andP;  After sizing and positioning the frame, you can import your textor figure.andP;  A graphic, once installed, can be kept at its full original size,resized to fit the frame dimensions, or simply cropped to please.andM;A variety of &quot;flowing&quot; options let you control the way the main documentinteracts with the frame.andP;  You can have the main text flow all around theframe, like a stream around a rock.andP;  Or you can have it jump over the frame(so there's no text to the left or right of the frame).andP;  Or you can simplyrun the text through the frame as though it weren't there--specifying wherethe frame contents are either transparent or opaque.andM;So much for the good news.andP;  What's less than fabulous about Ami is therelatively slow screen update that comes from working in a graphicsenvironment.andP;  However, in order to cope with this constraint Samna included a&quot;draft mode&quot; in which Ami displays words only--with no formatting whatsoever.andO;For maximum speed, you can work blind in draft mode and just toggle in andout of &quot;layout&quot; mode when you want to check how things are going to look onpaper.andM;Writing in draft mode is something like writing in the Windows Notepad.andP;  Thefont is the same, and the screen performance is comparable.andP;  As any Windowsuser knows, you can move through a page of Notepad a lot more quickly thanyou can move through a page of Windows Write (which is comparable to Ami'slayout mode).andP;  But it's still nothing like blasting through a document whilewriting in XyWrite.andM;Three additional complaints: search-and-replace options are limited, and tosearch only, you have to specify a null replacement field; scrolling inlayout mode is page oriented, which means you never get to see the end of onepage and the beginning of the next at the same time; and the manual is quitea bit on the light side.andM;Ami has no thesaurus, but it does include a decent spelling checker.andP;  It alsohas no merge capability.andP;  Look for more-advanced features such as these inAmi Professional, a souped-up version scheduled for shipment in the spring.andM;The bottom line?andP;  For short, highly formatted and/or highly standardizeddocuments, Ami is a capable product and a pleasure to use.andP;  For plaineroutput and high-volume production, use your favorite text-based processor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
