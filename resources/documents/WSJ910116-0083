Cubic Defense Systems, a unit of the San Diego-baseddefense contractor, admitted to a federal judge inAlexandria, Va., that it paid for sensitive governmentinformation useful in obtaining Air Force contracts. CubicDefense Systems agreed to pay the government $4,650,000, ofwhich $1.5 million was a criminal fine. Colvin Wellborn,former chief executive officer of Cubic Defense Systems,faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000fine, according to the Justice Department.</LP><TEXT>   William Stewart, Cubic Corp.'s general counsel, said thatthe subsidiary's guilty plea &quot;involved the isolated conductof a single former officer&quot; and that the defense unit &quot;hasput this matter behind it.&quot;   The guilty pleas mark the 41st and 42nd convictionsarising from the investigation of defense procurement fraudand public corruption known as Operation Ill Wind.   Cubic Defense Systems and Mr. Wellborn admitted that theexecutive hired a prominent Washington defense consultant,William Galvin, to assist the concern in obtaining Pentagoncontracts. According to the pleas, Mr. Galvin receivedsensitive procurement information from a senior Air Forceacquisitions official, Victor Cohen, who, in return, receivedindirect payments, gifts, assistance in opening a Swiss bankaccount and promises of future employment.   The bribery conspiracy was aimed at obtaining internalPentagon documents on the purchase of airborne reconnaissancesystems and certain air combat training equipment, amongother things. The company and its collaborators used phonypaperwork to conceal payments to Mr. Galvin and then used thesame paperwork to claim reimbursement from the government onexisting Air Force contracts, according to court documents.   Mr. Galvin, a major figure in the procurement scandal, wassentenced to 32 months in prison after pleading guilty tobribing Mr. Cohen and another senior Pentagon official toinfluence the awarding of military contracts.   Mr. Cohen, who is still employed by the Air Force, isunder investigation but hasn't been charged with anywrongdoing. He couldn't be reached for comment. His attorneyhas protested that prosecutors have improperly put pressureon people under the threat of prosecution to name Mr. Cohenin incriminating court documents.   Cubic Corp. said in a statement released by its attorneysthat neither the parent company &quot;nor any of its othersubsidiaries or divisions were involved in the matters underinvestigation.&quot;   Cubic Defense Systems and Mr. Wellborn have agreed tocooperate with the investigation, which is headed by the U.S.attorney's office in Alexandria.</TEXT></DOC>
