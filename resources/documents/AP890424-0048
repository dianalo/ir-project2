Summit participants issued a call for greater government actionon education, housing, black employment and drugs, among otherthings.   Jesse Jackson's Saturday speech and Louis Farrakhan's fierySunday morning address drew the conference's largest and mostenthusiastic crowds, estimated at 1,000 at the New OrleansConvention Center.   But only a week before, organizers predicted a crowd of at least2,000. And 17 years earlier, 2,700 came to a similar meetingHatcher organized in Gary.   Delegates, however, expressed little disappointment at theturnout.   ``The significant thing is that we came together,'' said SheldonKing, a delegate from Chicago.   The summit's invitation to Farrakhan, a controversial BlackMuslim minister, prompted at least one black Republican leader,Fred Brown of New York, to boycott the conference.   Conservative blacks who boycotted because of Farrakhan lost achance to have their voices heard, said King.   The meeting ended Sunday with distribution and discussion of thesummit's social and political agenda for the next decade.   Several delegates complained during the closing session that theseven-page document failed to address all problems with specificsolutions. But Hatcher stressed that the agenda was far fromfinished and that the summit steering committee would continue towork on it.   The preliminary agenda included calls for:   _ Preservation of black family life.   _ More government involvement in providing housing for the poor,including a reduction in ``red tape'' in making federallyforeclosed housing available for private ownership by the poor.   _ A call for increased government spending on education and ``ahalt to the rush to implement testing, certification schemes andother devices designed to basically eliminate black teachers fromthe public school systems.''   _ Support for government and private programs designed toincrease black employment and business investment opportunities.   _ Work to end apartheid in South Africa, including support foreconomic sanctions against that nation.   _ Reparations to compensate blacks for hundreds of years ofslave labor and poor economic conditions. What form suchreparations should take was not specified.   _ A full-scale attack on drugs that ``should not begin and endat the borders of the African American communities.''</TEXT></DOC>
