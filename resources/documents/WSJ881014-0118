Terms weren't disclosed. Kidder is a brokerage services and investment banking unit of General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn.    Max C. Chapman Jr., Kidder's president and chief operating officer, said the tie with the Milan firm expands Kidder's Italian business &quot;and is the first step in our plan to position our firm strategically in a number of key locations&quot; in Europe.    Mr. Chapman added that Kidder is seeking links with foreign &quot;investment banking firms with a high degree of local market knowledge.&quot; Kidder is in talks with several firms in other countries and hopes to establish more such ventures by year's end, the executive said.    The Italian firm was founded by 38-year-old Jody Vender, an Italian businessman, and is controlled by the Vender family. The firm, which employs more than 100 people, had about $154 million of equity capital at June 30. Shares totaling a 20% stake trade on the Milan Stock Exchange.    As part of the deal, Kidder will acquire a 5% stake in the Italian parent, and an option for an additional 5% from an investment bank controlled by the Venders. And by July 1, Kidder will acquire 25% of Pasfin with an option to boost this stake to 50%, subject to Pasfin's approval. </TEXT></DOC>
