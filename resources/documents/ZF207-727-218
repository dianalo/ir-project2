GianoneandM;As &quot;proprietor&quot; of the non-proprietary Kermit file-transfer protocol, I'vetraveled to Europe, the Far East and the Soviet Union in recent years toconduct seminars and workshops for Kermit users and developers.andP;  And I'vecome to realize that the great computer marketplace of the West -- the UnitedStates, Canada, Great Britain and Australia -- has placed an onerous burdenon the rest of the world: Compute in English (or, perhaps more to the point,compute in ASCII .andP;  .  .  or sometimes EBCDIC)!andM;No doubt it will be many years before the operating systems and userinterfaces of the dominant computers speak to users in their own languages.andO;In my experience, most computer users in other lands are not terriblyconcerned about this.andP;  But what they are concerned about is the ability tocreate documents in their own languages.andP;  For almost any language other thanEnglish, this requires the computer to support &quot;special characters&quot; --accented vowels and so forth.andP;  For languages such as Russian, Arabic, Greek,Hebrew or Cherokee, an entirely different alphabet is required.andP;  ForJapanese, Chinese or Korean, the computer must have a repertoire of thousandsof ideograms.andM;Many computer manufacturers have begun to provide these capabilities to theirinternational customers.andP;  A PC's screen can display the required characters;its printers can print them; and there is often some arcane method by whichthe user can actually key them in.andP;  (&quot;Hold down the Alt key and type threedigits representing the decimal code for the character .andP;  .  .&quot;) Thesecompanies even make special &quot;national&quot; versions of their products for manycountries.andP;  A Portuguese version of a PC, for example, might include keys forthe Portuguese special characters -- accented vowels, upside-down questionand exclamation marks and so on -- as well as versions of these characters inthe PC's character-generation ROM.andP;  With any luck, these characters will alsoappear correctly when sent to a locally attached printer.andM;So far, so good.andP;  But what happens when there is a need to share thisinternational text? Suppose a Portuguese PC user creates a file on herPortuguese PC, writes it onto a disk and mails the disk to a branch office inNorway, where there are Norwegian-version PCs -- same manufacturer, same PCmodel, just different national versions?andP;  Many of the special characters willbe misinterpreted by the Norwegian-version PC.andP;  The Portuguese uppercase Owith tilde will become a Norwegian umlauted O. An uppercase O with graveaccent will become an upper-left corner box-drawing character.andP;  And so on.andM;Now what happens if this same file is transferred somehow to a computer fromanother manufacturer?andP;  In all likelihood, the results will be even worse.andM;Although national and international bodies have produced a series of standardcharacter sets, very few manufacturers use them.andP;  Instead, each manufacturerhas its own private method of encoding &quot;special&quot; characters, eachincompatible with the other.andM;To make matters worse, very few computer file systems include any kind ofidentification for which character set was used in creating a particularfile.andP;  So if a computer supports several different character sets -- as manydo -- it is incumbent upon the user to remember which one was used for whichfile.andM;That's not all.andP;  With the incredibly sophisticated technology at our disposaltoday, what prevents us from creating documents that contain a mixture oflanguages?andP;  I don't mean just German, French and Spanish -- we can do thatnow -- but Greek, Hebrew, Icelandic, Russian, Japanese? Suppose, for example,that I have a business with an international clientele.andP;  Shouldn't I be ableto represent their names and addresses correctly in my customer database,print them correctly on my mailing lists, and spell their names right in myboilerplate letters?andP;  Today, unless I buy an expensive, proprietary&quot;multilingual&quot; PC software package, I'm out of luck.andP;  Even if I do this, thefiles I create with it will be incompatible with every other application onthe same computer, let alone other computers.andM;The Kermit file-transfer protocol was recently extended to allow text filesin a variety of languages and character sets to be transferred between unlikecomputers.andP;  Kermit will use ISO and other standard character sets fortransmission of textual data, converting to and from each computer's local,private character codes.andP;  But to make use of Kermit's new ability, users willoften be required to specify manually which character set or sets have beenused to encode each file -- a painful process.andP;  Why?andP;  Because most computerfile systems don't record this sort of information.andM;An explosion in demand for international computing and data communication isinevitable.andP;  How can we prepare for it?andP;  The answer comes in two parts.andO;First, computer manufacturers must give their customers the ability to createfiles in different languages.andP;  Many have done this already.andP;  Second, filescreated on these computers must be marked according to the character setsused.andP;  This will allow computer applications -- including data-communicationsoftware -- to correctly interpret the characters within each file.andM;If these steps are followed, then many of the needs of the internationalmarketplace will be met, and -- perhaps most important -- it will becomepossible for reliable, automated procedures to interchange text in alllanguages between computers of all makers, in our own country and in allcountries of the world.andM;----------Christine M.
