The principal bullish influences were renewed inflation concerns and a threat by South Africa to cut shipments of strategic metals if the U.S. increases economic sanctions against it.    Platinum for July delivery advanced $12.90 an ounce to $539.50. June delivery gold gained $3.50 an ounce to $448.80. July delivery silver rose nine cents an ounce to $6.5450.    Inflation is growing, both world-wide and in the U.S., said James T. Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Commodities Corp., a Cambridge, Mass., futures trading adviser.    One reason that inflation concerns came out yesterday, Mr. Kneafsey said, were comments made by Federal Reserve Board members Martha Seger and Robert Heller. According to a wire service report, Ms. Seger said that the economy in the past few months had been stronger than expected but that the Fed &quot;is not chickening out&quot; on inflation.    Mr. Heller, according to the report, said that U.S. monetary growth is at the high end of targets and that growth in many countries is exceeding targets.    Other factors for inflation concerns, Mr. Kneafsey said, were yesterday's sharp rallies in such basic commodities as soybeans, cotton and copper. These gains helped raise the Commodity Research Bureau Index to a four-month high of 236.03, a gain of 1.48.    &quot;This is about an 0.7% increase, which is a significant rise,&quot; Mr. Kneafsey said.    As for news reports on South Africa's possible cut in shipments of strategic metals, William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York, observed: &quot;I don't think it would be in South Africa's interest to do so.&quot; But he acknowledged the threat bolstered prices.    An estimated 85% to 90% of the free world supply of platinum comes from South Africa.    Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metal analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, termed platinum &quot;the powerhouse&quot; in driving precious metals prices higher. The South African threat was the main influence, he said, but &quot;the Japanese returned from their holiday and were active buyers of platinum.&quot; Mr. Savaiko added that gold was influenced mainly by the inflationary fears.    In other commodity futures markets yesterday:   GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices rose amid speculation about export offers to Egypt and the Soviet Union, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The Agriculture Department is rumored to be mulling an offer to subsidize the sale of one million metric tons of U.S. wheat to both countries. As part of its campaign to reduce U.S. stockpiles, the department compensates exporters that sell U.S. wheat at cheap rates to targeted nations. Wheat futures prices also were bouyed by speculation that the Agriculture Department will forecast today that this year's U.S. winter wheat harvest will rise only slightly. According to Mr. Lespinasse, the average estimate among market analysts is that the department will peg the winter wheat crop -- which is harvested around June -- at 1.578 billion bushels compared with last year's harvest of 1.563 billion bushels. Soybean futures prices also rose yesterday amid speculation that the department will forecast that U.S. soybean stockpiles will drop to roughly 200 million bushels by the fall of 1989, compared with its forecast of a 290 million bushel stockpile this fall. Chicago-based Candamp;D Commodities contributed to yesterday's price rise by buying futures contracts for roughly 12 million bushels of soybeans. Corn futures prices slipped.    COPPER: Futures prices rose as traders saw improved demand and somewhat tighter supplies. July delivery copper advanced 2.50 cents a pound to 94.65 cents. Inventories in the London Metal Exchange warehouse fell 3,650 tons to 41,425 tons. An analyst noted that premiums for nearby futures contracts over more deferred ones widened yesterday. This analyst said that indicated demand, which has been sluggish in the past several weeks, has begun to perk up.    COTTON: Futures prices advanced in response to dry weather in growing areas, which could affect the progress of the crops. July delivery cotton rose 1.42 cents a pound to 63.15 cents. December, reflecting the cotton season to begin Aug. 1, was the biggest gainer, rising 1.74 cents to 58.44 cents. According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., dry weather in areas of Texas and in the Mississippi Valley, from Missouri to Louisiana, presented a potential threat to the newly planted crop. He specifically mentioned the lower Rio Grande Valley, which is the first area to be planted in the U.S., beginning last month, and Texas's coastal bend and Abilene sections. </TEXT></DOC>
