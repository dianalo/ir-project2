There are a number of solutionsto this problem and the most viable seem to be removed of acidic materialsfrom emissions and by working collectively on western and coal problems.Research at the INEL has focused on using biotechnology as a means ofcleaning coal. Since organic sulfur is the predominant sulfur speciasin western coal the biological efforts have focused on removal of organicsulfur. Other biological research in the field has shown that inorganicpyrites can also be effectively removed from coal. While more researchis required, results for biological removal of organic sulfur is encouraging.One exciting new development not directly related to coal cleaning isthe potential of using biological organisms to liquefy wast lignite materials.As a second solution to the challenge posed by acid deposition, the INELis seeking to form a western fossil energy research establishment composedof regional universities, national laboratories and industry. It is hopedthat through this establishment, more effective and economical productionand uses of western coal can be achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
