Also, if the medium has finitelength, the Cerenkov radiation is diffracted. Not only is the angle ofemission broadened but the emission threshold is not sharp. At measurementangles in the vicinity of 90{sup 0}, the Fourier transforms of the chargedistribution within a bunch may be determined for both the Cerenkov andsub-Cerenkov cases.</TEXT></DOC>
