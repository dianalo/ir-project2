The non-Japanese spouses or parents who went to internment campsto be with their families were not included in the Civil LibertiesAct of 1988 that authorized the reparations, so the JusticeDepartment has begun work on new legislation that would allowpayments to them.   There were approximately 80 such non-Japanese interned; thedepartment estimates 40 are still alive.   ``In reality, these non-Japanese spouses and parents wereconfronted by a horrifying choice,'' the department said Thursday inits proposed regulations for distribution of money to the 60,000Japanese-Americans.   ``They could either `elect' to accompany their spouses orchildren throughout the removal and internment process, or choose tobe separated from them,'' the regulations said.   About 120,000 American citizens and permanent resident aliens ofJapanese ancestry were affected by the evacuations from the WestCoast. The department said only about 60,000 people are eligible forthe payments that will cost a total of about $1.25 billion. Congresshas not yet appropriated funds.   The oldest survivors must be paid first.   Under the law, payments go to those confined, held in custody,relocated or ``otherwise deprived of liberty or property'' from Dec.7, 1941, to June 30, 1946, because of U.S. actions based on theirJapanese ancestry.   To be eligible, said Robert Bratt of the department's Office ofRedress Administration, ``you had to be living'' when then-PresidentReagan signed the law, Aug. 10, 1988.   ``But, people are dying at a rate of about 200 people per month.If your parent died after Aug. 10, 1988, then you're eligible as asurvivor,'' said Bratt.   The first recipient would be the surviving spouse, followed bychildren and parents, if there are any, he said, adding that thedepartment is responsible for dividing the $20,000 equally amongseveral children.   Each member of a family evacuated and interned will becompensated, so a family of four still surviving would receive$80,000, Bratt said.   Compensation also will go to Japanese-American soldiers who lostproperty or were unable to visit with their interned families,according to the proposed regulations.   Groups not entitled to compensation, the regulations say, includethose who evacuated voluntarily and those who relocated to Japanduring the war. In addition, minors who were U.S. citizens but whomoved to Japan with their parents during the war will not receivepayments.   The proposed regulations, to be published in the FederalRegister, will be open for 30 days of public comment. The departmentwould not say when it expects final regulations to be issued.</TEXT></DOC>
