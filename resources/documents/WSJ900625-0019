But make way for the big-picture optimists who see glorydays for gold -- and gloom and doom for just about everythingelse -- around the corner, or maybe the corner after that.</LP><TEXT>   Lawrence H. Heim says gold is headed for $8,000 an ounce.James Dines sees $5,000 in gold's future. Anthony V. Caldarobelieves gold can reach $2,400. R.E. McMaster expects $1,000.   When these prices might be achieved isn't a question thatelicits very specific answers. For the most part, thesepeople view gold as an underpriced standard of value in adebt-ridden, problem-plagued world. At some point, they feel,the negative financial and economic factors will become socrushing that the inherent stability and value of gold willsuddenly become prized and cause its price to explode.Current declines are only transitory, they say.   For example, Mr. Heim, who says he advised traders to getout of gold during the 1980s until 1989, links his gold boomprediction to overheated government money-printing presses.   Mr. Heim, who edits the Heim Investment Letter inPortland, Ore., and heads a gold and silver dealership,predicts a &quot;panic into gold&quot; that will be touched off by acollapse of the dollar and by the &quot;outrageous&quot; governmentalcreation of money over the past decade that has led to acrushing national debt.   Mr. Heim adds up a national debt of $3 trillion, a moneysupply of $4 trillion and half of the $6 trillion he says thegovernment has in guarantees and obligations and comes upwith a &quot;federal level of money&quot; of $10 trillion for the U.S.Dividing that by the 262 million ounces of gold he says theU.S. has in stock, he says, &quot;gold would have to be over$38,000 an ounce to back this `money' 100%.&quot; He doesn't carethat the dollar is no longer officially backed by gold -- ina crunch, the values of all currencies historically have beenmeasured against gold, he asserts -- nor that there isn'twide recognition of his &quot;federal level of money&quot; concept.   Mr. Heim is undaunted. &quot;Only 10% backing would amount to$3,000 an ounce for gold, which {would be} around 10 timeswhere it is now,&quot; he says. &quot;I really think 20% backing iswhat we will eventually see, so that would make the value ofgold close to $8,000 per ounce.&quot;   The advance to that level will take place over the nextseveral years, he says. The current weakness in gold istransitory and &quot;will only make for a greater profit,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Dines, editor of the Dines Letter in Belvedere,Calif., was among the famous gold bugs when the metal rose toa record $875 an ounce in 1980. When he first told hisclients that the price would rise from $35 to $400, he says,&quot;I thought I would get arrested,&quot; and so he tempered hisprediction. Now, he thinks gold will top $2,000 in the nextfive years and climb to between $3,000 and $5,000 by the endof the decade.   These prices will be brought about by some kind ofmonetary crisis, probably in the banking system, he says.&quot;Just look at the savings-and-loan mess, where the bailout isnow estimated at $500 billion. I've been warning abouttrouble in the banking system for over 10 years, and thatincludes the entire banking system. The savings-and-loansituation is just the first shoe dropping.&quot;   Mr. Dines believes that the Soviets have been selling goldright along, contrary to reports that they slowed down inMay. &quot;They have been selling gold to survive,&quot; he says.Silver has resisted going down with gold and has actuallyrisen, he notes.   &quot;As soon as the Soviet selling stops, gold will rise againand catch up with silver,&quot; Mr. Dines says. This move couldset the stage for an &quot;explosive surge that will ignite ashort-covering panic that will accelerate the rally.&quot;   Mr. Caldaro, editor of Long Term Trends, an investornewsletter in Columbia, Md., sees gold going to more than$2,000 an ounce by 1995 because he believes interest rateswill rise to more than 10% by late this year and to 14% to15% by 1992 or 1993.   He says prices in the 30-year bond market topped out inDecember 1989 in what he terms a &quot;major cyclical low&quot; forinterest rates and that the stock market reached its peakthis month. He thinks the U.S. will get an &quot;inflationaryrecession&quot; like the one that took place in the late 1970s andearly 1980s that will last until 1992 and will trigger a&quot;flight to safety&quot; -- to gold.   Mr. Caldaro says the real &quot;kicker&quot; in gold's climb willcome in 1992, when the government's printing presses go intohigh gear, churning out money to get the economy out of arecession.   &quot;This will create an economic expansion that will devaluethe dollar vs. its buying power, and a rush to gold will takeplace,&quot; he says. Among the calamities Mr. Caldaro foreseesenhancing gold, in addition to the inflation he expects tocontinue through the 1990s, is a stock market crash and acollapse of the dollar. &quot;Any one of those could happen,&quot; hesays.   Mr. McMaster, in the May 24 issue of his newsletter, TheReaper, published in Phoenix, Ariz., deals extensively withgold and its undervaluation. He cites &quot;other studies&quot; that hesays &quot;indicate that gold should be priced at approximately$1,200 an ounce to cover U.S. net liquid liabilities.&quot;   He says: &quot;Gold, as I see it, is a time bomb. Gold is achaos hedge. Gold at any time could explode the deception anddelusion which has driven the debt-ridden post-WWII financialworld.&quot; He, too, thinks the withdrawal of the Soviet Union asa gold seller will help the metal's price rebound.   Not all extremist thinkers are bulls, however. RobertPrechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist in Gainesville,Ga., said in 1980, after gold had hit $875: &quot;On a long-termbasis, gold won't be attractive as an investment until itfalls below $200 an ounce.&quot;   That statement still holds, according to David Allman, Mr.Prechter's director of research, who says Mr. Prechter nolonger gives interviews. The gold market is still in acorrection from that record high, Mr. Allman says, andaccording to a series of historical chart patterns could dropas low in the next few years as the $105 an ounce it reachedin 1976.   Deflation rather than inflation is the great danger, Mr.Allman says, and could cause the price decline. Historicalpatterns show that after a surge of inflation, such as theone that ran through 1980, there is a leveling-period duringwhich stock and real estate prices boom. That has alreadytaken place, he says. Then comes a period -- which he says isnow beginning -- in which commodities and real estate sag.   &quot;This will ultimately be followed by a drop in stockprices as well, which will culminate in a general deflation.The early warning signs are already present in the priceaction of gold,&quot; Mr. Allman says.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Crude oil prices jumped Friday in a market driven bytechnical factors, but traders remain wary of buying in amarket glutted with crude. Trading in the crude oil pit atthe New York Mercantile Exchange Friday was at times thelightest of the week. Many market participants are expectingprices to decline slowly during the next several weeks.   Production by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries has swamped the market with crude. Even modestcutbacks by Kuwait, an OPEC member that had been flagrantlyviolating its quota, have barely affected the huge quantitiesof crude being offered for sale.                                                                                                          Orange Juice                                                                                                          Frozen orange juice concentrate prices are expected tosettle down, according to Celeste Georgakis, tropicalcommodities analyst at Cargill Investors Services Inc. in NewYork. She says that prices two weeks ago were sent into atailspin by a combination of the Federal Reserve Board'sstatements about achieving a zero inflation rate and a majorBrazilian processor offering to sell juice at pricessubstantially under those quoted by other producers.   &quot;It appears that this processor was offering juice at adiscount for technical reasons -- a lack of storage space,&quot;Ms. Georgakis says. Other major Brazilian processors didn'tfollow with price cuts. However, after the price cut wasannounced, the U.S. futures market fell below a technicalsupport level at $1.89 a pound, which had held since lastDecember's freeze. Once that level gave way, prices plummetedto under $1.70.   Ms. Georgakis pointed out that the processors and dealersstarted to buy as prices began to sink, slowing the decline.Additional buying came in under the $1.70 level fromshort-sellers who were evening positions that profited fromweakening prices. That buying kicked off the rally thatdominated the market most of last week.   The Cargill analyst says she expects prices for the Julycontract to rise no higher than $1.90 and to fall no lowerthan $1.80. She says there is an unusually large total ofmore than 4,000 July contracts outstanding. She also says shethinks some speculative short-sellers and commodity fundsholding short positions are still in the market and will haveto buy back their positions in the next few sessions, whichcould fuel a rally to about $1.90. The first day that juiceprocessors can give notice to the exchange that they intendto deliver juice is next Monday.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          The highlight this week is a quarterly hog survey slatedfor release by the Agriculture Department Friday.   The big question is whether high hog prices are promptingfarmers to expand their herds. Such a development would helpindicate when hog prices might ease enough to bring porkprices in the supermarket down from their current recordlevels.   Jerry Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp;Sons, said the government's June 1 survey probably found thatthe nation's hog herd continued to shrink. He calculates thatthe population dropped 1% from June 1989. What's more, thenumber of piglets born in March, April and May probablydeclined 2% -- indicating relatively tight supplies for therest of the year. It takes about six months to fatten a hog.   Because of the seasonal breeding pattern, the supply offattened hogs should increase in the fall from the relativelytight levels expected this summer. But some analysts don'texpect to see any significant year-to-year increase in thesupply of fattened hogs until early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
