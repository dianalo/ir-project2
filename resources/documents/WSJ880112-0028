Albert Gore has distinguished himself from the other Democratic presidential contenders by adopting a more hawkish posture on foreign and defense issues. This has struck a responsive chord in his native South, propelling him toward the front of the pack for the March 8 &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; constellation of primaries. The initial success of this stratagem, however, reveals more about the Democratic field than about Sen. Gore. That he can play the hawk, given his 11-year record in the House and Senate, shows what a dovish flock he's flying with.    During his legislative career, Sen. Gore voted &quot;right&quot; on 57% of the foreign and defense issues chosen by the liberal Americans for Democratic Action for its congressional score card. Conversely, he was &quot;right&quot; on only 40% of the votes rated by the conservative American Security Council. These results jibe neatly with each other, and are further reinforced by the impartial National Journal, on whose foreign-policy scale Sen. Gore has averaged 61% &quot;liberal&quot; and 38% &quot;conservative.&quot;    This record places Sen. Gore moderately to the dovish side of center of the congressional spectrum. How does he compare with the other Democratic contenders? Gary Hart and Paul Simon both are nearly pure doves, each having voted to ADA's liking 92% of the time, while Mr. Hart has managed to please the American Security Council 15% of the time and Mr. Simon only 7%. Rep. Richard Gephart, on the other hand, has a record very similar to Sen. Gore's -- 59% right with ADA and 39% right with the ASC. (Of the three Democratic contenders who haven't served in Congress, Michael Dukakis is an extreme dove; Jesse Jackson is even to the left of that; and Bruce Babbitt, though temperamentally a moderate, has pointedly identified himself with the party's liberal wing on Central America.)    Sen. Gore, in short, is somewhat more hawkish than the Democratic field, but his record is a far cry from that of, say, Sen. Sam Nunn, a genuine Democratic hawk in the tradition of Sen. Henry Jackson. Mr. Nunn's votes won ADA approval only 32% of the time, that of the ASC 72%.    Ironically, the multiple primaries of &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; were engineered by Southern Democrats in the hope of maximizing their region's impact on the nominating process and perhaps serving as a springboard for the likes of Sen. Nunn -- the only kind of candidate Southern Democratic politicos believe can carry their region in the general election. When he and former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia both decided against making the race, they left a vacuum on the party's hawkish flank that Mr. Gore has moved to fill.    But the ambiguity of Mr. Gore's record is underscored by the fact that Mr. Gephart, with a virtually identical record, is running as a dove. Perhaps the best perspective was offered by Rep. Tom Downey, one of Mr. Gore's liberal backers, who suggested that &quot;as a matter of tactics for the campaign&quot; the various Democrats may be &quot;maximizing minimal differences,&quot; and that &quot;viewed against the backdrop of what Al {Gore} and Paul {Simon} and Dick {Gephart} want to do on arms control, {their stands on national security} are not that contradictory, they are just magnified by the political process.&quot;    Indeed, the difference between Sen. Gore's tally on the various legislative score cards and the scores of some of the other Democrats may exaggerate the philosophical distance separating them. The issues on which Sen. Gore has differed with the doves have been mostly minor ones. In contrast, Sen. Bill Bradley staked out his turf as a centrist by breaking ranks with the majority of fellow Democrats on such cutting-edge issues as aid to the Nicaraguan resistance and support for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Sen. Gore has consistently opposed Contra aid and voted for numerous cuts and restrictions on SDI.    He also sided with the doves on such critical votes as the repeal of the Clark Amendment that had prohibited aid to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels in Angola and the landmark 1984 vote on El Salvador when then Majority Leader Jim Wright led some 50-odd Democrats in supporting the administration's request for military aid to the new Duarte government.    The one really important and controversial issue on which Sen. Gore broke with the doves was on nuclear-weapons policy. To his credit, he took arms control seriously, not as a mere shibboleth. He became a champion of the &quot;Midgetman,&quot; a small, single-warhead ICBM that he saw as a key to nuclear stability. He helped broker a compromise with the Reagan administration that provided for developing Midgetman while proceeding to build 50 MX missiles.    Yet for all the question marks, Sen. Gore's stance may still benefit his party. For two decades all the momentum in Democratic presidential contests has been leftward. The only Democrat who did not try to out-dove his opponents (aside from protest candidate George Wallace) was Jackson, and his failure seemed only to confirm the absence of running room on that side of the Democratic spectrum. Even Democrats with hawkish records -- such as Sen. Fritz Hollings in 1984 -- sought to repackage themselves as doves. By breaking with this tradition, Sen. Gore may help to restore a measure of balance to his party's deliberations. By decrying those who support &quot;indiscriminate cuts in the defense budget,&quot; he may help to re-create an atmosphere in which Democrats decide foreign and defense positions by deliberation rather than dovish reflex.    Moreover, Sen. Gore's own political evolution is not necessarily completed. Having made this break with Democratic tradition, he may go further, as a candidate or as a president. In underscoring his difference with the other Democrats, he has begun to stress his support for President Reagan's invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya, and for the reflagging of tankers in the Persian Gulf.    These all are, or were, important issues, but none is a particularly risky stand. So far, Sen. Gore apparently hopes to capture hawkish voters in Southern primaries without doing anything to make the doves really angry at him. But, given his dovish record, the only way he'll make believers out of the hawks is by taking some courageous positions that burn bridges to the doves -- say, by throwing his support behind aid to the Contras or a robust SDI program. Until he takes that kind of step, his quarrel with the other Democrats, though better for his party than his pledge to the Women's Political Caucus for a 50% female administration, will look like little more than another campaign maneuver.    ---   Mr. Muravchik is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a one-time staffer to Sen.
