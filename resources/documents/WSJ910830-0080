It blazed the wildcatters' trail inCalifornia, seemed to drill the deepest holes, awed rivalswith an offshore platform taller than the Sears Tower androse to No. 1 among U.S. gasoline retailers with 9,400stations sporting its yellow seashell signs.   It also refused to follow the rest of the industry withlayoffs during the Oil Patch collapse of 1986 and after thestock-market crash of 1987. &quot;We thought they were a littlesmarter,&quot; says Glenn Cox, president of Phillips PetroleumCo., which has slashed employment 41% since 1981.</LP><TEXT>   But three years ago, the Shell myth exploded. In theMississippi River town of Norco, La., its showcase gasolinerefinery blew up. The blast, set off when a flammable gasignited after escaping from a corroded eight-inch pipe,incinerated seven men, wrecked the refinery and rockedShell's regional office 25 miles east in New Orleans.Occupational Safety and Health Administration officialscriticized Shell's safety practices, but the company insiststhat it complied with the rules.   The loss of refining capacity forced Shell to spend morethan $1 billion to buy gasoline on the open market to supplyits service stations and deprived the company of industryrefining profits that were near record highs. And today,1,000 repair workers sweating under the Louisiana sun arestill a year away from restoring the refinery to fullproduction. The rebuilding cost is estimated at $600 million,equal to 60% of last year's net income.   &quot;There's no precedent for an accident of this magnitude inShell history,&quot; says Ramon Lopez, a vice president.   However, the Norco disaster is just one of the problemsthat have pushed Shell off its pinnacle. Shell also ispicking up the pieces after a series of other accidents. InDecember 1988, eight months after Norco, a Shell pipelineruptured in Missouri's Gasconade River and spewed out 840,000gallons of oil. Tainted water forced Anheuser-Busch Cos. toclose its largest brewery. The following winter, the coldfroze Shell's Gulf Coast refineries and closed them for weekswhile rivals' better-insulated plants profited handsomely.   One result of such problems: Shell's annual net income hasskidded from a consistent No. 3 in the industry -- ahead ofbigger companies such as Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp. andTexaco Inc. -- to a distant seventh last year. And lastmonth, Shell reported its first quarterly loss, of $68million, in 57 years.   Moreover, Shell has stumbled by betting billions ofdollars on risky deep-water exploration efforts that requiresharply higher oil and natural-gas prices to pay off. Thecompany's esprit de corps slid when its parent, RoyalDutch/Shell Group, started siphoning profits toward othersubsidiaries around the world.   And Shell is facing a companywide loss of confidence overquality control and safety. That concern is etched on theface of George Machino, a worker at Shell's refinery in WoodRiver, Ill. &quot;People are scared to death,&quot; he says.   Now, the company is struggling to improve its safetyrecord, making costly realignments to its refining andexploration and trying to raise morale. At stake are billionsof dollars worth of market share in gasoline and jet fuel andthe oil finds needed to keep refineries going.   The job of restoring luster to the jewel in the crown ofRoyal Dutch, which is based in both The Hague and London, hasfallen to Frank Richardson. A Mr. Fix-It-style chiefexecutive who once dried off a rain-soaked job candidate withpaper towels, Mr. Richardson readily concedes that Shell'sfinances deteriorated on his watch -- during the past threeyears.   &quot;It isn't a pleasant situation,&quot; he says in an interviewin his Houston office. The 58-year-old veteran of 36 years atShell adds that the job &quot;is tougher than I expected.&quot;   In what some critics consider a too-deliberate manner, topmanagement has huddled for more than a year trying to solveShell's problems. Some see Mr. Richardson's leisurelypondering as part of the difficulty and say he should go.Replies Mr. Richardson calmly: &quot;All the cards haven't beenturned over yet.&quot;   Meanwhile, however, Shell's refineries were down 11% ofthe time last year, twice as much as it deems acceptable.Many plant workers attribute the excessive downtime to a laxattitude toward maintenance. At the Deer Park, Texas, plant,operators still chortle about the visit several years ago byBritain's Prince Charles. Shell got ready by painting justthe sides of buildings that could be seen from his route --leaving peeling paint elsewhere.   East of the Rockies, Shell is years behind its competitorsin retrofitting plants to make environmentally cleaner fuels.&quot;First-class refining capability is very important, and,frankly, we don't have it,&quot; Mr. Richardson admits.   Shell is spending too heavily, some critics say, exploringdeep-water fields in the Gulf of Mexico that will requireas-yet-unperfected drilling technology. While other companieshave already scaled back such exploration, Shell is riskingbillions of dollars in the hope that sharply higher prices inthe future will make profitable some oil that won't flow foras long as 10 years.   Shell has directed 65% of its resources to such long-termprojects while its oil production fell. Since 1986, its dailyoil output has dropped 160,000 barrels, more than manycompetitors produce.   One reason for this decline is something Shell executivescan't do much about. While other big U.S. companies arespending heavily overseas, where prospects are clearlybetter, Shell, as Royal Dutch's U.S. subsidiary, is basicallyrestricted by its parent to the U.S. So, Shell bid heavily onstill more high-risk leases in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, wherecosts dwarf even those in the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters.   Shell spent $360 million for Chukchi acreage. Each wellcosts $70 million -- five times the expense of a deep-waterhole in the Gulf. Ice has permitted Shell to drill just a fewwells. And so far, Shell hasn't found enough oil to make itsAlaskan operations worth the costs in the long run,competitors say. Shell declines to comment.   All this is eroding morale already damaged by RoyalDutch's 1985 acquisition of the one-third of Shell sharesthat had been publicly traded. The move caused Shellemployees to fear that the company no longer controlled itsown destiny. They also resent what they view as a low-balltender offer that they felt they had to accept, and thesituation exposed deep-felt resentment toward the Dutchowners.   &quot;We always felt cheated,&quot; says George Costa, a 63-year-oldretired refinery worker in Martinez, Calif. He grudginglysold his 2,600 Shell shares to the parent company but says heand others paid less attention to their jobs afterward. Thestock deal, he says, was a &quot;stab in the back.&quot;   Before the tender offer, executive stock optionsencouraged superior performance, a former official says. Nowthat's gone, he says. William Randol, a First Boston Corp.oil analyst and former Shell executive, agrees. &quot;There's beena lack of hustle ever since the takeover,&quot; he says.   Shell's deterioration does raise fears that Royal Dutchwill invest more and more capital outside of the U.S. As thelargest subsidiary, 100%-owned Shell accounts for a third ofRoyal Dutch's assets but only 16% of its 1990 net income.   Shell's marketing executives already complain that theycan't get enough money to modernize stations. In Chicago,Shell is selling 67 million fewer gallons of gasoline a yearthan it did in 1988, and its market share has dropped to17.5% from 21%.   Shell also has lost the right to operate 13 servicestations along the New Jersey Turnpike that last year pumpedfour million gallons apiece -- four times the volume of atypical profitable station. Turnpike officials say they won'trenew Shell's contract, which expires next spring, becausethe stations have been understaffed and the attendants rude.&quot;We had extensive consumer complaints,&quot; says Donald Watson, aturnpike official.   Shell says it lost the contract because of Royal Dutch'spresence in South Africa. (Oil companies based in the U.S.have pulled out.) Turnpike officials say that that's onereason but that poorly run operations were more important.   Shell is finally battling its problems. Its current layoffplans target up to 15% of its 31,500 workers.   To catch up with the industry's push to produce cleanerfuels, Shell plans to increase by 30% the $700 million itspends annually to update processing equipment. It recentlyinsulated its Gulf Coast equipment against future freezes andordered a companywide safety check.   In addition, Shell surprised the industry by putting itsrefinery near Los Angeles up for sale. If a buyer isn'tfound, Shell will close the plant and many SouthernCalifornia service stations as well.   And in another shift in strategy, Shell plans to raisespending on short-term exploration efforts to 50% of itstotal from 35% today. &quot;We're slowing down in the deep water,&quot;says Carl Wickizer, head of a project in the Gulf of Mexico.But for now, Shell's best hopes remain long term, includingits much-discussed Mars discovery field in the Gulf. Shelland its partners decline to say how big they believe thefield may be, but in any event it is at least seven yearsfrom producing any oil.   Right now, Royal Dutch is backing Shell's strategy. ALondon spokesman says, &quot;There is no change nor is anycontemplated in the relationship with Shell Oil Co. Thecompany retains the full support and confidence of itsshareholder.&quot;   But if Shell's prospects don't improve, some observersspeculate it may lose even more autonomy and market clout.All that bodes well for U.S. competitors hungry for itscustomers and properties.   Already, Shell's prospects for reclaiming its place as anindustry leader are slim. Competitors are making majorinroads. Texaco, long the industry doormat, recently shed $7billion of assets to become leaner and more profitable.Atlantic Richfield Co. reined in its gasoline-marketing turfto five of Shell's most important Western states, includingCalifornia, and increased its profit margins. PhillipsPetroleum slashed costs by exploring only where short-termprospects are strong.   Meanwhile, Shell is still repairing the damage from theNorco explosion. And some Shell workers doubt that thecompany has learned a lesson. They recently got hold of aninternal memo exhorting plant managers to trim spending onmaintenance, including inspections and safety.   Says Ed Riley, a Norco pipefitter, &quot;It makes you wonder.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
