The arrests came after a federal grand jury in Honolulu returnedindictments alleging theft of telephone access codes that may havebeen obtained through sophisticated computer technology, federalofficials said.   U.S. Attorney Gene Anderson and Skip Jones, head of the SecretService office here, said in a news release Monday the 18 peoplewere charged with conspiracy to steal and market long distancecodes in a nationwide network.   The indictments said the defendants acquired long distancetelephone credit card numbers and access codes and then marketedthose codes to defraud long distance telephone companies, theofficials said.   Anderson and Jones said they said they seized numerousunauthorized access codes and a variety of computer andtelecommunications equipment used in the conspiracy. Access codesare numbers dialed before a telephone number that allow a caller touse a particular company's long-distance network.   Anderson and Jones said the indictments and arrests culminatedan eight-month undercover operation by the U.S. Secret Serviceoffice in Honolulu into the wholesale marketing of unauthorizedaccess codes.   Agents made more than 600 undercover telephone contacts withpeople involved in marketing the codes, officials said. Theundercover agents received more than 600 unauthorized telephoneaccess codes from the individuals charged.   Anderson and Jones said the industry has indicated that morethan $4.5 million in fraudulent calls can be attributed to those600 codes.   According to industry estimates, several of those indicted areprincipal operators of marketing networks responsible for $125million in telephone access fraud over the past year, they said.This represents half of the estimated loss of this type from suchmarketing schemes throughout the nation, they said.   The government said the Communications Fraud ControlAssociation, a long distance telephone clearinghouse, estimateslosses from all types of access device fraud at about $500 millionannually for the $40 billion per year long distance telephoneindustry.</TEXT></DOC>
