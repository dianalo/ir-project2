Rabbi Herman Dicker of New York, who arrived in Frankfurt today,is to officiate at Sunday evening services at a synagogue in EastBerlin. The tiny East German Jewish community has no permanentrabbi.   Michel Friedman, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Jewish Community,said Dicker was expected to arrive in Berlin tonight.   The World Jewish Congress in New York said it had reached anagreement with the East German government for Dicker to leadservices in observance of the Jewish religious holidays of RoshHashana and Yom Kippur.   The World Jewish Congress said there were 600 Jews in EastGermany, while other estimates put the population at fewer than 450people.   The Hungarian-born Dicker, a research librarian at the JewishTheological Seminary in New York, lived in Berlin until he fled in1936 after the Nazis came to power. He served with U.S. forces thatliberated Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, theWorld Jewish Conference said.   The World Jewish Conference said it and the East Berlin Jewishcommunity were still looking for a permanent rabbi to serve there.   In September 1987, American Rabbi Isaac Neuman became the firstrabbi in 21 years to be appointed to East Germany. But thePolish-born Neuman resigned in May after criticizing the Jewishcommunity leadership for allegedly interfering in his work.</TEXT></DOC>
