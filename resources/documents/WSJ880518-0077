Adler (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> UK FREST </CO><IN> CHM </IN><TEXT>   If you happen to have a copy of Judge S.K. Seth's April 4 opinion in the Bhopal litigation, hang onto it. It may become a hot item.    Even Union Carbide Corp. had to borrow the decision from the Indian appeals court judge, make a nearly illegible photocopy on a rickety machine in Jabalpur, India, and then retype it back home.    With lawyers in the Bhopal case slogging through the deep procedural mud of the Indian legal system, the $3 billion suit against Union Carbide involving the 1984 poison-gas leak has attracted little notice lately. The remoteness of the Jabalpur courthouse -- and the limited communications facilities available there -- hasn't helped.    Yet the few U.S. lawyers who have studied Judge Seth's opinion recognize it as one of the most extraordinary developments in the field of mass-disaster law in years.    In essence, the judge ruled that a defendant in a personal-injury suit can be required to pay damages to accident victims even before the defendant has been found liable at a trial. Based on that ruling, he ordered defendant Carbide to pay $190 million as an &quot;advance&quot; on an eventual damage award.    The innovative ruling isn't the final word; it must survive appeals in India and then be found enforceable by a U.S. court. The process could take several years.    But Judge Seth's decision -- which appears to be without precedent -- is likely to have an impact far beyond Bhopal. At the least, it gets lawyers and professors debating a radical new direction in personal-injury law. That, in turn, might spur judges elsewhere to experiment with similar interim compensation awards. And it certainly will be cited -- and embraced -- by plaintiffs' lawyers in future cases.    &quot;This approach is going to be of significant interest to plaintiffs and defendants around the world as a way of expediting relief in very lengthy cases,&quot; says Bruce Finzen, an American lawyer who is representing the Indian government in the case.    Judge Seth's opinion is the latest link in a chain of legal events that began just days after poison gas leaked from Carbide's Bhopal pesticide plant on Dec. 3, 1984, killing at least 2,500 people and seriously injuring tens of thousands more.    In the beginning, U.S. personal-injury lawyers and the Indian government contrived to try the case against Union Carbide in U.S. courts, where they expected quicker justice than in India -- and a much larger verdict. But federal Judge John Keenan of New York dismissed the case in May of 1986 on the ground that Bhopal was the more convenient forum. Since then a succession of Bhopal judges have failed to move the case to trial.    The fourth -- and current -- judge, M.W. Deo, stirred things up last December, however, when he ordered Union Carbide to pay about $270 million as interim compensation to the victims.    Enter Judge Seth of the Indian High Court in Jabalpur, where Carbide appealed the ruling. It is Judge Seth's opinion upholding the order for interim relief -- for reasons different than those cited by Judge Deo -- that is causing such a stir among lawyers.    The amount Judge Seth required Carbide to pay -- he reduced the original figure to $190 million -- is hardly considered steep. The government of India, as representative of the victims, has been seeking $3 billion in the suit. And Carbide has itself offered at least $350 million during earlier settlement talks.    The shocker was that the judge had ordered a huge damage payment before Carbide's liability for damages, if any, had been established at a trial. At first glance, at least, the decision seems to violate any defendant's fundamental right to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses against it. A Carbide spokesman has decried the ruling as &quot;a judgment and decree without trial.&quot;    Yet Judge Seth's 103-page opinion is not without its logic. Typically in court cases, factual disputes are decided by a jury or, as in India, by a trial judge, based on testimony and cross-examination. But decisions about which rules of law govern the case can be made by a judge who has not heard testimony about the facts.    Applying this principle, Judge Seth ruled first that, under Indian law, a company that engages in a hazardous activity -- such as operating a chemical plant -- is &quot;absolutely liable&quot; for damages from an accident. This is true, he said, even if the company had not been negligent in the way it ran the plant.    Second, he ruled, Union Carbide had sufficient control over Union Carbide India Ltd. -- which ran the plant -- that the multinational would be held responsible for the accident. As a consequence, the court could dip into the company's world-wide assets to satisfy a damage judgment.    Given these rulings, it seemed highly likely that Carbide would be assessed substantial damages once the case went to trial. Why, Judge Seth asked, shouldn't the victims get some of that money now instead of waiting for the trial and multiple appeals to run their lengthy course?    Drawing on some limited British precedents, Judge Seth decided that Carbide could be ordered to make what amounts to an advance payment on damages that the company would almost certainly be required to pay after a trial.    He concluded that such an order was necessary because the Indian government's relief payments to victims amounted to &quot;a pittance&quot; and that &quot;any further delay in extending appropriate relief by way of interim payment of damages . . . would have grave and tragic consequences.&quot;    Judge Seth then ordered Judge Deo to proceed with the trial. He made it clear that if the trial judge determined that the $190 million payment was unwarranted, the government of India, as the victims' representative, would have to return some or all of the advance.    Union Carbide has long argued that it isn't responsible for the accident. It has been preparing evidence that Union Carbide India Ltd. is beyond the control of the multinational and thus that the multinational can't be held liable. Carbide also has maintained that sabotage -- not negligence -- caused the disaster.    But it is unclear how far Carbide can get with arguments that Judge Seth has now appeared to dismiss out of hand.    Has Union Carbide lost the case? Not necessarily. First, the company can appeal the decision in the Indian courts. It has already sought reconsideration by the High Court in Jabalpur and has the option of petitioning for a hearing before the Indian Supreme Court.    If Carbide loses in India, it has further recourse: It can refuse to pay. It's clear that Carbide doesn't have sufficient assets in India to satisfy the $190 million judgment. And if the company refuses to pay, the Indian government will have to ask a U.S. court to order Carbide to comply. But if the Indian judgment is sufficiently outrageous, a U.S. court might refuse to enforce it.    For Carbide, then, it may turn out that the worse the opinion, the better the outcome.    Under the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act, U.S. courts are required to enforce a foreign judgment when the foreign court has jurisdiction and the judgment is not repugnant to public policy. Underlying the law is the requirement that the defendant be granted a fair proceeding in the foreign country -- in other words, due process.    Says Harvard law professor Arthur Miller: &quot;I have serious doubts that (Judge Seth's opinion) is enforceable . . . Absent the classic day in court, there's an American due-process issue at stake.&quot; (Mr. Miller consulted briefly for the U.S. plaintiffs' lawyers who had represented victims in U.S. courts.)    Arthur von Mehren, another Harvard law professor and a specialist on enforcement of foreign judgments, agrees that Carbide appears to have a fundamental right to defend itself. And this right, he says, includes trying to prove in court that some of the individual victims' claims were not valid. The company has alleged from the start that many of the people claiming injury from the accident became sick due to other causes. Says Mr. von Mehren: &quot;I would think there is a very strong chance that such an opinion would not be enforced.&quot;    Yet Carbide does face one serious obstacle of its own making. The company is in the embarrassing position of having fought to get the case moved out of the U.S. courts and into the Indian system. In the process, it became a champion of the Indian judiciary, arguing that the system was sophisticated enough to do justice in a case of this magnitude.    Will Carbide be held to that view if it challenges the ruling in the U.S.? &quot;Union Carbide worked very hard to get the case removed from New York to India,&quot; says Andreas Lowenfeld, a law professor at New York University. &quot;I can't see how they could refuse to satisfy the judgment.&quot;    Professor Lowenfeld also points out that U.S. courts have begun to experiment with interim payments in mass-disaster cases when liability is established and the only question in dispute is the amount of damge and the division of responsibility among co-defendants. Such cases could bolster the Indian government's argument that Judge Seth's opinion stretches the limits of American jurisprudence only a little.    Professor Lowenfeld says he sees no problem with interim relief unless &quot;there is a genuine pssibility that there is no liability.&quot; He adds: &quot;If Union Carbide can prove sabotage over which they had no control, then I see a problem&quot; with the judge's order.    In addition to surviving a due-process challenge by Carbide, the order would have to pass another threshold to get the judgment enforced: finality. U.S. courts don't enforce foreign juddgments unless those judgments are final. Would a federal court consider an order of interim compensation sufficiently &quot;final&quot; to be enforced? &quot;It's a free-fire zone,&quot; says Professor Miller, noting the absence of precedent on the question.    Even if the case is settled before these issues can be resolved, Judge Seth's opinion is likely to spark debate about whether innovations such as his can serve the needs of plaintiffs without violating the rights of defendants. Professor Lowenfeld notes that personal injury cases often take years to try and that the injured parties get nothing in the interim. &quot;It makes sense,&quot; he suggests, &quot;to say that meanwhile the victims should get some money.&quot;    ---               Bhopal: A Legal Chronology   December 3, 1984 -- MIC gas leaks from Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, killing more than 2,500 people and seriously injuring many thousands more.
