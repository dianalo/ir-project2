This year's crop suggests many oftoday's managements view them with disdain -- as vehicles todo goofy things -- or with indifference, at best.   The cover of Norwest's report proclaims the Minneapolisbanking company seeks &quot;to create an environment emphasizingteamwork . . . while having fun.&quot; But many photos show stiffemployees doing silly things, such as holding up oversizedobjects or chairs.   UtiliCorp United says that behind its growth &quot;have beenthe dedication and professionalism of our employees.&quot; Yetexcept for a picture of its chief executive, the report hasonly drawings of workers. The company says the illustrationscapture &quot;the spirit of their work ethic.&quot; Merchants Nationalhas only full-page color pictures of five senior lendingofficers along with the regal pose of its chairman flanked byportraits of his father and grandfather.   Many companies play up the diversity of their work forces-- but inadvertently show that it doesn't extend to seniormanagement or directors. First Merchants' cover shows sixemployees, including three women and one black manager, yetthe 14 directors shown are all white men. Vice PresidentChris Laughlin says that workforce diversity is becoming &quot;abig issue&quot; at the Muncie, Ind., banking company and thatthere are &quot;a lot of doors open&quot; for any employee to move intosenior management positions.   W.H. Brady Co.'s annual report has 25 employees -- 14female and seven black -- standing stiffly on draped boxes.Its 38 directors, executives and managers are shown that way,too -- but there's only one woman director and no blacksamong them. A spokesman says that officials of the Milwaukeemanufacturer are &quot;well aware of the discrepancy&quot; and thatthings should change &quot;over the next three to five years.&quot;   Carl Thompson, a Denver public-relations consultant, says,&quot;An annual report needs to be credible. It should be one thatemployees don't snicker about in hallways or laugh at.&quot;                                                                                                          For Managing Insight, Try   Box Scores at Breakfast                                                                                                          WHERE can fledgling managers -- women in particular --gain insight into how men in authority communicate andmanage? The sports pages, says Harry Levinson.   &quot;Reading the sports pages provides a kind of managementeducation you just don't get reading politics, business orthe life-style section of the paper,&quot; says Mr. Levinson, aBelmont, Mass., psychologist. &quot;There's a bluntness to much ofsports reporting, a candor you don't get elsewhere.&quot;   Stories about how successful coaches motivate, evaluateand discipline players offer insight into management styleand philosophy, he says. Because covering professional sportsis &quot;very much like covering a business,&quot; adds Steven Doyle,the Orlando Sentinel's deputy managing editor for sports,readers can gain perspective about negotiating with employeesand handling disputes, among other things.   Businesswomen acknowledge that sports can offer clues tothe management game. Still, &quot;if all you did was {read thesports pages}, I doubt you'd get a wave of insight,&quot; saysKaren Berg, a New York management-development consultant. AMellon Bank manager favors watching sports events overreading about them because &quot;you can draw clues from the way acoach conducts himself or herself.&quot;                                                                                                          This Budget Reduction   May Have Little Merit                                                                                                          IN GOOD times or bad, companies are eager to retain keyemployees. That's why a fresh finding by Wyatt Co., benefitsconsultants, is surprising. Its 1991 pay-practices surveyshows a distinct gap in merit increases between companiesreducing or planning to reduce staff this year and those withno such plans.   What explains the merit-pay gap? Marsha Cameron, a Wyattprincipal, says paring merit raises has become just anotherway for troubled firms to cut costs. Still, she considers thegap significant: &quot;Since these organizations are going throughstaff reductions, you'd think there'd be a relatively highlevel of concern for those who remain behind.&quot;   Healthy companies, the survey results suggest, enjoy anopportunity to woo away troubled firms' star employees, whosemorale already has been battered by colleagues' dismissalsand other cost reductions. Employers with low merit budgetstold Wyatt researchers their pay practices already have hurttheir ability to retain top performers.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AT Du Pont, 56% of male employees favor flexible workoptions, up from 37% in 1986, a company study finds. Fortypercent of the men say they've considered joining otheremployers that offer more job flexibility, up from just 15%five years ago. Among women, 76% favor flexible options. . ..
