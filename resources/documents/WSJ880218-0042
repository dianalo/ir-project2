The decision to purchase a 75% interest in a joint venture that would take over Firestone's tire business will also, of course, vastly expand Bridgestone's customer base, making it an even bigger world power in tires. Firestone has five factories in North America and six in Europe. Firestone would hold a 25% interest in the joint venture.    But beyond all this, analysts say, a key consideration was Bridgestone's wish to establish or reinforce ties with Japanese companies that have set up production facilities in the U.S. These companies, either directly or in joint ventures with U.S. concerns, produce about two million vehicles a year, according to industry analyst Tony Moyer at SBCI Securities (Asia) Ltd., an affiliate of Swiss Bank Corp.    Bridgestone's move &quot;is consistent with all sorts of trends -- political, currency-related and the shift to offshore production,&quot; says Geoffrey Wilkinson, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.'s Tokyo office.    The move also would enable Bridgestone to strengthen its product line. It excels in truck and heavy-duty-vehicle tires, while Firestone's strength is in passenger-car tires. &quot;There will be a synergy,&quot; says Bridgestone's president, Akira Yeiri.    Bridgestone is the largest tire maker in Japan with 50% of the market. With the new venture, it hopes to run a close third in the world market, behind No. 1 Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. of the U.S. and No. 2 Michelin andamp; Cie. of France, by claiming 16% of overall tire sales.    In Japan, Bridgestone is a household name -- whose similarity to Firestone is coincidental. Bridgestone is an inversion of the English translation of the founder's name, Ishibashi, or stone bridge.    The Ishibashi family still controls 22% of the 56-year-old company, whose estimated pretax profit last year surged 52%, to 60 billion yen ($459 million), even though sales inched up just 0.4%, to 550 billion yen ($4.2 billion). Increased domestic demand and the strong yen have driven down exports' share of sales to 26% in 1987's first half from 33% in 1981.    Analysts expect Bridgestone to use its new foothold to sell its own tires directly to leading U.S. auto makers and to vehicle owners needing replacements. &quot;In the short to medium term, the main thing is the ability to plug into Firestone's production facilities,&quot; says Mr. Moyer of SBCI Securities. &quot;But it could be a tremendous boost to their distribution network to plug into a well established U.S. company.&quot;    The joint venture would retain the Firestone name and employ Firestone tire-division staff. It would operate independently, however, based on policies to be developed by directors sent from the two companies, Bridgestone's Mr. Yeiri says. Under the proposed agreement, Firestone would receive about $1.25 billion-$750 million from Bridgestone and $500 million that the joint venture would borrow.    Mr. Yeiri says a final agreement should be reached by year's end. </TEXT></DOC>
