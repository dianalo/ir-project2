LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sharp differences emerged today amongPalestinians and Israelis over the plan Egyptian President HosniMubarak put forward to end the uprising in the occupied territories.   Soldiers shot and killed a 28-year-old Palestinian while tryingto arrest him on charges of being an activist in the uprising, thearmy said. It said soldiers fired after the suspect ignored ordersto halt in the Gaza Strip.   The victim, Mohammed Arafat Al-Akra, died of a bullet wound tothe head, Arab reporters said. They said he had been jailed threetimes without charges during the uprising.   Seventeen other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clasheswith soldiers elsewhere in the occupied lands, Arab hospitalofficials said.   The army confirmed two injuries in Nablus, saying stoning attacksoccurred there after a 12-day curfew was lifted. The army denied anArab report that an 18-year-old Palestinian was wounded by a soldiershooting from a helicopter.   Al-Akra's death raised to 568 the number of Palestinians killedin clashes with soldiers and Israeli civilians in the 21-month-olduprising. Another 114 Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs asalleged collaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis also have beenkilled.   An Israeli soldier, Corporal Yosef Haba, 20, died ofelectrocution Wednesday while he was on a rooftop in Gaza and theaerial on his military radio touched a high-tension wire, the armysaid.   The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, distributed aleaflet rejecting the peace proposal by Mubarak, who has been tryingto persuade PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to accept the plan.   Hamas, which has organized the uprising along with PLO-backedleaders, warned residents of the territories about ``Arab regimeswho are acting with the backing of the United States.''   U.S. officials have said that Mubarak's plan could be an avenueto revive Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's stalled proposal forholding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a first steptoward peace talks.   Shamir's plan calls for electing Palestinians from the West Bankand Gaza Strip to negotiate an interim peace plan with Israel. Thefinal status of the occupied territories would be decided in latertalks.   Mubarak's plan calls for allowing the Arabs in Jerusalem to voteand for conducting talks on the basis of trading occupied land forpeace, two controversial issues not included in the Shamir planapproved by the joint Likud-Labor Cabinet.   Two leading members of the prime minister's right-wing Likud bloccriticized Shamir and other top leaders for meeting to discussMubarak's 10-point peace proposal on Wednesday.   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, on a visit to the United States,told Israel radio that Israel should reject without discussion anyeffort to alter Shamir's election plan.   ``There is no other plan, and there is no need for anotherplan,'' Sharon said. ``It is inconceivable that the government ofIsrael will be pushed from time to time in directions it does notintend to go.''   David Levy, the housing minister, also was quoted in theJerusalem Post as complaining that the meeting was held despiteShamir's statement that he opposed even talking about Mubarak's plan.   ``This shows that what we say doesn't hold for even one day,''Levy told the English-language Post.</TEXT></DOC>
