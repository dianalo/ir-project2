Gordon Crovitz (&quot;Reverse a Precedent,Protect the Constitution,&quot; Rule of Law, oped) and TerryEastland (&quot;260 Precedents That Bit the Dust,&quot; editorial page)invite comment by those interested in the next episode of thedebate about the proper role of the Supreme Court and staredecisis -- standing by decided rulings.   By saying stare decisis may be OK for common-lawproperty/tort cases, but not for constitutional cases, Mr.Crovitz is taking a dive with a 9.9 degree of difficulty.Unfortunately, he doesn't land in the pool. In both kinds ofcases the stability factor of stare decisis carries greatweight and underpins our legal system.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Crovitz's other point is that somehow if subsequentjustices think a prior Supreme Court decision is really bad(e.g. the Booth case on victim-impact statements) they shouldbe free to overrule it. Mr. Eastland's article tries tobuttress the point by citing numerous prior Supreme Courtdecisions the court later overturned.   However, stare decisis is not a rigid approach, but agradual, fluid one. It is a misconception to complain thatold decisions are etched in stone. They can and should changewhen important underlying facts justify it. But they shouldnot be overruled just because the individual judges hearingthe case are replaced. This leads to a nation not &quot;of laws,&quot;but &quot;of men.&quot; I've spent a lot of time in countries with thatsystem, and believe me most of us would prefer ours.   The most relevant aspect of Mr. Eastland's article neverappeared in it -- how many of the 260 decisions he cited wereoverturned because of changed facts, and how many onlybecause there were different justices on the bench? And evenif judicial makeup alone did play some role before, does itjustify continuing this practice?   Many people take a bottom-line-policy approach in judgingthe recent Supreme Court nominees. Do the nominees favoraffirmative action, abortion, expanded police powers, etc.?But perhaps the nominees' views on the following broaderissues will be more telling in the long run:   -- Do nominees accept the premise that the Constitution isa &quot;living, breathing document&quot; to be interpreted according tothe conditions of the day, or should we stick to its&quot;original intent&quot; -- only the four corners of the document?   Ironically, if we do literally stick to the four corners,we may find that the Supreme Court in fact has no businessstriking down any act of Congress as unconstitutional becausethe Constitution does not explicitly give it that authority.If memory serves correctly, the Supreme Court gave itselfthat power in the 1803 Marbury vs. Madison case, which nobodybothered to challenge at the time. On the other hand, theFramers did build in a mechanism to adapt the Constitution tochange, and that's called amendment.   -- Under the Constitution, Congress and the statelegislatures exist to express and protect the popular(majority) view. What are the nominees' views on the role ofthe federal courts, especially the Supreme Court, in ourseparation-of-powers system? Just how far should the SupremeCourt go to check and balance legislatures and protectindividual rights of those not in the majority? How muchshould the courts check the powers of the executive branch,which have grown dramatically in unforeseen ways in ourpostindustrial society?   Today's nominees tend to be younger and so have apotential for many years of service on the court. Their viewson these questions can therefore have a lasting impact on theshaping of our legal system for a long time after they aregone. Unless of course their successors adopt Mr. Crovitz'sviews and overrule all their decisions.   Paul E. Mason   Boca Raton, Fla.   ---   Messrs. Crovitz and Eastland are correct in arguing thatdeference to precedents under the doctrine of stare decisisis not and never has been an absolute constraint on theSupreme Court. Rather, it is a prudential consideration thatpromotes integrity by checking activist tendencies. Theattacks of Messrs. Crovitz and Eastland on the doctrine,however, belie an activism of their own. While prudentialconsiderations should not always be decisive, cautionshouldn't be thrown to the wind.   Consider, for instance, the recent case of Rust v.Sullivan. The court declined to follow precedents embodyinganother cautionary rule -- that of construing statutes toavoid raising constitutional problems. That rule is acommon-sense presumption that Congress does not intend topush the Constitution to its limits. An additional benefit ofthe rule is that it avoids the sort of hasty constitutionaldecision-making that can occur when a shift in politicalwinds raises new controversies. The controversy in Rust aroseas a result of a shift in political winds that led theDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to bandiscussion of abortion from federally funded family-planningclinics. The court circumvented the cautionary rule,construing a law passed by Congress as having given HHS theauthority to impose the ban, raising a conflict involving theFirst Amendment's protection of speech. The vast majority ofcongressmen, however, are now demonstrating that they did notintend any such result. Adherence to cautionary rules andprudential doctrines can mitigate this type of conflict.   Certainly, as the makeup of the court changes and thepolitical mood of the nation evolves, doctrinal shifts areinevitable. Mr. Eastland's list of overruled precedentsdemonstrates that this phenomenon not only predates theRehnquist Court but the Warren Court as well. Just as theWarren Court had activist tendencies, so do the prevailingjurisprudential winds today. Even The Wall Street Journal'sbrand of jurisprudence carries its own type of activism (tryas I may, I cannot seem to locate the command &quot;Thou shalt notimpose punitive damages&quot; anywhere in the Constitution --although I have not looked under any penumbras yet).   We should recognize that the value-laden nature of thecourt's decisionmaking is inevitable. The importance ofprudential considerations such as stare decisis is that theymitigate the manner in which this nature creates an incentiveto activism.   Mark D.
