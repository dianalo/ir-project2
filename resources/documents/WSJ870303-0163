However, that panel prepared its theoretical document without any inflight air-quality testing.    There is no research, government-sponsored or otherwise, that supplies scientific support for such a prohibition. All four of the major inflight tests for tobacco smoke conducted since 1971 have concluded that the amount that can be detected in commercial flights is extremely small, posing no demonstrated risk to non-smoking passengers or flight personnel.    Not long ago, a federal agency asked for public comment on a virtual smoking ban in the air. Seventy percent opposed any further restrictions. In a 1985 poll, 82% of airline passengers, including 79% of former smokers and 81% of those who have never smoked said the present system of smoking and non-smoking sections works well.    Though Mr. Adler yearns for the day when airlines prohibit smoking, he doesn't reckon with the fate of one that tried that. Muse Airlines permitted no passenger smoking from the day it began operations until the day when, millions in debt, it was absorbed by another carrier and its non-smoking policy was abandoned.    William Kloepfer Jr.   Senior Vice President   Tobacco Institute   Washington   ---   It is high time, as Mr. Adler has so eloquently pointed out, for airlines to offer smoke-free flights. As a frequent business flyer, I have long suspected what recent studies have confirmed -- that all that smoke is harmful to everyone aboard.    While Lamar Muse provided smoke-free flights in Texas, I regularly paid a premium to fly Muse Air. It was such a pleasure to step onto an aircraft that smelled of new leather instead of stale tobacco! More recently, Pan Am has provided some degree of isolation on overseas flights with its non-smoking upstairs business class -- helpful, but still recirculating smoke from the rest of the aircraft. Even so, they get preference for my patronage. Certainly no frequent-flyer incentive program could possibly be as attractive to me as traveling in clean air.
