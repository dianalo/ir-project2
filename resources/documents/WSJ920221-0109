Estimates from the National Center for EducationStatistics based on the 1990-91 school year indicate that thenational pupil-teacher ratio for public elementary andsecondary schools was 17.2 to 1. The average expenditure perpupil was $4,885.   The estimated outlay per pupil was lowest in Utah, at$2,727. Utah also had the highest pupil-teacher ratio, at 25to 1. Eleven other states, including Alabama, California,Colorado and Georgia, had both lower-than-average spendingper student and bigger-than-average class sizes.   Small classes can mean higher costs. Spending per studentwas greatest, at $8,161, in the District of Columbia, whichalso had the second-lowest pupil-teacher ratio, 13.3 to 1.Thirteen states, including all of the Middle Atlantic and NewEngland states, had smaller-than-average classes andabove-average outlays per student.   But 15 states, including Illinois, North Carolina andTexas, combine lower-than-average pupil-teacher ratios withbelow-average spending per student. In some of these states,including Arkansas and West Virginia, the low expendituresmay stem partly from their low cost of living, in contrast tothe Northeastern states.   Among the remaining states, Minnesota and Ohio haveaverage class sizes and above-average costs per student,while Michigan and Oregon have both large classes and highcosts.                                                                                                          Households Bring   Most Bacon Home                                                                                                          SPENDING on food prepared and eaten at home grew faster inrecent years than outlays on food away from home, reversingthe pattern of most of the '80s.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that spending inthe at-home category averaged $2,485 a household in 1990, up5.3% from 1988, while spending on food away from home rose1.7% to $1,811.   Many nutritionists recommend eating more vegetables andgrains and making animal flesh a side dish, but the nation'sdiet still appears to center on meaty main dishes: Thebiggest portion of at-home food spending, $668, went formeat, poultry, fish and eggs.   Fruits and vegetables were the second-leading category, at$408; cereal and bakery goods third, at $368; and dairyproducts fourth, at $295. Households also spent an average of$84 on various combinations of these main categories, asfound in canned, frozen and prepared foods.   Basic foods need embellishment, however. U.S. householdsspent an average of $74 on condiments and seasonings, and $68on fats and oils.   Then there are the real nonessentials. Spending on sugarand sweets, including candy, gum and jam, averaged $94 in1990. Potato chips, nuts and other snacks accounted for $67.Miscellaneous prepared foods, including baby food, accountedfor another $146.   To wash everything down, households spent an average of$213 on beverages, including coffee, tea, soda and powdereddrinks. (Milk and juices are counted in the dairy andfruit/vegetable categories.)   Altogether, spending on food and beverages accounted for16% of consumer spending in 1990.                                                                                                          U.S. Population Growth   Picks Up After Census                                                                                                          POPULATION growth has accelerated in the U.S.   The nation's population rose 0.9% annually in the 1980s.But recent Census Bureau estimates show growth accelerated toa 1.1% annual rate between April 1, 1990, and July 1, 1991.   Several states lost population in the 15 months followingthe 1990 census, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire andNorth Dakota, as well as the District of Columbia. But Iowa,which lost population in the 1980s, grew at a 0.5% rate inthe latest period.   Growth in some states has accelerated steadily. Nevada'spopulation rose an average of 3.3% a year in the early 1980s,4.9% in the late 1980s and at an estimated 5.3% rate in the1990-91 period. Growth has also risen steadily in theCarolinas, Delaware, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Tennessee,Washington and Wisconsin.   Several Midwestern states whose populations fell in theearly 1980s are now seeing growth, including Illinois,Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.   On the other hand, growth has slowed in some states,including Arizona, Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey.Florida grew at a yearly pace of 2.1% in 1990-91, comparedwith 2.9% in the early 1980s and 2.8% in the late 1980s. Evenso, it is currently the seventh fastest-growing state;Arizona ranks 10th.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE FIRST employer-provided retirement plan in the U.S.was set up by American Express in 1875, says the Bureau ofLabor Statistics. It applied only to disabled elderlyemployees with at least 20 years of service. In 1987, the twomain types of private pensions numbered more than 872,000plans covering 78 million workers. . . . Of the 13 largestmedical specialties, only pediatrics has shown a significantincrease in share of office visits in recent years. TheNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey shows that visits topediatricians accounted for 12.6% of office visits made tophysicians in 1989, up from 11.4% in 1985. . . . The share ofprescription-drug costs that consumers pay fell to 72% in1989 from 78% in 1980 because of increased spending by publicprograms (such as Medicaid) and other third parties (such asemployer-provided insurance), says the Employee BenefitResearch Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
