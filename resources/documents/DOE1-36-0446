Theoretical considerationslead to the proposed solution which consists in the multiplication ofthe pickup electrodes and a suitable subsequent mixing of the outputcurrents by means of discrete resistors. Experimental results exhibitan image practically distortionless over more than 80% of the resistivearea without any software treatment of the data.</TEXT></DOC>
