The proposed action would preserve the required margins of safetyagainst tube pullout under both normal and accident conditions by adheringto the requirements of the ASME Code. Therefore, the proposed amendmentcontinues to provide reasonable assurance that tube pullout will not occur.Consequently, the proposed amendment would not involve a significant changein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,and any radiological releases resulting from an accident would not be significantlygreater than previously determined. Because the proposed amendment doesnot otherwise affect routine radiological plant effluents, the impactsof operation will be within those evaluated in the Final EnvironmentalStatement.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. The Commissionalso concludes that the proposed action will not result in a significantincrease in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure.With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17282). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was file following this notice.<T3>Alternatives to the Proposed Action: </T3>Because the Commission hasconcluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed action, there is no need to examine alternatives to theproposed action.<T3>Alternative Use of Resources: </T3>This action does not involve theuse of resources not previously considered in connection with the FinalEnvironmental Statement related to operation of San Onofre Nuclear GeneratingStation, Unit 1, dated October 1973.<T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted: </T3>The NRC has reviewed the licensee'srequest that supports the proposed amendment. The NRC staff did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, The Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated March 10, 1988, as supplemented March 22 and 29, 1988.These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and at the GeneralLibrary, University of California, P.O.
