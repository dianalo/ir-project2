Mr. Rule, acting chief of the division, is expected to be approved by the full Senate before its August recess.    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) threatened to hold up the nomination on the Senate floor until he could obtain assurances from Mr. Rule that the division will apply the antitrust laws flexibly to any efforts to restructure the ailing steel industry. But Sen. Metzenbaum subsequently said he expects to meet with Mr. Rule and withdrew the threatened delay.    The nomination was approved without objection by any of the eight senators who were present, out of the committee's 14 members. </TEXT></DOC>
