The techniqueconsists of preliminary CT scans on petrous bones, after iv administrationof a bolus of contrast medium. The scans are performed at a predeterminedlevel of the middle portion of the internal auditory canals. The earlyenhancement is then evaluated of the soft tissues contained into theauditory canal on the side with retrocochlear neurosensorial hypoacusia.The images obtained are then processed by an image processing program,thus enhancing the contrast resolution and allowing an optimal depictionof the lesion. In the past 10 months, 67 patients with clinical suspicionof acoustic neuromas were studied. This technique allowed the diagnosisof 2 acoustic neuromas with a purely intracanalicular involvement.</TEXT></DOC>
