Magma Power, which explores and develops geothermal resources for electricity generation, has 20.4 million shares outstanding. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Magma Power shares closed at $12.25, unchanged.    The warrant, which expires Dec. 31, 1990, was granted in conjunction with Morgan Guaranty's commitment of $75 million financing for two of three geothermal power plants that Magma Power will build in Imperial Valley, Calif. Magma Power also retained Morgan Guaranty, a unit of New York-based J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., as its financial adviser to structure the balance of funding required for the three 34-megawatt plants, which will have a total cost of about $240 million.    Separately, the California Energy Commission determined it doesn't have jurisdiction over the plants, the company said. The commission has regulatory authority over plants with capacities of more than 50 megawatts, and had been considering whether the Magma Power plants would fall under its jurisdiction, because the plants' combined capacity would exceed 50 megawatts, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
