But some analysts said chip makers outside of the relatively robust personal computer and work-station markets, which have been leading the recovery, may see little growth in 1987 without a broad-based increase in capital spending.    &quot;For the broader semiconductor market, there will have to be some help from the economy -- real increases in capital spending -- and that's not happening yet,&quot; said Eli A. Sayegh, an analyst with S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in San Francisco.    The industry's book-to-bill ratio in the three-month period through February rose to 1.13 from a revised 1.12 in the like period through January. That means that for every $100 in the value of product shipped, manufacturers got new orders worth $113 in the latest period.    Orders for the February period improved about 1% to $788.2 million from $780.8 million for the three-month period ended in January, while shipments for the period grew slightly to $699.4 million from $697.8 million.    The figures are published by the Cupertino, Calif.-based Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, which compiles them from a survey of key semiconductor makers. An association spokesman said the February figures, along with industry data showing a substantial drawdown in inventory among many major computer makers, make it clear that 1987 will outpace a moribund 1986.    The semiconductor industry has been in a pervasive slump since the end of 1984, battered by weakening personal computer markets and stiffening Japanese competition.    &quot;I think the February figures certainly indicate that there is good momentum to carry this recovery through midyear at least,&quot; said Michael Kubiak, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in San Francisco. Mr. Kubiak agreed with the association that there has been a &quot;definite movement of inventory.&quot; For example, International Business Machines Corp. reduced its inventory by $600 million between the third and fourth quarters of 1986, he estimates.    For suppliers of chips to personal computer makers, that means &quot;there is definitely restocking going on. Companies are now ready to go out and buy new parts,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sayegh, however, said at least some of the vigor in the personal computer market has to do with the conversion currently underway to higher-speed machines that have spurred demand for new-generation microprocessors. The intial surge in demand for those chips is bound to ease as they eventually saturate the market.    &quot;That's why we're looking for slow and gradual growth this year,&quot; Mr. Sayegh said. &quot;Things are going to trend upward but nowhere as vigorously as many people might have hoped.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
