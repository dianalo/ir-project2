But a myriad of economic and other forces threatens to tear gaping holes in the stretched-thin fabric.    Health-care workers tell of poor mothers who don't get prenatal care, of indigent people with life-threatening health problems who aren't covered by public programs, and of elderly patients who cycle between costly hospital emergencies because government programs deny them relatively cheap home care.    The problems are worsening as economic pressures mount on the safety net, a system that includes hospitals, which often provide free care; Medicaid, the state and federal program for the poor, and Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled.    &quot;A whole series of things are destabilizing&quot; the safety net, says Robert Blendon, a health policy expert at the Harvard School of Public Health. But mainly, he adds, &quot;we're just losing control of costs.&quot;    New medical technologies continue to proliferate, pushing up medical costs and potentially limiting access by the poor to expensive treatments, such as TPA, the new drug to save heart-attack victims. The aging of America is sparking an explosion in long-term care costs, placing especially heavy burdens on the safety net. And the increase in acquired immune deficiency syndrome -- AIDS -- further strains the system.    Consequently, the economic problems are triggering policies that profoundly affect millions. Government agencies, tighting budgets on their health programs, have reduced some of the programs' coverage of the poor. Meanwhile, insurers, businesses and other groups are taking steps to contain their own health-care costs. All this squeezes hospital budgets, limiting the institutions' ability to provide charity care.    Generally, the safety net catches those who are down-and-out and acutely ill. But many indigent people with chronic ailments are ineligible for public health programs. Another large group of Americans have enough financial resources to be ineligible for public help but not enough to pay for health insurance or doctors' bills.    While some medically needy -- such as expanded numbers of pregnant women and children in poor families -- have made gains during the past few years because of changes in federal laws, the ranks of Americans without health insurance have grown during that period to an estimated 37 million. Excluding farm workers, 17.4% of the population under 65 had no health insurance in 1985, compared with 15.5% in 1982, according to a report last year by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.    Poverty and unemployment represent only part of the problem. More than half of uninsured Americans have jobs, including large numbers of service-industry, construction and self-employed workers. More than one-third of the uninsured are children, many of whom live in families with working, insured adults. And about one in ten uninsured workers is employed in professional and related services.    William McFarland expects soon to become one of the working uninsured. A diabetic, the 53-year-old accountant in Dracut, Mass., lost his job with an insurance company last year after having to take time off for several eye operations and other complications related to his disease.    With the aid of part-time jobs, he now pays $2,940 annually to maintain the health insurance policy that his former employer had provided. But that policy expires in October and won't be renewed, leaving him with &quot;gonzo coverage,&quot; he says. Blue Cross/Blue Shield may cover him after that, but he worries that the premiums will be prohibitively expensive and that limits on coverage for &quot;pre-existing conditions,&quot; such as his diabetes and his wife's high blood pressure, will leave him vulnerable to big medical bills.    People like Mr. McFarland don't qualify for public programs such as Medicaid, which is usually available only to those whose incomes fall below the federal poverty level. Moreover, Medicaid coverage of the working poor and other indigent groups has been cut as the program has become mainly a safety net for the impoverished elderly.    Contrary to widely held perceptions, Medicare -- the main government program for people over 64 -- provides little long-term care. Thus, many older Americans who require nursing-home care, which can cost $100 or more a day, must &quot;spend down&quot; their assets until they are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.    &quot;People who have saved all their lives and have Medicare and supplemental insurance spend a few months in a nursing home, and then it's all gone,&quot; says Edward Dale, an attorney who works for a Connecticut legal services group that helps Medicare patients get federal benefits. His advice in such cases: &quot;Give away everything you've got before it's too late. Chances are you will lose everything in the end anyway.&quot;    The spend-down problem strikes some people before retirement age. Robert J. Quinn, a 62-year-old resident of Lynn, Mass., without private health insurance, exhausted his assets during nine hospitalizations since 1985 for emphysema. He hopes in July to get Medicare disability coverage. Meanwhile, he is dependent on Medicaid, which, because of quirks in its coverage rules, last month stopped paying his $900-a-month bills for the oxygen that keeps him alive. The oxygen supply is continuing for now, but Mr. Quinn doesn't know who will pay for it. &quot;I'm just playing it day by day,&quot; he says.    About half of the nation's cost for long-term care is provided by Medicaid, an American Hospital Association study found last year. As Medicaid shouldered more long-term care costs during the past decade, the percentage of the poor it covers shrank to less than 40% from 65%. Poor women and children have been particularly hard hit by its restricted income-eligibility rules, which haven't kept pace with inflation. In 1986, the average state income cut-off for Medicaid coverage was 48% of the federal poverty level, compared with 71% in 1975.    Medicare also is getting stingier. The program's home-care benefits, for example, were restricted in 1986 after a federal General Accounting Office study recommended tighter controls on them. Medicare denials of home-care requests climbed to 7% of such requests from 1.2% before the tightening, says William Dombi, an attorney for the National Association for Home Care, a Washington, D.C., trade group.    Robin Caron, who coordinates Medicare-supported home care in York County, Maine, says Medicare officials recently denied home-care benefits for a man in his late 70s who, while recovering from surgery for colon cancer, could walk a few paces with a cane. Being marginally ambulatory, the man was declared ineligible for benefits even though he couldn't drive, she adds.    A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledges that the increased denial rates for home care &quot;is upsetting to people.&quot; But more stringent review of Medicare benefits has helped to reduce &quot;inappropriate&quot; care, he claims.    To save money, public health programs also increasingly rely on pre-set, fixed fee payment systems to compensate health-care providers who care for government-insured elderly and poor. In a variation on the prospective payment theme, the government is attempting to cover more of the elderly and poor through health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, which charge fixed fees to care for patients.    Prospective payment systems, also popular among private insurers, punch holes in the health-care safety net by restricting the ability of hospitals and other healthcare providers to provide charity care. In the past, hospitals made up costs of free care by raising insured patients' charges. Under prospective payment, the charges are fixed in advance, and hospitals can no longer play Robin Hood.    Faced with mounting losses, many hospitals are reducing free care in non-acute cases. That puts heavier burdens on the institutions, mostly urban public hospitals, that serve as last resorts for the indigent. Ten percent of the nation's hospitals provide more than 40% of all hospital care for the uninsured, according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report.    Indigent patients who come to Los Angeles county hospitals' emergency rooms sometimes wait up to 12 hours for attention if their problems aren't obviously acute, says an official with the county's health department. &quot;It can take four to 12 weeks to get an outpatient appointment,&quot; he adds.    As the safety net weakens, signs emerge of a two-tiered health system in which the poor get less health care than the non-poor. The number of Americans without a regular source of health care rose by 65% between 1982 and 1986, a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found. The study also estimated that 19 million Americans in 1986 had trouble getting needed health care because of financial reasons.    For many of them, that means going without medical attention or relying on family members for care. Ralph Whelan, a 61-year-old pensioner in Lindenwold, N.J., whose wife is paralyzed, is one of those family members.    &quot;I'm one of the people in the middle,&quot; who don't qualify for help from government programs, he says. Mr. Whelan, whose diabetic wife was paralyzed last year by a stroke, has health insurance, but it doesn't pay for her daily care or for rehabilitation. Because of age and income rules, the couple gets no help from Medicare or Medicaid. Mr. Whelan, who worries that his pension won't cover future medical expenses, contends with catheters, needles and his wife's other medical requirements by himself. She can't speak, and &quot;I often wonder if I'm doing the right things,&quot; he says.    Together, the millions of people like Mr. Whelan possess a lot of political clout, and that has helped place the shoring up of the health-care safety net high on the public agenda. Indeed, nine of 10 Americans believe everyone is entitled to health care &quot;as good as a millionaire could get,&quot; according to a recent national poll by Louis Harris andamp; Associates for Harvard Community Health Plan, a Boston HMO.    Some proposed patches for the net have been introduced recently in Congress. One measure expected to be enacted this year would provide federal benefits to cover the costs of catastrophic illness. That bill, though, won't solve the much larger problem of long-term costs. Nor will it patch gaps that leave millions without health insurance.    A bill to do that, however, has been introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). It would require employers to pay at least 80% of health-care insurance premiums for employees working at least 17.5 hours a week. The measure faces tough opposition from employers, though, who are worried about its costs.    Controversy about the Kennedy bill illuminates why the safety net continues to slide toward a crisis despite attempts to fix it in the past two decades. An array of powerful, often opposing constituencies -- including hospitals, consumer groups, employers, unions, physicians, government agencies, insurers and, of course, patients -- have stakes in the system. Achieving a consensus on the issues involved &quot;is like playing three-dimensional chess,&quot; maintains Susan Sherry, director of a Massachusetts consumer group seeking increased health coverage in her state.    Many medical experts contend the solution rests in creating a national health-care system that strengthens the safety net and also controls costs. A Massachusetts initiative, which has gained national attention during Gov. Michael Dukakis's presidential bid, is considered a bellwether for future attempts to improve the safety net at the state and national levels.    Like the Kennedy bill, it would require employers, with some exceptions, to provide health insurance for most of their workers. Employers who don't provide such benefits would have to pay additional taxes to fund health coverage for the state's uninsured. The proposed plan, which would be phased in by 1992, also would place caps on hospital budgets, limiting private insurance payouts. That has garnered business support for it.    &quot;In two or three years, I think it will be possible for a president to take (the Massachusetts) approach,&quot; says Mr. Blendon, the Harvard professor. &quot;By then, there will be more pressure on the system and more questions about how to make sure everyone pays a fair share of its costs.&quot;    ---   Mr. Stipp reports on science and medicine from The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau.    ---              Health-Care Resources Are Stretched                    Hospital's Charity Care    Cost to the hospitals of bad debt and free care to the poor, after government reimbursements.
