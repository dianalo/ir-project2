Temperatures plunged by nearly 80 degrees in a day, with one townreporting a 23-degree drop in one minute. High winds preceding thecold front blew a toddler down a street in Lander, Wyo.   The polar air outburst, accompanied today by blizzards driven bywinds over 100 mph, stunned residents of the northern Plains andMidwest, where ski slopes and ice festivals had been abandoned forgolf courses and tennis courts.   The frigid air, no longer trapped by a warm-air jet stream thathad strayed farther north than usual and left record-hightemperatures in 64 cities Tuesday, promised frigid weekend weatherfor the East Coast and as far south as Arkansas, the NationalWeather Service said.   ``We're going to make up for the party we've been enjoying,''said meteorologist Rick Brumer in Chicago.   The party ended quickly on Tuesday, as arctic air rushed into thebalmy northern Plains, including Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming,dropping temperatures to 10 to 20 below zero. High winds and blowingsnow knocked out power in Washington state _ Seattle got a raresnowfall in the worst winter storm in more than three years _ andparts of Montana.   Valentine, Neb., reached a record high of 70 degrees and droppedto zero degrees within 10 hours. The mercury plunged 33 degrees inone hour after the cold front passed Valentine. In Russell, Kan.,which had the national high temperature of 84 Tuesday afternoon, itwas 12 degrees this morning.   In a 24-hour period beginning Monday morning, temperatures fell79 degrees at Great Falls, Mont., from 62 above to 17 below zero.The state braced for even colder weather today as the systemcontinued southward.   ``It's the coldest air mass in the last five years, sinceDecember of 1983,'' said Bruce Thoricht, a weather servicemeteorologist at Billings.   In the town of Cut Bank, about 100 miles north of Helena, aFederal Aviation Administration official said the temperatureplunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds dropped the windchill to 75 below zero.   ``It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier CountyUndersheriff Bill Barron.   In Lander, winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2-year-old boydown the street, said his mother, Pamela Roberts, who chased afterhim. The toddler was not seriously hurt.   ``He fell and the wind dragged him along on his face,'' saidRoberts, 27. ``I was trying to hold him and trying to open thedoor.''   In the Plains, ranchers worked to secure cattle, particularlynewborn calves, in areas that basked in temperatures in the 60sTuesday but shivered in dangerous wind-chills down to 40 and 50below this morning.   ``It's a shock to anything's system, when you have a 100-degreedrop in temperature,'' said Tom Scott, executive director of theNebraska Beef Industry Development Board.   In another way, the cold snap was good news for farmers whosuffered through drought last summer and faced more worries for thecoming season because of the dry winter.   ``Given how dry it has been, it's better to have colder weatherbecause there's less chance of evaporation losses'' from the soil,said Iowa state climatologist Harry Hillaker.   Blizzards hit Tuesday in northwestern Minnesota, southeast NorthDakota and southern Montana. Cut Bank had 5 inches of snow andHelena 4. Blowing, drifting snow dropped visibility to almost zeroin parts of Montana and Minnesota. Snowfall was light this morningin most areas, but forecasters said more wind-whipped snow waspredicted in the upper Plains and Midwest tonight.   The Minnesota state patrol closed a 50-mile stretch of highway inthe west-central part of the state for nearly 11 hours through thismorning, and troopers Tuesday night led about 100 stranded motoriststhe 10 miles from Glyndon to Moorhead because Glyndon had noaccommodations for them.   ``It was pretty treacherous going,'' said Dave Haug of WestFargo, N.D., who drove the lead car in the convoy. ``I'm just glad Igot home.''   Snow also fell in Washington state, where Snohomish and Spokanegot up to 5 inches.   Two inches of snow were recorded in 24 hours at Seattle-TacomaInternational Airport, enough to close the airport for nearly anhour this morning. About 200 minor traffic accidents were reportedby early morning in the region, police said. It was Seattle's worstwinter weather since November 1985, when 17 inches of snow fell inthe month.   Where snow didn't fall, high winds fanned a prairie fire inNebraska that consumed 8,000 acres and burned several farm buildingsbut destroyed only one house.   The cold air had been trapped over Alaska by a dome of extremelyhigh pressure. The barometer at Northway, Alaska, rose to a NorthAmerican record high of 31.85 inches of mercury, the weather servicereported Tuesday.   The pressure was so high that the FAA late Tuesday restrictedflights over Alaska. Airplane instruments that use atmosphericpressure to calculate altitude are not designed for such highpressure and may give innacurate readings, officials said.   Before the warm jet stream shifted south and freed the arcticair, high-temperature records were broken or tied in 64 cities fromColorado to Ohio and from northern Texas into southern Minnesota.Dodge City, Kan., soared to 80 degrees, surpassing the record of 76set in 1911; Chicago climbed to 65, breaking its 1877 record of 56;Louisville, Ky., hit 67, also breaking a 112-year-old record;Detroit climbed to 60, breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890;Grand Island, Neb., reached 72; and Fort Smith, Ark., hit 77.   ``The upper air wind patterns are normally different than theywould be this time of year,'' said Brian Smith of the NationalWeather Service Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.   ``Normally we have the jet stream across the continental U.S.It's been further north. ... Weather systems couldn't move through.''   Finally, he said today, ``we've had a buckle in it.''   Authorities reported no deaths or injuries directly attributableto the cold. However, on Tuesday the body of a man whose skiff wasswamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeastAlaska was found on a beach.   The warmth that preceded the cold front was indirectlyresponsible for the death of a Wisconsin woman Tuesday aboard a sledthat sank in a lake where warnings had been issued several timesabout untrustworthy ice.</TEXT></DOC>
