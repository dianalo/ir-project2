Denver has sought the dam on the South Platte River to providefor the city's future water needs, but conservationists andNebraskans have blasted the project as environmentally disastrous.   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Tom Gleason, an aide to Denver MayorFederico Pena, both said they learned this morning of the decisionby EPA Regional Administrator Lee DeHihns.   EPA Administrator William Reilly announced his intention to vetothe project last spring and appointed DeHihns to make a final studyand issue a recommendation.   The project still faces public hearings before a final EPAdecision is made.   Kerrey said DeHihns based his decision on potential damage tofish, wildlife and recreation in Colorado and fish and wildlife inNebraska. Kerrey also said the EPA didn't agree with Denver's waterneed projections.   ``They didn't believe the Denver Water Board had assemblednumbers that supported their need,'' he said.   Gleason declined to discuss details of the decision, but said,``We did find some serious shortcomings in their rationale.''   Gleason said DeHihns, who has been reviewing the project for thepast 4{ months, briefed Pena and members of the Denver Water Boardon the agency's rationale.   Rich Lathrop, an EPA spokesman in Denver, declined comment on thereports and said the EPA's official announcement was to be madelater today.   The 1.1 million-acre-foot dam project would flood 30 miles ofCheesman Canyon southwest of Denver to create a reservoir for citywater. Its cost has been estimated at between $500 million and $1billion.   Kerrey, speaking by telephone from Washington, said DeHihns'decision indicates that EPA officials are willing to discussalternative proposals to the dam and believe Colorado could do morein the way of conservation.   ``It is possible that other alternatives could be detrimental toNebraska, although the alternatives that were mentioned by DeHihnswould not be,'' Kerrey said.   He said he hoped the agency can select an alternative that isn't``environmentally offensive,'' while still allowing for Denver'swater needs.</TEXT></DOC>
