Col. William Higgins by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems,though the president's spokesman acknowledged others' concern overIsraeli actions.   Higgins' captors said they executed him Monday in retaliationfor Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   In Washington, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole suggestedIsrael should have exercised more responsibility, but Rep. CharlesSchumer, D-N.Y., said, ``The blame has to fall on the terroriststhemselves.''   At the White House, officials would not directly embrace Dole'sremarks, but Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, withoutelaboration, ``It is fair to say that many people do share thesenator's concerns.''   Fitzwater said, ``We would not make any direct comment on hisstatemnets other than to repeat the president's words of Fridaywhere he said that he did not think kidnapping and violence helpsthe cause of peace.''   Meanwhile, a senior administration official, speaking toreporters aboard the U.S. Air Force jet that was carrying Secretaryof State James A. Baker III back to Washington from a conference inParis, said, ``Violence and kidnapping are not the route to peace''in the Middle East.   But when asked if statements both President Bush and Baker hadmade deploring kidnapping were intended as criticism of Israel, theofficial said, ``I am not criticizing Israel for what it did.That's not the interpretation.''   In any event, the official said, Bush and Baker did not want to``deflect attention from what is the real problem here _ theoutrageous and uncivilized behavior of the people who have takenthese hostages, held them, and now by an unconfirmed report atleast, have killed a young American colonel who was engaged in apeacekeeping mission.''   ``I don't think we ought to divert attention from what is thecentral issue, which is that, by speculating about somethingelse.'' said the official, who spoke only on condition thatreporters not identify him.   Israel had offered to trade the cleric and other Shiiteprisoners for Israelis and Westerners held in Lebanon. ButPresident Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, said U.S. AmbassadorWilliam Brown on Monday morning underscored to the Israelis theU.S. position on hostage situations _ that the government will notnegotiate with terrorists.   That communication took place before the Israelis announcedtheir proposal, said Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates.   At the White House, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ofDole's criticism of Israel, ``It is fair to say that many people doshare the senator's concerns,'' but he would not elaborate. ``Wewould not make any direct comment'' on the Israeli actions, he said.   Dole, speaking on the Senate floor in Washington, bitterlydenounced Israel for its kidnapping of the Islamic cleric.   ``I hope the Israelis would take another look at their actions,which they must know in advance will endanger American lives,''Dole said. ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part ofthe Israelis one of these days would be refreshing.''   He said the Bush administration ``better have some understandingwith the Israelis about future conduct that ... endangers the livesof Americans.''   While Israel's motives to curb terrorism may be good, theiractions have consequences for Americans because terrorists know``the leverage is with the United States,'' Dole said.   An Israeli official said Obeid, under interrogation, had givennames of Higgins' kidnappers as well as details about Hezbollah'sother operations and its links to Iran.   ``It's ridiculous to say that Israel is responsible for Higgins'death. We don't even know if it's him, and if it is, when he waskilled,'' said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Middle Eastsubcommittee, said Israel had failed to consult the United Statesbefore mounting its kidnap raid last week.   ``We would like to see Israel bring us in. If we are going to bein on the crash landing, we would like to be in on the takeoff aswell,'' he said.   But Rep. Schumer said blaming Israel would be ``turning theworld on its head. Israel is among the few countries seeking tofight terrorism.''   Rather than criticizing Israel for the kidnapping of Obeid, theUnited States and other countries should be supportive, Schumersaid. ``They're fighting the world's battle. When terrorists shootat you, do you just cower?''   He defended the kidnapping, saying it did not amount to sinkingto the level of the terrorists, but constituted self defense.   Baker, commenting as he left the conference in Paris, denouncedthe ``outrageous and uncivilized behavior of Higgins' captors.''</TEXT></DOC>
