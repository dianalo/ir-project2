American Express also told employees yesterday thatindividuals responsible for the delays in reporting problemsat its Optima credit card unit &quot;have left the company,&quot;resigned or been reassigned.</LP><TEXT>   American Express Travel Related Services said yesterdaythat Frank L. Skillern Jr. was named chairman of CenturionBank and executive vice president of Optima Card and consumerlending businesses. Mr. Skillern, previously president of thecompany's London-based Acuma Ltd., succeeds Anne Busquet, thearchitect of the Optima card. Ms. Busquet developed andlaunched the Optima card in 1987 and was thought to have hadthe support of her mentor, James D. Robinson III, chairman ofAmerican Express.   The move comes a few days after Harvey Golub, president ofAmerican Express, took over day-to-day responsibilities ofTravel Related Services from Edwin Cooperman, who joinedPrimerica Corp. TRS posted its first loss ever because of$265 million in charges stemming from credit andrestructuring costs at Optima.   Mr. Skillern is a former executive from American Express'sIDS Financial Corp., which Mr. Golub headed until last year.The company said in a statement that Ms. Busquet &quot;will helpMr. Skillern with an orderly transition and then take anotherposition within the TRS company.&quot;   In addition, Richard Interdonato, the operations andcredit executive who oversaw Centurion Bank, which heldOptima portfolios, was succeeded by William Barton, head ofthe Western Regional Operating Center.   But Mr. Golub told employees in a letter that &quot;we do notbelieve that either Anne or Rich were involved in the policyviolations or behaved with any lack of integrity.&quot;   Some analysts said that part of the problem was thedifficulty of communicating bad news to upper management --something they consider to be a general problem in thecorporate culture at American Express.   &quot;My understanding is that senior management has littletolerance for bad news, and this is the latest in a series ofincidents where operating managers tried to forestall theinevitable,&quot; said John Keefe, analyst at Lipper AnalyticalSecurities Corp.   While the company has said that part of the problemsstemmed from cyclical pressures from the economy, Mr. Golubwrote that &quot;the second aspect of Optima that we have beenlooking at is the failure by some employees to comply withcertain of our account classification policies.&quot; He addedthat &quot;this problem was discovered and corrected before it hada material impact from a financial point of view.&quot; Totallosses that were delayed in being recognized were $24million.   The company notified the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,which has regulatory oversight for Centurion Bank. That'sbecause the company's reports filed with the FDIC did notinclude the losses and were therefore not accurate. Still, anofficial with knowledge of the company's investigation saidit's doubtful that legal actions will be taken.   Mr. Golub wrote that &quot;the few individuals who abused oursystems clearly violated policies and our reputation forintegrity. These employees have left the company. In additionwe have asked for the resignation or changed the jobs ofcertain people who had some credit responsibility for theportfolio, but who were not directly involved inmisclassifying records. They failed either to takeappropriate or timely actions to correct the problemsthemselves or to bring them to the attention of someone whocould.&quot;   The company reportedly will be looking for senior-levelcredit officers to help oversee Centurion Bank, which hasseen delinquency rates soar to a staggering 9.5% in the thirdquarter, from 8.6% in the second quarter.   &quot;They need a credit specialist,&quot; said James Hanbury,analyst at Wertheim Schroder.</TEXT></DOC>
