The latest effort, by the National Cable TelevisionAssociation, a Washington trade group, is a three-yearcampaign whose main focus is feel-good ads and publicrelations training for managers. The primary theme in thecampaign, budgeted at $10 million for the first year: &quot;Cablecontributes to life.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The campaign aims to stress the price value and socialworth of cable, a message the industry has had little luckdriving home to consumers or Congress. &quot;You've got anindustry that until only recently has been a constructionindustry,&quot; says James Mooney, president of the NCTA. &quot;Nowwe're becoming a service industry. Our public relations hasbeen kind of spotty.&quot;   That may be an understatement. After the Cable Act of 1984freed the industry from years of regulation, some highlyvisible operators jacked up prices without offering betterservice. The result: a massive drive to reregulate theindustry that is continuing into its second session ofCongress. Legislators are now pondering measures that includerate regulation and retransmission consent, a provisionrequiring cable operators to start paying for the right toretransmit local broadcast signals.   The current campaign reflects the second industrywidedrive by cable operators to spruce up their image, and somesay this latest effort may be too little, too late. In themid-1980s, a national campaign by the Council for CableInformation failed in part because cable companies had toagree on a single message that didn't necessarily address theproblems of individual operators. A mix of smaller,forgettable campaigns has followed.   The NCTA is separately attempting to counter a campaign bythe National Association of Broadcasters, which has beenrunning ads on local TV stations declaring, &quot;If cable wins{in Congress}, consumers lose.&quot; The NCTA, meanwhile, isrunning its own anti-broadcasting ads, on cable and in fliersin monthly cable bills.   The cable industry continues to face new attacks. Inanother public-image blow, the September issue of ConsumerReports magazine stated that viewer satisfaction with cableTV was the lowest the magazine has found in 16 years ofrating service industries. The cable industry responded bydeclaring the methodology flawed, the information dated andthe results unfairly presented. Says the NCTA's Mr. Mooney,&quot;We're making big progress in customer service. To insistnothing's changing is desperately unfair.&quot;   The new campaign, produced by Bozell Inc., stresses thevalue of cable programming. In one of the six televisionspots airing on cable, as shots of classic movies and starspan across the screen, a voice says, &quot;A monthly subscriptionto basic cable gives you over 600 movies for less than itcosts a family of four to go to the movies once.&quot;   In another, over smoky scenes of elephants and poacherswith guns, a voice says, &quot;Where would the African elephant betoday without cable? After viewing a Discovery Channeldocumentary on the slaughter of African elephants, delegatesfrom 103 nations enacted a total ban on the sale of ivory.&quot;The camera cuts to baby elephants.   A third version of the campaign's television spots showsscenes from the Gulf War while an announcer asks, &quot;Wherewould coverage of the Gulf War have been without cable?&quot; Toexplain to viewers where their money goes, he answers, &quot;Cablecompanies like yours have paid more than $1 billion to CNN soyou can get comprehensive news 24 hours a day.&quot;   Full-page print ads now running in national newspapers,including this one, state that &quot;cable television isprogramming every high school kid in America to stay inschool&quot; with &quot;Cable in the Classroom,&quot; a program in whichcable companies provide free installation, service andprogramming to junior and senior high schools.   &quot;I'll give them credit for programming,&quot; says GeneKimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation ofAmerica, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington. Butwith this campaign &quot;they want to distract people from thefact that they're overcharging people for poor service.&quot;   Mr. Mooney, however, emphasizes that the ads are just partof an overall strategy which sets forth guidelines andtraining for corporate, community and consumer relations forboth local managers and chief executives. He says thecampaign, funded by essentially doubling the dues of NCTAmembers, will also dovetail with a set of voluntary serviceguidelines announced recently that most cable operators saythey have met.   Says Amos Hostetter, chairman and chief executive officerof Continental Cablevision Inc., &quot;We've made great strides inprogramming and service. It's a very positive story. We'vejust got to start telling it.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          CLIO AWARDS: An investor group led by Screen magazineowner Ruth Ratny said it purchased the beleaguered ClioAwards after protracted negotiations. Ms. Ratny said hergroup bought the trademark and relevant assets of ClioEnterprises. However, Bill Evans, who has controlled theawards for two decades, said the group has acquired only a25% stake with an option to acquire the rest. Ms. Ratny saidMr. Evans, who has been harshly criticized in the ad industryfor the collapse of the awards, won't be associated with thenew company. But Mr. Evans insisted he will still have a handin training staff members at the new organization.
