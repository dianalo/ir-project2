The action came at a sensitive time. U.S. congressional conferees have cleared provisions in a pending trade bill to impose sanctions against Toshiba Machine Co. for illegally exporting machine tools to the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984. Japan wants to stave off lighter sanctions against the parent company, Toshiba Corp.    The shipments to China totaled only 48 million yen ($387,000), and the U.S. is more tolerant of technology exports to China. Still, the Toshiba Machine incident deeply embarrassed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is eager to be seen clamping down on such exports.    &quot;It may not be a serious breach of national security,&quot; said Hiroshi Fujiwara, deputy director of MITI's security export control office. &quot;But it's still a violation. It was deliberate, repeated and malignant, and that's serious. We intend to be harsh in going after violators.&quot;    Police yesterday raided Kyokuto Shokai Co. and Shinsei Koeki Co. to investigate allegations that the trading companies sneaked militarily sensitive electronic equipment out of Japan in airline luggage during 1985 and 1986. MITI filed charges Monday with police against the two small companies for allegedly violating restraints on technology exports to communist countries.    MITI Minister Hajime Tamura yesterday informed U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield of the steps, just after urging the ambassador to discourage anti-Japan trade bills and U.S. reprisals against Toshiba Corp. In Washington, Paul Freedenberg, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said the raids show Japan's &quot;commitment to a strong and effective export-control regime, reinforced by increased funds and stronger laws.&quot;    Japan bases its trade rules on those of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based body that regulates trade with communist countries. Japan changed its export-control laws last year to allow MITI to more easily catch violators.    MITI began investigating the companies after a tip from the U.S. government last summer. Ministry officials said Kyokuto illegally exported to China five digital memories, a sampling oscilloscope and a signal analyzer, together costing 34 million yen, between June 1985 and June 1986. MITI said Shinsei illegally exported two digital memories costing 14 million yen between August and November 1986.    MITI said officials from the companies hand-carried the equipment through Japanese airports to four Chinese-government trading companies in Beijing. The final destination isn't known.    The equipment generally is used in such applications as measuring earthquakes or testing microwaves transmitted by communications gear. But the machines also can be used to test nuclear explosions, to fine-tune radar equipment and to detect submarines.    A third Tokyo company, Iwatsu Electric Co., made the equipment. A MITI official said the ministry hasn't charged Iwatsu with wrongdoing but wouldn't say if Iwatsu is under investigation. MITI added that Kyokuto also exported equipment to China in 1982 that may have violated Cocom rules.    Kyokuto, a company with 161 employees that also sells chemicals and air-conditioning equipment domestically, had exports of 6.77 billion yen in 1986. It exports computer equipment and electronic parts to China. Shinsei, a company with 60 employees, had exports of 24.57 billion yen in 1986, mostly to China.    Officials at the companies wouldn't comment on the MITI charges. </TEXT></DOC>
