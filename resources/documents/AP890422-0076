Maurice Nyagumbo, who was the government's senior minister forpolitical affairs, will be entombed Sunday at Heroes' Acre on theoutskirts of Harare, a government spokesman said.   Nyagumbo, 64, died at Harare's main hospital on Thursday frompoisoning. No details were available, but police sources said theywere investigating whether he committed suicide.   He was a founder of the party of socialist President RobertMugabe, which controls the government as the country's only legalparty. Nyagumbo ranked third in its hierarchy.   Nyagumbo, the longest serving political detainee in the formercolony of Rhodesia, spent 21 years in jail for opposition to whiterule. After Rhodesia became the independent nation of Zimbabwe in1980, Nyagumbo held key posts in the Cabinet, the 15-memberPolitburo and the ruling party's Central Committee.   But he resigned his government and party posts April 14 after hewas found by a presidential inquiry to be involved in a racketinvolving illegal sales of vehicles. Investigators found he abusedhis position by acquiring 38 vehicles, mostly for friends, from astate assembly plant.   Nyagumbo denied wrongdoing but stepped down.   Despite the scandal, the government spokesman, who commented oncondition of anonymity, said Mugabe declared Nyagumbo a nationalhero.   ``His death has robbed us of a man whose record of revolutionaryperformance is second to none,'' the president said Friday.   Nyagumbo's body was to lie in state until burial.   The revolutionary shrine honors about 27,000 Zimbabweans whodied in the seven-year guerrilla war that led to independence.</TEXT></DOC>
