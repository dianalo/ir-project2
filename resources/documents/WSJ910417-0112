As executive pay has soared in recent years, oftenirrespective of corporate performance, suspicions have grownthat compensation committees were asleep at the switch.</LP><TEXT>   Maybe they have been, say a group ofcompensation-committee members brought together by The WallStreet Journal. But, they insist, that's changing. Restiveshareholders, complex compensation plans, increasingcompetition -- all are forcing compensation committees to paymore attention. A lot more attention.   &quot;If there are any rubber stamps, the ink pads got dry,&quot;says David McLaughlin, a compensation consultant and a memberof several compensation committees, including those at ExideElectronics Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc.   Besides Mr. McLaughlin, the Journal's panel includes:   -- Gerard Seelig, former executive vice president ofAllied-Signal Inc. and now executive-in-residence at ColumbiaUniversity's Graduate School of Business. His compensationcommittees include that at Monogram Aerospace Group, owned byVestar Capital, an investment group.   -- Hicks Waldron, former chairman and chief executiveofficer of Avon Products Inc. and now chairman of BoardroomConsultants Inc. His compensation committees include:Atlantic Richfield Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Ryder SystemsInc.   -- Walter Wriston, former chairman and chief executiveofficer of Citicorp, and now a member of the compensationcommittee at General Electric Co.   -- Boris Yavitz, professor of management and former deanat Columbia University's Graduate School of Business. Hiscompensation committees include: Barnes Group, Crane Co. andMedusa Corp.   Excerpts of their discussion follow.                                                                                                          RATCHET EFFECT                                                                                                          WRISTON: {Setting compensation} has become a giantratchet. Every boards' compensation committee opens with:&quot;Here is a graph of the compensation of the 50 largestcompanies in America, and our sterling CEO is in the thirdquartile.&quot; So you're getting these huge salaries and thedifference between the top and the shop floor has gotten sowide that it is storing up trouble for tomorrow.   SEELIG: I think certainly the gap between what we defineas top management and that of the lower two-thirds of thepopulation has increased. And I think part of the reason isthe ratcheting. Everybody talks about how we have to becompetitive, and there's the implication that if you're notcompetitive, you're going to have your management team or keymembers look for jobs elsewhere.   YAVITZ: Everybody wants to be above the average. Ifeverybody is above the average, the average is going to moveup.   SEELIG: Let's look at the actual setting, and that mayexplain a little bit of why this is going on. In so manycases the corporate management gets all the statistics andgets all the data and makes all these presentations. Thecompensation committee will ask questions, but -- unless theyuse outside consultants of their own and very, very rarely dothey do that -- they find themselves inundated withmanagement-generated and maybe even selective data. So inmost cases the board and the committee probably end up --maybe reluctantly -- going along with the recommendations.                                                                                                          PAY FOR PERFORMANCE                                                                                                          WRISTON: With the lists of the highest-paid people, itbecomes obvious that some of the highest-paid people have hadthe worst performance. How long that will continue, I don'tknow. But I think where it's going to get adjusted -- and Ithink you'll find it in the proxies this year -- is thatthere just won't be any bonuses or the bonuses will be halfof what they were.   MCLAUGHLIN: It's a pivotal year -- this year and the nextcouple of years -- because we've had seven or eight years ofrelatively good results in many companies and I thinkinevitably there's been an escalation of the total cash. ButI think we're going to see a difference this year. I hope wedo.   WALDRON: I've seen some changes in the companies on whoseboards I serve. At three of the companies that I serve on,the management doesn't make a recommendation.   YAVITZ: My sense is that in the last few years there'sbeen a very strong, growing interest in the incentivecomponent of compensation. There's been less hassling anddiscussing of how do you set the base rate, but there's beenmore exploration and experimentation in how do you really tryto tie performance to pay.                                                                                                          FINDING THE RIGHT YARDSTICK                                                                                                          SEELIG: There are a variety of incentive-type plans. Ithink {the individual bonus} is a very important one and canbe structured to be focused on individuals' contribution andperformance. Stock options and {other stock-relatedcompensation} tend to be more based on the company'sperformance. I think the trend is -- and certainly should --be more toward individual type of performance.   YAVITZ: It's very silly to give somebody three levels downa bonus based on corporate profit which is made up of adiversified 17 divisions.   WRISTON: It's very dangerous, though, to base it entirelyon the division group because then they play games. Youshould have some portion of everybody's {bonus} based on thecorporation's results, even if it's 25%.   SEELIG: I think you're right. You should have a product ofthe two. But I'm suggesting {that managers} be measuredsignificantly -- maybe not totally, but significantly -- onthe performance which they have the capability ofcontrolling.   WALDRON: But let's say you have a plan based on measuringthe performance of a business. Do you measure on the basis ofthe budget, and if we achieve the budget? Or do you measureit on the basis of competition?   YAVITZ: It's also not as simple as dollars of profit. Ifyou want people to worry not only about profit, but how muchinvestment you used to do it, you try to do something thatlooks at that. If some people say the important thing is tocreate a positive, strong cash flow, you want to tie thenumbers to cash flow. So what it is you measure is a toughthing to find. The other part that's always tough is thathaving decided this is what we want to measure, what do youset as par? Do you have a budget which then becomes par? Thenthe question comes, who sets the budget? You're always afraidthat if the people who are going to be measured set it,you're going to be low-balling the initial budget to make iteasy to beat.                                                                                                          MOTIVATION                                                                                                          YAVITZ: I think more meaningful standards is what we'retrying to shoot for. So that you don't just compensate butalso motivate. It's extremely difficult, and yet the peopleyou're supposed to be motivating have to have someunderstanding of how this action will reflect as against thataction, and that gets to be very difficult if the formulasget too complicated and too esoteric.   WALDRON: And you know the people in the businesses who aregetting paid understand to a greater degree than the{compensation consultants} who are putting the plans in. Ittook me a long while to learn that people do what you paythem to do, not what you ask them to do. And if you design aplan that says this is what I want to do, but they get paidmore for doing something else . . .   MCLAUGHLIN: . . . in about two nanoseconds they've figuredit out.   SEELIG: That's why the whole subject of compensation is socritical. A person is going to be strongly influenced by howhe gets compensated.                                                                                                          ROLE OF COMP COMMITTEES                                                                                                          MCLAUGHLIN: Are you finding that more judgment is requiredat the compensation committee and board level?   WALDRON: I am, absolutely.   WRISTON: Absolutely.   YAVITZ: I think the compensation committees are gettingmore backbone in resisting overriding the formula if itdoesn't make sense. If we did poorly, and bonuses are not asgood as people were hoping to get, that's what the game isall about.   SEELIG: I'm not sure I totally agree. I've always foundthat even though there usually is some sort of a base pointbelow which you presumably don't get any bonus, thatinvariably some type of an extenuating circumstances will bepresented.   WRISTON: I've seen a company where the management decidedto do something, and it took a big hit to do it. Then theysaid to the comp committee, well, we're going to exclude thaton the bonuses. And they got away with it. I, for one, raisedsome hell about it. I have seen managements who exclude thesebig charges, which I think is wrong. I'm talking about thetop level here, and I was ashamed of one board that let thatget by -- twice.                                                                                                          WHY THINGS ARE CHANGING                                                                                                          WALDRON: I think there is an awareness that the system hasprovided inequities. On the other hand, I don't think weshould sit here and denigrate the whole system because by andlarge I think the whole system has always worked reasonablywell.   YAVITZ: I would also say that during the last decade, theLBO and the merger and acquisition mania have served tohighlight the gross inequities. The horror stories havegotten more horrible. Plus, I think the whole role of theboard is being taken more seriously, and this is clearly onepart where it's showing.   MCLAUGHLIN: {One thing} that is astonishing to me is thelevel of sophistication and knowledge that exists now on thepart of the boards.   SEELIG: One other driving force that clearly makes thepresent different from the past is that American industriesare in a much more intensive, competitive climate. And one ofthe automatic consequences is that performance is absolutelyparamount. We can't just go along year by year getting somesmall percentage improvement. Therefore, performance is goingto have to be recognized. This whole trend to rewardingperformance is what is taking place as a consequence of thatincreased competitive environment.   WRISTON: I think that would be my main point. Nobody canbe fat, dumb and happy any more because some fellow inSingapore is going to steal your lunch. So you have to be aworld-class competitor in just about everything. You cannotpermit your company not to become competitive, or you'll beout of business.</TEXT></DOC>
