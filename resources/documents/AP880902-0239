Some Asians say they see signs of racism.   Several Asian newspapers have published editorials remindingAustralia of its growing economic links with Asian countries.   ``The outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way inAustralia will either confirm or confound the view Asians hold thata strong undercurrent of racism exists in the `Lucky Country',''the conservative English-language South China Morning Post of HongKong said.   ``While Australia was founded on British values, the facts todayare that politically and economically the country cannot alwayslook West.''   In Australia, a growing influx of Asian migrants is in thebackground of a debate over immigration rules and multi-culturalism_ a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links withtheir homelands.   John Howard, leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party,says immigration from Asia should be slowed in the interests ofsocial harmony and that immigrants should embrace theEnglish-speaking majority's Anglo-Saxon cultural values.   ``I am not saying I would end Asian immigration,'' he said.``But what I am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of anycommunity and any government to say that it is imposing socialtensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion.''   The government has proposed legislation that would prohibit theuse of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potentialimmigrants' acceptability. Howard, who heads a two-party nationalopposition, is against the bill but has lost support recently inParliament.   Prime Minister Bob Hawke, of the Labor Party, has vowed to fightany move to restrict Asian immigration and says he would maintain apolicy of non-discrimination even if he thought it would meanlosing an election.   Australia, a continent with only 16 million people near Asia'shuge population of 3 billion, is an attractive destination foremigrants. It is called ``lucky'' because of its rich resources andcomfortable climate.   The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the number of Asianimmigrants climbed by one-third in the past year. Out of 116,430immigrants between January and November 1987, 47,450 were Asians,compared with 36,360 in the same period in 1986. Australia hastaken in 100,000 Vietnamese since 1975, when the Indochina warended, and has a growing Chinese community.   Emigration counselors in several Asian countries list Australiaas attractive for its climate, proximity and educationalopportunities for children. Increasing numbers of Asians withcapital and business experience are snowing interest in emigratingto Australia.   In Taiwan, Australia now surpassed Canada and the United Statesas the top choice of emigrants.   ``People here barely knew anything about Australia three yearsago,'' said David Chang, manager of Taiwan's Queter InternationalCompany, which handles emigration applications to Australia. ``Butemigrating to Australia has become a fad now.''   Chang said he understood why Australia had doubled the capitalrequirement for business emigrants to 500,000 Australian dollars($410,000) in the past year.   ``Australia no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now asmuch as before. It is only natural that it closes the door a bit.''   In Hong Kong, where emigration is on the upswing due tonervousness over China's taking sovereignty of the British colonyin 1997, Australia is the second most popular destination afterCanada.   Janet Sekavs, regional migration director in Australia'sConsulate in Hong Kong, said 6,431 Filipinos emigrated to Australiain 1986, compared with 5,140 from Hong Kong and 5,032 from Malaysia.   Chan Ka-wai, editor of The Emigrant, Hong Kong's magazine onemigration, said he thought the number of emigration applicationswould remain high even if Australia imposes new curbs.   ``Australia is strange,'' Chan said. ``It is in Asia but it doesnot treat itself as an Asian country. It is a multi-racial countryand economically it should have the potential to accept morepeople.''   Susie Tse, migration service manager of Price Waterhouseemigration consultancy in Hong Kong, said, ``It would be racist ifAustralia refuses Asians. But from my nine years' experience inAustralia, I have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is justover-exaggeration by the press.''   The fiercest reaction has come from a Malaysian newspaper, theStar in Kuala Lumpur, where editor V.K. Chin wrote in a recentcolumn that Australians he described as racists make Asianimmigrants ``feel inadequate, insecure and even sub-human.''   ``Based on the statements of some of these pillars of theAustralian political establishment, it would appear that insideevery Liberal senator or member of Parliament is a raciststruggling to get out,'' Chin wrote.   ``Australia may be a big, wide-open country but it is in dangerof being led by small-minded people with petty prejudices andattitudes more suited to the Victorian age.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 12</NOTE></DOC>
