More specifically, focuswas on development of a model for propagation of the Westward TravellingSurge (WTS) as seen from the viewpoint of an active ionosphere. Alsoconsidered was a mechanism for the generation of Pi2 pulsations. An importantfeature of the approach is the natural coupling that exists between theWTS motion and the frequency spectrum of the Pi2 modes. Thus, the theorypredicts the correlation of Pi2 waveforms to substorm onsets. This correlationseems to be a reasonable one in light of recent observations of substormmorphology.</TEXT></DOC>
