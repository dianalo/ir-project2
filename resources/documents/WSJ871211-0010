The summit's outcome leaves in doubt whether the two leaders next year can achieve the agreement they both want: to cut arsenals of long-range, or strategic, nuclear arms by 50%.    The two leaders did agree to some new details that could be included in such a pact. And, speaking at a packed 90-minute news conference after the summit, Mr. Gorbachev said there is an &quot;opportunity at hand&quot; for a breakthrough toward a new strategic arms agreement. But the Soviet leader continued to link deep cuts in offensive nuclear weapons to restrictions on President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which he said would &quot;undermine strategic stability.&quot;    The two sides agreed that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev will continue to plan for another summit meeting in mid-1988 in Moscow, but they didn't set a date.    Although the summit didn't produce any major new breakthroughs, both leaders tried to maintain a cordial atmosphere as they parted on the south grounds of the White House during a rainstorm. The two men used virtually the same language to describe the movement on arms control -- Mr. Reagan said &quot;some progress&quot; was made and Mr. Gorbachev spoke of &quot;some headway&quot; -- and both held out hope for more significant agreements in the future.    Mr. Gorbachev told reporters at the new Soviet Embassy in Washington that the U.S. has agreed to set limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles, and he claimed that Soviet scientists have conquered the difficult problem of verifying whether such missiles are armed with nuclear or conventional warheads. He also said the two nations have agreed to set a limit of 4,900 nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are the biggest, fastest, and most threatening weapons in their arsenals.    But the Soviet leader added that &quot;we still have a lot of work to do&quot; before agreeing to cuts in arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons. And he suggested that he continues to insist that the U.S. must conduct missile-defense research within a narrow interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, not the broader interpretation favored by the Reagan administration. Asked if he and Mr. Reagan had made any progress toward his stated goal of &quot;preventing an arms race in space,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev replied: &quot;I don't think so.'    U.S. officials said a joint statement from the leaders will allow the U.S. to continue testing parts of President Reagan's proposed SDI, or Star Wars, defense system. The agreement says that for an unspecified period both countries will continue to abide by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which prohibits deployment of new missile-defense systems. But the statement also specifies that both sides will be free to conduct research, development and testing of defensive systems &quot;as required&quot; during that time.    At the end of the period, each side would be &quot;free to decide its course of action,&quot; the statement said.    The statement says that negotiators from both superpowers will be told to work out, in talks in Geneva, precisely how they'll continue to honor the ABM treaty and for how long. The U.S. has proposed to abide by the treaty for another seven years; the Soviets have proposed 10 years.    Mr. Gorbachev, by continuing to insist that the U.S. halt aid to rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government as Moscow begins withdrawing its 115,000 troops from the country, made it clear that the two leaders made little headway toward resolving their differences over Afghanistan.    Mr. Reagan said the summit's &quot;greatest accomplishment&quot; was the signing of a treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear arms, a pact that had been wrapped up before the summit even began. But the friendly atmosphere at the end of the meetings indicated that both leaders are eager to leave the door open for more progress next year.    In a televised speech from the White House last night, Mr. Reagan asserted that the superpowers made &quot;dramatic progress&quot; in arms control, but he also acknowledged that &quot;much remains to be done in that area&quot; and on other issues.    Mr. Reagan, apparently in an effort to quell conservative critics who have accused him of being overly eager to reach agreements with the Soviets, also asserted that he talked at length with Mr. Gorbachev about Afghanistan and human-rights issues.    &quot;Soviet-American relations are no longer focused only on arms-control issues,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;They now cover a far broader agenda, one that has at its root realism and candor.&quot; For example, he said, some Soviet prisoners will be released and others granted visas to leave that country as a result of the summit talks.    The president said he &quot;made it clear&quot; during the summit that his strategic defense program will continue. And he put in a strong pitch for a quick Senate ratification of the agreement he signed eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons. &quot;I believe this treaty represents a landmark in postwar history because it is not just an arms-control, but an arms-reduction, agreement,&quot; he said.    During a 70-minute opening statement at his news conference, Mr. Gorbachev said the U.S. and the Soviet Union are &quot;emerging from the long drawn-out confrontation&quot; of the past 40 years, and he emphasized that he and President Reagan had made history by agreeing to scrap their intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles.    &quot;The percentages don't really matter,&quot; he said of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, Treaty signed Tuesday. &quot;What does matter is we have opened up a new phase in the real process of nuclear disarmament by agreeing&quot; to the treaty, he said.    &quot;Differences still exist and on some points those differences are very serious indeed,&quot; the Soviet leader added. But in remarks carried on live television in the U.S., he added: &quot;We do not regard them as insurmountable.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev may have decided to play down his country's objections to Mr. Reagan's SDI program for now in hopes that the cost of developing missile defenses, and congressional objections to the effort, may kill the program, anyway. But the continuing dispute over what kind of testing and research is acceptable suggests the problem may still block the way to a 50% cut in strategic-arms arsenals.    While Mr. Gorbachev said discussions on strategic arms dominated his meetings with Mr. Reagan, he went out of his way in his departure statement at the White House to stress that he considered his contacts with American political, business and intellectual leaders to be nearly as important as his talks with the president. The remarks suggested that he is trying to build bridges to American society that will remain long after Mr. Reagan has left the White House.    &quot;In bidding farewell to America, I am looking forward to a new encounter with it in the hope that I will then be able to see not only its capital, but also to meet face-to-face with its great people, to chat and to have some lively exchanges with ordinary Americans,&quot; he said.    Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's drive to reach out to the American public produced the most surprising scene of the summit just hours before its conclusion. On his way to the White House for his final meeting with President Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev ordered his Soviet-made limousine to stop at one of the busiest intersections in downtown Washington and he jumped out and began shaking hands with passers-by on the corner.    Vice President George Bush, who was accompanying the Soviet leader back to the White House, also jumped out to join the impromptu public meeting, as security agents from both countries scrambled to protect the two officials.    In the wake of the summit, both countries next year will be trying to work out a series of difficult and divisive issues. The Soviets have said they would like to get their troops out of Afghanistan, though they apparently failed in this summit to reach an agreement under which the U.S. would agree to stop aiding the Afghan resistance as Soviet troops begin to withdraw.    In addition, Mr. Gorbachev's government must try to win extensions in international financing for his country, a particularly important task as he tries to carry out broad economic reforms.    The Reagan administration, for its part, will have to push Congress to ratify the treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear arms without attaching &quot;killer amendments&quot; that would force the pact back to the negotiating table. </TEXT></DOC>
