These compounds can be used for staining cells, as well as      for the determination of various analytes found in human or animal      biological fluids. Such determinations can be carried out in solution or      by using dry analytical elements. The fluorescent compounds can be reacted      with quinone nuclei to form reducible compounds which are also useful in      analytical methods. In addition, the compounds can be incorporated into      what are known as &quot;loadable&quot; latex particles to form detectable labels and      biological reagents. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a division of application Ser. No. 215,478 filed Jul. 5, 1988 now      U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,414. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to a class of phenalenimine fluorescent compounds      and reducible compounds. It also relates to analytical compositions,      elements and methods utilizing such compounds. Moreover, it relates to      fluorescent labels and fluorescent labeled biological reagents useful in      biomedical studies and various analytical determinations. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In the fields of medicine, biomedical research and diagnostic and clinical      chemistry, there is often a need to visibly detect a cell or component      thereof in order to effectively examine, diagnose or treat an animal or      person. Many colorimetric and fluorometric compounds have been used for      such detection. For example, copending and commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No.      824,757, filed Jan. 31, 1986, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,803,161 by Babb et al      describes novel phenalenone and benzphenalenone fluorescent compounds and      reducible precursors which are useful in various medical and diagnostic      applications, such as for staining cells and for detecting microorganisms. </PAR><PAR>  Many studies and determinations of physiologically reactive species (that      is, species which will react in a specific binding reaction with a      complementary binding partner, such as cell components, proteins,      peptides, polypeptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, haptens and other      materials known in the art) are carried out using &quot;labels&quot; which      facilitate the detection or separation of the materials of interest at low      concentrations. In one such application, the diagnosis of pathological      conditions and the detection of drugs or narcotics is often carried out      using labeled materials in specific binding assays using competitive      binding principles. </PAR><PAR>  Whenever labels are used, sensitivity is of prime importance due to the      generally low levels of detectable species present. Radiometric labels      have several drawbacks including limited sensitivity, short useful life      and handling hazards. Various colorimetric labels can be incorporated into      latex particles for use in analytical methods, but the dyes may be hard to      detect and provide limited sensitivity. </PAR><PAR>  Fluorescence spectroscopy, one of the most sensitive and versatile of the      optical analytical techniques, has become increasingly popular in recent      years to overcome the drawbacks of other labeling techniques. Fluorescent      labels for immunoassays are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,259,313 (issued      Mar. 31, 1981 to Frank et al) and related 4,283,382 (issued Aug. 11, 1981      to Frank et al) which describe labeled polymeric particles useful in      immunoassays. </PAR><PAR>  After appropriate excitation, many known fluorescent compounds used in      biological methods emit radiation at a wavelength less than 600 nm. In      such cases, detection of the component of interest can be interfered with      by other components commonly found in biological samples and which emit      electromagnetic radiation at or near the emission wavelength of the      fluorescent compound. To overcome this, various filtration steps can be      carried out to remove interferents but this results in a tedious and      costly procedure. It would be highly desirable to have fluorescent      compounds which are detectable at a wavelength at or above about 600 nm.      It would also be useful to have such compounds as labels in analytical      procedures, and incorporated in precursors which are fluorescent only      after appropriate chemical treatment. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Novel fluorescent compounds which are detectable at a wavelength at or      above about 600 nm are those represented by the structure      ##STR2##      wherein R' and R&quot; are independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl,      carbocyclic aryl or a heterocycle, or R' comprises the carbon or      heteroatoms which form a fused ring with the compound nucleus. These      compounds can be used in aqueous compositions buffered to a pH of 9 or      less. </PAR><PAR>  This invention also provides a fluorescent label comprising the fluorescent      compound identified above which is incorporated into polymeric particles      which are derived from a loadable latex having a discontinuous phase and      an aqueous phase. This fluorescent label can be used to provide a      fluorescent labeled biological reagent comprising a biological compound      bound thereto. </PAR><PAR>  A dry analytical element useful in analytical or diagnostic methods      comprises an absorbent carrier material having one or more zones, and      contains in at least one of the zones a fluorescent labeled biological      reagent as described above. </PAR><PAR>  Further, a method for the determination of a specific binding ligand in an      aqueous liquid comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  A. in the presence of a receptor for the ligand, contacting a sample of the      liquid with a fluorescent labeled specific binding ligand analog      comprising a specific binding ligand bound to the fluorescent label      described above, to form a complex between the receptor and the ligand      analog, </PAR><PAR>  B. separating the complex from uncomplexed materials, and </PAR><PAR>  C. fluorimetrically detecting either the complex or the uncomplexed      materials at a wavelength greater than or equal to about 600 nm. </PAR><PAR>  In another method of this invention, a specific binding ligand is      determined in an aqueous liquid by </PAR><PAR>  A. contacting a sample of the liquid with a fluorescent labeled specific      binding reagent comprising a receptor for the ligand bound to a      fluorescent label as described above, to form a complex between the      receptor and the ligand, and </PAR><PAR>  B. fluorimetrically detecting the complex at a wavelength greater than or      equal to 600 nm. </PAR><PAR>  A method for staining a biological specimen comprises the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  A. contacting a biological specimen with a composition buffered to a pH of      from about 9 or less and comprising a fluorescent compound as identified      above, and </PAR><PAR>  B. detecting stained material at a wavelength greater than or equal to      about 600 nm. </PAR><PAR>  This invention also provides a reducible precursor compound of the      structure:      ##STR3##      wherein R.sup.1 is a monovalent fluorescent moiety derived from the      fluorescent compound identified above, </PAR><PA1>  R.sup.2 and R.sup.4 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or an electron      withdrawing group, </PA1><PA1>  R.sup.5 is methylene, and </PA1><PA1>  R.sup.3 is      ##STR4##       or it is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or an electron withdrawing group as      defined for R.sup.2 and R.sup.4, or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4, taken together,      represent the atoms necessary to complete a fused carbocyclic ring. </PA1><PAR>  This reducible precursor compound can be included in at least one zone of a      dry analytical element comprising an absorbent carrier material having one      or more zones. </PAR><PAR>  The reducible compound can be used in a method for the determination of an      analyte comprising the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  A. at a pH of 9 or less, contacting a sample of a liquid suspected of      containing an analyte with a reducible compound, as identified above, to      release a fluorescent dye, and </PAR><PAR>  B. determining the released fluorescent dye at a wavelength greater than or      equal to about 600 nm as a result of the presence of the analyte. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds of this invention can be used in rapid and highly sensitive      assays even when the analytes are present in low concentrations. Spectral      interferents are avoided because the compounds fluoresce at a wavelength      at or above about 600 nm which is generally higher than most interferents      found in biological specimens. The fluorescent compounds can be readily      attached to quinone carriers to provide precursors which release dyes when      the precursor is reduced in the presence of the analyte. In addition the      fluorescent compounds can be used for staining biological specimens and      can be &quot;loaded&quot; into loadable polymeric particles to form fluorescent      labels and biological reagents. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The fluorescent compounds of this invention are phenalenimine compounds      represented by the structure      ##STR5##      wherein R' and R&quot; are independently (that is, the same or different)      hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (generally of 1 to 20 carbon      atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, hexyl, chloromethyl,      methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, benzyl, dodecyl and hexadecyl, and preferably      of 1 to 10 carbon atoms), substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl      (generally of 5 to 7 carbon atoms, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl,      4-methylcyclohexyl, 2,3-dichlorocycloheptyl, and preferably of 5 or 6      carbon atoms), substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic aryl (generally of      6 to 14 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, napthyl, tolyl, xylyl,      4-chlorophenyl, and preferably of 6 to 10 carbon atoms), or a substituted      or unsubstituted heterocycle andlsqb;aromatic or nonaromatic, generally of 5 to 7      carbon and hetero atoms (for example, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen), such      as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, imidazolyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, furyl, and      preferably of 5 or 6 carbon and hetero atomsandrsqb;. Alternatively, R' comprises      the carbon and hetero atoms (for example, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen)      necessary to form a fused ring with the compound nucleus (generally of 5      to 7 carbon and hetero atoms, which ring can be substituted with one or      more alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclic groups as defined above,      alkoxy groups, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and the like or halo      groups such as chloro, fluoro and bromo). </PAR><PAR>  The compound of this invention can have one or more additional electron      donating substituents on the phenalenimine nucleus. Such groups generally      exhibit negative Hammett sigma values calculated according to standard      procedures described, for example, in Steric Effects in Organic Chemistry,      John Wiley andamp; Sons, Inc. 1956, pp. 570-574 and Progress in Physical Organic      Chemistry, Vol. 2, Interscience Publishers, 1964, pp. 333-339.      Representative electron donating substituents include substituted or      unsubstituted alkoxy (preferably of 1 to 10 carbon atoms), substituted or      unsubstituted aralkoxy (preferably of 7 to 14 carbon atoms), primary,      secondary and tertiary amines (including cyclic amines, such as amino,      methylamino, dimethylamino, morpholino, piperidino and others known in the      art), substituted or unsubstituted alkylazo, substituted or unsubstituted      arylazo, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl carbonyloxy, substituted or      unsubstituted arylcarbonyloxy, unsaturated alkyl, for example vinyl, allyl      and alkynyl, and others known to those skilled in the art. </PAR><PAR>  Preferred fluorescent compounds of this invention have the structure      defined above wherein R' and R&quot; are independently hydrogen, substituted or      unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 10 carbon atoms (methyl, ethyl and benzyl or      substituted with chloro or alkoxy of the same number of carbon atoms) or      substituted or unsubstituted aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms (phenyl,      naphthyl, or aryl groups substituted with halo, alkyl or alkoxy groups as      defined above). Particularly useful fluorescent compounds are selected      from the group consisting of:      ##STR6## </PAR><PAR>  Compounds I, II and III are most preferred in the practice of this      invention. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescent compounds of this invention are prepared using the      following general procedure (including general concentrations and      temperature conditions) which is understandable to a skilled synthetic      chemist. A 6-hydroxyphenalenone is converted to an alkyl ether (preferably      the methyl ether) intermediate by the Williamson synthesis, that is, by      alkylation of the phenoxide with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfate. More      specifically, the intermediate is produced by forming the alkoxide with a      base, for example, potassium carbonate, treating with methyl iodide,      heating for about 15 hours, cooling and isolating the 6-methoxyphenalenone      intermediate. This intermediate is then condensed with an amine or ammonia      (ammonium acetate) by heating at reflux in the presence of glacial acetic      acid until all starting intermediate is converted to the imine product.      Specific representative preparations are described in Examples 1, 2 and 3      below. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescent compounds of this invention can be kept and used in      nonbuffered or buffered aqueous solutions. Preferably, they are kept and      used in solutions buffered to a pH of 9 or less, and generally at a pH of      5 to 9 which is often considered physiological pH. Useful buffers are well      known in the art and include phosphates, borates and organic buffers, some      of which are described by Good et al, Biochem. 5, 467 (1966) and Anal.      Biochem. 104, 300 (1980). </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment of this invention, the fluorescent compounds are useful      for staining biological specimens, for example tissues and cells, and for      cell cytometry using standard techniques. Staining, for example is      generally accomplished by mixing a suspension of cells with a buffered      solution of a fluorescent compound present in a concentration of at least      about 1 mmolar. The dyed cells can then be detected and viewed at a      wavelength of about 600 nm or greater after exposure to the appropriate      electromagnetic excitation using suitable equipment. </PAR><PAR>  In another embodiment, the fluorescent compounds of this invention can be      attached to a quinone nucleus to form reducible dye precursors. The      precursors can be subjected to suitable treatment or conditions which will      reduce the precursor and release the fluorescent moiety to form a dye from      the nucleus during an assay. While attached to the reducible compound, the      fluorescent moiety generally has an emission spectrum different from the      emission spectrum (600 nm or greater) of the released dye. </PAR><PAR>  More particularly, the reducible precursors are represented by the      structure:      ##STR7##      wherein R.sup.1 is a fluorescent moiety derived from the fluorescent      compound of this invention identified above. R.sup.1 is attached to the      ##STR8##       group through the amine group of the fluorescent compound upon the      removal of a hydrogen atom, </PAR><PA1>  R.sup.2 and R.sup.4 are independently (that is, the same or different)      hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted      aryl or an electron withdrawing group, </PA1><PA1>  R.sup.5 is substituted or unsubstituted methylene (such as substituted with      an alkyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and </PA1><PA1>  R.sup.3 is      ##STR9##       or it is hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or      unsubstituted aryl or an electron withdrawing group as defined for R.sup.2      and R.sup.4 above, or R.sup.3 and R.sup.4, taken together, represent the      atoms necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted fused      carbocyclic ring. </PA1><PAR>  Preferably, in the reducible compound structure shown above, R.sup.2 and      R.sup.4 in the above quinone structure are independently hydrogen,      substituted or unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 40 carbon atoms (for example,      methyl, ethyl, chloromethyl, hydroxymethyl, methoxymethyl, benzyl and      others known to one skilled in the art) substituted or unsubstituted aryl      (carbocyclic or heterocyclic, for example, phenyl, naphthyl,      methylnaphthyl, p-nitrophenyl, m-methoxyphenyl, phenylsulfonamido, and      others known to one skilled in the art) or an electron withdrawing group      which generally has a positive Hammett sigma value, and preferably has a      sigma value greater than about 0.06. Hammett sigma values are calculated      in accordance with standard procedures described, for example, in the      texts Steric Effects in Organic Chemistry and Progress in Physical Organic      Chemistry, noted above. Representative electron withdrawing groups having      positive Hammett sigma values include cyano, carboxy, nitro, halo (such as      fluoro, bromo or chloro), trihalomethyl (for example, trifluoromethyl or      trichloromethyl), trialkylammonium, carbonyl, carbamoyl, sulfonyl,      sulfamoyl, esters and others known in the art. Preferred electron      withdrawing groups include p-nitrophenyl, m-nitrophenyl, p-cyanophenyl and      2,5-dichlorophenyl. Aryl groups with methoxy or acetamido groups in the      meta position are also useful. </PAR><PAR>  R.sup.3 can be      ##STR10##      thereby potentially providing a 2:1 molar ratio of fluorescent moiety      molecules to precursor molecules, or R.sup.3 can be hydrogen, substituted      or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl or an electron      withdrawing group as defined above for R.sup.2 and R.sup.4. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, R.sup.3 and R.sup.4, taken together, can represent the      carbon atoms necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted fused      carbocyclic ring attached to the quinone nucleus. For example, such a ring      (mono- or bicyclic) can have from 4 to 8, and preferably from 5 to 7,      carbon atoms in the backbone. The fused ring can be substituted with the      groups defined for R.sup.2 and R.sup.4 above. </PAR><PAR>  The reducible precursors of this invention can be prepared by treating the      dye with phosgene in the presence of 2,6-lutidine to produce the      chloroformamide from the amine group on the dye, and condensing the      chloroformamide with a 2-hydroxymethylquinone to produce the reducible dye      precursor. This procedure is illustrated in Example 4 below. Other details      are provided in copending and commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 215,127      filed on even date herewith by Mooberry and entitled &quot;Reducible Compounds      Which Provide Aniline Dyes and Analytical Compositions, Elements and      Methods Using Same&quot;, incorporated herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  The reducible precursor compounds just described can be used in aqueous      solutions or dispersions for analytical purposes. If the precursors lack      the needed water-solubility or -dispersibility, they can be solubilized      using minor amounts of water-miscible organic solvents (for example,      methanol, ethanol, propanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,      acetonitrile, acetone or hexamethylenephosphoramide) or surfactants which      do not inhibit reducibility of the precursor and release of the      fluorescent dye. Useful surfactants include nonionic compounds which do      not interfere with precursor reduction or with an assay, such as for      microorganisms. The solutions or dispersions can be buffered to a pH of 9      or less if desired. </PAR><PAR>  The reducible precursor compounds of this invention are useful in      compositions for analytical determination (that is, qualitative,      semiquantitative or quantitative detection) of chemical or biological      materials in aqueous and nonaqueous liquids, for example, biological      fluids, manufacturing effluents, wastewater, food stuffs, and other      fluids. Determinations can be made of various analytes via a single      reaction or a sequence of reactions which bring about reduction of the      precursor and release of the fluorescent moiety. The various analytes      include living cells (for example, bacteria, yeast, white blood cells or      fungi), enzymes (for example, lipase, glucose oxidase, lactate oxidase,      creatine kinase, .alpha.-glycerophosphate oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase,      pyruvate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, alanine      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and other NADH-based,      FADH-based or oxidase-based assays which include dehydrogenase or      reductase enzymes), biological or chemical reductants other than living      cells (for example, ascorbates, cysteine, glutathione or thioredoxin),      metabolizable substances (for example, glucose, lactic acid, triglycerides      or cholesterol), immunoreactants (for example, antigens, antibodies or      haptens). </PAR><PAR>  The compositions can be used to monitor flavin-linked dehydrogenases and      oxidases, including (NAD-NADH)-, (FAD-FADH)- and (NADP-NADPH)-based      reactions. In such instances, the reducible precursor can be used to      provide a fluorescent dye in place of NADH, FADH or NADPH. </PAR><PAR>  When determining living cells using the reducible precursors, it is      preferably for rapid dye release that the living cells interact with an      electron transfer agent (herein ETA). The ETA is a mobile compound which      acts as an intermediary between the substance being determined (for      example, a living cell) and the reducible precursor. </PAR><PAR>  In general, the ETA should be more easily reduced than the analyte and less      easily reduced than the reducible precursor. They are generally present at      a concentration that is dependant upon the concentration of the analyte,      and preferably at a concentration of from about 1.times.10.sup.-3 molar to      about 1.times.10.sup.-7 molar. </PAR><PAR>  ETA compounds useful in the practice of this invention include phenazine      methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, substituted benzo- and      naphthoquinones such as those described in copending and commonly assigned      U.S. Ser. No. 699,374 filed Feb. 7, 1985 by Mura et al, now U.S. Pat. No.      4,746,607 and similar compounds known to one skilled in the art.      Combinations of different ETA compounds can be used if desired. </PAR><PAR>  The determination of living cells, and particularly of bacterial cells, is      often carried out in the presence of a metabolizable nutrient for those      cells although its presence is not essential. Any nutrient medium can be      used which contains useful carbon, and optionally nitrogen, sources.      Suitable nutrient media having proper components and pH are well known in      the art. </PAR><PAR>  Use of the reducible precursors of this invention can be adapted to either      solution or dry assays. In a solution assay, a solution (or aqueous      dispersion) containing a reducible precursor, and preferably an ETA, can      be prepared and contacted with a liquid test sample containing the living      cells or analyte to be determined by mixing in a suitable container. The      ETA can also be mixed with the test sample prior to mixing with the      reducible precursor. The resulting solution (or dispersion) is gently      mixed and incubated for a relatively short time (i.e. up to about 30      minutes) at a temperature up to about 40.degree. C. The test sample is      then evaluated by measuring the shift in fluorescence resulting from      release of the fluorescent dye with suitable detection equipment. </PAR><PAR>  The solution assay can also be carried out by contacting a porous,      absorbent material, for example, a paper strip, containing the test sample      with a dispersion of the reducible precursor. The analyte in the test      sample can migrate from the porous material into the dispersion and      initiate the analytical reactions needed for determination. In solution      assays, the amount of precursor present is at least about 0.001      millimolar. Other reagents can be present in amounts readily determined by      one skilled in the art. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the method of this invention can be practiced with a dry      analytical element. Such an element can be an absorbent carrier material,      i.e. a thin sheet or strip of self-supporting absorbent or bibulous      material, such as filter paper or strips, which contains the precursor or      a dried residue of the dispersion comprising same. Such elements are known      in the art as test strips, diagnostic elements, dip sticks, diagnostic      agents and the like. </PAR><PAR>  When employed in dry analytical elements, the reducible precursors can be      incorporated into a suitable absorbent carrier material by imbibition or      impregnation, or can be coated on a suitable absorbent carrier material.      Alternatively, they can be incorporated in the element during an assay.      Useful carrier materials are insoluble and maintain their structural      integrity when contacted with water or physiological fluids such as urine      or serum. Useful carrier materials can be prepared from paper, porous      particulate structures, cellulose, porous polymeric films, wood, glass      fiber, woven and nonwoven fabrics (synthetic and nonsynthetic) and the      like. Useful materials and procedures for making such elements are well      known in the art as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,092,465 (issued Jun.      4, 1963 to Adams et al), 3,802,842 (issued Apr. 9, 1974 to Lange et al),      3,915,647 (issued Oct. 28, 1975 to Wright), 3,917,453 (issued Nov. 4, 1975      to Milligan et al), 3,936,357 (issued Feb. 3, 1976 to Milligan et al),      4,248,829 (issued Feb. 3, 1981  to Kitajima et al), 4,255,384 (issued Mar.      10, 1981 Kitajima et al), and 4,270,920 (issued Jun. 2, 1981 to Kondo et      al), and U.K. Patent 2,052,057 (published Jan. 21, 1981). </PAR><PAR>  A dry assay can be practiced to particular advantage with an analytical      element comprising a support having thereon at least one porous spreading      zone as the absorbent carrier material. The reducible precursor can be in      the spreading or in other zones (for example, a reagent, registration or      hydrophilic zone). </PAR><PAR>  The spreading zone can be prepared using fibrous materials, either mixed      with a suitable binder material or woven into a fabric, as described in      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,292,272 (issued Sep. 29, 1981 to Kitajima et al),      polymeric compositions (for example, blush polymers) or particulate      materials, with or without binding adhesives, as described in U.S. Pat.      Nos. 3,992,158 (issued Nov. 16, 1976 to Przybylowicz et al), 4,258,001      (issued Mar. 24, 1981 to Pierce et al) and 4,430,436 (issued Feb. 7, 1984      to Koyama et al) and Japanese Patent Publication 57(1982)-101760      (published Jun. 24, 1982). </PAR><PAR>  The dry analytical element of this invention can be a single      self-supporting absorbent carrier material containing a reducible      precursor and any other desired reagents for a particular use, but      preferably such material is carried on a suitable nonporous support. Such      a support can be any suitable dimensionally stable, and preferably,      transparent (that is, radiation transmissive) film or sheet material which      transmits electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength between about 200 and      about 900 nm. Useful support materials include polystyrene, polyesters,      polycarbonates and cellulose esters. </PAR><PAR>  The elements can have a plurality of zones which are generally in fluid      contact with each other, meaning that fluids, reagents and reaction      products can pass between superposed regions of adjacent zones.      Preferably, the zones are separately coated superposed layers, although      two or more zones can be located in a single layer. </PAR><PAR>  In the elements of this invention, the amount of the reducible precursor      can be varied widely, but it is generally present in a coverage of at      least about 0.01 g/m.sup.2. Optional, but preferred reagents (for example,      ETA, nutrient and buffer) are generally present in the following      coverages: </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         ETA:            generally at least about 0.001                                                 g/m.sup.2,                                                     nutrient:       generally at least about 0.05                                                  g/m.sup.2 (used only in living cell                                            detection),                                                    buffer (pH .ltoreq. 9):                                                                        generally at least about 0.1                                                   g/m.sup.2, and                                                 surfactant:     generally at least about 0.1                                                   g/m.sup.2.                                                     ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  In one embodiment of this invention, an element for detection of      microorganisms (for example, yeast, fungi or bacteria) in an aqueous      liquid comprises an electron transfer agent and a reducible precursor,      both of which are described above. It is desirable that these elements      also contain a nutrient for the living cells and a buffer which maintains      suitable pH during the assay. Such an element can be used to detect      bacteria, for example, in a urine sample by physically contacting the      sample and element in a suitable manner, and detecting the fluorescent dye      released from the precursor as a result of the presence of bacteria at the      appropriate wavelength greater than or equal to about 600 nm. </PAR><PAR>  In another of this invention, an element is used for the determination of a      nonliving biological or chemical analyte in an aqueous liquid, and      comprises an interactive composition which is capable of reacting with the      reducible precursor to provide a fluorescent dye upon reduction. The      amount of fluorescent dye detected can be correlated to the amount of      analyte present in the liquid sample. A pretreatment step to remove      interferences or to concentrate cells prior to assay may be desirable. </PAR><PAR>  A variety of different elements, depending on the method of assay, can be      prepared in accordance with the present invention. Elements can be      configured in a variety of forms, including elongated tapes of any desired      width, sheets, slides or chips. </PAR><PAR>  The assay of this invention can be manual or automated. In general, in      using the dry elements, an analyte or living cell determination is made by      taking the element from a supply roll, chip packet or other source and      contacting it with a sample (for example, 1-200 .mu.l) of the liquid to be      tested which mixes with the reagents in the element. Such contact can be      accomplished in any suitable manner, for example, by dipping or immersing      the element into the sample or, preferably, by spotting the element by      hand or machine with one or more drops of the sample with a suitable      dispensing means. </PAR><PAR>  After sample application, the element is exposed to any conditioning, such      as incubation, heating or the like, that may be desirable to quicken or      otherwise facilitate obtaining any test result. </PAR><PAR>  Detection of an analyte or living cell is achieved when the precursor is      reduced releasing a fluorescent dye which can be detected in a suitable      manner at a suitable wavelength at or above about 600 nm. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescent labels of this invention can also be used as probes, or      labeling materials, for a variety of biomedical studies and clinical and      diagnostic determinations. They can be used to label cells or other      biological compounds including proteins, nucleic acids and nucleotides,      enzymes, enzyme substrates, cofactors, viruses, leukocytes, growth      factors, lectins, antigens, antibodies, haptens, vitamins, metabolites,      hormones, toxins, radioisotopes, and others known to one skilled in the      art. Many such biological compounds are specific binding ligands which      will complex specifically with a corresponding receptor molecule. The      labels are attached to such biological compounds in a suitable manner (as      described below). Particularly useful biological compounds include avidin,      biotin, enzymes and immunologically reactive compounds (such as antibodies      and antigens). </PAR><PAR>  The labels are particularly useful in specific binding assays to determine      a species (that is, a specific binding ligand) which has specific binding      capacity with a corresponding receptor molecule, for example an antigen to      an antibody. In one embodiment, the species to be determined is attached      to the label and the labeled species is placed in competition with      unlabeled species from a test sample for reaction with the common      receptor. The labels can also be used in what are known in the art as      agglutination assays in which the presence of a species is detected using      labeled, insolubilized receptor molecules which cause the species to clump      together. The labels can be insoluble particles (labeled with the      fluorescent compound of this invention) to which the receptor molecules      are attached. Another embodiment is what is known as a sandwich or      immunometric assay using two or more receptor molecules for the species to      be detected. One of the receptors is attached to the fluorescent labels of      the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  In preferred embodiments of this invention, the specific binding ligand is      an antigen or antibody and the specific binding assay is an immunoassay. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescent labels of this invention comprise latex polymer particles      which contain the fluorescent compound of this invention. Useful polymeric      particles are those which are &quot;loadable&quot;, meaning that the fluorescent      compound can be incorporated, or imbibed, into and distributed within      preformed particles using the techniques described in more detail below. </PAR><PAR>  Several techniques are known for distributing a hydrophobic compound, such      as the fluorescent compound of this invention, in loadable polymeric latex      particles. Such techniques are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No.      4,199,363 (issued Apr. 22, 1980 to Chen) and 4,368,258 (issued Jan. 11,      1983 to Fujiwhara et al), and in copending and commonly assigned U.S. Ser.      No. 136,214 filed Dec. 18, 1987 by Sutton, now abandoned. Generally      &quot;loading&quot; the compound into the particles involves gradually using a      water-miscible organic solvent containing dissolved fluorescent compound      to carry the compound into particles which are partially softened in order      to take up the compound in preference to the surrounding hydrophilic      medium. The techniques noted in the art above involve various sequences of      adding and mixing the various materials. </PAR><PAR>  A preferred loading method is that described by the noted Sutton      application in which a loadable latex (described below) is provided, a      solution of fluorescent compound dissolved in one or more watermiscible      organic solvents is provided, the loadable latex is heated to 30.degree.      to 95.degree. C., and the organic solution is gradually added to the      heated latex so that the polymeric particles and fluorescent compound are      brought into intimate contact. The water-miscible solvent is diluted with      water to reduce the solubility of the compound in the water, whereby the      equilibrium distribution of the compound is driven away from the water      towards the polymeric particles. </PAR><PAR>  The proportion of loadable latex to fluorescent compound is generally      maintained within the volume ratio of from about 30:1 to about 1:1. The      weight ratio of fluorescent compound in the organic solution to polymeric      particles is generally from about 1:30 to about 1:1. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, loadable polymeric particles are those which meet the following      test: at 25.degree. C., the particles must (a) be capable of forming a      latex with water at a particle concentration of from about 0.2 to about 20      percent, based on total latex weight, and (b) when a 100 ml sample of the      latex is then mixed with an equal volume of the water-miscible organic      solvent to be employed in forming the loaded latex composition, stirred      and allowed to stand for 10 minutes, it exhibits no observable coagulation      of polymeric particles. </PAR><PAR>  The Sutton application noted above describes many polymers, details of      preparing them and other features of loadable latices and conditions for      loading them with fluorescent compounds which are useful in the practice      of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  Once a loaded latex has been prepared, a biological compound of interest      (as described above) can be attached to particles by adsorption or by      covalent attachment, assuming, of course, that the particles have surface      reactive groups which are capable of reacting with the free amine or      sulfhydryl groups of the biological compound. The particles or the      biological compound can be chemically modified, if necessary, to      facilitate attachment. Adsorption can be achieved using known techniques,      usually mixing the particles and compounds for a suitable time at a      suitable temperature. Covalent attachment techniques are more complex and      preferred, but many such techniques are known in the art. </PAR><PAR>  The resulting fluorescent biological reagents are useful in various      analytical procedures as noted above, including competitive binding      immunoassays, agglutination assays and immunometric assays. For instance,      the reagents can be used as fluorescently labeled specific binding ligand      analogs in immunoassays for a specific binding ligand. They can also be      labeled reagents used in agglutination or immunometric assays having a      receptor to the ligand of interest attached to insoluble particles. </PAR><PAR>  These assays can be employed in solution, dry analytical elements (as      described above) or test plates or devices as desired. Such articles are      described in considerable technical and patent literature and are well      within the skill of the ordinary worker in the art to design and use. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples illustrate the practice of this invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of Fluorescent Compound I </PAC><PAR>  Fluorescent compound I identified by structure above was prepared by the      following procedure: </PAR><PAC>  STEP 1 </PAC><PAR>  An intermediate, 6-hydroxyphenalenone (20 g), was dissolved in acetone (200      ml). This intermediate is prepared according to the procedure described by      Cooke et al, Austral. J. Chem., 11, pp. 230-235 (1958), specifically      preparation (a) therein, or by Solodar et al, Zhurnal Organicheskoi      Khimii, 16(5), pp. 1062-1064 (1980). A mixture of potassium carbonate (20      g), iodomethane (10 ml) and water (1 ml) was added to the acetone      solution, and the resulting solution was heated under reflux for about 15      hours. After cooling, water was added, and the precipitated yellow product      was collected by filtration. </PAR><PAR>  The product was dissolved in alcohol, filtered, and the filtrate was      diluted with water and chilled. The resulting crystalline solid was      collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried at 25.degree. C.      under nitrogen. About 6 g of the product, 6-methoxyphenalenone, were      obtained. Infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed      the structure. </PAR><PAC>  STEP 2 </PAC><PAR>  6-Methoxyphenalenone (6.3 g) and ammonium acetate (60 g) in glacial acetic      acid (150 ml) were heated under reflux until starting material was no      longer present, as determined by thin-layer chromatography (silica, 3:2      methanol, ethyl acetate). A reaction time of about one hour was required.      The mixture was diluted to 500 ml with hot water, and the solution was      filtered. The filtrate was treated with saturated sodium chloride solution      and chilled in a methanol/ice bath. The precipitated dye was collected,      then triturated with acetone to remove the 6-aminophenalenone by-product.      The remaining solid was recrystallized from methanol to give 5 g of the      desired compound I. Mass spectral analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance and      infrared spectroscopy confirmed the structure. Compound I exhibited a      maximum fluorescent emission at a wavelength of about 623 nm when excited      at 573 nm in methanol with a fluorescence efficiency of 0.13. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of Fluorescent Compound II </PAC><PAR>  Fluorescent compound II illustrated by structure above was prepared as      follows: </PAR><PAR>  A sample of 6-methoxyphenalenone (5 g) prepared as described in Example 1      was heated in an open vessel in glacial acetic acid (50 ml) and      methylamine (30 ml). Water and glacial acetic acid were boiled off until      the temperature reached 150.degree. C. After the beaker was covered,      heating was continued for about 3 hours at 170.degree. C. After cooling,      water was added to precipitate the crude product which was then dissolved      in hot water containing a small amount of glacial acetic acid. The      resulting solution was filtered, and the filtrate was treated with salt      solution to precipitate the product which was collected and slurried in      ethyl acetate. The solid was collected and recrystallized from methanol to      obtain 2.1 g of compound II. Infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance      spectroscopy confirmed the structure. Compound II exhibited a maximum      fluorescent emission at a wavelength of about 615 nm when excited at 596      nm in ethanol with a fluorescence efficiency of 0.46. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of Fluorescent Compound III </PAC><PAR>  Fluorescent compound III illustrated by structure above was prepared in the      following manner: </PAR><PAR>  A sample of 6-methoxyphenalenone (2.1 g), glacial acetic acid (10 ml) and      benzylamine (10 g) were mixed in a flask and heated on a steam bath for 24      hours. Thin-layer chromatography (silica, 3:2 methanol, ethyl acetate)      showed no starting material. </PAR><PAR>  The reaction mixture was treated with dilute ammonium hydroxide and      extracted with toluene. The toluene solution was washed three times with      dilute saline solution, dried and concentrated. The resulting oil was      dissolved in methanol, and 20% (v/v) water was added, and the solution was      then chilled. The product was precipitated as a waxy solid (2 g). The      material was recrystallized from methanol to give 0.5 g of compound III.      Infrared, nucelar magnetic resonance and mass spectral analysis confirmed      the structure of the compound. Compound III exhibited a maximum      fluorescent emission wavelength of about 634 nm when excited at 589 nm in      a pH 7.5 phosphate buffered solution with a fluorescence efficiency of      0.42. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 4 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of Reducible Compound      6-andlsqb;N-(5,7-Ethano-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoquinonylmethoxycarbonyl)-N-me     thylaminoandrsqb;-N'-methyl-1-phenalenimine </PAC><PAR>  A reducible compound of this invention was prepared by attaching      fluorescent compound II to a quinone carrier moiety in the following      manner:      ##STR11## </PAR><PAR>  A mixture of 6-methylamino-N-methyl-1 phenalenimine (2.2 g) and      2,6-lutidine (5 ml) in dry acetonitrile (200 ml) was cooled to 0.degree.      C. A solution of 1 molar phosgene in toluene (15 ml) was added rapidly and      stirred under nitrogen for 60 minutes while allowing the mixture to warm      to room temperature. The mixture was washed with cold water to remove      excess phosgene and the lutidine hydrochloride salt, and dried over      magnesium sulfate. </PAR><PAR>  3-(4-Cyanophenyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,8-ethanonaphthoquino     ne (3.2 g) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.13 g) were added to the dried      solution. The resulting mixture was cooled to 0.degree. C., treated with      2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10-octahydropyrimido-andlsqb;1,2-aandrsqb;-azepine (1.6 g), and stirred      for 25 minutes at 0.degree. C. A small amount of acetic acid was then      added, the salts were washed out with ice cold water, the solution dried      over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator.      The crude reducible compound was recrystallized from acetonitrile to yield      about 1 gram. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 5 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of a Fluorescent Label By Loading Dye Compound III into      Loadable Polymeric Latex Particles </PAC><PAR>  A latex of poly(styrene-co-vinylbenzylchloride-co-methacrylic acid) (molar      ratio 50/30/20) was prepared containing about 17.23% solids. A dye      solution of 0.12 g of fluorescent Dye III in 5 g of methanol was prepared      and added to 6 g of the above latex (diluted with 92 g of water). The      mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, then the methanol was removed under      vacuum at 60.degree.
