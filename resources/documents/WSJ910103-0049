Everett, the queen ofhorse racing, may soon be put out to pasture.   But she's not about to go quietly, for her saga involves aformer president, a fallen governor, a stable of Hollywoodstars and some of Wall Street's deepest pockets.</LP><TEXT>   The 69-year-old Mrs. Everett -- &quot;Marje&quot; to friends andenemies alike -- has run Hollywood Park race track here fornearly two decades. For many years, it was the envy of theindustry, outpacing every other thoroughbred park inattendance, purse and handle. But it has fallen on hardtimes, and a proxy fight looms for Hollywood Park OperatingCo., the publicly traded entity that manages the track.   Leading the call for Mrs. Everett's ouster as chairman andchief executive is Randall D. Hubbard, a Texas glassmakingmogul and a successful track and horse owner. Foremost on hisside is arithmetic. He owns a 9.9% stake, compared with Mrs.Everett's 8.5%, and his slate includes three dissident boardmembers who together control more than 10%. He can count on afourth director who owns 5.6% and has tried twice, includingonce with Mr. Hubbard, to take control of the track.   In a bid to have the Everett-led board replaced by hisslate of 11 directors even before the Feb. 18 annual meeting,Mr. Hubbard declared Monday that he had turned in votes ofsupport from the holders of more than 50% of the stock.Unruffled, Mrs. Everett's camp says it presented &quot;hundreds ofthousands&quot; of votes countering Mr. Hubbard to election judgesin Delaware. &quot;They seem to be trying to say they've alreadywon,&quot; says a spokesman for Mrs. Everett. &quot;That's the kind ofpolitics you have in Haiti.&quot; A preliminary count is expectedwithin a few days.   Mrs. Everett clings to power like mud to a horse hoof.&quot;She presents herself . . . as a bullying, overbearingmatriarch,&quot; says Tom Aronson, a marketing consultant who hasdone work for Hollywood Park. Everybody has a favorite MarjeEverett story, like the time she spied workers at the tracktaking a coffee break and accused them of goldbricking. &quot;Whatthe hell are you doing?&quot; she is said to have shouted. &quot;You'refired]&quot; There was one hitch: They were phone companyemployees and didn't work for her.   &quot;Sometimes I come on stronger than I should,&quot; Mrs. Everettconcedes. &quot;I expect things to be perfect.&quot; Lately, they havebeen perfectly hostile. Board meetings, held at Mrs.Everett's mansion in the affluent Holmby Hills section of LosAngeles, have become mean-spirited finger-pointing sessions.The vitriol got so bad at the September meeting that actorJohn Forsythe (Blake Carrington of &quot;Dynasty&quot;), a staunchsupporter of Mrs. Everett, told other directors he was sickto his stomach. At the next meeting, he proposed a resolutionthat went something like this: &quot;May we carry on thisproceeding with a level of civility not heretoforeexhibited.&quot;   But things have only gotten more rancorous. A couple ofweeks ago, Mr. Forsythe was in the directors' box at thetrack when he exchanged words with Harry Ornest, the owner ofthe Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and oneof the dissidents on the board. With Mrs. Everett standingnearby, the two men got into a shoving match. Mr. Ornest tooka swing, but &quot;it wasn't a very good lick,&quot; he says. Adds Mr.Forsythe, &quot;It's a trifle embarrassing for two old gentlemento be wrestling with each other like that.&quot;   At this point, nobody's pulling any punches. On Nov. 15,Mr. Hubbard sent the board a letter that said privateinvestigators he hired had found evidence that Mrs. Everettfilched from the track. She subsequently reimbursed HollywoodPark for $13,850.86 to cover a generator that the company hadinstalled in her house last year. She said in an accompanyingnote that she belatedly discovered the equipment was&quot;inadvertently . . . not billed to me earlier&quot; by HollywoodPark.   Warren Williamson, who serves on the board's auditcommittee, says that Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. is investigatingwhether Mrs. Everett has misappropriated company funds. Oneallegation being examined is that audio-visual equipment wasinstalled at the home of Mrs. Everett's good friends, Ronaldand Nancy Reagan, at Hollywood Park expense. A spokesman forthe former president declined comment, but Mrs. Everettdenies any impropriety.   &quot;They won't find one g.d. thing on me,&quot; she bristles. Sheacknowledges that the Reagans and others, including TVproducer and Hollywood Park director Aaron Spelling, havegotten discounts on televisions through the track'sassociation with Mitsubishi, which supplied the big-screen TVfor the Hollywood Park infield. Mrs. Everett herself has manyTVs in her house, including one in her bathroom and three inher bedroom, where she likes to watch several programssimultaneously. She agrees that's &quot;a little eccentric.&quot;   But she denies that she or her friends have taken a centfrom the track. In fact, Mrs. Everett says she has personallyspent more than $1 million over the years on expenses thatcould have been charged legitimately to her office. &quot;Thesepeople are trying to smear me,&quot; she says. &quot;I resent it, andI'm going to fight back.&quot;   In an often rambling, three-hour discourse in her spaciousliving room, which is stuffed with equine art, Mrs. Everettdisplays an emotional gamut. She coos at her poodles, one agift from Elizabeth Taylor called E.T. Jr. and the other agift from the Forsythes called Blake. She talks at lengthabout her love for the dogs, whom she affectionately calls&quot;my kids,&quot; since she and her late husband had no children.She has established with Hollywood Park stock a caninemedical research trust named for her dead boxer, Winston.Discussing her father's death and the late Cary Grant, a dearfriend and long-time Hollywood Park director, she sobs.   She portrays herself as an honest, charitable woman who isthe target of an elaborate, four-year plot by Mr. Hubbard andhis associates to steal Hollywood Park from her and the othershareholders. (Mr. Hubbard says that's a &quot;desperate act&quot;designed &quot;to confuse&quot; stockholders.)   Mrs. Everett says she &quot;has been victimized&quot; by &quot;the samerot&quot; throughout her career. The adopted daughter of BenLindheimer, a major Chicago track owner and a cog in thecity's political machine, Mrs. Everett grew up around theRunyonesque world of racing. In 1940 she left NorthwesternUniversity and went to work for her father at the tracks for$15 a week.   In 1957, she married Webb Everett, 25 years her senior andthe director of racing at Golden Gate Fields near SanFrancisco. Three years later, her father died and Mrs.Everett became the principal shareholder and chief executiveof Arlington Park and Washington Park, both near Chicago.   Like her father, she doled out hefty politicalcontributions and set aside stock in her companies forprominent politicians, financial records show. Then, in 1969,Mrs. Everett claimed she had been forced by the chairman ofthe Illinois Racing Board to sell stock to a number ofpoliticians at artificially low prices. Two years later, anumber of high-ranking state officials were indicted,including Otto Kerner, the former governor and a sittingfederal judge.   Despite her assertions that she was extorted, Mrs. Everettwas named as an unindicted co-conspirator. Evidence emergedthat Mrs. Everett was able to influence racing dates and theappointments of regulators in exchange for the stock, but shebecame the government's star witness at the Kerner trial. TheU.S. Court of Appeals, in later affirming Mr. Kerner'sconviction, said that Mrs. Everett had offered stock to Mr.Kerner with &quot;a corrupt intent.&quot;   It didn't take long for Mrs. Everett to re-establishherself. The Chicago tracks had been bought in 1968 by Gulf andamp;Western Industries Inc. (now Paramount Communications Inc.).Mrs. Everett was retained to manage the property, but sooncollided with the new owners. There were suits andcountersuits and, ultimately, what she calls &quot;an amicablesettlement&quot; in which Gulf andamp; Western gave Mrs. Everett itsinterest in Hollywood Park. Coupled with shares her husbandalready held, Mrs. Everett became the track's largest holder.   By 1972, after a fight with other members, she wasreluctantly accepted as a Hollywood Park director. It didn'thurt her cause that Ronald Reagan was governor of Californiaat the time. Mrs. Everett had become close with NancyReagan's family in Chicago. Later, both the Everetts and Mrs.Reagan's parents had homes in Arizona, and they visitedfrequently.   For many years, Hollywood Park was profitable, and Mrs.Everett earned the lasting respect of some. Merv Griffin, aHollywood Park director since 1987, calls her &quot;one of thegreat innovators of the sport,&quot; pointing to her launching ofFriday night and Sunday racing. He notes, too, that Mrs.Everett collects no salary, evidence that the track is atotal passion for her, not just a job. &quot;She's done more forthe people of racing than anyone I can think of,&quot; says WillieShoemaker, the champion jockey.   But by the mid-1980s, Mrs. Everett's fiscal failures beganto eclipse her successes. In 1984, the track sank $40 millioninto the Cary Grant Pavilion of the Stars. However, fansgrouse that the finish line is too far away, so thebuilding's luxury boxes remain idle. On a recent day, thesun-baked structure was so empty that it lived up to itsnickname: &quot;Grant's Tomb.&quot;   Another costly misstep came the same year, when HollywoodPark purchased Los Alamitos, a track primarily used forharness racing in nearby Orange County, for $58 million. Theplan was to sell off the plentiful acreage around the track.But Hollywood Park bulldozed a popular golf course on thesite and so alienated the surrounding community of Cypressthat voters overwhelmingly rejected a zoning change needed todevelop the land. Last year, Hollywood Park sold Los Alamitosat a book loss of about $4 million.   Mrs. Everett charges that Mr. Hubbard, who himself retainsan option to buy a 25% interest in Los Alamitos, conspired tohelp defeat the rezoning initiative. He denies he hadanything to do with the vote. Mrs. Everett also claims Mr.Hubbard will take Hollywood Park private, pointing to the$1.1 billion leveraged buy-out of his glass company, AFGIndustries Inc. She dismisses his declarations to thecontrary as the stuff of &quot;a darn liar.&quot;   As the acrimony at Hollywood Park has grown more intense,some have bailed out. Lodwrick Cook, the chairman of AtlanticRichfield Co., lasted on the board for only six months lastyear and told several people as he departed: &quot;Who needsthis?&quot; Financier Marvin Davis and Wall Street tycoon DanLufkin also have resigned as directors in the past 15 months.Neither will give a reason publicly. But Mr. Lufkin,according to minutes of the June board meeting, had someparting advice: Get &quot;strengthened executive management.&quot;   Shortly before Mr. Davis left the board in May, he andMrs. Everett agreed that he would try to take over HollywoodPark for between $40 and $44 a share, according to severalpeople close to the talks. The stock, which is paired inover-the-counter trading with sister concern Hollywood ParkRealty Enterprises Inc. (which is managed as a totallyseparate company with its own board), was then in the $25range and closed yesterday at $35.25, down $1.25. At the lastminute, Mrs. Everett backed out, these people say. Mr. Davis,with $300,000 in legal bills and nothing to show for it, quitin a huff. Mr. Davis, the former owner of Twentieth CenturyFox, won't comment on his role at Hollywood Park. Mrs.Everett contends that no price was put on the table and noformal deal ever struck.   Either way, Mr. Davis didn't stay mad for long. AlthoughMrs. Everett disputes this version of events, severalinsiders say that President Reagan sent word to Mr. Davisthat he should help Marje, and Mr. Davis asked takeoverstrategist David Batchelder to lend his assistance in fendingoff Mr. Hubbard. Mr. Batchelder, who once worked for Mr.Hubbard, has been hired by Hollywood Park for $350,000. Mr.Reagan's spokesman wouldn't comment, and Mr. Batchelderdidn't return calls.   Mrs. Everett has named a committee of incumbent directorsto battle Mr. Hubbard, prompting the resignation from theboard last week of Thomas Gamel, president of a Denvertruck-body manufacturer who in 1986 made a tender offer forHollywood Park along with Mr. Hubbard and threatened a proxyfight of his own in 1989. &quot;I have been shut out of theboard's deliberations and decisions,&quot; Mr. Gamel said in aletter to the board. &quot;I have become a director in name only,which I find unacceptable.&quot; For her part, Mrs. Everett seesMr. Gamel as part of a cabal to capture Hollywood Park andsell off its racing dates to a rival track, Santa Anita.   But the loyalists can't hide the fact that, under Mrs.Everett, Hollywood Park's reputation has been impugned: In1988, a state court concluded that the company had tried to&quot;ingratiate itself&quot; with members of the California HorseRacing Board in a manner that &quot;is not acceptable in dealingwith state agencies.&quot; The board had been sued by a group ofharness racers after Hollywood Park successfully petitionedthe panel to cut the number of harness meets that could beheld that year. Hollywood Park, it was found, gave onecommissioner free rental space on track grounds for his motorhome, and another accepted free food and drinks at the turfclub.   The Everett team also can't mask the numbers: $27 millionin losses in the past three years. Even the track'smuch-touted earnings turnaround in 1990 is somewhat illusory.Once the expense of hanging onto Los Alamitos is backed outof last year's nine-month statement, 1990 operating resultsare off by more than $1.7 million.   &quot;It just makes you sick to look out and see this,&quot; Mr.Hubbard says, gazing at the largely empty Hollywood Parkgrandstand on a recent day. At least the afternoon isn't atotal loss: He wins about $8,000.   Dislodging Mrs. Everett may not be as easy. She survivedan earlier proxy fight in 1977, when she was accused ofimproperly selling the track's concession operation to herattorney. She is determined to survive again. &quot;My whole lifeis wrapped around the racing business,&quot; she says.   Her forces are busy trying to dig up dirt on Mr. Hubbard.Last month, for instance, they pointed out to the CaliforniaHorse Racing Board that Mr. Hubbard was part of a group thatin 1970 was denied an application to purchase the RuidosoDowns race track in New Mexico for failure to disclose a$600,000 loan from Emprise Corp., which was alleged to haveorganized-crime ties. Mr. Hubbard stresses that he was only a&quot;passive investor&quot; in the group, now is the majority owner ofRuidoso and was recently described by the chairman of the NewMexico racing commission as &quot;beneficial to the industry.&quot;   Regardless, it surely won't be the last accusation by Mrs.Everett. &quot;Above all, she seems to love a good fight,&quot; saysMr. Aronson, the marketing consultant. &quot;That's probably whyshe's had so many of them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
