(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers and campus police tore up aconcrete slab and carted away building materials at People's Parkearly Friday, thwarting activists' attempts to build a permanenttoilet.   The ``restroom brigade,'' as they called themselves, dug atrench and poured concrete Thursday following a rally and marchcommemorating the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the``park,'' which is on land owned by the University of California atBerkeley.   Some of the builders camped overnight to guard materials, butmoved aside and did not confront police. The group was back workingat the site after the university crew left, vowing they would notgive up. University police watched from a short distance away.   In 1969, activists occupied an empty lot owned by theuniversity. One man was killed and hundreds wounded in riots thaterupted when the university fenced in the lot and tore up greeneryplanted by activists.   Protesters tore down the fence in 1972 and the university hasallowed the public limited use of the land. But universityspokesman Ray Colvig said the university's rules include a ban onpermanent structures.</TEXT></DOC>
