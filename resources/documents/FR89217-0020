This notice proposed to upgradethe fire safety standards for cargo or baggage compartments in certaintransport category airplanes used in air carrier, air taxi, or commercialservice. During the early post-World War II period, it was recognized that timelydetection of a fire by a crewmember while at his or her station and promptcontrol of the fire when detected were necessary for protection of theairplane from a fire originating in a cargo or baggage compartment. Becausethe requirements for detection and extinguishment varied depending on thetype and location of the compartment, a classification system was established.Three classes were initially established and defined as follows:Class A_A compartment in which the presence of a fire would be easily discoveredby a crewmember while at his or her station, and of which all parts areeasily accessible in flight. This is typically a small compartment usedfor crew luggage and located in the cockpit where a fire would be readilydetected and extinguished by a crewmember. Due to the small size and locationof the compartment, and the relatively brief time required to extinguisha fire, a liner is not needed to protect adjacent structure.Class B_A compartment with sufficient access in flight to enable a crewmemberto effectively reach any part of the compartment with the contents of ahand fire extinguisher and which incorporates a separate, approved smokeor fire detector system to give warning at the pilot or flight engineerstation. A Class B compartment is typically much larger than a Class Acompartment and can be located in an area remote from the cockpit. Becauseof the larger size of the compartment and the greater time interval likelyto occur before a fire would be controlled, a liner meeting the flame penetrationstandards of andSection; 25.855 and Part I of Appendix F of Part 25 mustbe provided to protect adjacent structure. A Class B compartment is typicallythe large cargo portion of the cabin of an airplane carrying a combinationof passengers and cargo (frequently referred to as a ``combi'' airplane)or the relatively small baggage compartment located within the pressurizedportion of an airplane designed for executive transportation.Class C_As defined at the time of initial classification, any compartmentthat did not fall into either Class A or B was a Class C compartment. ClassC compartments differ from Class B compartments primarily in that built-inextinguishing systems are required for control of fires in lieu of crewmemberaccessibility. The volumes of Class C compartments in currently used domesticjet transport category airplanes range from approximately 700 to 3,000cubic feet.Later, two additional classes were established and defined as follows:Class D_A compartment in which a fire would be completely contained withoutendangering the safety of the airplane or the occupants. A Class D compartmentis similar to a Class C compartment in that both are located in areas thatare not readily accessible to a crewmember. In lieu of providing fire orsmoke detection and extinguishment, Class D compartments are designed tocontrol a fire by severely restricting the supply of available oxygen.Because an oxygen-deprived fire might continue to smolder for the durationof a flight, the capability of the liner to resist flame penetration isespecially important. The volumes of Class D compartments in transportcategory airplanes currently used in domestic air carrier service rangefrom approximately 225 to 1,630 cubic feet. Some airplanes designed forexecutive transportation and used in air taxi service also have relativelysmall (15-25 cubic feet) Class D compartments located outside the pressurizedportions of the cabin.Class E_A cargo compartment of an airplane used only for the carriage ofcargo. In lieu of providing extinguishment, means must be provided to shutoff the ventilating airflow to or within a Class E compartment. In addition,procedures, such as depressurizing the airplane, are stipulated to minimizethe amount of oxygen available in the event a fire occurs in a Class Ecompartment.The FAA conducted a series of full-scale tests at its Technical Centerto investigate the capability of three liner materials to resist flamepenetration under conditions representative of actual cargo or baggagecompartment fires. The tests were conducted using simulated Class C andD compartments. Copies of Report No. DOT/FAA/CT-83/44, A Laboratory Testfor Evaluating the Fire Containment Characteristics of Aircraft Class DCargo Comparment Lining Material, dated October 1983, and Report No. DOT/FAA/CT-84/21,Suppression and Control of Class C Cargo Compartment Fires, dated February1985, have been placed in the Rules Docket. Copies of these reports, whichdescribe the FAA testing, are available for public inspection and are alsoavailable for purchase from the National Technical Information Servicein Springfield, Virginia 22161. Although cargo or baggage is sometimesplaced in compartments in preloaded containers, the tests were conductedwith bulk-loaded baggage because cargo or baggage is frequently bulk-loadeddirectly into the compartments in actual service. In conjunction with thosetests, the FAA developed a method of testing liner materials utilizinga 2 gallons-per-hour kerosene burner. The materials tested_glass fiberreinforced resin (rigid fiberglass) Kevlar and Nomex_comprise the primaryliner materials currently used in domestic jet transport airplanes. Although liners constructed of Kevlar or Nomex met the existing standardsof Part 25, it was found from those tests that a fire could rapidly burnthem under representative conditions. In addition to the fire hazards associatedwith the initial flame penetration, the ability of the compartment to restrictthe supply of oxygen in the compartment would be hindered. That, in turn,could result in a fire of increased intensity. In contrast, the capabilityof liners constructed of glass fiber reinforced resin to resist flame penetrationwas typically found to be very high regardless of the resin used. Thisis because the fiberglass remains after the resin burns out and servesas a flame arrester. As a result of those tests, new type certificationstandards were adopted for Class C or D cargo or baggage compartments intransport category airplanes (Amendment 25-60; 51 FR 18236; May 16, 1986).The newly adopted standards, which are applicable to airplanes for whichapplication for type certificate is made after June 16, 1986, include newtest methods for the ceiling and sidewall liner panels. In addition, themaximum volume of a Class D compartment is limited to 1,000 cubic feet.Subsequent testing conducted at the Technical Center showed that linersconstructed of aluminum were better in regard to flame penetration resistancethan those of Kevlar or Nomex, although not generally as good as thoseconstructed of glass fiber reinforced resin. On the other hand, nonglassfiber reinforced resin construction, such as blankets or battings, wasfound to be unsatisfactory because the supporting material would burn awayrapidly. In the absence of the supporting material, the fiberglass wouldfall out of place. Although Amendment 25-60 provides new standards for future transport categoryairplanes, it does not affect airplanes currently in service nor the airplanesthat will be produced under type certificates for which application wasmade prior to June 16, 1986. Although the majority of the transport categoryairplanes currently used in U.S. air carrier, air taxi and commercial serviceutilize liners constructed of glass fiber reinforced resin for ceilingand sidewalls of cargo or baggage compartments, certain models use linersconstructed of Kevlar or Nomex. In order to preclude the continued useof such materials, Notice 87-11 proposed to add a new andSection; 121.314and to amend andSection; 135.169 to require improved standards for the cargoor baggage compartment liners in transport category airplanes used in suchservice. Due to the additional burden of retrofitting existing airplanes, the standardsproposed in Notice 87-11 differ somewhat from those provided by Amendment25-60 for future designs. As proposed in Notice 87-11, existing installationswith liners constructed of glass fiber reinforced resin would be acceptablewithout further tests. Previously approved installations utilizing aluminumceiling or sidewall liner panels could also be retained; however, aluminumcould not be used to replace other materials. Ceiling and sidewall panelsconstructed of other materials would have to be replaced with panels constructedof glass fiber reinforced resin or with materials tested using the apparatusand procedures recently adopted for Part 25. The acceptance criteria forsuch materials would be the same as for materials tested for compliancewith Part 25. The term ``liner,'' as used in this final rule and in Amendment 25-60 alsoincludes any design features which would affect the capability of the linerto safely contain a fire. In the case of glass fiber reinforced resin oraluminum panels, the materials of such features would have to have thefire integrity of the basic material; or the design features would haveto be tested along with the basic panel material unless they have beenpreviously found satisfactory. For example, joints that are constructedwith fireproof fasteners and are not subject to gaps caused by distortionneed not be tested. On the other hand, the test specimens would includejoints constructed with nonfireproof fasteners or joints subject to distortion.Similarly, test specimens would include lamp lenses, if failure of thelenses would allow flames to pass; however, lamps need not be includedin the test specimen if the lamp incorporates a fireproof body which wouldprevent the passage of flames. Unlike the new standards of Part 25, the standards proposed in Notice 87-11would not be applicable to compartments with volumes less than 200 cubicfeet. The fire hazards associated with relatively small compartments arenot as great due to the limited volume of oxygen and amount of combustiblematerials that would be contained in them. The present liners used in thosecompartments are, therefore, considered to provide an acceptable levelof safety. The new standards of Part 25 for future type designs include a maximumvolume of 1,000 cubic feet for a Class D compartment. A corresponding requirementwas not proposed in Notice 87-11 because the redesign and retrofit of airplaneswith Class D compartments larger than 1,000 cubic feet was considered tobe extremely burdensome and did not appear to be warranted due to a lackof adverse service experience. Recent service experience has shown, however,that additional new standards, such as requirements for fire or smoke detectorsand extinguishment, may be needed for both Class B and Class D compartments.(The installation of such equipment would, in effect, make such compartmentsClass C.) The FAA is, therefore, considering further rulemaking in thatregard. Nevertheless, such further rulemaking would not lessen the needfor the new standards proposed in Notice 87-11.Compliance with the standards proposed in Notice 87-11 would not be requiredfor transport category airplanes type certificated on or before January1, 1958, because their advanced age and limited numbers in Part 121 or135 operation would make compliance impractical from an economic standpoint.That date was selected because the rule would include Boeing 707 and DouglasDC-8 vintage and later airplanes, and would exclude older airplanes, suchas the Douglas DC-6's or DC-7's. As proposed in Notice 87-11, all other transport category airplanes whichare operated under the provisions of Part 121 or 135 would have to meetthe new standards within two years after the effective date of the amendment.The two year compliance period is intended to allow operators and manufacturerstime to select and qualify prospective liner materials and incorporatethem with a minimum of disruption to fleet schedules or assembly lines.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Comments were received from a diversity of commenters ranging from organizationsrepresenting various aircraft manufacturers and operators, to aviationtrade unions. Commenters also included a foreign airworthiness authorityand producers of candidate interior materials. Two commenters support theproposed new standards without qualification. The seven other commenterssupport the general intent of the rulemaking; however, they offer suggestedchanges and additions. One commenter recommends that the proposed standards should apply to compartmentssmaller than 200 cubic feet, as well as to larger compartments. As notedabove, the fire hazards associated with relatively small compartments arenot as great due to the limited volume of oxygen and amount of combustiblematerials that would be contained in them. Furthermore, service experiencedoes not indicate that improved liners are needed in such compartments.The same commenter recommends that all Class D compartments should be upgradedto Class C compartments by providing fire detection and extinguishing means.This would be beyond the scope of Notice 87-11 and could not be adoptedat this time. The FAA is, however, considering future rulemaking in thatregard as noted above. The commenter also recommends that all cargo compartments should be requiredto have liners. All cargo or baggage compartments, except Class A compartments,are presently required to have liners. By definition, a Class A compartmentmust be located such that the presence of a fire would be easily detectedby a crewmember while at his or her station. In addition, all parts ofa Class A compartment must be easily accessible in flight. Class A compartmentsare typically small compartments located in the cockpit and used for crewluggage. Due to the brief time needed to detect and extinguish a fire,a liner would serve no useful purpose in a Class A compartment. One commenter is concerned that the language of proposed andSection; 121.314(a)(1) and (2) would imply that glass fiber reinforced resin constructiondoes not necessarily satisfy the test requirements of Part III of AppendixF to Part 25. In contrast, another commenter is concerned that the languagewould imply that glass fiber reinforced resin construction would pass thenew standards of Part 25. That commenter notes that some liners constructedof glass fiber reinforced resin do not meet the new standards and proposesthat all constructions, including glass fiber reinforced resin, shouldbe required to meet the new standards. The second commenter is correctin noting that glass fiber reinforced resin construction does not necessarilymeet the new standards of Part 25. It was found, however, to be so likelyto meet or exceed the new standards that the cost of conducting a testfor each installation to show compliance with the new standards would notbe justified. Glass fiber reinforced resin construction is, therefore,considered acceptable without further testing, insofar as compliance withandSection; 121.314 is concerned. Three commenters object to the statement in proposed andSection; 121.314that the term ``liner'' includes any design feature which would affectthe capability of the liner to safely contain a fire. They assert thatthere are installation features of almost every existing cargo compartmentwhich do not meet the new standards of Part 25. One of the three commentersdraws a parallel to the recent rulemaking concerning cabin interior materials(Amendment 25-61; 51 FR 26208; July 21, 1986). In that regard, the commenternotes that the FAA exempted a number of interior components in that rulemakingbecause they would make an insignificant contribution to the flammabilityof the interior when compared to the large interior surfaces. The commenters incorrectly assume that proposed andSection; 121.314 wouldrequire all design features to be tested to show compliance with the newstandards of Part 25. The design features are not considered as-separateentities insofar as compliance with the proposed standards is concerned.Rather, they are considered as part of the liner and then only to the extentthat they would affect the capability of the liner to safely contain afire. Design features which could fail without compromising the capabilityof the liner would not have to be considered at all. As parts of the liners,design features which would affect the capability of the liners to safelycontain fires would be subject to the same exceptions for glass fiber reinforcedresin and aluminum as the basic liner panel material. The parallel made to the recent interior materials rulemaking is inappropriate.The purpose of the interior materials rulemaking is to minimize the contributionof the materials to a fire that is already burning in the cabin. A relativelysmall component would make an insignificant contribution to the flammabilityof the cabin. The purpose of the proposed cargo or baggage compartmentliner standards, on the other hand, is to prevent a fire in a compartmentfrom penetrating the compartment walls and spreading to other parts ofthe airplane. The consequences of flames penetrating a design feature ina liner are just as great as those of flames penetrating a portion of thebasic liner material. In addition, it is pointless to have a liner withexcellent capability to resist flame penetration if the joints or attachmentscan fail and allow the liner to fall out of place. One commenter states they were advised by the FAA Technical Center thatthe test apparatus required for compliance with the new standards of Part25 is not appropriate for testing joints, seams, fasteners, etc. Whilethe test apparatus and procedures were originally developed using onlybasic liner panels, the Technical Center has since demonstrated that thetest apparatus can be used effectively when the liner does incorporatejoints, seams, fasteners, etc. One commenter expresses concern that there would be a detrimental impacton the airlines' current maintenance programs which allow for temporaryrepair of liner damage with fire resistant tapes. Some current repair methodsmay, in fact, not meet the new standards and have to be replaced. Nevertheless,as in the case of design features, it is pointless to have a liner withexcellent capability to resist flame penetration if a substandard repairwere to fail in the event a fire occurred and leave an opening in the liner.One commenter believes the proposed two-year compliance period should beextended to four years in order to provide sufficient time for operatorsto comply during major scheduled maintenance periods. The commenter assertsthat such scheduled maintenance periods occur at three to five year periodsand that airplanes would have to be removed from scheduled service to complywithin the proposed two-year period. The FAA does not concur that airplaneswould have to be removed from scheduled service to comply within two years.The existing liners are, in fact, routinely removed at intermediate timesfor inspection of structure surrounding the cargo or baggage compartments.Replacement liners could easily be installed during those inspections.One commenter believes that the term ``rigid fiberglass'' does not accuratelydescribe the materials in question. The commenter notes that the resistanceof such materials to fire penetration is due to their being reinforcedwith fiberglass rather than their being ``rigid'' per se. The commenterfurther notes that resins used in laminates fabricated with such fiberglassreinforcement may be flexible or rigid and thereby produce flexible orrigid laminates. The commenter states that as long as the materials arefiberglass-reinforced laminates (as opposed to fiberglass batting, suchas is used in thermal or accoustical insulation), they are highly resistantto fire penetration. The FAA concurs that ``rigid fiberglass'' is not anaccurate description. The term ``rigid fiberglass'' has, therefore, beenremoved leaving only the term ``glass fiber reinforced resin.'' One commenter notes that the trademarks ``Kevlar'' and ``Nomex'' are theproperty of the commenter and serve as the exclusive designation for aramidfiber products manufactured by the commenter. The commenter is particularlyconcerned that the use of those terms in the NPRM implies that the impactis only on those products and that the organic materials of other manufacturersare not affected. The commenter is further concerned that the use of thoseterms implies that Kevlar or Nomex cannot be a component of the replacementmaterials used to comply with the proposed standards. The commenter alsoasserts fiberglass construction, as well as Kevlar and Nomex construction,failed to meet the new standards of Part 25. The FAA regrets any implication that the products of the commenter areunsatisfactory by definition and that similar materials of other producersare satisfactory. Nevertheless, as noted in the preamble to Notice 87-11,Kevlar and Nomex are the only two materials, other than fiberglass andaluminum, that are widely used in the construction of the cargo or baggagecompartment liners that are in service today. Furthermore, the liners usedin the compartments of the Boeing 757 and 767, the Saab SF-340, and theLockheed L-1011 are known to the aircraft industry and the general publicas ``Kevlar'' or ``Nomex.'' Because, as the commenter notes, there maybe other such constructions which do, in fact, meet the new standards,the use of the generic term ``aramid fiber products'' in lieu of ``Kevlar''and ``Nomex'' in the NPRM would have misled the public. The FAA also regrets any implication that future materials identified as``Kevlar'' or ``Nomex'' are unsuitable regardless of whether they meetthe new standards of Part 25. Obviously, any material which meets thosestandards is acceptable regardless of the name given to it. The FAA is,however, concerned that the use of the same name for materials with suchdifferent performance characteristics could lead to the inadvertent useof the wrong material. In order to preclude a hazard through the inadvertentuse of the ``Kevlar'' or ``Nomex'' construction that has been found unsatisfactory,the FAA strongly recommends that the commenter assign new or modified designationsto the materials that do meet the new standards. As noted above, glass fiber reinforced resin construction was found tobe so likely to meet or exceed the new standards of Part 25 that the costof conducting a test for each installation would not be justified. The regulatory evaluation prepared for Notice 87-11 was based, in part,on the understanding that 44 Saab SF-340 airplanes would have to be modifiedto replace existing liners constructed of Kevlar and that all of the airplanesproduced by Airbus Industrie already have liners constructed of materialswhich would meet the new standards. One commenter states that the SF-340airplanes would not be affected because the volume of the largest cargoor baggage compartment in the Model SF-340 is 189 cubic feet. The commenteris, of course, correct in believing that compartments which are less than200 cubic feet would not be affected. The comment that the largest compartmentin the Model SF-340 is only 189 cubic feet in volume is, however, contraryto the manufacturer's SF-340 Aircraft Operation Manual which states thatthe volume of the baggage compartment is 225 cubic feet. A copy of thepertinent pages of that manual has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking.To be conservative, the regulatory evaluation prepared for this final ruleis based on the assumption that the SF-340 airplanes would have to meetthe new standards. Another commenter notes that the forward and aft cargobay ceiling panels of 12 Airbus A-300B4 airplanes of U.S. registry wouldhave to be replaced. This additional information is addressed in the newregulatory evaluation prepared for these amendments. The regulatory evaluation prepared for Notice 87-11 was based on the assumptionthat there would be a slight increase in airplane weight due to the useof heavier materials needed to comply with the proposed new standards.One commenter submitted data showing that new materials which would meetthe new standards and save about half the weight of glass fiber reinforcedresin liners are available. This information is also addressed in the newregulatory evaluation prepared for these amendments. Since the time Notice 87-11 was prepared, it has come to the attentionof the FAA that the practice of incorporating certain provisions of Part121 in Part 135 by reference may cause confusion. In order to precludeany confusion in this regard, Part 135 is amended to include the new standardsexplicitly rather than by reference. This is a nonsubstantive editorialchange. Except as noted above, Parts 121 and 135 are amended as proposed in Notice87-11. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>The following is a summary of the final cost impact and benefit assessmentof this regulation amending Parts 121 and 135 of the FAR. These amendmentsupgrade the fire safety standards for cargo or baggage compartment linermaterials in certain transport category airplanes used in air carrier,air taxi, or commercial service. Transport category airplanes type certificatedafter January 1, 1958, will be required to have ceiling and sidewall panelsconstructed of either glass fiber reinforced resin, aluminum (only forliner installations approved prior to the effective date of this rule),or materials meeting the test requirements of Part 25, Appendix F, PartIII. The FAA issued a rule in 1986 mandating similar, but more stringent, standardsfor newly type certificated transport category airplanes, and a NPRM (52FR 42512; November 5, 1987) proposing retrofitting cargo or baggage compartmentliners in transport category airplanes already in service. Several of the written comments received as of May 3, 1988, in responseto the NPRM pertain to the economic impact of the proposal. Commentersinclude an organization representing air carriers, and a manufacturer oflining materials, as well as others. One commenter objects to the inclusion of 44 Saab SF-340 airplanes in theinitial regulatory evaluation's list of airplanes that would require modification.This commenter indicates that the Saab SF-340 would not be affected bythe proposed standards, since its largest cargo or baggage compartmenthas only 189 cubic feet of volume, whereas the NPRM would only affect compartmentslarger than 200 cubic feet. The FAA has not been able to corroborate this assertion. The manufacturer'sSF-340 Aircraft Operations Manual states that the volume of the baggagecompartment is 225 cubic feet. Therefore, the FAA assumes, for purposesof this evaluation, that all Saab SF-340 airplanes operating under Part121 will require retrofit of their cargo or baggage compartment liners.Another commenter notes that 12 Airbus A300-B4 airplanes of U.S. registrywould require replacement of cargo bay ceiling panels, in addition to theairplanes listed in the initial regulatory evaluation as requiring modification.The FAA disagrees with this comment. The manufacturer of the A300-B4 hasindicated that it, and all other types of Airbus airplanes, have cargocompartment liners constructed of glass fiber reinforced resin, which wouldmeet the proposed requirements.The same commenter also indicates that the initial regulatory evaluation'sestimate of the total cost of the proposed rule excludes additional costsof up to $47 million annually, resulting from the removal of aircraft fromservice to comply with the proposed rule within the specified two yearcompliance period. The FAA disagrees that affected airplanes would need to be removed fromservice to comply with the proposed rule within two years. Existing linersare routinely removed more frequently than every two years, for inspectionof structure surrounding the cargo or baggage compartments. Replacementliners could easily be installed during these inspections. Therefore, compliancewith the proposed rule within two years would not cause any additionalcosts due to removal of airplanes from service. The commenter indicates as well that the initial regulatory evaluationdoes not take into account any additional costs due to the required replacementof design features, such as joints and fixtures, in addition to the largepanel surface areas. The FAA's initial cost projections for materials and labor were based onestimates of the costs of complete kits for replacing cargo or baggagecompartment liners, including engineering and certification costs. TheFAA believes that the costs of replacement of design features would notadd significantly to the total cost of liner replacement since very fewof these features would be likely to require replacement. Therefore, theFAA has not increased its estimates of the cost per aircraft of liner replacementin the final regulatory evaluation. Many design features are mounted on the liner panels and could fail withoutcompromising the fire containment characteristics of the liner itself.Such features would not require replacement. Furthermore, information availableto the FAA indicates that support or attachment structure for cargo orbaggage compartment liner panels in virtually all of the affected airplanesis constructed of aluminum, or the panels are mounted directly to the airframestructure with aluminum or steel fasteners. Since aluminum is an acceptablematerial for the construction of liners, according to the proposed rule,such support or attachment structures would not need to be tested or replaced.The FAA also considers that steel fasteners meet the new fire protectionstandards and that no further testing is needed for such fasteners. Finally, another commenter indicates that new materials containing layersof organic fibers and fire blocking material could meet the proposed burnthroughrequirements, while saving as much as one-half the weight of glass reinforcedliners with similar impact resistance. The FAA recognizes that materials may now exist or may be developed inthe future that contain fire as effectively as glass fiber reinforced resinpanels, but weigh less and provide cost savings from reduced fuel consumption.However, in order not to underestimate the costs of this rule, the FAAcontinues to assume in the final regulatory evaluation that all cargo orbaggage compartment retrofits will employ the heavier glass fiber reinforcedpanels. Total costs of these amendments are expected to be $21.3 million in 1987dollars, or $15.5 million discounted present value, and are evaluated overthe ten-year period following the expected 1991 compliance date. Thesecosts include labor and material costs of installing cargo compartmentliners in certain airplanes that do not already meet the standards setforth in the amendments, as well as the additional fuel consumed by theseairplanes because of the slight increase in the weight of these new liners.Total costs can be broken down as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7</C> <H1> </H1><H1>1987 dollars (in millions)</H1><H1>Present dollar value (in millions)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cost retrofit <D>14.1</D><D>11.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cost of additional fuel<D>7.2</D><D>3.8</D><R>n,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total costs<D>21.3</D><D>15.5</D></ITAG></ITAG> Cost estimates have been adjusted from the initial regulatory evaluationto account for new projections of the composition and size of the fleetof affected airplanes, and are updated from 1986 to 1987 dollars. Airplanesexpected to be effected by these amendments include certain Boeing 727,737, 747, 757 and 767's, Lockheed L-1011's, and Saab SF-340's. This rule will be cost beneficial if it succeeds in preventing only oneaccident. Comparing the potential benefit of avoiding airplane propertyloss alone (ranging from approximately $2.6 million to $23 million) againstthe costs of bringing all airplanes of a specific model into compliance,the benefit would greatly exceed the costs. Taking into account the overallcosts and the benefits of preventing fatalities as well as property loss,should the only accident prevented involve the smallest airplane subjectto the rule change (the Saab SF-340, with an average load of 20 passengers),the cost per fatality avoided would be $645 thousand. Economists generallyagree that this figure is well below the $1 million criterion for ``costper life saved.'' Furthermore, if this rule succeeds in preventing an accidentinvolving a larger or more fully loaded airplane, the cost per fatalityavoided will be lower.Regulatory Flexibility Act Determination The FAA has identified 20 small entity air carriers that operate airplanemodels affected by this rule. All but three of these carriers operate onlyBoeing 727 and 737 airplanes among the affected airplanes, the least expensivemodels to bring into compliance. Should these air carriers operate as manyas nine of these airplanes, the largest number allowed for an operatorto be considered a small entity, then the annualized retrofit cost foreach operator would be under $750. This is far less than the thresholdvalue of $3,600 prescribed in FAA Order 2100.14A, <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, </T3>for determiningsignificant economic impact on unscheduled operators, and significantlylower than the $92,700 threshold value for scheduled operators. For thesereasons, these amendments are not expected to result in a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Nonetheless, they areexpected to provide a benefit for those small entities engaged in manufacturingcargo compartment liner material. The FAA believes, however, that thisbenefit will not be significant. International Trade Impact Analysis This rulemaking will have little or no impact on trade for either U.S.firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign firms doing businessin the United States. Foreign air carriers, which are not affected by thisrule, will not gain any competitive advantage over the domestic operationsof U.S. carriers because they are prohibited from transporting passengersbetween origin-destination points within the United States. In international operations, foreign air carriers may realize a slightcost advantage. However, the costs of this rule are extremely small incomparison to the overall cost of engaging in international air transportation.Therefore, no appreciable trade impact is expected to result from theseamendments. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed earlier in the preamble, the FAA has determinedthat this is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. TheFAA has determined that this action is significant under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44FA 11034; February 26, 1979).
