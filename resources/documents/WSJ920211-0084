The rating concern's downgrade was made in advance of theplanned sale of $1.39 billion of general obligation bondsFeb. 19. About $16.24 billion of debt is affected.</LP><TEXT>   In December, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered its rating onCalifornia's public debt to double-A from the top ranking oftriple-A because of doubts about the state's handling of itsballooning deficit. State officials estimate that Californiacould face a deficit of $5 billion or more by June 30, theend of the current fiscal year. &quot;Wall Street is sendingCalifornia a clear message: Get your house in order,&quot; saidstate Controller Gray Davis.   In lowering its rating, Moody's said that while some ofCalifornia's current fiscal woes are due to the recession,they also &quot;reflect long-term pressures that will make itdifficult to regain the degree of financial stability&quot;California once held. Moody's cited the &quot;magnitude of thestate's infrastructure needs and other spending demands of arapidly growing population.&quot; The state currently has about 30million residents.   California has been struggling to deal with increasingdemands on its social services and revenue that is fallingshort of expectations. The state also faces financialpressure from programs mandated but not funded by the federalgovernment and spending decisions made by voter initiatives.   Still, Moody's said it &quot;doesn't subscribe to the view thatthe state is entering a period of severe long-term decline&quot;and doesn't expect &quot;recent job loss or social servicecaseload trends to continue unabated.&quot;   The downgrade will increase the interest cost on new debtissued by the state by five basis points, or hundredths of apercentage point. California plans to issue about $11 billionof bonds in the next three years, according to stateTreasurer Kathleen Brown. The higher cost on that amountwould result in an additional $80 million in debt serviceover the 20-year life of the bonds, or about $4 million ayear.   Current holders of state bonds may see their value drop byas much as 0.5%, Ms. Brown's office said, a loss of nearly$74 million to market bondholders.</TEXT></DOC>
