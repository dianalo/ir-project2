Augusto Pinochet lateSunday again rejected opposition demands that he step down frompower, saying he will not leave office before March 1990.   ``The situation is very simple,'' Pinochet said in a surprisetelevision appearance from his country home at Bucalemu. ``Wefulfilled the constitution that was set up ... so, now that theopposition has triumphed, why should we change?''   ``I acknowlege the opposition's victory, but I am not going tochange what the constitution says,'' Pinochet said. ``March 11,1990, is going to be the day that the government is handed over.''   The comments of the 72-year-old commander-in-chief of Chile'sarmed forces came during a three-minute TV newscast. Pinochet wasdressed in a short-sleeve blue shirt. He appeared relaxed and spokeclearly and firmly.   Last Wednesday, nearly 7 million Chileans went to the polls tovote on the armed forces' proposal that Pinochet legally be allowedto remain president until 1997.   Pinochet, who ousted elected Marxist President Salvador Allendein a 1973 coup, lost by about 800,000 votes. Precedence for theballoting was established under the 1980 constitution.   In that constitution, elections for president and congress won'tbe held until December 1989, with the winners taking office thefollowing March.   Opposition leaders, including Patricio Aylwin, spokesman for the16-party coalition that urged Chileans to vote ``no'' in thereferendum, have pressed the military government to move up thedate of elections, among other constitutional changes.   ``We will formally call on those holding power now, to talk toreach an agreement,'' Aylwin said in an interview published Sundayin the newspaper La Epoca. ``We will take the initiative by makinga proposal and call to the armed forces.''   A 4-man military junta acts as the legislature of this SouthAmerica country, which has been ruled by freely elected, democraticgovernments for most of its 178-year history as an independentnation.   The junta is empowered to change the constitution, but Pinochetemphasized in aspeech broadcast nationwide the night after thereferendum that he had no intention of doing so.   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, the head of Pinochet's16-member cabinet and director of his losing referendum campaign,urged Pinochet supporters to remain ``united and mobilized aroundour president.'' He did not address opposition demands for changes.   Opposition proposals include: move up the date of nationalelections, eliminate a constitutional ban on Marxist groups, andallow the entire senate _ not just two-thirds _ to be elected, notappointed.   Also, opposition leaders want to streamline the process by whichfuture constitutional changes can be made.   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent, moderate Socialist, acknowleged thatnegotiations, if they take place, would take time. ``The people aremature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship don't endin 15 hours.''   But other Pinochet opponents already have served notice theydon't intend to wait peacefully, or long. On Saturday, a coalitionof leftist parties publicly called for Pinochet's immediateresignation.   The situation sets up potential clashes between the governmentand its opponents. In the two days following the election, tens ofthousands of Chileans celebrated Pinochet's defeat with spontaneousdemonstrations in the streets of the capital and oother majorcities.   Last Friday, an estimated 350,000 Chileans gathered in adowntown park in a rally organized by the opposition politicalcoalition.   Also, hundreds of youths clashed with riot police, leading todozens of injuries and arrests, and two shooting deaths.   Journalists were among those attacked by riot police last week,resulting in minor injuries to about 20 reporters and photographers.   In a separate development Sunday, two national policemenguarding the U.S. Consulate told the state Orbe news agency theywere fired upon by unidentified gunmen in a car parked near theconsulate, and they shot back. No injuries were reported.</TEXT></DOC>
