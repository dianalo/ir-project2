White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that theadministration was seeking ``continued economic growth with lowinflation. We believe the economy is generally on that course at thepresent time and the Fed is doing a good job.''   But at the same time, Fitzwater did not repudiate the statementsmade on Sunday by Budget Director Richard Darman. Fitzwater notedthat Bush has made similar comments himself in the past.   Darman, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the Fed waskeeping interest rates too high and would shoulder the blame if thecountry falls into a recession.   Saying he feared the Fed ``may have been a little too tight,''Darman urged the central bank to do more to lower interest rates andsaid the Fed should ``be more attentive to the need to avoid tippingthe economy into a recession.''   Private economists were surprised by the timing of Darman'sremarks, given the fact that recent economic statistics suggestFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may be succeeding in hiseffort to achieve a ``soft landing'' in which economic growth slowsenough to dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the countryinto a recession.   Some analysts suggested that Darman was positioning the FederalReserve to take the blame should the economy falter before nextyear's congressional elections.   ``This is a classic situation of setting up the Fed to be thefall guy if something goes wrong,'' said Robert Dederick, chiefeconomist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.   Economists said it was unlikely that Darman's remarks would haveany impact on upcoming Fed decisions. Top Fed policymakers will meetagain in Washington on Aug. 22 and many economists said theyexpected the central bank to hold interest rates steady and not easefurther.   From March 1988 through March 1989, the Federal Reserve pushedshort-term interest rates up by about 3 percentage points in aneffort to dampen economic growth as a way of cooling inflationarypressures. Starting in June, the Fed reversed course and has made amodest effort to lower interest rates in order to keep the economyfrom tumbling into a recession.   Those moves, which have made more money available to the bankingsystem, have allowed banks to cut their prime lending rate sinceearly June by a full percentage point to 10.5 percent currently.Home mortgage rates have declined as well to the lowest levels intwo years.   But with recent signs that economic growth is not as sluggish asfeared, many analysts said they were not looking for the Fed to pushinterest rates lower in the near future.   ``So long as the economy is OK, there is no reason for the Fed toease any more,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   Sinai said mortgage rates may even climb by about one-fourthpercentage point as financial markets realize that the central bankhas decided to hold off on further easing moves.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said thatDarman's comments had made it more difficult for the Fed to easeright away because the independent central bank would appear to bebowing to political pressure, a situation which rattles financialmarkets.   ``I don't think the Fed has the political option to ease rightnow after Darman's broadside,'' Evans said.   Paul Getman, senior economist at the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,Pa., consulting firm, suggested that Darman may have felt compelledto attack the Fed because of the just-signed legislation bailing outthe savings and loan industry.   That measure projects spending $166 billion through 1999 to closeor merge failing Sandamp;Ls, an estimate which could balloon if interestrate assumptions used by the administration turn out to be toooptimistic.   ``The administration's forecast of the bailout is predicated onlow interest rates. Darman knows that,'' Getman said.   Darman's comments marked the first critical administrationstatements since last winter when Bush and Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady both complained that the Fed's year-long effort topush interest rates higher ran the risk of aborting the recordpeacetime expansion, now in its seventh year.</TEXT></DOC>
