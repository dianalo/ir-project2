The Si-SSDwas bombarded by 14 MeV neutrons and the resulting spectra have beenmeasured in order to compare with the calculated ones using a code developedin this study for the PKA's and charged particles (CP's) with evaluatedneutron nuclear data library, ENDF/B-IV. The calculated one globallyreproduced the experimental one. However, in detailed inspection, thepresent conventional model was too simple to compare both spectra. Itis necessary to adopt more realistic nuclear models, especially for two-bodycontinuum and three-body reactions, and include some effects such aspenetration of the energetic particles and energy loss process of thePKA's at low energy regions, etc.</TEXT></DOC>
