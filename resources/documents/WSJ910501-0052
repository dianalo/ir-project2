The quirk sends copies of random snippets of a PC'scontents into some special files in the software Prodigysubscribers use to access the system. Those files are alsoaccessible to Prodigy's central computers, which connect tousers' PCs via phone lines. Prodigy, a joint venture ofInternational Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co., offers nearly one million users electronic banking,games, mail and other services.</LP><TEXT>   The service's officials say they're aware of the softwarefluke. They also confirm that it could conceivably allowProdigy employees to view those stray snippets of privatefiles that creep into the Prodigy software. But they insistthat Prodigy has never looked at those snippets and hasn'tany intention of ever doing so.   &quot;We couldn't get to that information without a lot ofwork, and we haven't any interest in getting there,&quot; saysBrian Ek, a Prodigy spokesman.   Nevertheless, news of the odd security breach has beenstirring alarm among Prodigy users. Many have been nervouslychecking their Prodigy software to see what snippets havecrept into it, finding such sensitive data as lawyer-clientnotes, private phone-lists, and accountants' tax files.   Even though Prodigy users' privacy doesn't appear to havebeen invaded, the software problem points up the securityrisks that can arise as the nation races to build vastnetworks linking PCs via telephone lines.   Computer users have already learned the dangers of rogue&quot;virus&quot; programs that replicate themselves from one system toanother, deleting data or crashing networks along the way.The threat of high-tech Peeping Toms invisibly snooping at auser's files is a newer worry.   Linda Rohrbough, a Van Nuys, Calif., computer consultant,looked in her Prodigy software and discovered fragments ofconfidential computer code she was programming for a client.While she has no evidence anyone else ever saw thatinformation, she canceled her Prodigy subscription just to besure.   &quot;I'm not going to take any chances with the source code ofour product,&quot; she says.   Mark Emanuele of Fords, N.J., another computer consultant,had a similar experience. He also found programs he waswriting for a client. &quot;What was getting out -- if it got out-- was harmless. But the fact that they could get in therereally upset me.&quot; Mr. Emanuele says his lawyer looked insidehis own Prodigy software and found confidential clientinformation.   A computer user at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology told a tax-professional friend using Prodigysoftware about the quirk. In the Prodigy files, &quot;hediscovered . . . confidential tax info on most of hisclients,&quot; the MIT user wrote in a bulletin circulating thisweek on computer networks. &quot;He is still searching through his{Prodigy software}, shouting expletives.&quot;   Prodigy is the biggest consumer on-line PC service, andthe first effort to try to promote such systems to a massmarket. A few other commercial ventures deliver consumerservices via PC, including General Electric Co.'s Genienetwork and a Citicorp bank-at-home offering. Thousands ofother home-grown bulletin boards let PC users send messagesto each others' terminals.   In theory all these other services could also exploittheir telephone links to snoop inside a user's files -- justas a phone company could tap a customer's line. But therearen't any notorious examples of on-line snooping, and usersgenerally haven't worried about the problem.   Prodigy's advanced design may have made it moresusceptible than other online services to picking up datafrom private files. To use the service, Prodigy subscribersmust load their computer with a bundle of special Prodigyprograms.   Among them are a pair of files called STAGE.DAT andCACHE.DAT. They cordon off big tracts of memory inside auser's disk-drive. While a user is connected to Prodigy, thesystem sends programs into these files. Those programs havesome of the instructions a user needs to use Prodigy. Prodigylikes having the option of shipping programs every time auser connects to the system -- so it can keep a user loadedwith the latest software advances.   As Prodigy explains it, the STAGE and CACHE programs don'tnecessarily fill up all the space set aside in those twofiles. Because of an oddity in the inner design of PCs, theempty space can get filled up by other stray pieces of datafloating inside a computer, Prodigy says.   &quot;It's an unfortunate side effect of the way the operatingsystem works,&quot; says Harold Goldes, a Prodigy technicalstaffer. He says the side-effect is part of the design of theDOS operating system, used in 60 million IBM andIBM-compatible PCs.</TEXT></DOC>
