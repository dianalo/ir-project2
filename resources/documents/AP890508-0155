The proposal would expand the council's peacekeepingresponsibilities dramatically.   Sir Crispin Tickell, Britain's U.N. ambassador, announcedLondon's new approach in a speech before the U.N. Economic andSocial Council.   ``The atmosphere knows no boundaries, and the winds carry nopassports,'' he said.   ``Just as member states of the United Nations came together totake action on damage to the ozone layer, so we now need to cometogether to see how to cope with the wider problem of likely globalwarming.''   Scientists believe global warming is caused by an increase inthe ``greenhouse effect,'' when gases in the earth's atmospheretrap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition to naturalbuildup, scientists say the gases have increased greatly because ofburning coal, oil, and gas, and destruction of tropical rainforests.   The ambassador said global warming and climate change couldundermine world peace as fertile nations are beset by droughts;coastal cities are inundated by rising oceans; and storms,hurricanes and floods strike with greater frequency and intensity.   Tickell said the international conference should proceedcautiously, avoiding utopian pronouncements or demands forimmediate and obligatory changes in energy use patterns.   ``In working out guidelines, we would try to look at measures todissuade governments from taking actions that have a bad effect onsomebody else,'' such as manipulating rainfall, river flows orocean currents, said Tickell.   ``We can look into the ways that energy could be betterconserved; again, you could look at guidelines which would try todissuade people from using certain sorts of fuel; for example, coaland oil produce far more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and thatproduces a bit more than nuclear energy,'' he said.   ``So there are a whole variety of subjects in which the world isnot ready for a formal treaty, but you can perhaps work out andpoint in certain directions in these guidelines which would helpnations to understand the nature of the problem and what is to bedone about it.''   He said the framework for an international convention alreadyexists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a year-oldbody with three study committees chaired by the United States,Soviet Union and Britain.   The Security Council could monitor progress toward dealing withthe effects of global warming under Article 34 of the U.N. Charter,said Tickell.   The article allows the council to look into ``any dispute or anysituation which might lead to international friction or give riseto a dispute.''   ``In the past, wars have been about productive land, they havebeen about the supply of fresh water and they have been about themovements of people. Now all of those could be very directly anddisagreeably affected by climactic change,'' Tickell said.   Tickell is a key adviser on environmental affairs to PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and is author of a book on the effectsof climactic change on international relations.</TEXT></DOC>
