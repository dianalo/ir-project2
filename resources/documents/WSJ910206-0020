Hughes   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/06/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><LP>   While Susan Cross was director of employee assistance forthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, she foundherself feeling resentful when one of her employees becamepregnant. &quot;I didn't have a child,&quot; she recalls, &quot;and some ofit came from my own feelings that I would like to.&quot;   Then, at the age of 40, Ms. Cross became pregnant andfound that she was the target of some resentment herself.Several co-workers were unhappy, she says, when her doctorordered her to stay in bed for five months before herdelivery. &quot;The people who didn't seem to be as tolerant werethe people who didn't have children,&quot; she recalls.&quot;Resentment came in the form of `we think you should be doingmore.'&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nowadays, more executives are confronting the question ofhow to deal with pregnant professionals. The rate ofchildbirth increased 25% among women over 30 in professionaland managerial positions between 1983 and 1988, the mostrecent period for which Census Bureau statistics areavailable.   Federal law makes it illegal to discriminate on the basisof pregnancy, but lawyers say that many women are stillfired, demoted or denied benefits solely on the basis oftheir pregnancies. More often, pregnant women face subtlediscrimination as attitudes toward them shift. Some say theyare punished with less important work assignments, and othersworry that they will be penalized. Colleagues and co-workersoften become resentful or condescending and frequently behaveawkwardly.   Susan Cross, a lawyer at First Interstate Bancorp. in LosAngeles (she isn't related to the consultant with the samename), says that a male client became &quot;even more patronizing&quot;when she became pregnant last year. He began to apologize forswearing; then he started questioning her competence. A maleco-worker asked her if she would be able to walk to a nearbymeeting. &quot;Hey, I try to walk two miles a day for exercise,&quot;she snapped. &quot;I can certainly walk to this meeting.&quot;   A pregnant executive may also be patted at any moment.Robin Piccone, president of Piccone Apparel Corp. in LosAngeles, was six months pregnant when she showed hercompany's Body Glove swimwear line to store buyers. One malebuyer reached out to rub her stomach good-bye. &quot;I blushed 90shades of red,&quot; says Ms. Piccone. &quot;I hadn't experienced thatbefore in a dead-serious business situation.&quot;   &quot;The real problem is that all of our professions have beendeveloped around a male model so there is still somethingabnormal about a pregnant professional,&quot; says Ruth Hubbard, arecently retired professor of biology at Harvard University.   The biggest fear among many employers is that aonce-assertive woman executive will ease up on the job, thentake paid maternity leave and never return. Co-workers oftenworry that they will be forced to pick up the slack. In fact,a recent study by Rand Corp. found that only 50% of women whowork during pregnancy return to the work force within threemonths of having their first child. Of those, 75% return tothe same job. The study doesn't differentiate betweenclerical and executive levels, though.   Reactions toward new motherhood often reflect co-workers'own attitudes toward children and family life. &quot;There issomething about motherhood that makes the woman herself andothers feel she is less important,&quot; says Hildy Grossman,co-editor of a new book, &quot;Experience and Meaning of Work inWomen's Lives.&quot; She adds: &quot;Motherhood isn't a powerfulposition.&quot;   An executive who becomes pregnant within a year of beinghired is particularly likely to encounter resentment. AmySemmel, a lawyer, left a large firm because she wanted tohave children and thought it would be difficult to balancework and family. She joined a smaller firm, telling thepartners during her interviews that she planned to havechildren and then work part time. &quot;They assured me that wouldbe fine,&quot; she recalls.   She became pregnant after six months, sooner than she hadanticipated. &quot;The firm got very upset. I think they feltcheated,&quot; she says. Ms. Semmel had been working on a big casebut soon was relegated to more menial work, reviewingdocuments and writing memos. &quot;At my level, I felt that wasunfair,&quot; she says.   Before her maternity leave, Ms. Semmel says she tried tohold the firm to its promise of part-time work when shereturned. The partners declined. &quot;They were required to takeme back full time by law but, in effect, they were sayingdon't come back,&quot; says Ms. Semmel. &quot;There was an attitude of,`We don't spend time with our families; why should you?'&quot; Ms.Semmel has since found a job with another firm.   When a new employee becomes pregnant quickly, someemployers suspect that she joined the company mainly formaternity benefits. Eli Broad, chairman of Broad Inc., a LosAngeles financial services company, recalls a free-lancer whojoined the company's public relations department full-time,soon became pregnant and quit. &quot;It was annoying,&quot; recalls Mr.Broad. &quot;As soon as she became eligible for the benefits shegot pregnant.&quot;   Mr. Broad hastens to add that several senior executiveshave worked successfully through pregnancies and returnedwith good results. &quot;It is a disruption. But you make do andlook forward to them coming back.&quot;   Fear of a negative reaction leads many women to delaytelling their bosses they're pregnant. Many worry they willlose business or miss a promotion or a pay increase. Indeed,a study by the State University of New York, Albany, showsthat 35% of the respondents knew someone who had delayedpregnancy because of fears about how they would be treated.   The fear may be justified. Diane Krouse, a senior vicepresident at the Los Angeles office of D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp;Bowles, a New York-based advertising agency, says she knowsof an advertising industry executive who was scheduled toreceive a pay increase that was postponed after she announcedher pregnancy. The executive did receive the raise when shereturned from maternity leave.   Keeping a pregnancy secret for a while isn't easy. KirbyVeevers, the owner of Veevers Associates, a New Yorkmarketing and public relations company, managed to concealher pregnancy for six months. She wore jackets with scarvesand big earrings to divert attention. &quot;My worst fears werethat my work would be undermined and my clients wouldn't seea future in me or the company,&quot; she says.   When she did tell her clients, one asked how her pregnancywould affect his company's account. To reassure him andothers, Ms. Veevers says she scheduled an unusually highnumber of publicity events for the period when she expectedto be tied up with the baby. &quot;If I hadn't overwhelmed themwith activities, they would have said, `Kirby is having ababy. Why should we send her a check?'&quot;   Some women say telling the boss is easier the second timearound, assuming the first pregnancy hasn't interfered withtheir work. Ms. Krouse, the advertising executive, says thatwhen she was pregnant with her first child five years ago,she received &quot;a much more dramatic reaction&quot; than she did thesecond time. &quot;With the first, there was a lot of concern thatI wouldn't come back; I couldn't offer enough reassurance,&quot;she recalls.   Reactions tend to be more positive in corporate cultureswhere senior executives have children. Melissa Bachrach, asenior vice president of production at News Corp.'s TwentiethCentury Fox unit, worried when she became pregnant last yearbecause few senior female executives in the industry havechildren. &quot;A lot of women give their lives to the moviebusiness,&quot; she says. But Roger Birnbaum, president ofworld-wide production, insists he wasn't worried at all. &quot;Ihave a four-year-old daughter and I know how great it is,&quot; hesays. &quot;Melissa was a team player who was benched for a while.Her performance didn't change at all.&quot;   Pregnancy can even be a plus in some troubled professionalrelationships. Some men seem to warm up for the first timewhen an assertive colleague becomes pregnant. Ms. Krouse saysa senior-level ad client went from being threatened to beingwarm and accepting after finding out she was pregnant. &quot;Hehad a traditional wife,&quot; she says. &quot;Suddenly I was female ina way that he was familiar with.&quot;   ---             Pregnant Women in the Work Force   -- 71% of all women who become pregnant are working at thetime.   -- 38% are in the work force by the time their childrenare three months old.   -- 58% are working by the time their children reach oneyear of age.
