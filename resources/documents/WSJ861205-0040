According to a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 64% of Americans don't believe Mr. Reagan is as fully in charge of his administration as he should be. And, surprisingly, more people approve of the way Jimmy Carter handled Iran than approve of Mr. Reagan's performance.    But the damage isn't irreparable: nearly half of Americans aren't yet willing to blame the president personally for the situation. If he is to regain his lost stature, according to the poll and to a dozen Toledoans who gathered to discuss the issue at the Journal's request, here is what he must do:    --Explain much more fully what happened in the Iran and Nicaragua operations, and his own role in them. Fully 86% disbelieve the administration's claim that high-level officials didn't know what was happening; only 4% believe it. On both the Iranian arms shipments and the funneling of money to the Contras, more than 90% of Americans believe that important parts of the story haven't yet been told. &quot;The only thing I think he could do is stop trying to cover everything up. Just come out and admit it, instead of having a potential Watergate, because it makes him look bad,&quot; concludes Joseph Beham, a 25-year-old tax accountant in nearby Maumee, Ohio, who voted for the president.    --Shake up his staff. Many Americans believe the president has been ill-served by his aides throughout the affair. White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, in particular, comes in for harsh criticism. Forty-eight percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Regan, while only 23% view him favorably; 56% either believe he should resign or aren't sure. By contrast, Americans by a 53%-to-23% margin view Secretary of State George Shultz favorably, and only 37% believe he should resign or aren't sure.    --Demonstrate that he's in firm control of his own policy and administration. &quot;I think it's worse not to have known&quot; about the operations, says Susan Chinni, a 36-year-old secretary. &quot;Then he seems like a puppet president.&quot; Half of Americans believe he doesn't pay enough attention to major policy issues.    Mrs. Golub, Mrs. Chinni, Mr. Beham and their nine neighbors braved a sleet storm here earlier this week to discuss the president's handling of the Iran scandal. Their two-hour discussion group was convened for The Wall Street Journal by Will Feltus of Market Opinion Research Corp. to help amplify the results of the nationwide Journal/NBC poll. The nationwide survey of 1,596 adults was conducted Monday and Tuesday, just as President Reagan was endorsing calls for an independent prosecutor in the case and before Vice President Bush's speech on the controversy.    As they talk about Mr. Reagan's handling of the Iranian and Nicaraguan situation, the middle Americans gathered here raise questions that strike at the core of Mr. Reagan's success as president. &quot;These people have some doubts about his leadership abilities and his strength, which have always been his strongest qualities,&quot; concludes Mr. Feltus, whose firm often polls for Republican candidates. &quot;Some in the group doubt his honesty and his candor.&quot; In the national poll, Americans were almost evenly split on whether the president told the truth about his knowledge of the diversion of funds to the Contras.    Only 17% of Americans believe Mr. Reagan is doing an excellent or good job handling U.S. relations with Iran, while 73% believe he is doing only a fair or poor job. By contrast, 30% now say former President Carter did an excellent or good job on Iran, while 65% said his performance was only fair or poor.    Mr. Reagan's poor marks could still change as the result of swiftly moving events. Still, his favorable approval ratings over the past three years had remained largely steady through other controversies, indicating that the current crisis could mark a profound change in the way Americans view him. Only 50% now give him favorable marks on his handling of the presidency, down from 61% in October; 48% give him unfavorable marks, up from 38%. Two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, now rate him unfavorably on handling foreign affairs.    Sixty-one percent of Americans believe the situation poses a major problem for the president, while 33% say it has been exaggerated. Here in Toledo, however, the folks in the discussion group are still more concerned about plant closings and jobs. They aren't willing to give up on Mr. Reagan; indeed, they want to give him the benefit of the doubt and believe his motives were good.    &quot;I think he did the right thing by trying to make Iran our friends again,&quot; says Herbert Swartzlander Jr., a 29-year-old Toledo auto-engine rebuilder. If the U.S. hostages had been released and relations with Iran improved because of the U.S. arms shipments there, &quot;he'd have been a hero,&quot; says Gary Long, a 30-year-old heating maintenance worker.    &quot;These Americans may not think that he is fully responsible for causing this problem, but they are holding him fully responsible for getting it under control,&quot; Mr. Feltus suggests. &quot;People haven't yet been convinced that he has gotten control of the problem.&quot;    Mr. Reagan has defended himself during the controversy by saying that he wasn't told about crucial aspects of the operation, including the fact that profits from the Iranian arms sales were diverted to aid the anti-Marxist Nicaraguan Contras. But that defense bothers these Toledoans. &quot;It does scare me a little to have a president who's not fully in control,&quot; says Reagan admirer Ronald Rains, a 21-year-old student at the University of Toledo. &quot;If he had the proper control and leadership, his people would have known how far they could go and how far they shouldn't go.&quot; Carol Hartsel, 38, a homemaker whose husband is a welder, agrees. &quot;We expect more of our president. . . . We expect him to be in control of the situation,&quot; she says.    Along with the doubts about Mr. Reagan, public doubts have grown about Vice President Bush. According to the nationwide Journal/NBC poll, 63% of Americans either have an unfavorable opinion of him or say they aren't sure, up from 49% in October; the number of people uncertain about him has more than doubled. &quot;I assume Reagan knew, so I would assume that most probably&quot; the vice president did too, Mr. Beham says in the Toledo discussion group. But most other participants here reserve judgment, saying they have little sense of Mr. Bush's role in the administration on any issue.    According to the nationwide poll, a plurality of Americans believe the president's staff is most responsible for the Iran-Nicaragua situation. Nearly half of those surveyed said his aides are primarily to blame, while 23% blame the president and 18% volunteered that he and the staff share the responsibility. The president &quot;will delegate everything and go off and take a nap,&quot; Steven McConaughy, a 38-year-old financial adviser, says in the Toledo group. &quot;As a result, there are lots of non-elected, appointed officials . . . running foreign policy and who knows what else.&quot;    Several Toledoans single out Chief of Staff Regan as a problem. &quot;I want to have a guy who's in tune with the general populace,&quot; says Mr. Rains, who is concerned that the chief of staff has isolated the president. &quot;He's the pressure valve. He wants to hear what he wants and shut them off when he doesn't want to hear it.&quot;    If President Reagan takes strong steps now to get the facts out and distance himself from any aides associated with the policy, he may win back the public's confidence, Mr. Feltus concludes. &quot;Even people that are critical of Reagan want to see the president get this behind him,&quot; he says.    But some of the Toledoans see irony in Mr. Reagan's Iran crisis, because he came into office criticizing his predecessor's dealings with the same regime. &quot;He was very critical of the administration before him, on the hostages. Now he soft-soaps that,&quot; concludes Mrs. Chinni. &quot;He's doing some of the same things.&quot;    ---   'What kind of a job do you think Ronald Reagan is doing in handling American relations with Iran? What kind of a job do you think Jimmy Carter did in handling American relations with Iran?'
