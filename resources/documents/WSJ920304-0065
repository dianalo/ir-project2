In late trading in Toronto, the Canadian dollar was quotedat 83.90 U.S. cents, down from 84.24 U.S. cents late Mondayand down more than 5.25 U.S. cents from early November.</LP><TEXT>   Currency analysts attributed the decline to concern overthe possible failure of efforts to reach a constitutionalsettlement that will keep Quebec within Canada. Quebecintends to hold a referendum on independence by October ifthe rest of the nation doesn't come up with an acceptableconstitutional offer.   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa warned yesterday that thelatest federal plan, drafted by the three major federalpolitical parties, failed to meet Quebec's demand for morepowers.   The Bank of Canada intervened in the currency market toslow the Canadian dollar's decline by buying Canadian dollarsand selling U.S. dollars.   Financial markets &quot;clearly are focused on theconstitution,&quot; said Gerard MacDonell, a Royal Bank of Canadaeconomist. He said that if the Canadian dollar were todecline further, it would jeopardize the Bank of Canada'schances of achieving its inflation-reduction goals.   This year's goal is to limit the rise in the consumerprice index to 3%.   Marc Vandal, Bank of Montreal's foreign exchange director,said the constitutional uncertainties could drive theCanadian dollar down to 83 U.S. cents in the next few days.But, he said, the Canadian dollar could later recover atleast some of its lost ground because of Canada'scomparatively good inflation performance.   Meanwhile, encouraging economic news reinforced bullishsentiment toward the U.S. dollar and sent it barreling past apsychological barrier against the yen.   Late in New York, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 131.07yen, up 1.1% from 129.65 yen late Monday and well beyond the130-yen level that capped its movements in recent days.   The U.S. currency also was quoted at 1.6570 marks, justshy of a 1% gain from 1.6435 marks late Monday. Sterling wastrading at $1.7380, down from $1.7535.   In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was at130.95 yen, up from 129.94 yen at Tuesday's Tokyo close. TheU.S. currency also was trading at 1.6585 marks, up from1.6462 marks Tuesday.   The U.S. dollar, which enjoyed heavy buying overseas earlyyesterday following Monday's report of an unexpectedly strongincrease in the National Association of Purchasing Managmentindex for February, got a further boost from gains in theU.S. index of leading indicators and new home sales.   U.S. data released so far this week &quot;are as good-lookingfor the economy as anything we've seen,&quot; said Dennis Pettit,a vice president and foreign-exchange manager in New York forLong-Term Credit Bank of Japan.   The index of leading indicators rose a surprising 0.9% inJanuary, following a revised decline of 0.2% in December. TheDecember drop was previously estimated at 0.3%. Analystssurveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report were looking, onaverage, for an increase of 0.5%.   The U.S. dollar also drew support from a 12.9% increase innew single-family home sales in January, compared with arevised 4.6% decline in the previous month. December'sdecline in home sales was originally reported at 6.6%.   The leading indicators and home sales data, taken togetherwith the improvement in the purchasers' index, provided&quot;tangible signs that {the U.S.} recovery is on track,&quot; saidEarl I. Johnson, a vice president for Harris Trust andamp; SavingsBank in Chicago.   The U.S. dollar cracked 130 yen despite rumors thatJapan's Finance Ministry was considering sales of marks foryen as a means of correcting Japan's trade imbalances. Ifbuying interest in the U.S. currency is sustained above 131yen, traders and analysts said a rise to 132.5 yen could comerapidly.   Although yesterday's economic data buttressed bullishnesstowards the U.S. dollar, players failed to challenge acrucial resistance point at 1.665 marks. Two rallies in theU.S. currency last week halted at 1.666 marks, where buyinginterest dried up.   The U.S. dollar spent most of the session hovering justbelow 1.66 marks, and a late drive to a session high at1.6622 marks was &quot;a little forced,&quot; said Mr. Pettit, notingthe thin market volume.   Observers aren't certain whether the U.S. dollar will test1.665 marks ahead of Friday's scheduled release of U.S.unemployment and nonfarm payrolls data for February. Theysaid many major players remain sidelined, unconvinced thatthe U.S. economy is recovering without sure signs ofimprovement in employment.</TEXT></DOC>
