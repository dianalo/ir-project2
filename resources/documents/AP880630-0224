North forfiling ``increasingly disrespectful'' pleadings with the judge inthe case.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh challenged North's requestto U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell that the judge reconsiderhis ruling that congressional immunity given three defendants inthe case does not compromise the case.   North's ``motion merely reflects the defendant's continuedfrustration at this failure to force the court to afford him a fullpretrial ... hearing to which he is not entitled,'' Walsh said in aone-page reply to North's motion.   ``Apart from their increasingly disrespectful tone, thepleadings raise no additional issues that have not already beenfully briefed by the parties,'' Walsh said.   In their motion filed Monday, North's lawyers said theprocedures and reasoning that Gesell used to reach his decisionabout the immunity issue ``are most notable for theirarbitrariness, their superficiality and their unprecedented denialof due process.''   A failure to reconsider the ruling ``would signal to the defenseand the nation the fundamental unfairness of this proceeding, andthe court's single-minded goal of overcoming or ignoring theextraordinary legal and factual obstacles to trial of this case,''the defense said in its brief.   Gesell ruled last month that the immunity Congress gave North,former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealerAlbert Hakim did not prevent them from being tried on Iran-Contraconspiracy charges.   The three are charged along with Hakim's former partner, retiredMaj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, of conspiring to illegally divertU.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   The judge ordered four separate trials to deal with the problemsimposed by the congressional immunity and said he would deferfurther consideration of the issue until the conclusion of eachproceeding.</TEXT></DOC>
