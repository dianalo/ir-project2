The pigment, heme, is what gives blood itsred color.;    Many substances can have strong effects in experiments but novalue in humans. It was not clear when, if ever, heme would be tested inpeople.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RED BLOOD CELLS' PIGMENT OFFERS HOPE FORAIDS TREATMENT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But, if similar effects are found in tests of heme in people with AIDS, theuse of heme alone or combined with AZT might reduce the amount of AZT neededto slow AIDS and prevent adverse reactions to the medication, the researchersreported Thursday in the journal, The Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences.;    AZT, or azidothymidine, can produce anemia and bleeding. Manypatients who take it need blood transfusions.;    Heme might help people inwhom AIDS has developed resistance to AZT, said the researchers, from New YorkMedical College in Valhalla and Rockefeller University in New York City.;   Heme is the iron-containing pigment in hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying proteinin red blood cells. Because it is known to play an important role in formingblood cells from bone marrow, researchers said trials might show that heme hasrestorative value among people whose blood systems have been damaged by AIDS.;   Doctors use heme to treat a rare metabolic disorder, porphyria. But becauseheme can be toxic, the researchers are exploring the possibility of usingsynthetic and less toxic types of heme, metalloporphyrins, said Dr. Richard D.Levere, senior author of the report.;    Levere is chairman of the medicinedepartment at New York Medical College and one of the few scientists in hemeresearch.;    Some forms of synthetic heme are used experimentally in thetreatment of jaundice of newborns in this country, Levere said. He said histeam will look into the possibility of using a form of heme manufactured inFinland.;    In the study, researchers isolated the virus that causes acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome from two people with the disease. They theninfected white blood cells with each strain of the AIDS virus. One strain ofthe virus was sensitive to AZT; the other had developed resistance to it.Next, the scientists added either AZT, heme, or both substances to theinfected white blood cells.;    Heme alone substantially slowed the growth ofthe drug sensitive strain but did not change the way AZT interferes with theAIDS virus when given concurrently with the drug.;    Heme alone and AZT alonefailed to slow the growth of the resistant strain of the AIDS virus. Yet acombination of the two almost completely stopped the strain. The researcherssaid they were puzzled about how heme produced its effect on the AIDS virusand on the action of AZT.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910303  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  466  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 3, 199100063133,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
