RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Pennsylvania Republican Chairman RobertB. Asher failed today in a Supreme Court attempt to overturn hisconviction for mail fraud and other bribery-related charges.   The court, without comment, let stand Asher's conviction, prisonsentence of a year and a day and $205,000 fine.   The case received national attention when Asher's co-defendant,former Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer, 47, fatally shothimself at a news conference Jan. 22, 1987, the day before he was tobe sentenced.   Dwyer said he was innocent, accused the federal prosecutor offraming him and then stuck the barrel of a handgun in his mouth andpulled the trigger.   Asher, a Montgomery County candymaker, and Dwyer were convictedin federal court in December 1986 of mail fraud, perjury, conspiracyto commit bribery and interstate transportation in aid ofracketeering.   They were charged with arranging the award of a state contract toComputer Technology Associates (CTA), a California company thathelps employers recover excess Social Security taxes paid to thefederal government.   Prosecutors said Asher, Dwyer and two company officials, WilliamT. Smith Jr. and John R. Torquato Jr., took part in the briberyscheme.   Torquato, who cooperated with the prosecution, testified that heagreed to pay $300,000 to be divided equally between Dwyer, Dwyer'sre-election campaign and the Republican State Committee in returnfor a $5 million state contract for his company.   CTA was awarded the contract in 1984, with the state rejecting alower bid from Arthur Young Inc., a nationally known accounting firm.   Smith, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Asher's convictionlast July, rejecting his claim that he was tried improperly under afederal mail fraud law.   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that the anti-fraud law could notbe used to charge officials with depriving the public of itsintangible right to honest government. The court said there must bea charge that the state lost something of material value.   The 3rd Circuit court said the indictment against Asher and theothers did allege a material loss since the state could have savedthe taxpayers money by awarding the contract to Arthur Young Inc.   The appeals court said even though the indictment against Asherspoke of intangible rights, the conviction must stand because therealso was a material loss.   Justice Department lawyers, urging the Supreme Court to rejectAsher's appeal, noted that Congress in 1988 amended federalanti-fraud law to permit indictments based solely on a deprivationof intangible rights. The amendments, in effect, reversed the 1987high court ruling for future government corruption cases.   The 3rd Circuit court also rejected Asher's argument that he wascharged mistakenly as a ``public official'' rather than as aRepublican Party official.   The case is Asher vs. U.S., 88-532.</TEXT></DOC>
