Mr. Lee, president of Four Seasons Realty Inc., foresaw that Taiwan would lift restrictions on investing abroad. Last April, he opened a spacious new office in Taipei to advise Taiwanese on buying property abroad. He has also sent a team of staffers to Texas and California, where many Taiwanese live, to draw up a list of target shops and apartments for Four Seasons clients.    After 38 years of restricting foreign investment, Taiwan is preparing to recycle its riches abroad. As of Wednesday, prior approval from Taiwan's Central Bank of China will no longer be necessary for investors wanting to buy anything from a house to a supermarket overseas -- providing they don't spend more than $5 million in any one year. (If they exceed that figure, they will need approval.)    Chen Chi-chu, a senior vice president of International Commercial Bank of China, estimates that as much as $10 billion could pour out of Taiwan into the U.S. alone over the next year. &quot;The outflow will be appreciable,&quot; Mr. Chen says. &quot;Compared with Japan, it will only be a drop in the bucket, but the drop will be significant.&quot;    The government is hoping the easing of the rules will help shrink its $60 billion-plus foreign-reserve mountain. But even the $10 billion exodus forecast by Mr. Chen would be more than offset by the inflow of around $1.5 billion a month from the nation's trade surplus.    The policy liberalization couldn't have been better timed. The stabilization in recent weeks of the Taiwan dollar, which has appreciated 22% against the U.S. dollar in the past two years, reduces the risk of foreign-exchange losses in shifting funds overseas. And stockbrokers say the lackluster performance of Taiwan's stock market might prompt investors to look outside the country.    The U.S. is Taiwan's major trading partner and is expected to be the main beneficiary of the lifting of capital curbs. Cathay Life Insurance Co., for example, is planning to place 5%, or $129 million, of its assets in America's capital markets. The concern is also being wooed by Japanese investment houses.    But bankers say they don't expect a rush of funds out of Taiwan. For one thing, the government-controlled local banks are extremely conservative and are likely to be slow to test the new waters. &quot;Unless the banks are privatized and are more efficiently managed, foreign-investment business from them won't be substantial,&quot; says a foreign-bond trader.    Individual investors are expected to show similar caution. &quot;The rich guys have already invested their money abroad through underground channels and those who haven't will need time to become familiar with the foreign markets,&quot; says Frank Lin, an executive with Japan's Daiwa Securities Co.    Charles Huang, president of Summit Consulting Group Inc. that advises small and medium-sized companies, agrees. &quot;Taiwan has been living through decades of the Dark Ages in corporate finances and it's difficult to recover overnight,&quot; he says.    Tax dodging could also restrain investment abroad. Mr. Huang says some companies are worried that if they start spending millions of dollars on foreign bonds and stocks, they will bring the tax collector to their doorstep.    But the biggest obstacle facing Taiwan investors is the limited number of channels through which the public can buy foreign shares and mutual funds. Anyone can place orders freely with a broker abroad and remit the payment to his account overseas. But those who don't have an overseas account can only subscribe to trust funds, which are being set up by five approved banks. The trust funds will specialize in investing in foreign stocks.    Companies such as Daiwa Securities and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. are seeking ways to sell their mutual-fund instruments in Taiwan. Investment bankers doubt they will be allowed to market these directly to individuals. Instead, they will probably have to do their selling through the five approved banks.    &quot;In the process of liberalization, the government is seeing to it that the local financial institutions are protected,&quot; says an investment banker. Another banker adds: &quot;Investors are likely to pay a premium&quot; because of the double layer of management involved.    There's no doubting, however, that the financial changes have generated a lot of excitement in Taiwan's investment community. &quot;My clients were excited by the news and some called up to see if we can move faster on the deals,&quot; says an investment banker. Another banker shows little concern about the $5 million ceiling on investments that can be made without central bank approval. &quot;The potential investor can conduct a head count in his office and he can come up with a pretty sizable amount,&quot; the banker says. </TEXT></DOC>
