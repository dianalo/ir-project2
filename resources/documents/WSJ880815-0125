Now they are suing them -- in record numbers. The average lawyer starting practice today will be the target of at least three malpractice claims during his career, according to legal malpractice specialist Ronald Mallen. The lawyer, or most likely his insurance company, will have to pay some money to the plaintiff in about one out of three cases, Mr. Mallen says.    The San Francisco lawyer was in big demand at the American Bar Association Convention in Toronto last week, where he spoke on two of the four panels that dealt with some aspect of the legal-malpractice phenomenon.    It's no wonder that lawyers are becoming obsessed with the issue. Law firms now pay between $2,000 and $7,000 per lawyer for legal-malpractice insurance, and the size of malpractice settlements is skyrocketing. The average settlement has risen threefold in the past five years, to about $85,000, and last week's $50 million settlement by the Philadelphia firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley is believed to be the largest ever.    To fight back, lawyers are devising ways to limit their risk. Malpractice specialists recommend that lawyers select clients carefully to avoid those most likely to turn around and sue them. They also suggest that lawyers stop sitting on boards of directors -- which often are named in suits against the corporation -- and avoid engaging in business deals with clients.    Lawyers Warned: Stay   Out of Clients' Business   MALPRACTICE fears may not be the only reason lawyers should reconsider acting as directors of their clients' companies or investing in their enterprises. New York corporate attorney Dennis J. Block believes that a lawyer's ability to provide independent legal advice is also at stake.    Mr. Block shook things up at the generally languid annual lawyers' convention by arguing in a report that getting involved in clients' businesses threatens the &quot;professionalism of our profession&quot; and should be barred by the ABA code of ethics.    &quot;We should appear to be totally aloof from client interests,&quot; says Mr. Block, a partner at Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges. &quot;There is too much room for conflicts of interest if we are involved in our clients' businesses.&quot;    But the ABA isn't likely to adopt Mr. Block's position, which would probably have an adverse impact on lawyers' incomes and influence. In a recent debate, Mr. Block &quot;got dumped on,&quot; as he puts it, by fellow lawyers.    Although a lawyer's judgment could be affected by business relationships with clients, decisions on these matters &quot;should be left to the lawyer and his law firm,&quot; says Kenneth Bialkin, a partner at the New York firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom. Of course, Mr. Bialkin says, &quot;I myself probably wouldn't choose to engage in most of these types of activities.&quot;    Help for Women   Who Have AIDS   PEOPLE WHO RUN hospitals generally prefer to see as little of lawyers as possible. For them, lawyers usually mean a malpractice suit.    But the AIDS crisis may be causing attitudes to shift. Recognizing the unique legal problems faced by women with AIDS -- many of whom are heads of single-parent households -- Bronx, N.Y.-based Montefiore Medical Center has asked the New York Legal Aid Society to provide legal assistance to such patients.    Once private funding for the program is completed, many of the 1,000 attorneys who do volunteer work for Legal Aid will be called upon to help female AIDS patients prepare wills, arrange for guardianship of their children and keep apartments for their families after they die.    Attorneys from many of New York's largest law firms will be involved, says David W. Weschler, director of Legal Aid's volunteer division. &quot;It's a ground-breaking idea because hospitals don't usually invite lawyers in,&quot; he adds.    Only one other public hospital is believed to have a similar program. Volunteers of Legal Service, a public-interest law organization, has teamed up with St. Clare's Hospital andamp; Health Center in New York to provide free legal assistance to AIDS patients.    Doctors and medical experts praise the efforts of these organizations. But many say that such programs aren't likely to be adopted by the majority of hospitals that treat AIDS patients. &quot;It's a wonderful idea,&quot; says Kirk Johnson, general counsel of the American Medical Association. &quot;But it takes a lot of courage for a hospital to let lawyers run loose on the premises.&quot;    Odds and Ends   WHAT'S THE BEST law school in the country? Supreme Court justices conduct a tally of sorts each year when they select recent graduates to serve as their law clerks. The votes are in for the coming term, and the winner is -- Yale, which placed eight clerks at the high court. Archrival Harvard was second with seven . . . Current concerns of lawyers can be gleaned by the attention paid to various topics at the ABA convention. In addition to legal malpractice, this year's hot topics included dealing with the press, marketing one's legal practice, and managing one's law firm. And then there was the seminar entitled &quot;Loving your Spouse -- Even the Lawyer Spouse.&quot;. . . Although former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell Jr. made news by expressing doubts about the death penalty after endorsing it on the court, capital punishment was a topic about which the assembled lawyers showed next-to-no interest. One panel on the subject had to be cancelled because only three people showed up. </TEXT></DOC>
