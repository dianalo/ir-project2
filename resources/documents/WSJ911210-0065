The company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, wasthe major bidder at a federal government offering of drillingrights in the region, near Canada's border with Alaska.</LP><TEXT>   Shell received rights on 274,000 acres in exchange forcommitment to do at least 53.3 million Canadian dollars(US$46.9 million) of exploration over the next four years.Bids usually take the form of work commitments in federalofferings of drilling rights.   The offering involved 274,000 acres in the Mackenzie deltaarea and 346,000 acres in the Beaufort Sea, which is part ofthe Arctic Ocean.   Shell Canada's drilling plans are expected to rekindleexploration interest in the Mackenzie delta. No wells arebeing drilled at present either in the delta or the BeaufortSea. Interest in the area has waned in recent years becauseof high drilling and development costs.   Roger Brundrit, Shell Canada's vice president ofexploration, said the company expects to drill as many as sixwells in the Mackenzie delta region over the next four years.He said a recent Shell Canada well in the region indicatedsignificant oil reserves. &quot;That regenerated our interest inwhat could be a viable oil play,&quot; he said.   Previously, most major finds in the delta involved gas.But none of the gas reserves has been developed because ofthe high cost of transporting it to southern markets.   Shell Canada intends to drill one well next month in theMackenzie delta on lands acquired in previous rightsofferings. It plans seismic work on its new lands early nextyear. Drilling on the new lands probably will start in 1993.   Mr. Brundrit said about 400 to 500 million barrels ofdiscovered oil reserves are needed before a pipeline would beviable from the delta to southern Canada. &quot;Two years ago wethought that was unlikely,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we think itspossible&quot;   The Geological Survey of Canada estimated that theMackenzie delta and Beaufort Sea contain between 6.2 and 7.8billion barrels of oil, of which about 24% has beendiscovered.   The largest oil discovery so far is the Amauligak field inthe Beaufort Sea. Amauligak was discovered by Gulf CanadaResources Ltd., a subsidiary of Olympia andamp; York DevelopmentsLtd., which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family.   Ian Doig, editor of Doig's Digest, an industry newsletter,said development of the Mackenzie delta and Beaufort Sea oilfinds remains several years away. &quot;I would be surprised tosee any crude out of there before the turn of the century,&quot;he said.   A group of companies led by the Canadian subsidiaries ofChevron Corp. and Amoco Corp. were awarded one concession inthe Canadian Beaufort Sea. The tract is near the Amauligakfield. The group has agreed to do C$3.2 million ofexploration work on the concession.   The offering yielded the largest amount ever bid forfrontier acreage. It was the first time in 25 years that theCanadian government offered rights in the delta. Previousofferings included only portions of the Beaufort Sea.   The Canadian government also announced plans for a callfor nominations in February. In a call for nominations,companies are asked to identify areas of interest forexploration. An offering of drilling rights usually follows acall for nominations. More than 18 million acres in theMackenzie Delta and the Beaufort Sea will be included in thecall for nominations.</TEXT></DOC>
