Barco introduced his peace plan on national television. He saidthe talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrillaorganizations.   Guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts, human rightsviolations, kidnappings and extortions before talks begin, Barcosaid. He said a peace agreement should be reached by the time ofthe next presidential and parliamentary elections, in March 1990.   Guerrillas firing automatic assault rifles, throwing handgrenades and setting fire to houses killed 12 peasants Tuesdaynight, Gov. Jose Gabriel Amin of the state of Cordoba said Thursday.   The guerrilla attacks appear to be an effort by the rebels toforce the government to open peace talks and make concessions.   An estimated 30 guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army setfire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near thetown of Canalete, Amin said.   Canalete is about 320 miles north of the capital of Bogota.   The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of El Tomate,setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor saidin a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain RCN.   In El Tomate, a village of 600 people, the attackers leftmessages painted on walls declaring, ``Death to the toads andparamilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN.   Guerrillas call army informants toads.   Peasants in Colombia have long claimed that they are caughtbetween the army and the guerrillas.   In dozens of interviews with The Associated Press, peasants havetold of being forced to sell food and other necessities toguerrillas.   Often the army hears of this and through threats or torture,soldiers force the peasants to tell of guerrilla movements, thepeasants say.   The guerrillas then return and kill the peasants, accusing themof being army informants, the peasants have said.   The People's Liberation Army and another guerrilla group knownas the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces attacked the town ofSaisa in the state of Cordoba on Aug. 23 and killed 12 civilians,10 soldiers and two policemen, the Defense Ministry said earlier.   Twenty-two soldiers and policemen were taken prisoner, theministry said.</TEXT></DOC>
