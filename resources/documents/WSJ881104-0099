Democrat Michael Dukakis pledges to &quot;transform the cycle of poverty&quot; -- yet although Walter Mondale stopped here in the 27th Ward in 1984, Mr. Dukakis hasn't responded to pleas of local Democratic leaders to visit.    This neighborhood, sitting just west of downtown, is a symbol of neglect and abandonment, both in daily life and in the presidential campaign. Its streets are marked by high-rise public housing with punched-out windows, abandoned hot-dog stands and imploded grocery stores. There are no banks for the ward's 60,000 residents, no bowling alleys or skating rinks to entertain its 20,000 children, no rehabilitation center despite rampant drug abuse. And shelter is inadequate for the ward's 1,000 homeless people.    The desperate problems of poor, predominantly black inner-city neighborhoods such as the 27th Ward would seem to be an urgent topic for debate in the presidential campaign. While much of the nation has prospered, the number of blacks with incomes 50% below the poverty line has climbed 69% in the past decade, according to one recent report. Among the poorest one-fifth of black families, many of them living in inner cities, inflation-adjusted income plunged 24% between 1978 and 1987.    Although both candidates insist that they are proposing plans to deal with urban problems, many inner-city residents and urban experts feel that those problems are being ignored.    &quot;If we don't do something to address the needs of the urban poor, then the core of our cities will die,&quot; says Frank Lomax, executive vice president of the National Urban League. But, he complains, &quot;neither candidate has come through with a clear message&quot; to the cities.    Certainly, residents of the 27th Ward feel alienated by the election campaign. Many think that increasingly oppressive inner-city problems have been neglected while both candidates race after the votes of the suburban middle class. This neighborhood, overwhelmingly Democratic, is virtually devoid of presidential posters or other signs of interest in the election. Indeed, the local Democratic leader couldn't even persuade the Dukakis campaign to send him a box of bumper stickers and buttons until two weeks ago.    &quot;The campaign just doesn't move us,&quot; says Mildred Wortham, a 34-year-old mother of two who lives in the hard-scrabble Rockwell Gardens housing project, where one young mother recently died of a cocaine overdose and a 13-year-old girl was stabbed and tossed from a seventh-floor window. Ms. Wortham usually votes, but she isn't sure she's going to bother on Tuesday.    Such feelings probably will hurt Mr. Dukakis more than Mr. Bush because Democrats have traditionally counted on big turnouts of urban voters to carry key states such as Illinois and New York. Both parties seem to have decided that in this election the crucial voters are middle-class Americans living outside the inner cities. Democratic pollster Peter Hart says political analysts determined that &quot;to be able to win states, there weren't enough votes in the major cities to do it.&quot;    Inner cities, in fact, have steadily lost the electoral clout that could draw politicians' attention. Here in Illinois, Chicago's share of the state's total votes for president fell to 25% in 1984 from 41% in 1952, according to the Elections Research Center in Washington.    Moreover, the federal budget deficit has blunted discussion of potentially expensive social programs for the poor, and proposals for urban spending risk alienating the suburban voters targeted by both campaigns. Mr. Bush's no-new-taxes pledge may block any plans he has for inner cities, and Mr. Dukakis pledges to be more austere than Democrats in the past.    &quot;Both candidates realize there's no money in the federal budget,&quot; says Gary Orfield, a University of Chicago political scientist, &quot;so no one's talking about the urban poor. It's very hard to do anything without disrupting the suburbanites and raising taxes.&quot; Others suggest that another reason candidates may be reluctant to discuss new urban proposals is that so many programs tried in the past have failed despite enormous expenditures of money, and until recently research into new solutions to urban ills has been scarce.    The two candidates point to several proposals they say would help inner-city residents. The Bush campaign &quot;has been extraordinarily specific in coming forward with proposals that go beyond the political rhetoric,&quot; maintains spokesman Mark Goodin. Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan insists that &quot;we didn't take any group for granted&quot; and that Mr. Dukakis's discussion of &quot;kitchen-table&quot; issues of concern to the poor has been obscured by the Bush campaign's attacks on other issues.    Mr. Bush has offered a child-care program that gives refundable tax credits to the poor; $500 million in annual awards to schools with disadvantaged students; and increased funding of Head Start programs for poor pre-schoolers. He also has proposed a youth-service plan in which suburban teen-agers would travel to the inner cities to help the disadvantaged.    Mr. Dukakis has proposed expanding Medicaid services for poor mothers and children; backed a $2.5 billion child-care bill and increases in Head Start; proposed a job-training program for welfare recipients; and suggested public-private &quot;partnerships&quot; to build low-income housing.    In addition, both candidates have offered detailed plans to curb drug abuse. Mr. Bush calls for tougher criminal penalties, including the death penalty for drug pushers convicted of murder. Mr. Dukakis calls for more aid to local police forces and more drug-rehabilitation centers.    But to residents here in the 27th Ward and to many social scientists, such proposals seem too modest or unrealistic.    Ask Donald Moran, the principal of Ulysses S. Grant Elementary School in the heart of the 27th Ward, for his reaction to Mr. Bush's proposal to bring young suburban volunteers into the inner cities, and he laughs. &quot;It tells me how little our politicians understand the real problems of people who live in neighborhoods like this,&quot; he says. Suburban teens couldn't deal with the social and economic problems, he says, and &quot;they wouldn't be accepted.&quot; Besides, he adds, &quot;not too many cab drivers would take them out here.&quot;    Similarly, for all the attention both candidates are paying to education, Mr. Moran doesn't see any evidence that their programs would address the kinds of problems afflicting schools such as his.    At the start of the Reagan administration, the school had a full-time nurse and two full-time counselors and one half-time counselor. But reductions in aid since then have forced cutbacks. Today, the school has just one counselor and no full-time nurse or social worker -- for children who seldom receive any other medical care.    Critics find similar flaws in the candidates' housing proposals. A private, national task force formed recently to study the need for low- and moderate-income housing has called for $3 billion in the first year of a five-year plan to build new housing. But while Mr. Dukakis embraces the task force's findings, he proposes spending at a much slower rate.    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, emphasizes giving the poor vouchers to pay for housing of their choice rather than building big new public-housing projects. But critics say that whether or not such vouchers eventually would stimulate construction, the current problem is a lack of available housing for which the vouchers could be used. Here in Chicago, there are 140,000 legal residents in public-housing units, but an estimated 60,000 more are illegally doubling up with legal residents.    Many of the unwed mothers here in the 27th Ward need day care if they are to get jobs. Currently, there is a waiting list of 60 at the day-care center run by Marillac House, a local social-services center, and the average national wait for unsubsidized child care is 18 weeks, according to a U.S. Conference of Mayors survey of 52 cities.    But Mr. Bush's child-care tax credit would help only those who file tax returns -- something most of the unwed mothers living in these housing projects and surviving on $342 monthly in welfare payments (for two children) don't bother with. And although Mr. Dukakis has endorsed a $2.5 billion plan that provides more direct child care, he doesn't embrace the full price tag.    The candidates also face calls from many big-city mayors to be more specific about their plans to fight drugs. In Houston, drug-related crime has so mushroomed that over the past six years the city has quadrupled, to $9.3 million a year, the law-enforcement dollars used to fight narcotics. But it got just $500,000 in aid for the police from the much-ballyhooed Drug Act of 1986.    Americans may be more willing to spend money on urban problems than many politicians seem to think. In a recent survey by the National Opinion Research Center, 54% said the nation was spending too little on big-city problems. &quot;The middle class isn't as greedy and selfish as the campaigns believe they are,&quot; says Prof. Orfield of the University of Chicago.    Yet after an election campaign aimed at &quot;the hearts and the minds of the middle class, there won't be any mandate coming out of this election to support new initiatives for the poor,&quot; says Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.    Regardless of specific programs they have presented, a more basic problem for the two candidates is that they seem to have failed to get a message of concern through to inner-city residents. That seems clear in a quick tour of the 27th Ward.    Reagan-era budget cuts have had some devastating effects in this neighborhood. Job-training programs here have closed down, taking away funds and potential jobs, complains Rickey Hendon, the local Democratic committeeman. Two neighborhood hospitals have closed in the past year, and businesses that are still open are limping along. Yet the problems under a Republican administration haven't produced much enthusiasm for the Democratic presidential candidate.    Mr. Hendon notes the lack of excitement as he campaigns door to door for Mr. Dukakis in the Henry Horner public-housing complex one afternoon.    Mr. Hendon starts by bounding energetically into the lobby of a project building where a nine-year-old boy, caught in the crossfire of a domestic argument last summer, was shot in the neck. On the way in, Mr. Hendon passes one sullen young man who refuses to shake his hand or say whether he intends to vote.    His first stop is at the apartment of Annie Green, a middle-aged woman who cracks her door and agrees that she's likely to vote Democratic. Her concerns are purely local. &quot;The dope around here, it's a serious problem,&quot; she says.    His next stop is at the apartment of Arlene Jones, a single mother with three children who is on welfare. &quot;Who's Dukakis?&quot; she asks. Mr. Hendon seems to convince her that the Democratic nominee deserves her vote, then hands her four Dukakis buttons for herself and her children.    As he walks away, Ms. Jones reemerges from her apartment and shouts: &quot;He's gonna be better than Bush, right?&quot; Mr. Hendon shakes his head and whispers that Mr. Dukakis &quot;hasn't gotten the message through himself.&quot;    Perhaps because the candidates have failed to ignite excitement, getting the residents of Ward 27 to register to vote has been harder than expected. The nuns operating Marillac House, the social-service center, held a registration day recently but signed up just 45 voters, down from the 150 usually registered before elections. And a drive by Mr. Hendon registered 4,000 voters, below his goal of 5,000 to 7,000.    Moreover, some local black leaders have urged people to &quot;go fishing&quot; on Election Day.    But even those who plan to vote seem to have lost hope that a national politician can solve the seemingly intractable problems here. &quot;The election's not going to affect anybody in the developments,&quot; says Brenda Stephenson, a public-housing resident who has sent her young daughter to live with friends in Texas so she isn't entrapped in the local drug scene. &quot;The mayor's election might bring a change, but not the presidential election.&quot;    ---                     Poverty in America                                1978      1986       1987 Poverty Rates  All persons                   11.4%     13.6%      13.5%  Blacks                        30.6      31.1       33.1  Blacks under 18               41.2      43.0       45.6  Blacks under 6                42.5      45.6       49.0 Average Income of Black Families*  Poorest one-fifth           $5,022    $4,014     $3,837  Middle one-fifth            19,038    18,416     18,020  Top one-fifth               51,858    55,484     55,107   *Adjusted for inflation to 1987 dollars   Source: Center for Budget and Policy Priorities</TEXT></DOC>
