SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors said today they have filedcriminal charges against former Communist Party chief ErichHonecker and five other ousted officials accused of using theirpower to rob the state and live in luxury.   The Communist Party's official newspaper said the party mustmake a new start if it is to survive the growing challenge to itsauthority. It said many members favor dissolving it in favor of asocialist movement.   In a bid to hold onto power, the party Thursday bowed to theopposition and agreed to rewrite the constitution and hold freeelections in May.   The concessions preceded a crucial party congress that openedtonight in East Berlin. Party leaders were expected to choose theirthird party leader in three months and radically alter the partystructure.   The meeting comes amid mounting civil unrest in East Germany andpolitical upheaval in other East bloc countries.   In Czechoslovakia, the new premier, Marian Calfa, met withopposition leaders today about forming a coalition government in abid to head off a general strike threatened Monday ifnon-Communists are not given more power.   The Soviet Union's Central Committee scheduled an extraordinarysession Saturday, and a journalist said it may discuss the growingchallenge to the Soviet party's authority _ in particular,Lithuania's decision Thursday to revoke the Communist Party'sguaranteed monopoly on power.   Prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski told reporters formalcharges were filed against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph,and four other ex-leaders ousted in the nationwide pro-democracymovement.   ``They are accused of damaging the economy of the GermanDemocratic Republic and of personally enriching themselves by abuseof office and corruption,'' the spokesman told reporters.   He said the officials' homes were searched but did not say whenthe charges were filed or when a trial would occur.   Four of the six are in prison. The 77-year-old Honecker, oustedfrom power Oct. 18, is too sick to be jailed, and former Politburomember Hermann Axen is having an eye operation in Moscow,Przybylski said.   In addition to Stoph, those under arrest are former Politburomembers Guenther Kleiber, Werner Krolikowski and Erich Mielke, hesaid.   Two months of political upheaval in East Germany set into motioninvestigations into abuses of power by the ousted Communist elite,whose members allegedly used their high positions to live in luxuryoff the state.   Honecker has been under house arrest in the lavish residentialcompound where he and other Politburo members lived.   In a detailed program published Thursday, the Communist Partythat ruled with orthodox communism for four decades called for ``analternative democratic socialism'' and admitted its role in thecurrent political crisis.   It also recognized the role of the church, but it maintained thepast party line of opposing reunification with West Germany.   Party and opposition delegations also agreed to recommend thatParliament schedule elections May 6.   There was speculation the party would even change its name, asHungarian Communists did this year.   Neues Deutschland, the official Communist Party newspaper, saidtoday a ``new start'' for the party is ``indispensable, evenvital.''   ``Not a few comrades see the solution practically in thedissolution of the SED (Communist Party) and the new founding of amodern socialist party movement,'' the paper said.   The chairman of the National Democratic Party, one of severallong allied with the Communists, was quoted as proposing the topadministrator of the Berlin church district, Manfred Stolpe, forstate president.   Parliament should elect a president after national elections,party leader Guenther Hartmann told West Germany's Bild newspaper.   Non-Communist Manfred Gerlach took over as interim head of stateafter Egon Krenz resigned from the post this week.   Krenz had taken over from Honecker, and although he introducedsuch reforms as opening East German borders, he was forced to quitbecause of his long-time association with the disgraced Honeckergovernment.   On Sunday, after Krenz and his Politboro and Central Committeestepped down, a 25-member panel of party reformers was appointed torun party affairs until a party congress next week.   The rapid pace of changes and public anger at former leadersreportedly led citizens to storm secret police headquarters in fourcities and stage politically motivated strikes at several stateenterprises.   Bild quoted Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer as saying there wasa ``potential for violence on both sides ... I understand themotivation (for the strikes), but such a process can get out ofcontrol.''   U.S. military officials say some Soviet forces in East Germanyhave raised their level of readiness, but apparently only toprotect their bases and nuclear weapons, according to a publishedreport. ``They're worried about their own forces (in the midst ofthis turmoil) and rightfully so,'' The Washington Post today quotedan unidentified senior U.S. military official as saying.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said he had noinformation on the report.   East German news media reported riots in some prisons by inmatesdemanding amnesty. Since last weekend, inmates have been on hungerand work strikes at prisons in Cottbus, Bautzen, Halle, Magdeburgand Potsdam.</TEXT></DOC>
