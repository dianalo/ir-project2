In an open letter to customers, First RepublicBank stated thatrecent news reports on the financial condition of the state'slargest bank holding company were wrong or misleading.   The advertisement was aimed at depositors, whom the companyfeared might begin withdrawing funds due to the reports because ofconcerns about deposit safety.   ``During the past few days, there have been several articles andnews stories about the current state of our bank,'' the ad says.``Many of the items reported in these articles have been misleadingand some just plain wrong. Consequently, we feel it necessary torespond to these reports.''   Since First RepublicBank reported a $656.8 million loss Jan. 19,rumors have spread about its ability to weather anticipated lossesfrom its $3.9 billion portfolio of troubled loans.   Speculation spread to financial markets last week, sending FirstRepublicBank's common and preferred stocks tumbling and disruptingits system for raising deposits.   The bank said in a statement Sunday that 88 percent of its fundscome from core deposits, gathered through its system of 134branches and subsidiary banks. At year's end, First Republic had$1.93 billion in foreign deposits, representing about 7.5 percentof its funds.   Total deposits as of Dec. 31 were about $24.5 billion, accordingto spokeswoman Martha Larsh. Assets totaled $33.2 billion, makingFirst RepublicBank the nation's 14th-largest bank holding companyat yearend 1987.   First Republic stated it lost slightly more than $1.1 billion indeposits since the end of 1987. First Republic Chairman GeraldFronterhouse said about half the withdrawals _ nearly $550 million_ were at the lead Dallas bank.   ``Through mid-February, the corporation's average total depositshave only declined by approximately 4{ percent this year,'' thecompany's ad said. ``More than half of the reduction was anexpected decline in foreign deposits, with the balance dueprimarily to normal seasonal factors.''   The Wall Street Journal reported in its Monday editions thatfederal regulators were preparing a possible $4.5 billion rescue.   Fronterhouse said in the statement issued Sunday that theinstitution was unaware of any efforts by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. to arrange an assisted merger for the bank holdingcompany, the nation's 13th largest.   ``Furthermore, that agency informed us that its policy is toadvise the institution before engaging in such negotiations,''Fronterhouse said.   An FDIC official said the agency ``would be less thanresponsible'' if it didn't prepare contingency plans for a troubledbank.   First RepublicBank's ad also addressed the economic condition inTexas, which leads the nation in bank failures.   ``These are not the best of times for any of us in Texas. But weare totally committed to serving your needs and contributing toyour success. We are here for the long term,'' read the lettersigned by Fronterhouse, Joseph Musolino and Charles Pistor, vicechairmen.</TEXT></DOC>
