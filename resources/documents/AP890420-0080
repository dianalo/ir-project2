Pickup 8th, ``One Patriot...''</HEAD><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan may develop its own surface-to-air missile ina $7.5 billion project, a news report said today.   It would be the first anti-aircraft missile Japan developedusing its own technology, the leading economic newspaper NihonKeizai Shimbun said.   The report comes as Tokyo and Washington remain mired indisagreement over a proposal to jointly develop a new fighter jet.   An official in the Finance Ministry's Budget Bureau confirmed$30 million were earmarked in the budget for fiscal year 1989 for``study expenses'' for the missile but refused to elaborate.   Japan's budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1,has not been approved by Parliament because of an oppositionboycott tied to a bribery scandal. Instead, the government isoperating on a 50-day provisional budget.   The newspaper said the Defense Agency plans three years ofresearch into areas such as radar and infrared sensors and guidancesystems before beginning development of the new missile.   The missile would replace the Patriot, which Japan producesunder license from the United States under a 1985 agreement. Japanplans to deploy 26 Japanese-made Patriot systems over the next 10years to replace its aging Nike-J missiles.   One Patriot system is estimated to cost $521 million and is madeup of 20 Patriot missiles, a launcher, and radar and firing controlequipment. It is capable of attacking multiple airborne targetswithin a range of 100 miles.   The newspaper said the plan to use Japanese technology todevelop the new missile system might bring a negative reaction fromthe United States, which has provided Japan with much of its maindefense technology.   The United States may propose joint development of the newmissile system, as in the case of Japan's controversialnext-generation jet fighter, the FSX, it said. Last year, Japan andthe United States agreed that private companies from the twocountries will jointly develop and produce a new jet fighter forJapan in a project worth more than $8 billion.   The move was a compromise after Washington wanted Japan to buyU.S.-built planes while Tokyo wanted to develop its own aircraft.   But the two countries are currently reviewing the agreementbecause of opposition from some U.S. congressmen who charge thatthe project would be a ``giveaway'' of U.S. aviation technology.</TEXT></DOC>
