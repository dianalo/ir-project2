The breakthrough could have important implications forgovernments and banks, which use large-digit numbers in securitysystems on the assumption they provide a code too difficult tobreak.   But the pleasure of the hunt concerned researchers more.   ``Why did we go after it?'' University of Chicago computerscientist Arjen Lenstra said Wednesday. ``Because people compilelists.''   The number, which begins 9,412,343,607 ... and stretches on for90 more digits, defied all previous efforts to find its primefactors.   The factors of a number are two numbers that, when multipliedtogether, yield the larger number. A prime number is one that isevenly divisible only by 1 or itself.   The prime factors of 21, for example, are 3 and 7. Bycomparison, the prime numbers that solved the 100-digit number are,respectively, 41 digits and 60 digits long.   Finding the prime factors of such large numbers was thought tobe so difficult, in fact, that many security systems assume suchcomputations to be beyond the range of even the most powerfulcomputers being applied for long periods of time.   Governments transfer secret messages and banks transfer fundselectronically by encoding the information in large-digit numbersthat require the receiver to know its prime factors in order todecipher the information.   ``Ten years ago, everybody suggested 80 digits were safe.Nowadays, that's trivial'' said Lenstra, co-director of the projectwith Dr. Mark Manasse of the Digital Equipment Corp.'s SystemsResearch Center in Palo Alto, Calif.   ``I think 150 is reasonable,'' he continued. ``But personally,I'd go a little beyond 200 now.''   Computer scientists had theorized that a single computer doing amillion calculations per second would have needed 25 years to solvethe problem. Even a state-of-the-art supercomputer such as the Craywould need about 10 months of constant computing _ that at a costof thousands of dollars per hour.   Lenstra and Manasse, however, factored the number in just 26days.   They began their attack on the 100-digit number by breaking theproblem into smaller tasks, then farmed them out to about 400computers in the United States, Europe and Australia through anexisiting electronic mail network.   All the computers used in the project worked on the factoringproblem only when they were not being used for anything else. Eachtime a problem was solved, it was relayed by electronic mail toDigital's Palo Alto lab.   The last sequence of numbers required to solve the entireproblem flashed across a computer screen at 2:03 a.m. PDT Tuesday.   ``One of the really nice things about this effort is that itcost us virtually nothing,'' Lenstra said. ``We contacted friends,other computer scientists, anybody that thought factoring was funand got them to participate.''   Lenstra, 32, a visiting professor in Chicago's computer sciencedepartment is unsure where the next horizon lies. He said everytime the length of the number goes up by three digits, the timeneeded to compute the prime factors doubles.   ``But we don't know what our problem-solving limit is until wefind out how much interest is out there and how big an electronicmail network we can assemble.   ``We've already started on a 102-digit number,'' he concluded,``just to keep us busy.''</TEXT><TEXT>   The number to be factored:9,412,343,607,359,262,946,971,172,136,294,514,357,528,981,378,983,082,541,347,532,211,942,640,121,301,590,698,634,089,611, 468,911,681.
