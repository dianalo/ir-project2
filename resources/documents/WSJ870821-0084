The 13-count indictment returned yesterday marks the second time in three months that top officers of a bank in Manhattan's Chinatown section have been indicted on criminal charges.    Yesterday's indictment charges that from September 1982 to December 1984, United Orient and the five officers failed to file currency-transaction reports with the Internal Revenue Service for more than 150 cash deposits made by 12 different local businesses. A total of $3.2 million of deposits went unreported, the indictment charges.    The officers charged were Chairman Ka Chiu Leung, 71 years old; a senior vice president, Daniel Lau, 42; a branch manager; and two operations officers. They are scheduled to be arraigned along with the bank next Thursday.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, at a news conference, declined to discuss the possible purpose of the alleged currency violations. But he noted that failing to file such reports can be a way to evade taxes or launder money earned illegally. &quot;Whatever the reason is, it's against the law,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said.    United Orient said in a statement that it would &quot;vigorously defend itself&quot; against what it called alleged &quot;technical legal violations.&quot; The bank said the five officers have been granted paid leaves of absence.    The bank said there was no evidence &quot;the funds involved were derived from illicit or criminal activities, or that anyone personally profited from the transactions.&quot;    United Orient, with 20,000 accounts, had $76.5 million in assets and slightly more than $71 million in liabilities at June 30.    The earlier case, involving two former officers of Golden Pacific National Bank who were indicted for fraud, is pending. The Golden Pacific officers deny any wrongdoing. The bank is now operated by Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
