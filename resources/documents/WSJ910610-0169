That is one of the chief results of last week's briefmeeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,industry analysts suggested in the wake of the oil ministers'conference in Vienna.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This meeting wasn't about the oil markets,&quot; said VahanZanoyan, senior director of Washington-based PetroleumFinance Co. &quot;It was to settle some scores in OPEC's internaldynamics.&quot;   Iran was among those settling scores. Often treated as anoutcast in the Arab-dominated exporters' group, Iran, aspredicted, was able to strengthen its new middleman role inOPEC at the meeting. Its neutrality on the issue was the keyto thwarting opposing moves by one group -- Algeria, Nigeriaand Libya -- to reduce the OPEC production level and byanother -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- toraise the ceiling. As previously reported, the oil ministersresolved the output issue by agreeing to maintain it at 22.3million barrels a day, the current ceiling, through Septemberwith the idea of taking a new look at it then.   But Iraq clearly emerged as the surprise of the meeting.   This was the first time Iraq has been represented at anOPEC meeting by an officially named oil minister since thePersian Gulf crisis began last August. The new minister isOsama Abdul Razzak AlHiti. He is 46 years old, a petroleumengineer and a graduate of Louisiana Polytechnic University.   Appointed as Iraq's oil minister a week before themeeting, Mr. Al-Hiti operated as a seasoned veteran of OPECpolitics. He quickly shocked the others by blocking, if onlyfor a few hours, what was expected to be a shoo-inreappointment of the popular Secretary-General Subroto to asecond three-year term.   Mr. Al-Hiti also pressed aggressively for the otherministers to urge the United Nations to lift its sanctionsagainst Iraq's oil exports. Some of the other ministers gotthe idea he was seeking a quid pro quo for his approval ofthe Subroto reappointment.   But he finally cast an approving vote for Mr. Subroto.That made the reappointment unanimous although it was delayedfrom the morning's agenda until late afternoon. Also, theSubroto debate pitted Iraq against Saudi Arabia, its foe inthe Persian Gulf War.   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer had nominated Mr. Subroto. AndMr. Al-Hiti's approval vote came only after the Saudi oilminister angrily denounced the Iraqi and threatened to lead amove to oust Ramzi Salman, former head of Iraq's State OilMarketing Organization, as the recently appointed deputysecretary-general. Some suggested the Iraqi strategy was tokeep Mr. Subroto out so that Mr. Salman could become actingsecretary-general.   Mr. Salman retains his important spot. But Mr. Al-Hitididn't succeed in his campaign to get OPEC to intercede inthe U.N. on Iraq's behalf. The other ministers flatly refusedto get involved. Some were infuriated, in fact. &quot;The Iraqisare still acting like the victims instead of the aggressors&quot;in the Persian Gulf War, said the chief delegate of one OPECmember nation that had been neutral during the crisis.   Still, the Iraqi minister left his mark on OPEC. &quot;He wassaying: See Iraq as a credible member,&quot; said PetroleumFinance's Mr. Zanoyan, who was in Vienna to observe themeeting.   Others agreed that Mr. Al-Hiti took home several rewards.Most important, he was reassured by the other oil ministersthat Iraq's former OPEC quota of 3.1 million barrels a daystill rightfully belongs to it. Also, &quot;OPEC isn't excludingthe possibility that Iraqi exports could be resumed beforeits next meeting&quot; in late September, reported theLondon-based Energy Compass.</TEXT></DOC>
