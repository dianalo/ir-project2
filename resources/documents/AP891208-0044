But the official, Doug Lewis, showed no inclination to ban thetype of weapon used by the gunman, and he maintained that nolegislation can guarantee such tragedies will never occur.   ``You can't legislate against insanity,'' the Conservative Partylegislator said Thursday.   The mass killing shocked many Canadians who have believed thatcarnage on such a scale may have taken place in the United Statesbut could not happen in their country.   Automatic weapons are banned in Canada but semi-automatics areavailable with the proper permit.   Some analysts say generally stricter gun control laws in Canadathan in the United States are a factor in a lower crime rate.   Lewis promised earlier this year to propose amendments to banthe import of military assault rifles, such as Uzis and AK-47s.   But the bill would not ban semi-automatic weapons such as the.223-calibre hunting rifle used in the shootings Wednesday, whichalso wounded 13 people.   ``There are many thousands of gun owners who act responsibly,''Lewis said. ``Semi-automatics are used for sporting purposes.''   Gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening theproposed legislation to cover such weapons.   Svend Robinson, an opposition New Democrat legislator, hecriticized Lewis for delaying his legislation, which has been inthe works since summer but has not come before House of Commons.   ``How many more tragedies of this nature must we see in thiscountry, before this Conserative government will finally act tokeep the commitments they made?'' he asked.   Robinson said that in addition to banning the import ofautomatic weapons, the government should consider tightening therules for gun permits, limiting the number of cartridges in theclips of semi-automatics, and requiring people to take safetycourses before being allowed to own a gun.   Dr. John Hinchey, a surgeon who operated on some of the woundedstudents, told a Montreal news conference that he supported a banon the type of rifle used in the attack.   Earlier, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had termed the slayingssenseless, tragic, and a ``grim reminder of the vulnerability ofour society.''   Flags on Parliament Hill were at half-staff as about 300 peoplegathered just after dark for a candlelight vigil in honor of theslain students. After speeches by representatives of local women'sgroups, they concluded with shouts of: ``No more violence againstwomen.''</TEXT></DOC>
