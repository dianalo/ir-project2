Gold prices were hammered again yesterday as gold forMarch delivery tumbled $3.20 an ounce to $340.10 on NewYork's Commodity Exchange. That's the lowest close on a spotfutures contract since mid-1986, and gold is now down 6.5%from a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   With inflation holding at a low rate, gold has littleallure as a hedge against rising prices. Gold bugs,anticipating an economic recovery this year, had predictedthat inflation would accelerate and that gold would rally.   But investors are staying out of gold, says DouglasMcCormick, manager of the precious metals department at theBank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. Investors are asking, hesays, &quot;why should we buy now, if we are going to be hit withmore selling?&quot;   Meanwhile, lower gold prices are encouraging to stock andbond investors, who like low inflation and keep an eye ongold as an early-warning signal of inflationary trends.Yesterday, the government reported that consumer prices rose0.3% in February, a benign increase that had been expected.   Gold has been edging lower for a week, amid signs that theU.S. economy is rebounding but not inflation. However, thespark for yesterday's sell-off was an early indication thatin South Africa -- the world's largest producer of gold --the government would receive a big mandate in yesterday'snationwide referendum. Jitters about the referendum, in whichwhites were voting on whether to share power with the blackmajority, had tempered the decline.   The sell-off began overnight as Middle Eastern centralbankers actively liquidated some of their holdings to raisecash, analysts said. &quot;The market was taken by surprise by thescale of selling,&quot; said Edwin Arnold, precious metals analystat Merrill Lynch in London. The London price sank more than$4 an ounce to $339 at the afternoon fixing.   Selling spilled into the New York market when it opened,with April gold futures dropping as low as $337.30 at onepoint before recovering to finish at $340.60 an ounce, down$3.30. Analysts said commodity funds at first joined in theselling, but then began taking profits in their shortpositions by buying offsetting contracts. This buying liftedthe New York market from its lows.   Platinum, another precious metal that is produced heavilyin South Africa, also slumped. Platinum futures for Aprildelivery, the most actively traded contract, tumbled $7.90 anounce to $352.60.   Where gold goes from here is anybody's guess. AndrewAddison, publisher of the Addison Report, a Franklin, Mass.,investment newsletter, said the speed at which prices aredropping suggests that gold is &quot;oversold and is at levelsthat would precede a rally. But to have a sustained rally,&quot;he added, the market needs to stabilize and stop falling.   Actually, destabilization is what some gold bugs arehoping for. They say a &quot;trigger event&quot; -- such as, onesuggested, a crash in the Japanese stock market -- wouldremind forgetful investors of gold's age-old appeal.   &quot;Gold is the only thing that has ultimate value in thefinal analysis,&quot; says Lawrence Heim, publisher of the HeimInvestment Letter, who still predicts gold will climb to$8,000 an ounce during the 1990s. And over the next 12months, he asserts that gold will rebound to $800 an ounce.   Mr. Heim argues that paper money is being printed sorapidly it is worthless, while gold is a tangible commoditythat investors can turn to in times of financial duress.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices firmed asmomentum appeared to grow in Washington for a favorableresponse to a request for more export credits from theCommonwealth of Independent States. Congressional leadersexpressed support yesterday for the request for credits,which Russia and other former Soviet republics would use tobuy U.S. grain. This could provide the political impetus theBush administration needs to grant the request, said DanielW. Basse, market research director for AgResource Co.,Chicago. Russia has asked for $500 million in export credits,Ukraine for $300 million and other republics for $500million. In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, thesoybean contract for July delivery rose 2.25 cents to $6.0450a bushel; the July wheat contract was up 0.25 cent to $3.7150a bushel; and the May corn contract climbed 0.75 cent to$2.70 a bushel.                                                                                                          ENERGY: In late trading in crude oil futures, a sell-offwas followed by a rally. The net result at the close was amodest gain of nine cents a barrel for crude oil for Aprildelivery, which settled at $19.24. May crude was up sevencents to $19.35 a barrel. At these prices, the April and Maycrudes remained above the psychologically important level of$19 a barrel and within the range established by lastFriday's rally. There was little news to affect oil marketsyesterday. But providing some support for futures prices wasthe expectation among traders that the industry's latestfigures on U.S. fuel inventories would show bullishdrawdowns. The report, released by the American PetroleumInstitute after the close of futures trading, showed onlymodest declines last week in inventories of gasoline andheating oil but a major drop in crude oil stocks. Accordingto the API report, crude oil inventories fell 4.8 millionbarrels last week, a much larger decline than had beenanticipated.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell. Coffee for March deliveryended at 72.25 cents a pound, down 0.30 cent. The activelytraded May contract finished at 72.85 cents, down 0.55 cent.&quot;Traders were squaring books&quot; ahead of Brazil's policystatement, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.Brazil is supposed to release its coffee policy today and,even though many analysts are expecting Brazil to agree tonegotiations for an international quota system for coffeeproduction, some traders were hedging their bets by sellingfutures yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
