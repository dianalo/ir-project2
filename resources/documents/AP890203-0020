The Senate's 95-5 vote Thursday against the raise sent the twohouses in different directions, and ``no one knows'' how thecontroversy will be resolved, said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan., ``I don't believe we'll know that for a matter of weeks ormonths.''   The Senate resolution included language to roll back the raise ifit becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases,along with those for top federal executives and judges, to becomelaw automatically unless rejected by both houses.   The chief sponsors were Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of SouthDakota and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.   Also approved, by unanimous voice vote, was a Senate rules changethat would ban senators from keeping fees for speeches, articles andappearances. But the ban on such fees, typically paid byspecial-interest groups, would only remain in effect while senatorswere receiving the raise.   The Senate action has strong political appeal to a public angrywith the size of the raise, but will have little practical effectunder House Speaker Jim Wright's plan to let the increase become lawautomatically next Wednesday.   Wright plans to use a risky parliamentary procedure that requiresa two-thirds majority to scale back the raise to 30 percent, and topass a House ban on speaking fees along with other outside incomerestrictions.   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said there was onlya 50-50 chance of getting the two-thirds while Rep. Tom Tauke,R-Iowa, and a leading pay raise opponent, predicted it would be``very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds to vote for theresolution.''   Rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise from$89,500 to $135,000 under the full raise. But the pay would be$116,350 under Wright's plan, the same amount House members can nowreceive in salary plus honoraria _ defined as fees for speeches,appearances and articles.   Even if the Wright plan passed, the Senate would be unlikely togo along, since senators can now keep $35,800 in honoraria and wouldtherefore lose money by accepting a smaller $26,850 raise. While thetwo houses haggled, the 51 percent raise would remain in effectalong with the honoraria bans.   Wright explained his rollback plan at a news conference Thursday,emphasizing the virtue of banning honoraria and taking that sameamount in salary. ``The difference is we will be serving one master,not two, that is, the American people,'' he said.   ``I don't like to articulate failure,'' Wright said, when askedwhat will happen if his plan is defeated. ``If for some reason itdoesn't work, we will regroup.''   The House could try to pass the 30 percent raise by a majority,like most legislation, but opponents might be able to tack onlanguage rescinding the raise altogether. Under the two-thirds rule,no amendments would be in order.   The House plan would scale back the raise for all three branchesof government, even though the Constitution prohibits judges' payfrom being reduced.   ``I think the courts are likely to hold it's unconstitutional todo this to the judiciary,'' Wright said.   Wright released results of a survey showing 57 percent of Housemembers opposing a pay raise vote before the Tuesday midnightdeadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the raiseto 30 percent.   Wright said his proposed $26,850 pay raise was ``a decent raisebut not an exorbitant raise,'' compared with the $45,500 increaseproposed by former President Reagan and endorsed by President Bush.   Actually, most House members would find their incomessubstantially increased, since fewer than half reach the currenthonoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to theirfinancial disclosures.   The five senators who voted against the package to eliminate thecurrently-proposed pay increase were Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.;Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; FrankMurkowski, R-Alaska; and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.   Their votes do not necessarily mean they support the 51 percentraise.   The Senate honoraria package would:   _Prohibit acceptance of honoraria, but allow a donation tocharity on the members' behalf. Donations would be limited to $2,000per appearance.   _Prohibit members from receiving any pension or tax benefitresulting from the charitable payments.   _Prohibit conversion of the charitable donations to personal useby a member or former member.   _Require the Senate ethics committee to issue guidelines fortravel expenses reimbursed by outside individuals or organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
