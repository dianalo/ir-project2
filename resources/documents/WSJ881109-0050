And that's bad news for auto makers, car buyers and perhaps the whole U.S. economy.    Mr. Lamoureux runs Auto City Auto Recovery, which repossesses cars from buyers who can't make their payments. Sitting in his cramped northwest Detroit office overlooking an 11-acre yard packed with cars, Mr. Lamoureux says that America's &quot;credit mania&quot; has pushed his business up 20% this year.    Much the same thing is happening elsewhere, including at Chicago-based Equitable Services Inc., which is running out of room to store repossessed cars. &quot;I'm trying to buy another piece of property,&quot; says President Kevin McGivern. &quot;I need four acres. We have to expand.&quot;    But good times for repo men mean trouble for the companies that make cars, the companies that finance their purchase and, ultimately, the consumer-led economic recovery. As lending institutions, including the finance arms of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., crack down on easy credit, the result could be a slowdown in the auto sales boom that buoyed the economy through the first half of this year.    &quot;Autos were a major factor in sustaining the growth of consumer spending in the first half,&quot; says Sara Johnson, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. &quot;They were the leading product group.&quot; But in September, she notes, slow auto sales helped drag down overall consumer spending 0.4% from the previous month.    There are signs that the pace of automotive lending is also slowing. Auto borrowing rose by just $49 million in September, though that was after a $2.2 billion jump in August. The overall consumer debt load was up 8.6% in September from a year earlier.    As consumer debt continues to rise, the percentage of borrowers getting behind on payments is bouncing up, too. A survey by the American Banker's Association found the rate of consumer loan delinquencies rose 7% during the second quarter after hitting a four-year low the period before. The rate of auto loan delinquencies rose 8% between the first and second quarters, according to the same survey.    One way to measure the growing car loan delinquency problem is the rate of repossessions. At General Motors Acceptance Corp., repossessions so far this year are running at about 2.1% of total loans outstanding, up from 1.6% in 1987. Another measure is late payments. The percentage of commercial bank car loans with payments 30 days or more past due jumped to 1.89% in the second quarter from 1.59% in the fourth quarter of 1987, says the American Bankers Association.    The figures may seem low in absolute terms, but they're bad news for auto lenders, who have tight margins and vulnerable profits. &quot;We consider anything over 1% {repossession rate} unattractive,&quot; says Robert Reich, president of Marine Midland Bank's auto-lending unit. &quot;That's a leading indicator of a problem.&quot;    So the bankers are cracking down. &quot;Fifty percent of the applicants presented {for car loans} through our dealer network are being rejected,&quot; says Donald W. Grigley, senior vice president for installment finance at Shawmut National Corp., a big New England bank holding company. Two years ago, he says, Shawmut bankers were rejecting only 35% of car-loan applicants. Rejections are up in part because Shawmut lenders are demanding that car buyers have no more than 40% of their total monthly income pledged to debt payments, including mortgages and rent.    The auto makers' captive lending arms are more sanguine, because profit isn't their main goal. &quot;We're here to sell cars,&quot; explains Don Cook, executive vice president for North American operations for Ford Motor Credit. Indeed, General Motors Acceptance Corp. granted extensions on 500,000 loans during the first nine months of the year to keep cars sold.    Nonetheless, Ford Credit's Mr. Cook acknowledges that his company, like GMAC and Chrysler Credit, is worried about the rise in loan losses. All three are taking a harder look at their lending practices, beefing up collection staffs, and scaling back the lending campaigns that put a lot of people into new cars last year -- and helped keep the U.S. car market healthy.    All this means the easy times are over in the car business. A lot of consumers who would have gotten car loans a year or two ago, when lenders didn't look as harshly on small down payments or big debt loads, wouldn't get loans today. Or else they would get smaller loans, and thus smaller cars.    That has some car dealers upset, because tougher lending policies can mean lost sales. Lenders &quot;start turning down deals they shouldn't turn down,&quot; says Robert Brest, president of Bob Brest Auto World Inc. in Lynn, Mass. At the GMAC branch office he deals with, says Mr. Brest, &quot;they get nervous.&quot;    The problem isn't with the vast majority of car buyers who put down substantial down payments, or whose family incomes are clearly enough to manage $200 to $400 a month in auto and insurance payments. Instead the trouble hits people with no credit, poor credit or relatively low incomes.    U.S. auto makers, through their finance arms, began aggressive efforts to tap this market last year through so-called first-time buyer programs. Under these programs, GMAC, Ford Motor Credit and Chrysler Credit offered to make loans to prospective new car buyers who previously would have had to settle for a used car.    Officials for all three auto company finance arms insist that first time buyer loans make up a relatively small slice of their business. GMAC, for instance, says 6% of its auto loans were made under the first-time buyer plan. But at Grossinger's Pontiac in Skokie, Ill., first-time buyers make up 13% of the business, says Morry Glicksman, the general manager. And when those buyers get turned down, he says, &quot;You do lose the sale. You get people mad at you.&quot;    Now, however, GMAC and the other captive finance units are paying the price for the aggressive move to build sales. Ford says earnings at its credit unit dropped in the third quarter, and GMAC says higher loan losses were partly to blame for a 26% drop in its third-quarter net income. First-time buyer loans were a major sore point, because they fail at a 50% higher rate than other special loan programs, such as one aimed at new college graduates who have proof of a job, GMAC officials concede.    &quot;We're struggling with that,&quot; says William J. Lovejoy, GMAC's group vice president for marketing. GMAC found that some who got new cars because of the easy terms of the first-time buyer program had concealed bad credit records or unacceptably heavy debt loads.    &quot;We were getting flimflammed,&quot; says Mr. Lovejoy. Now, he says, GMAC is more aggressive about checking credit references and steering first-time buyers into low-price models such as the Pontiac LeMans.    Meanwhile, the captive finance companies are moving to discourage even creditworthy consumers from trying to ease their monthly payments by stretching car loans over five years or more.    As car prices have risen, the average car loan term has jumped to more than 53 months from about 44 months eight years ago. While buyers get lower payments on longer loans, lenders say these loans go bad more frequently because consumers find themselves owing more for the car, even after three or four years, than the car is worth. People who have no equity in their cars find it easier to walk away from the loans.    &quot;We run into loans that have six or seven payments left, but the car doesn't run,&quot; says Mr. Lamoureux of Auto City Auto Recovery. &quot;They think they're going to get even with GM by not paying.&quot;    GMAC recently started a crusade to persuade GM dealers to steer customers into shorter term loans. Ford Credit went a step further. It now charges an extra 0.2% a year interest on 60-month loans. That adds only $1.45 to the monthly payment on a $14,000 Ford Taurus, but the symbolic message is clear.    GMAC's Mr. Lovejoy and his counterparts bridle at the suggestion that they are tightening up lending after a splurge during the past two years. But it's clear that the captive lenders, like their bank competitors, are rediscovering old virtues. As Ford's Mr. Cook puts it: &quot;The first thing I'll tell a person is to buy a car you can afford and a contract you can pay back.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
