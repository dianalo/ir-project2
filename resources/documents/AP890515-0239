TheNational Climatic Data Center handles tens of thousands suchqueries each year, from farmers, lawyers, sailors, filmmakers andothers.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By PAUL NOWELL</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Perhaps it's fitting that the world'slargest repository of weather records is housed in a 1920s-vintageindoor shopping mall that leaks during downpours.   Accurate weather records dating back to 1890 _ some even to thetime of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock _ are available at theNational Climatic Data Center, which has dozens of cubbyholeoffices in the the historic building guarded by two terra-cottagriffins.   ``Every time it rains hard the roof leaks and we have to breakout the buckets,'' says Steve Doty, the center's project director.   Despite the accomodations, the center, with a staff of 300,turns out an impressive amount of weather information, answering85,000 queries last year alone.   ``We can't give you the weather forecast for next week but wecan give you a look back 100 years,'' Doty says. ``Our role is tosupply the historical perspective.''   The center's long view at the world's climate can be vital whenit comes to such things as fighting world hunger, sendingastronauts into space or winning court cases.   For example, when an Exxon tanker spilled 10 million barrels ofoil in March into Prince William Sound in Alaska, industry andgovernment experts called the center to learn what kind of weatherconditions could be expected during the cleanup.   By coincidence, the center had just published a climatic atlasof the area, which provided detailed information on temperatures,wind speed and ocean currents.   Bill Brower, who helped prepare the atlas, said the data showedthe 70-mph winds that hit the Valdez area at the time of theaccident were unusual for that time of year. The information wasbeneficial as cleanup efforts were coordinated.   ``What we offer is a lot of good hard science,'' Doty says. ``Wecan tell you normals and extremes so you know what to expect.''   While keeping weather records may seem like dull work, some ofthe greatest minds in U.S. history have shown an interest in it.   Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington Carver allwere amateur weather observers. Copies of their records can befound at the center, which is part of the U.S. CommerceDepartment's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   The tons of records stored in the center's basement aretestimony to generations of less-famous volunteer weather trackers.   ``We've even got a copy of a diary with weather records fromPlymouth Rock,'' Doty says.   Most of the bound records stored in what once was the mall'sunderground parking deck come from places like Vicksburg, Miss.,St. Joseph, Mo., or Bear Mountain, N.Y., since 1890.   So if you've just got to know how many times it snowed inChicago on April 30 for the past 99 years, the folks at the NCDCcan help.   The raw data comes from the military, the National WeatherService, the Federal Aviation Administration and 8,000 volunteerweather observers. Hourly weather observations pour in from aroundthe globe, much of them from 10,000 ships stationed in variouspositions and from weather satellites orbiting Earth.   Current records are stored on computer. But because of budgetconstraints the center has been able to save on microfiche only afourth of the 200 million paper records.   In 1951, the center was moved from New Orleans to Asheville inthe mountains of western North Carolina. The city had a pool ofworkers skilled in key-punch machines, so the government bought theArcade Building and set up shop.   At one time, the sprawling building that takes up an entire cityblock was bulging at the seams with key-punch cards. Now its roomsare stuffed with computers and microfiche readers.   The center prints about 5,000 different publications on suchtopics as hourly precipitation data by state, national storm dataand global climatic data. The publications go out to more than50,000 individuals and businesses.   Seven staff meteorologists answer thousands of telephone andmail queries each month. Over the years, they have been asked somepeculiar questions, including:   _A free-lance writer wanted to know what the weather was likeduring the Oct. 30, 1938 radio broadcast of the ``The War of theWorlds.''   _Actress Carol Burnett called to find out whether thunderstormsand hail hit the San Antonio area on April 26, 1933, the day shewas born.   _A company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted toknow where in the United States they were likely to find snow onthe ground in November. They were instructed to shoot on locationin Stampede Pass, Wash., which averages 64 inches of snow eachNovember.   _A Texas law firm requested wind speed and direction records fora client who was planning to build a chicken coop. The lawyerswanted to show that the odors from the coop would not be blown tosurrounding homes.   _A chocolate candy company planning a summer publicity campaignrequested nighttime temperatures in several Midwestern towns tohelp them pinpoint the best time to leave samples on doorsteps.   One out of three requests come from attorneys trying toreconstruct weather conditions in accident or criminal cases, saysSam McCown, the center's supervisory meteorologist.   The minimum charge for information was increased recently to$12, while the average cost is about $40. Some complicated requestscan cost several thousand dollars.   Last summer, the center set up a special office to handlerequests for drought-related information. Calls came in from allover the country.   Richard Heim, who was in charge of the drought office, saidrecords on file from the 1930s and the 1950s put last year's dryweather into perspective.   At the peak of the 1988 drought, about 26 percent of the countrywas classified as experiencing extreme drought. On his computer,Heim called up a map from 1934 which showed 45 percent of thecountry was suffering from extreme drought.   The weather records also help scientists explore such things asthe ``greenhouse effect,'' a warming of Earth's temperatures thathas been attributed to industrial growth.   ``There are some scientists who believe the 1988 drought wascaused by the greenhouse effect,'' Heim says. ``We've had worsedroughts. If this one was caused by that, what caused the droughtsof the 1930s and 1950s?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 28</NOTE></DOC>
