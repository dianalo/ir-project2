After supplying some background, they focus on resultsprovided by recombinant DNA approaches, particularly work relating tocontractile protein synthesis and proliferation-related gene regulation.The authors' aim was to develop the idea that through studying myogenesisthey can learn something about the role of gene regulation in cell proliferation.It will become clear that although recombinant DNA approaches have alreadyprovided useful information of a specific nature, their most importantcontributions consist of establishing a general framework for furtherinvestigation and providing the tools to proceed.</TEXT></DOC>
