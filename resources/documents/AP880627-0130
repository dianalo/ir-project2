The state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento said thequake hit 5.2 on the Richter scale, while the U.S. GeologicalSurvey office in Menlo Park said the quake registered 5.0.   The epicenter, USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said, was about 16miles south of San Jose, along the San Andreas Fault. The time wasset at 11:43 a.m., she added.   There were no indications of injury or damage, San Jose policesaid.   The quake was felt over a large area, extending from Santa Rosa,about 60 miles north of San Francisco, to the Santa Cruz area 70miles to the south.   The temblor lasted up to 10 seconds in many areas. The 38 trainsrunning on Bay Area Rapid Transit lines were halted briefly toallow a check for track damage and then allowed to resume operation.   ``It hit real hard like something going into the side of thebuilding. Nothing fell, but light standards swayed back andforth,'' said Tom Honig, city editor of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.   Walt Glines, news editor of The Dispatch in Gilroy, said halfthe workers in the newspaper's city room ``didn't even notice'' therolling quake, which he said seemed to hit that area in two waves.   ``The first time, I thought it was a caffeine rush. But when thesecond one hit, I knew,'' he said.   A South San Francisco police dispatcher, who identified herselfonly as Pat, said her department had received a few calls, but nonereporting damage.   ``I sure felt it,'' she said. ``There were two shocks.''   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energey released by anearthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.Each increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 timesgreater.   On Sunday, a moderate earthquake shook a wide area of SouthernCalifornia, but there were no reports of serious damage. At leastfour people were treated for minor injuries.   The temblor was felt in downtown Los Angeles and as far away asSaugus, some 70 miles northwest of the epicenter, and Palm Springs,about 70 miles to the east. It was followed by several aftershocks.   The quake in Southern California, centered 3 milesnorth-northwest of Upland, struck at 8:04 a.m. and registered 4.5on the Richter scale, according to Robert Finn of the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology Seismology Lab in Pasadena. Instruments atthe U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., recorded a slightlyhigher reading of 4.7.   Upland, in San Bernardino County, is a city of about 50,000people located 40 miles east of Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
