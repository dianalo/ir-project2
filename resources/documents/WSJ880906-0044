Grassley </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ARO </IN><G> DEF JUS </G><TEXT>   Hundreds of government workers and employees of defense contractors must be terrified that they'll end up among those indicted in the latest procurement scandals. Too bad offenders apparently didn't know they could have reaped far greater financial benefit by revealing procurement plunder than by participating in it.    The little-known False Claims Act enlists private citizens in the campaign against corruption by giving enormous financial incentives and guarantees of job protection to people who blow the whistle on those who cheat the government.    The law dates back to the Civil War, when fraud by government contractors was also rampant. The same horses were sold to the cavalry several times over. Bullets were filled with sawdust instead of gunpowder. At that time, the law was passed to encourage people who knew about fraud to step forward. Over the years, however, it suffered weakening amendments and fell into disuse.    Then, in the 1980s, revelations of doublebilling, bill-padding and collusive bidding practices created a climate conducive to strengthening the False Claims Act. The tough updated law, signed in 1986, says that just about anyone can blow the whistle on and profit from uncovering companies that defraud the federal government. Allowing private citizens who know of fraud to sue contractors in federal court on behalf of the U.S. Treasury makes every citizen a potential attorney general.    By filing a complaint, the citizen forces a government investigation, because the Justice Department is required to examine each False Claims suit. If Justice decides to join the case, the government becomes primarily responsible for pursuing the suit, but the citizen may still participate, acting as a watchdog against sweetheart settlements. If the government decides not to join, the plaintiff may proceed on his own.    Why should any employee of a private contractor go through the trouble of filing such an action? Ethical considerations aside, because the False Claims Act gives whistle-blowers 15% to 30% of the damages the government collects, depending on the importance of their contributions. The contractor must pay the U.S. three times the amount of damages the government sustained as a result of the fraud.    Since the amendments were enacted in 1986, about 85 False Claims suits have been filed and are in litigation. Although the law covers every phase of government contracting, most of the defendants are defense contractors.    In a case filed against Raytheon Co., a retired employee claims overcharges of about $38 million in the production and maintenance of Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles for the Army. In a case filed against McDonnell Douglas, a former employee says the company overcharged the Army $175 million in a broad pattern of improper cost reporting on subcontracts related to the Apache attack helicopter program. And a former employee of TRW alleges it used a phony billing scheme to defraud the government out of $75 million.    Each of these cases has been the subject of thorough investigation by the Justice Department, has been found to be meritorious, and has been joined by the federal government. In a word, we're talking about real money here, and honesty may yet pay.    Almost all the False Claims whistle-blowers offer the same reason for filing their suits: Their employers refused to take action when the abuses were pointed out to them. In many cases, the plaintiffs had taken their claims to the FBI and other federal agencies, including the Justice Department. Until the filing of a False Claims complaint, they could not seem to get the attention of the federal government. In short, the act is keeping the Justice Department on its toes.    Nobody knows precisely the extent of fraud against the government, but estimates made by the General Accounting Office, the Department of Defense Inspector General's office and the Justice Department range in the billions of dollars annually. If the False Claims law were more widely known, it would be an effective deterrent. Who would risk enlisting fellow workers in illegal practices when those workers stand to gain so much more by exposing the fraudulent activity?    In the end, maybe good old marketplace incentives could succeed where personal ethics and general codes of morality have failed in the fight to keep the government from being fleeced.    ---   Rep. Berman (D., Calif.) and Sen. Grassley (R., Iowa) were the authors of the False Claims Act amendments. </TEXT></DOC>
