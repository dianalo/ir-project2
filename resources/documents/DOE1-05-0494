The images of digital subtraction for pulmonaryartery, pulmonary vein and thoracic aorta were studied by comparing tothe conventional pulmonary angiogram. Good images of pulmonary arterydue to digital subtraction were obtained in 80 % of the 45 cases. Thismethod needed only half volume of contrast media compared to the conventionalfor obtaining good images and thus reduced side effect. Therefore thismethod seems to be an usefull pre-operative examination in various chestdiseases, especially in case of lung cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
