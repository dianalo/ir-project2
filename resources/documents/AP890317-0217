BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents of Southern California would have tochange how they paint their houses, light their barbecues and spraytheir hair under a plan devised to clean up the nation's worst air.   The changes are outlined in a comprehensive blueprint intended toenable the metropolitan area to comply with federal clean airstandards by the year 2007.   The Air Quality Management Plan, expected to be approved today,is likely to touch nearly every aspect of Southern California lifefor the next 18 years, said A. Norton Younglove, a Riverside Countysupervisor and chairman of the South Coast Regional Air QualityManagement District's governing board.   ``We're doing literally pioneering work,'' said Younglove.``We're moving ahead of Congress, for example, on what they might doto amend the Clean Air Act.''   The regional agency devised the plan with the Southern CaliforniaAssociation of Governments, and the governing boards of bothagencies were to consider it at a meeting today.   ``We've included as many things as possible,'' said Bill Kelly, aspokesman for the air quality management district.   New measures would restrict air pollutants in industries,including electric power generating utilities, oil and gasrefineries, dry cleaners, furniture makers and auto body shops.   District officials maintain that their regulatory approach isfair, but the rules have aroused strident opposition among industryexecutives and conservatives such as Los Angeles County SupervisorMichael Antonovich.   ``This proposal will destroy thousands of jobs, increase taxes,raise consumer prices and exile businesses from our communities,''said Antonovich, a dissenting member of the air managementdistrict's 12-member governing board.   Invoking a specter of Big Brother government, Antonovich said,``If this measure passes we will have a new motto: `Use a barbecue _go to jail.'''   Once approved, the plan must be accepted by the state AirResources Board and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Theplan's first provisions, however, could go into effect within a year.   In big and small ways, rules set out in the plan attempt toreduce the gaseous chemical stew permeating the air in Los Angeles,Orange, Riverside and much of San Bernardino counties _ California'smost populous region.   For example, one of the 160 proposed rules would requiremetropolitan residents to forsake household aerosol sprays _including hair spray and deodorants _ within the next five years formanual-pump sprays.   Another set of rules would reduce the reactive chemicals inpaints, coatings and solvents, making it more difficult to painthomes and varnish furniture.   Conventional lighter fluid would be outlawed in a shift toelectric charcoal starters for barbecues.   Radial tires would be required on cars and light trucks.   ``Radial tires last longer,'' Kelly said, explaining that tiresthat last longer throw off less of the minute flecks of rubber thatcontribute to pollutants.   Such a rule may seem trivial, but not in a region where more than12 million residents drive 8 million vehicles about 234 millionmiles a day, Kelly said.   By the year 2000, the exclusive use of radial tires would reduceparticulant pollutants by 3.1 tons a day, he said.   Antonovich has rallied support among fellow conservatives andseveral big labor representatives, who are alarmed about potentialeconomic impact.   ``McDonnell Douglas cannot build airplanes if they can't paintthem; General Motors cannot build cars if they can't paint them andRocketdyne cannot build rocket motors if they can't test fire themin the Santa Susana Mountains,'' said Tom Whalen, who representsabout 38,000 members of the United Auto and Aerospace Workers.   Antonovich also cited a study prepared for the California Councilon Environmental and Economic Balance, which estimates the plan willcost individual households $2,200 a year.   Meanwhile, the Southern California Edison and the Western StatesPetroleum Association have prepared alternative smog plans, whichthey contend would meet federal standards faster and more cheaply.   ``We have studied and seriously considered alternatives suggestedby industry,'' said James M. Lents, the air quality district'sexecutive director. ``They simply fail to attain all federal airquality health standards as required by law.''</TEXT></DOC>
