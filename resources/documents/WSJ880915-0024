For reasons yet unclear, GTE's GSTAR III, launched by the French company Arianespace S.A., remains in a useless egg-shaped orbit thousands of miles above the Earth.    According to Booz, Allen andamp; Hamilton, New York management consultants, the failure will simply exacerbate a predicted shortage of satellite capacity after 1990. By then, the current glut of satellite transponders operating at high frequencies will narrow, forcing prices up.    Demand for so-called Ku-band satellite transponders, which use cheaper, smaller Earth stations, should grow 16% annually through 1993, says Chris Cleveland, an associate at the firm. By then, he says, excess capacity will be at only 10%, low enough to allow operators to demand higher prices.    &quot;Demand for Ku-band capacity&quot; is likely to outstrip supply, says Troy Ellington, vice president for satellite systems and government service of GTE Spacenet. &quot;The loss of any capacity certainly would make the situation worse.&quot;    The loss of GSTAR III alone, with only 16 transponders, won't by itself cause capacity to dry up. There are currently 28 commercial communication satellites in orbit with a total of 554 transponders operating, says GTE.    But there are far fewer Ku-band transponders than C-band transponders operating and demand for Ku-band is growing more rapidly. Cable television programmers are switching to Ku-band to tap a potential market of up to 14 million rural households that aren't wired for cable. In addition, corporations such as K mart Corp. and Prudential-Bache Securities are buying satellite video and data hookups between far-flung locations.    Meanwhile, says Booz Allen, operators cut launches due to higher insurance premiums and consolidation in the industry. The Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as some launch failures by Arianespace interrupted normal launch schedules, says Michael Reyman, who heads International Business Machines Corp.'s new satellite programs.    &quot;From 1989 to 1992 or 1993, the basic supply-demand picture will tighten considerably,&quot; says Mr. Reyman.    Mr. Ellington says GTE has enough extra capacity to continue providing service to customers. But, he says, &quot;we will have to perhaps accelerate our sales efforts more slowly than we would have otherwise.&quot;    GTE, the General Electric Co. division that made the satellite, Arianespace and Morton Thiokol Inc., which made the kick motor designed to give the satellite its final boost into orbit, are all investigating why GSTAR III didn't reach a useable orbit. Possible causes include difficulties with the kick motor or a sudden change in the center of gravity of the satellite itself, GTE said.    IBM's satellite on the same rocket did reach orbit and IBM expects to begin commercial operation Oct. 15. Mr. Ellington says GTE may use fuel on GSTAR III to boost it into its proper orbit, but it then would be useable for only a couple of years.    GTE has about $60 million in insurance, which will partly cover its losses, Mr. Ellington said. The company had invested between $80 million and $100 million in the satellite. Meantime, GTE hopes to launch its GSTAR IV satellite by late next year. </TEXT></DOC>
