The daughter of Burma's assassinated independence hero, AungSan, she returned to Rangoon, Burma's capital, from her home inBritain in April 1988 to care for her ailing mother. She foundherself in the midst of an unprecedented nationwide campaign to endauthoritarianism.   She sided with student protesters and stayed with them after theSeptember military coup in which troops of Army Commander Gen. SawMaung crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people.   Her campaign rallies commonly draw thousands of people, andWestern diplomats say authorities are concerned she could win ageneral election scheduled for early next year.   The slight frame of Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, belies a steely politicalwill that brushes off military intimidation and veiled threatsagainst her life. She had no political experience before last year.   Many Burmese attribute her widespread support to herunprecedented denunciation of the military and strongman Ne Win,whom she charges is still pulling the strings although heofficially retired last year after 26 years of autocratic rule.   Her first appearance on the Burmese political scene was on Aug.15 last year, when she attempted to mediate between the protestingstudents and the army by writing an open letter to then PresidentMaung Maung.   But when she spoke outside Rangoon's glittering Shwedagon Pagodaon Aug. 26, the height of the pro-democracy movement, she drew whatmay have been the largest crowd ever seen in Rangoon.   An estimated 1 million people packed the streets to hear hercall for democracy and an end to one-party rule. Demonstratorscamped in the streets for days to see her.   After brutal clampdowns on dissent that killed thousands, thearmy crushed open street protest after Sept 18. Ms. Suu Kyisubsequenty emerged as the most prominent of the Burmese oppositionleaders.   Her popularity has increased steadily and she has drawn largecrowds during political campaign tours throughout the country thisyear.   In December, crowds filled the streets of Rangoon for thefuneral of her mother, Kyin Gyi, who was Burma's first femaleambassador.   Her party, the National League for Democracy, is the largestpolitical opposition group and claims over 700,000 members inRangoon alone.   Over the past month she has openly defied martial lawregulations, which forbid open air political rallies and gatheringsof more than five persons. Her speeches in Rangoon have drawncrowds of up to 15,000 despite the persistent presence of armedtroops.   Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon in 1945 and married British academicMichael Aris in 1972. Her two sons traveled recently to Rangoon.   She went to school in India where her mother was Burma's firstfemale ambassador. She won a scholarship to Oxford in 1967 andobtained an honors degree in politics, philosophy and economics.   She later worked at the United Nations in New York and in theearly 1980s researched the life of her father and the origins ofBurmese nationalism at Kyodo University in Japan.   She has written two books, a guide to Burma for children and ashort biography of her father.</TEXT></DOC>
