Gov. Pete Wilson was negotiating with theDemocratic-controlled legislature over ways to fund theremaining $2 billion gap in what had been a projected $14.3billion deficit for fiscal 1991 and 1992. The Democrats wantto raise the $2 billion by increasing the state income tax onindividuals with incomes of more than $250,000 or couplesearning more than $500,000, to up to 11% from 9.3%.</LP><TEXT>   The other option, once favored by Gov. Wilson, is a 2%utility tax increase and a 6% tax on cable television. Thatplan has been widely criticized by Democrats and the state'spowerful big business lobby. The governor Saturday indicateda willingness to compromise on these issues, but a blow-upbetween Democrats and Republicans remained a distinctpossibility last night. Republicans are generally opposed toan income-tax increase for wealthy taxpayers.   On Friday, state Democrats were able to woo the bigbusiness lobby to back the income tax hikes, primarilybecause a utility tax increase would fall squarely on theshoulders of the state's business community. The decision toback the income tax hike was a turnabout for the businesslobby, which had previously stood behind Gov. Wilson'sopposition to the plan.   Broad agreement has already been reached on bills thatwould increase the state's sales tax to 7.25% from 6%,appropriate $1.6 billion from the state pension fund forpublic employees and sharply increase taxes on alcoholicbeverages and vehicle licenses. Legislation would also slashspending on education and welfare recipients, among others.Roughly half of the entire deficit will be closed byincreased taxes, and the other half by reduced spending.   Meanwhile, New York City officials last night passed a$28.7 billion budget that will raise property taxes, slashhealth-care programs and leave thousands of city workersjobless. In a compromise between Mayor David Dinkins and CityCouncil leaders, however, many of the service cuts originallyproposed by the mayor were restored. But it was unclearwhether the restorations were a result of finding savingselsewhere, or simply the product of adopting a rosier budgetforecast.   Had the city failed to approve a budget before the startof its fiscal year today, it risked triggering a processleading to a state takeover of its finances. Such controlswere put in place in the aftermath of the city's 1970s brushwith bankruptcy.   A Dinkins spokesman said the City Council and the mayorhad compromised on the thorny issue of how much to raiseproperty taxes. The council members, all of whom facereelection next year, wanted to keep property taxes unchangedand close the budget gap through more layoffs. Already,10,000 city workers have been laid off as a result of thecity's budget crisis.   The Dinkins spokesman said union concessions, once thoughtto be a key part of any budget package, had not been agreedto yet, though union and city officials were expected tocontinue negotiating through the week.   The New York City budget accord, coupled with a recentbudget compromise reached in Albany, caps a six-month processthat has been marked by dire economic predictions and intensepolitical bickering. The state and city combined faced a $10billion budget gap in fiscal 1992, and both Gov. Mario Cuomoand Mayor Dinkins fought hard with their respectivelegislatures to approve their own solutions.   New York state, whose budget was approved two months afterthe start of its April 1 fiscal year, only this weekendcompleted a compromise plan on how much of the $1 billion inspending vetoed by Gov. Cuomo would be restored. Delays inapproving the state budget are believed to have contributedto New York receiving the third-worst credit rating of anystate, after Massachusetts and Louisiana.   In neighboring Connecticut, Gov. Lowell Weicker had wantedto help balance the state's $7.5 billion budget, which facesa $942 million deficit, by imposing a state income tax.Connecticut lawmakers rejected that approach Saturday, andwere working yesterday on a proposal to extend the statesales tax to previously untaxed services. Gov. Weickerthreatened to shut down all nonessential state services if nobudget was passed.   In Maine, a shutdown of government offices loomed over theweekend as budget bickering threatened to continue past lastnight's deadline for the state to put a new spending plan inplace. The dispute centered on a legislative proposal toallow video gaming in bars, a measure that would result inadditional state revenue. Gov. John R. McKernan's oppositionto the plan appeared to stalemate budget talks.   Massachusetts legislators passed a $12.99 billion budgetover the weekend after a session that went on through Fridaynight into Saturday morning. The budget cut about $328million from state aid to communities, gave a 10% to 15% taxcredit to businesses for new research and development, cutMedicaid spending and delayed the start of certain parts ofthe state's universal health care plan.</TEXT></DOC>
