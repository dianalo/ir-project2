One hundred nineteen cases and four hundred fifty-twolatency-matched controls were selected. Analyses were conducted usingthe conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio and conditionallogistic regression for matched sets. The results from the analyses revealeda relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma; the strengthof this relationship increased with the intensity and duration of theasbestos exposure. Exposure to low-level gamma radiation was also associatedwith an increased risk of mesothelioma. There was no interaction betweenasbestos and radiation. Shipyard employment in non-asbestos jobs andmale gender were also found to be associated with mesothelioma.</TEXT></DOC>
