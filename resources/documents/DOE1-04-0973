The conductor of that magnet is in pure tensionand, therefore not subject to any bending moment. This makes the configurationof the electromagnetic force supporters much easier and also the quantityof them much less than those of the ordinary circular crosssectionaltoroidal magnet. The contours of D shape are given by the solution ofa differential equation. In this paper the equation is solved. The solutionis given by the expansion in terms of K, which is related to the bendingradius of the D shape contour. The first five terms are practically enoughto obtain the solution in less than 0.5 % error. Then, the equationsfor the stored electromagnetic energy and inductance of the D shape magnetare calculated. Using these solutions, some characteristics of D shapemagnet are considered by comparing with the circular toroidal magnet.It is shown that the D shape magnet can atore more magnetic energy thanthe circular toroidal magnet, if the amount of the conductor is same.When the ratio of the one turn length to the inner radius is 30, theD shape magnet can store 30 % larger amount of the magnetic energy thanthat of the circular toroidal magnet. But if this ratio become smallerthan 0.6, the crosssectional shapes become almost identical. The weightof the electromagnetic force supporter is estimated. The weight of thesupporter of D shaped magnet whose stored magnetic energy is 4.18 x 10/sup10/ (J) is 1/7 of that of the circular toroidal magnet.</TEXT></DOC>
