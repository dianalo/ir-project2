The amendment proposed today wouldextend the regulatory ban on all oil and gas activities on Cordell Bankand in any of the area within the 50-fathom isobath surrounding the Bank(<T3>i.e.,</T3> together, the core area of the Sanctuary, consisting ofapproximately 18.14 square nautical miles) to the entire Sanctuary. Thisamendment was suggested in comments received in response to the noticeof proposed rulemaking (52 FR 32563, Aug. 28, 1987) for the final ruleissued today. It was not adopted in that final rule because the noticeof proposed rulemaking and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement/ManagementPlan (DEIS/MP) did not consider such a ban. Further, a regulatory prohibitionof this magnitude should not be imposed without assessing the protectionto Sanctuary resources given their special environmental sensitivity thatwould be afforded by such a prohibition and the effect of such a prohibitionon this nation's domestic energy reserve potential and on potential leaserevenues to the Treasury of the United States, and without all interestedpersons having notice and an opportunity to comment. The purpose of thisnotice is to invite public comments on the merits of expanding the regulatoryprohibition on oil and gas activities in the core area to the entire Sanctuary.Commenters are particularly requested to address the effects of seismicexploration activities, oil discharges from accidental spills which couldarise as a result of exploration, development, and production activities,and on-site discharges or drill cuttings and drilling muds on Sanctuaryresources and special protection needs in light of the Sanctuary's specialenvironmental sensitivity. Commenters are also particularly requested toaddress the effect of a prohibition for the entire Sanctuary on domesticenergy reserve potentials and potential lease revenues to the United StatesTreasury.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments are invited and will be considered if receivedby July 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to Joseph A.

Uravitch, 202/673-5122.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Today NOAA published a notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> under the authority of title III of the MarineProtection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (hereinafter ``Act'') (16 U.S.C.1431 <T3>et seq.</T3>) designating a 397.05 square nautical mile area of marinewaters surrounding Cordell Bank, which is located approximately 50 nauticalmiles west-northwest of San Francisco, California, as the Cordell BankNational Marine Sanctuary, and setting forth regulations implementing thatdesignation and regulating activities in the Sanctuary. Pursuant to section304(b) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1434), Congress has 45 days of continuoussession beginning today to review the designation and regulations beforethey take effect. After 45 days, the designation and regulations automaticallybecome final and take effect unless the designation of any of its termsis disapproved by Congress through enactment of a joint resolution.The regulations published today, upon taking effect, would, among otherthings, ban all oil and gas activities on Cordell Bank and in the areawithin the 50-fathom isobath surrounding the Bank (<T3>i.e.,</T3> together, the core area of the Sanctuary, consisting ofapproximately 18.14 square nautical miles). As discussed in the noticeof final rule, imposition of this prohibition was justified even thoughnot proposed in the notice of proposed rule making (52 FR 32563, Aug. 28,1987) given the special environmental sensitivity of the core area andthe fact that this prohibition was considered in the DEIS/MP, upon whichpublic comment was solicited and received. As noted in the DEIS/MP, theUnited States Department of the Interior's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)Oil and Gas 5-Year Leasing Plan, in recognition of the unlikelihood ofthe presence of viable oil and gas reserves in the core area and the corearea's special environmental sensitivity, has already excluded the corearea from being offered for lease. While the 5-year plan expires in February1992, it is unlikely that the core area ever would be offered for lease.Cordell Bank and its surrounding waters, because of a rare combinationof oceanic conditions and undersea topography, provide a highly productivemarine environment in a discrete, well defined area. Cordell Bank providesa habitat for some twelve endangered and two threatened species, as wellas a variety of rare species. The prevailing California Current flows southwardalong the coast, while the upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom waters bringsnutrients and stimulates the growth of planktonic organisms. These nutrientssupport the entire food chain from small crustaceans to fish, marine mammalsand seabirds that form the exceptionally vigorous, ecological communityflourishing at Cordell Bank. The area is designated as a National MarineSanctuary for the purpose of protecting and conserving the area and ensuringthe continued availability of the ecological, research, educational, aesthetic,and recreational resources therein. In addition, historical or culturalresources may be present within the Cordell Bank area and its designationas a Sanctuary protects these resources as well.Hydrocarbon exploration, development and production possibly could threatenSanctuary resources (impacts from seismic exploration, oil discharges fromaccidental spills including well blow-outs, and on-site discharges of drillcuttings and drilling muds). The baseline characteristics of the Sanctuaryand the threats and expected impacts from oil and gas activities are discussedin detail in the FEIS/MP (Vol. I, pp. 81-91).The Sanctuary is of special environmental sensitivity. While the probabilityof a significant oil spill occurring as a result of exploration, developmentor production is small, should such a spill occur, sensitive resourcescould be seriously damaged. The probability of serious damage is increasedwith respect to the Sanctuary because seas over six feet are typicallythe case in the area of the Sanctuary. Mechanical cleanup equipment foroil spills is typically inoperable in seas over six feet. Further, theuse of chemical oil dispersants in an area of special environmental sensitivitymay be contraindicated due to their toxicity to marine life.Drilling muds consist of naturally occurring minerals such as barite, simplechemicals such as sodium hydroxide and potassium chloride, and complexorganic compounds such as lignosulfonates and formaldehydes. The UnitedStates Department of the Interior forbids the discharge of drilling mudscontaining toxic substances into marine waters. Further, the Departmentof the Interior can also prohibit the discharge of any drilling muds.Fluids and the lighter elements in drilling discharges are rapidly dispersedin the water column. The heavier elements, over 90 percent of the dischargedmaterials, settle to the bottom, usually in a plume extending in the directionof prevailing bottom currents.While the on-site discharge of drill cuttings and drilling muds can adverselyaffect benthic biota, the magnitude of such impact is open to scientificdebate. In 1983, the Marine Board of the National Research Council conducteda study of drilling discharges. The study recognized that drilling dischargeshad an adverse impact on the benthic environment in the immediate areaof the discharge but concluded that these discharges presented only a minimalrisk to the marine environment (National Research Council, Marine Board,1983). However, more recent by the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency has shown significant adverse benthic impacts from platform dischargesup to two miles from drilling sites (EPA 440/4-85/002, Aug. 1985). Thus,more than a minimal risk may be presented.The potential impacts on marine organisms resulting from the dischargeof drilling muds and cuttings are: (1) Decreased primary production causedby increased turbidity which reduces light levels; (2) interference withfilter feeding caused by high particulate loads; (3) burial of benthiccommunities; and (4) injury resulting from the acute or chronic toxic effectsof drilling mud constituents. Commenters are specifically requested topresent technical evidence on the above.Because a great majority of commentators on the proposed rule and on theDEIS/MP recommended adoption of a regulation prohibiting all hydrocarbonexploration and development activities within the Sanctuary and commentsreceived from members of the public and the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency in response to the publication of the FEIS/MP also recommendedthat oil and gas activities be banned throughout the Sanctuary, NOAA, inlight of the special environmental sensitivity of the Sanctuary, is initiatingthis rule making to consider expanding the ban on oil and gas activitiesin the core area to the entire Sanctuary. Initiating a rule making consideringexpanded the ban to the entire Sanctuary was chosen over taking regulatoryaction in the notice of final rule designating the Sanctuary and promulgatingthe implementing regulations, because the notice proposing the designationand implementing regulations and the DEIS/MP did not consider such a ban.A regulatory prohibition of this magnitude should not be imposed withoutassessing the protection to Sanctuary resources given their special environmentalsensitivity that would be afforded by such a prohibition and the effectof such a prohibition on this nation's domestic energy reserve potentialand on potential lease revenues to the United States Treasury, and withoutall interested persons having notice and an opportunity to comment.Conversely, immediately banning all oil and gas activities in the corearea was justified given the special environmental sensitivity of the corearea and the fact that a regulatory ban on oil and gas activities in thecore area was an alternative examined in the DEIS/MP, upon which publiccomment was solicited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 NOAA has concluded that the amendment proposed in this notice is not a``major rule'' within the meaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291because it would not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies or geographic regions; or,(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Regulatory Flexibility Act The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that thisregulatory amendment, if adopted, will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because there are no oiland gas activities presently ongoing or planned. While the Department ofthe Interior could offer leases for sale covering areas outside the corebut partially or entirely within the Sanctuary, such a possibility is toospeculative upon which to base a conclusion that the proposed ban for theentire Sanctuary would have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. As a result, an initial Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis was not prepared. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed regulatory amendment does not contain a collection of informationrequirement subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act(Pub. L. No. 96-511). National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with section 304(a)(2) of the Act and the provisions of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370(a)),a DEIS was prepared for the designation and the initial proposed regulations.As required by section 304(a)(2) of the Act, the DEIS included the resourceassessment report required by section 303(b)(3) of the Act, maps depictingthe boundaries of the proposed designated area, and the existing and potentialuses and resources of the area. The DEIS was made available for publicreview on August 28, 1987, with comments due on October 12, 1987. Publichearings to receive comments on the proposed designation were held in Bodega,California, on September 29, 1987, and in San Francisco, California, onSeptember 30, 1987. All comments were reviewed and, where appropriate,incorporated into the FEIS and the Sanctuary regulations published today.NOAA has determined that preparation of a supplemental EIS is needed toconsider banning oil and gas activities in the entire Sanctuary. This supplementalEIS will consider such things as the protection such a ban will affordto Sanctuary resources and the effect of such a ban on this nation's domesticenergy reserve potential and on potential lease revenues to the Treasury.It will rank the ban relative to the other options in the FEIS/MP. NOAAis preparing this supplement to the FEIS/MP under the authority of 40 CFR1502.9(c)(2) to cover the amendment being proposed today and will be issuedin draft incorporating by reference the FEIS/MP in accordance with requirementsof 40 CFR 1502.21 for public and other comments required by 40 CFR 1503.1.The availability of the draft and final supplements will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Executive Order 12612 This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Executive Order12612. Executive Order 12630 This rule does not have takings implications sufficient to require preparationof a Takings Implications Assessent under Executive Order 12630. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 942 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Marineresources, Natural resources.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog Number 11.429 Marine SanctuaryProgram)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 19, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John J.
