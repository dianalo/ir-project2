 This development couldprove a crucial aid in cracking the home computer market, since it means thata reasonably priced multimedia computer could soon be available able to carryaudio, visual and animation qualities without the need for an expensiveCD-ROM disk.andP;  This is because Bell researchers have developed a practical wayto retrieve single-page and full-motion video images from a crystal, usingholograms - three-dimensional images created with laser technology.andO;Scientists have recognised for a long time that holography could lead toimproved computer and telecommunications systems.andP;  For gaining selectiveaccess to specific data in a holographic memory system would increase thespeed with which data stored in that system could be retrieved and applied toa particular task, according to co-researcher John Wullert - at presentcomputers with hard disks assemble information line by line and only in theoriginal sequence.andP;  This means that the user must wait until all of that datahas been processed before locating a specific item.andP;  But no one has been ableto find a practical way to retrieve individual images from a hologram untilnow, because of the technical limitations of most system architectures anddevices, said co-researcher Ann Von Lehmen.andP;  While prior attempts frequentlyused bulky lasers and unwieldy light deflectors, Bell Communications'approach takes advantage of recent advancements in harnessing the power ofthe world's smallest lasers (invented by a collaborative team of Bellscientists about 15 months ago), and the refractive properties of somephotorefractive crystals, such as Gallium Arsenide and Lithium Niobate.andO;Photorefractive crystals are three-dimensional cubic structures, typicallythe size of a sugar cube, whose optical properties can be altered by light.andO;This research achievement could lead to advanced database systems withincredibly fast access times, dramatically faster computer processing, andimproved neural network-based operations systems, according to researcherEung-Gi Paek.andM;Miniature crystal-based storage systemandM;The three-person research team successfully recovered the equivalent of an 8&quot;by 11&quot; page of text from a miniature crystal-based storage system prototypein less than 1nS - about a billionth of a second.andP;  This compares with today'stypical high-powered computer system that requires about 10mS to recover adocument stored in a computer's memory.andP;  The researchers estimate that acomputer system with a holographic memory could store more than 1Gb of data -a capacity well above today's most advanced personal computers.andP;  Aphotorefractive crystal measuring one cubic centimetre could store up to amillion holographic images, which is considerably more information than canbe stored on the flat surface of a semiconductor.andP;  The new optical memorytechnique involves taking light from a tiny microlaser just 40 millionths ofan inch across and dividing it into two separate beams.andP;  Information in theform of an optical image is then carried along one of these beams, while thesecond beam serves as a reference beam for the first.andP;  Light-regulatingmodulators, which are powered by electrical current, combine the two beams inthe crystal to create three-dimensional holographic images.andP;  Such imagesresemble light and dark lines spread in microscopically thin bands.andP;  Thestored information - now a holographically recorded memory - can be retrievedat a moment's notice when illuminated by the original reference beam.andP;  Thisbeam comprises an array of micron-sized lasers with tremendous focussingcapability.andP;  The desired information is routed onto the array fortransmission to a computer display screen.andP;  The research team is refining thenew memory and retrieval technique, which will be used in continuing work onoptical neural networks - computers that use pulses of light combined withchip technology to imitate human learning processes.andP;  While conventionalcomputers can perform most calculations faster than the human brain, mostalso process information serially - that is, one piece of information at atime.andP;  The scientists anticipate that their computer storage advancement willspur creation of neural systems capable of parallel readout - performingseveral tasks simultaneously.andP;  Possible future applications include use ofthe storage process in fast high-capacity switch-ing and data-processingequipment needed to provide future multimedia telecommunications services.andP;  -andO;Katy Ring</TEXT></DOC>
