This is a people who have murdered each other by the hundreds of thousands. The reasons: Religion -- Hindu vs. Moslem. Politics -- the Sikhs want independence, the central government doesn't want to give it. Immigration -- people in the uplands don't want flatlander immigration.    There have even been murderous incidents over language, over land allotments and over the caste system's remaining influences.    It's conservatively estimated that several hundred thousand Hindus and Moslems were murdered on account of religion during the 1948 partition.    On the other side of the coin, I find it fascinating that people of color can, by dint of effort and sacrifice, rapidly climb into the American middle class from a base of relative poverty and cultural disparity; it makes our inner-city problems all the more curious by contrast.
