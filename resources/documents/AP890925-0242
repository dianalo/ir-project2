Here are some tips for getting your car into shape before thefirst leaves fall:   _Have the cooling system flushed if it hasn't been in the lasttwo years. Cleaning the system and replacing antifreeze in the fallhelps the car run smoothly in the winter.

Besure the battery has a good charge.   _Be sure your vehicle is properly tuned. A well-tuned enginestarts easier in lousy weather and runs better than a poorly tunedengine.   _Check windshield wiper blades and switch to heavy-duty ones ifdriving in snow and ice is anticipated.   _Get an oil change. It only takes a few minutes, and manybusinesses will check levels of other fluids in the vehicle at thesame time.   _During winter, frequently check the level of windshield washerfluid.   _Before cold weather sets in, check the heater's operation. Itmay get a little warm for a moment or two now, but that's betterthan starting a long trip in freezing temperatures and findingthere's going to be no heat for you and your passengers.   _Inspect tires for tread depth and uneven wear.
