The point energy Monte Carlo method was usedfor the estimation of the dose equivalent and the absorbed dose. A newapproach was adopted where band-averaged responses were calculated insteadof the previous approach which generates them as point values. The needfor interpolation of the fluence-to-dose conversion factors between thepoint values is this eliminated. Based on the depth-dose distributionsin the standard sphere, the index quantities, the newly-defined operationalquantities and the effective quality factors were evaluated. The differencesbetween the calculated indices and the previous results varied from -13%to +4% for the deep dose equivalent, and from -19% to +7% for the shallowdose equivalent. The energy dependencies of the responses were dominatedby the oxygen content in tissue due to both the resonant oxygen crosssection and the characteristic behavior of the proton quality factors.</TEXT></DOC>
