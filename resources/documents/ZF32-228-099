 With reduced instruction set computing and parallelprocessing technologies bringing increasing computing power to thedesktop, applications developers seek to create more sophisticatedgraphics programs.andP;  A need for the integration of computer systemson a global scale currently informs the adoption of picture- anddata-exchange standards.andP;  The graphical user interface acts as apowerful stimulus for the continued growth of computer graphics,as do future technologies such as virtual reality, a technologyexpected to be boosted by increasingly powerful hardware andlower-cost displays.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer GraphicsMultimedia TechnologyBusiness PlanningMarket AnalysisGraphics SystemsThree-Dimensional GraphicsVirtual RealityTrends.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Technological advances move graphics into the mainstreamandM;Just 10 years ago, computer graphics was sometimes called a technologylooking for an application.andP;  Few would venture that opinion today, as it isnearly impossible to find an area in business or industry where computergraphics cannot be applied.andM;The challenge for most computer graphics users now is to keep abreat of newtechnologies and successfully apply them to gain or maintain an edge over thecompetition.andM;It has become increasingly difficult to break computer graphics intoapplications such as computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing(CAD/CAM) or business graphics.andM;In business, the areas of statistical graphics, graphic arts, and printingand publishing are being gathered together under the flag of multimedia.andM;Price/performance is no longer the sole issue of concern for most computergraphics users.andP;  They are also looking for programs that are more interactiveand easier to use, ways to integrate their applications, and painless methodsby which they can move to new computing platforms without abandoning existingsystems.andM;The need for systems integration has led to an increased interest inpicture-and data-exchange standards such as the Computer Graphics Metafile(CGM) and the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES).andP;  These andother standards will become even more critical as the move to a globaleconomy accelerates - it will become a requirement for companies doinginternational business to be able to exchange graphical information instandard formats.andM;Parallel and RISC-based processing continue to bring more graphics power tothe desktop.andP;  The line between PCs and workstations has been blurred, perhapseven permanently eliminated, by the combination of low-cost graphicsworkstations and powerful graphics boards for PCs.andP;  Photorealistic imaging,once available only on workstations costing $100,000 or more, is nowavailable on systems in the $20,000 - $50,000 range.andP;  The ability to combinesound, animation, text and graphics for multimedia presentations is availableon systems costing as little as $2,000.andM;Computer graphics software developers are scrambling to keep up with thefrantic pace set by hardware developers.andP;  Most graphics users can do whatthey want to do now, they just want to do it easier and faster.andM;The proliferation of programs based on graphics interfaces such asMicrosoft's Windows, X-Windows and Motif, and Apple's Desktop Manager, areevidence that software vendors are responding to the ease-of-use issue.andP;  Inthe CAD/CAM worLD, feature-based systems are becoming the norm.andM;The following is a list of technologies, some new and some established, thatwill begin moving into the computer graphics mainstream over the next fewyears.andM;* Virtual reality - Still in its early stages, this technology will benefitfrom lower-cost displays and better graphics processors.andP;  Application areasfor virtual reality will include design, simulation and communication.andM;* Multimedia - This technology has tremendous potential for communicating ina society that increasingly gets its information from television.andP;  Drawbacksto multimedia acceptance include the skills needed to produce presentations,lack of standards for configuring systems and lack of a single softwarepackage that will satisfy users' needs.andM;* 3-D output - The ability to generate a three-dimensional prototype from acomputer model is revolutionizing product development.andP;  A wide range of 3-Doutput systems have hit the market, offering a greater number of choices andpromising increased accuracy, faster model generation, lower prices andsmaller unit sizes.andM;* 3-D animation - Users now have the ability to produce quality 3-D animationon PCs and low-cost workstations.andP;  The movement of this technology into themainstream of business and industry will depend primarily on improvements ininteractivity and ease of use.andM;* Photorealistic Imaging - Programs such as Pixar's Renderman are giving moreusers access to producing photorealistic images from popular CAD programssuch as AutoCAD and CADkey.andM;The relentless movement of graphics technology will continue to dramaticallychange the way we work.andP;  Just five years ago, how many people used faxmachines or desktop publishing systems?andP;  In a similar manner, key graphicstechnologies are evolving that will soon assume major roles in tomorrow'sworlds of business and industry.andM;Bob Cramblitt heads a marketing and communications firm based in Cary, N.C.,andO;that specializes in computer graphics technology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
