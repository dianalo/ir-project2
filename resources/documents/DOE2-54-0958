This effect was most pronounced at {Delta}K values lowerthan about 15 MPa{radical}m for tests conducted at a load ratio of 0.5.Hydrogen induced an intergranular fracture mode that increased in percentageof the total fracture with decreasing crack velocities at decreasing{Delta}K values. Hydrogen has been shown to induce intergranular fracturein this steel in precharged and dynamic tensile tests and in subcriticalcrack growth tests at cathodic potentials. The fatigue crack growth rateof both the hydrogen-charged and uncharged material was a function ofthe cyclic frequency between frequencies of 0.2 and 5 Hz; the fatiguecrack growth rate increased with decreasing frequencies or increasingperiod. There is some evidence that the as-received hydrogen concentrationof 1 appm affected the crack growth rate.</TEXT></DOC>
