Pleading for the American journalist and the 14 other foreignersheld in Lebanon, Peggy Say declared in an open letter to thepro-Iranian captors: ``I pray for you to have the courage to bringthis to a peaceful conclusion.'' Her appeal was published in Beirutnewspapers.   Nine of the hostages are Americans, including Anderson, the41-year-old chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.He was seized by Shiite Moslem gunmen March 16, 1985, whilereturning home from a Saturday morning game of tennis, and has beenheld the longest.   Lebanon's most influential Shiite cleric said Friday the case ofthe Western hostages should be settled if Iranian captives are freedand Israel releases Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.   ``We are hearing these days many messages and calls for therelease of the Western hostages,'' said Sheik Mohammed HusseinFadlallah, spiritual guide of Hezbollah (Party of God), believed tobe an umbrella organization for groups holding hostages.   ``We have said time and again that we want this matter closed,''Fadlallah said in a sermon at the Bir el-Abed mosque in Beirut'ssouthern slums, where most of the foreigners are thought to be held.   ``We add our voice to those calling for the release of theforeign hostages provided all captives, including Iranians in eastBeirut and Lebanese and Palestinians held by Israel, are also freed.   ``There should be no distinction among kidnap victims. Let thecry be for the release of all hostages with no discrimination. Let'streat the case from its humanitarian angle. Let us preserve thehumanity of all of the captives.'' Three Iranian Embassy diplomatsand their driver have been missing since they tried to flee Moslemwest Beirut through the Christian eastern sector during Israel's1982 invasion of Lebanon. They were stopped by Christian militiamenand are believed dead.   Hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas are in Israeliprisons.   Eight daily newspapers, including An Nidaa, which speaks for theCommunist Party, published Mrs. Say's letter.   She addressed it to ``the captors of Terry Anderson'' and said:   ``Please give Terry our message of love and concern during thisChristmas season. Tell him that thousands pray every day for thehostages, their captors and the people of Lebanon.''   An Nahar, an independent daily, published it in English andArabic. The others printed the Arabic translation.   ``We published the English text as well to give Terry a chance toread what is addressed to him,'' an editor of An Nahar said, oncondition of anonymity.   Mrs. Say's letter also said:   ``Traditionally this is a season of hope, peace and forgiveness,but there is little hope in my heart that I will see Terry and otherhostages released during these Christmas holidays.   ``It is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years ofworking and praying for freedom for Terry and the other hostages.Some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from ourgoal than ever.   ``We hear mixed messages from the Middle East and we have noclear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf ofthese innocent men.''   Addressing her brother's kidnappers _ Islamic Jihad (Islamic HolyWar) _ she said: ``Only you, their captors, can end this stalemate.We have all suffered enough. Please. May God be with you and peacebe yours.''   Hundreds of Christmas greetings for the hostages from abroadarrived at Beirut's leftist newspaper as-Safir for the thirdstraight year.   Most of them were addressed to Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, 56,of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut who was kidnapped in west Beirut June 9, 1985;and Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49, who was on a personalmission from the spiritual head of the Anglican Church when hedisappeared after leaving his west Beirut hotel Jan. 20, 1987, tonegotiate for the release of Americans.   ``To Mr. Terry Waite. We think of you often, more at this time ofthe year. We hope you are feeling better by now. Good wishesalways,'' said one card from Dorothy and Leonard Moon of Britain.   Among the greetings to Sutherland was from a Fort Collinsstudent. It said: ``Dear Tom. Don't go around thinking we haven'tremembered you. We have a day or holiday for you in Fort Collins andwe tie yellow ribbons on all the trees around the campus inremembrance of you. We also have a calendar by the field house thatcounts how many days you've been held captive until you come back.''   In London, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said ``I wouldlike Terry Waite back'' as a Christmas present.   On Thursday, families and friends of hostages made radio appealsfor their release. Among them were Mrs. Say and two freed Americanhostages, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco and David Jacobsen.</TEXT></DOC>
