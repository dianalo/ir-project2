During the first eight months of the year ending Sept. 30, the deficit totaled $119.02 billion, a drop of nearly $47 billion from $165.81 billion for the similar period in fiscal 1986. Last year, the budget's red ink ran to $220.7 billion.    &quot;It's amazing that kind of a decline has been totally ignored&quot; by traders and investors so far, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.. He predicts a deficit of $170 billion or less this year. &quot;These numbers we're seeing are substantially better than anyone thought,&quot; he said.    But the good news may be nearly over.    While tax revenues surged this year largely as a result of a change in the capital gains provision of the tax code, these receipts aren't likely to be repeated in the years ahead, Mr. Barbera and other analysts contend. Moreover, the administration and Congress remain at loggerheads over hitting targets in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act.    &quot;Markets are cynical,&quot; said Susan Hering, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., who predicts budget deficits of about $175 billion this year and at least $165 billion in 1988. &quot;No one views the current situation as a permanent improvement.&quot;    This year's smaller gap is &quot;an encouraging sign,&quot; but doesn't represent &quot;a structural reform of the budget deficit,&quot; said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He added that his recent survey of 267 institutional investment decision-makers showed that most expect the budget deficit to hover between $160 billion and $170 billion &quot;as far as the eye can see.&quot;    Progress on the deficit has been far overshadowed this year by the dollar's plunge in the foreign exchange market and growing fear about inflation. &quot;We should have had a big rally for bonds in 1987,&quot; said Mr. Barbera. &quot;We didn't see it because there's been a significant shift in capital flows&quot; into the debt markets.    While foreign capital flows this year are likely to be unchanged from about $150 billion in 1986, most of this money has come from foreign central banks instead of private investors. In addition, such funds have been invested in Treasury bills rather than bonds, Mr. Barbera said.    Nevertheless, he expects yields on actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds will move &quot;irregularly lower to 7.8% over the next six months&quot; from about 8 1/2% today. That's because the Federal Reserve &quot;won't tighten credit and the dollar will stabilize,&quot; Mr. Barbera contended.    In the long run, the budget deficit represents &quot;a big risk to the credit markets,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;Progress is coming to an end on reducing the deficit as a percentage of the gross national product. It's quite clear we aren't getting close to approaching the Gramm-Rudman targets.&quot;    H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Moseley Securities Corp. agrees. &quot;I think we are still in deep trouble on the budget deficit,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think the political process is working.&quot; He expects pressures for higher interest rates to intensify as investment managers and traders &quot;focus on the fact that we are as far from solution on the budget as we have ever been.&quot;    But some analysts contend that all the sound and fury surrounding the budget morass actually signifies nothing.    &quot;A whole lot less attention is being paid to this subject nowadays because most of the bad things that were supposed to happen with budget deficits didn't happen,&quot; observed Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., political and economic consulting firm. He contends that the size of the deficit will have much less influence on bond prices than the fate of the dollar or the direction of commodity prices.    &quot;Whether the budget deficit is $170 billion or $180 billion is a relatively trivial matter&quot; compared to the dollar and commodity prices, Mr. Reynolds said. &quot;But it's not at all trivial whether the dollar is 150 or 130 to the yen.&quot;    The Treasury this week is planning to sell $24.25 billion of notes. The financing consists of $9.75 billion of two-year notes to be sold tomorrow, $7.5 billion of four-year notes Wednesday and $7 billion seven-year notes Thursday. Many analysts and traders don't anticipate serious difficulties for the sales.    &quot;The prime catalyst is going to remain the dollar,&quot; said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. &quot;If the currency is stable, the bond market will remain stable. I expect a lackluster week as the new supply of debt is absorbed.&quot;    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Most interest rates hardly budged in another day of lethargic activity.    In the long-term bond market, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 closed at a price of 102 30/32 to yield 8.48%. That compared with Thursday's closing level of 102 27/32, where the yield was 8.49%. The Treasury's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rose slightly to 101 10/32 from 101 8/32 Thursday, as the yield declined to 8.30% from 8.31%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds advanced 0.60 point to close at 1307.81. The high for the day was 1311.22, and the low was 1304.41.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate wound up unchanged at 5.64% bid. The latest six-month bill rate fell to 5.92% bid from 5.93%.    The federal funds rate hovered around 6 3/4% most of the day. According to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc., the funds rate averaged 6.77%. That was down slightly from Thursday's average of 6.81%. The funds rate is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight. </TEXT></DOC>
