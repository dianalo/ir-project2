Many are immune from laws localcitizens must obey, some don't speak English. Disputes are inevitable,sometimes settled at gunpoint. Middle of day or middle of night, the adjudicatorof disputes is a woman of infinite patience, Gillian Sorensen.    ___</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN BARBOUR</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Ed Koch, told that Mikhail Gorbachev andhis wife, Raisa, were coming for a visit, said: ``Great. Invitethem to dinner. I'll take them to my favorite Chinese restaurant.''   While the reaction says something of the mayor's naturalexuberance, it also says a great deal of this polyglot city that ishost to the world's largest diplomatic corps, some 40,000 men,women and children from widely divergent cultures. They staff 159missions to the United Nations and 87 consulates.   If it's not easy living with 8 million New Yorkers, it's nopiece of cake for the New Yorkers either.   Many of these guests live within the sometime shelter ofdiplomatic immunity. Their various embassies are considered foreignterritory, immune from the New York police force, even cityinspectors, as is the United Nations itself. And their 1,000 carshave special areas to park, one of their privileges, which doesn'tstop them from parking illegally almost anywhere they choose.   Last year, 65,000 parking violations were issued to cars withdiplomatic plates, down from 154,000 a decade earlier, anindication of better cooperation.   The Vienna conventions do specify that the diplomats shouldrespect the laws of the host country. So diplomatic vehicles can betowed to the city pound if they threaten the health and safety, butunlike everyday New Yorkers, the erring diplomat can retrieve hiscar without cost in most circumstances.   The city concedes there is not enough diplomatic parking space.Fifty-five missions and consulates don't have any at all. But it isthe one battlefield where the host New Yorkers and their guestscross bayonets.   Not long ago, the Mexican ambassador pulled up to his designateddiplomatic parking spot in front of his residence just as a NewYorker was backing into it. The ambassador asked him to move and hewouldn't. It heated up from there. Finally the ambassador pulled agun and won back his parking place.   The person who adjudicates, mediates, calms the angry waters, isGillian Martin Sorensen, head of the city's Commission for theUnited Nations and Consular Corps. She is the wife of Ted Sorensen,a New York attorney who served in President John F. Kennedy's WhiteHouse.   Their home phone rings at all hours of the night. The diplomatic911 number seems to be ``Call Gillian.''   ``Not that it happens every night, because it doesn't,'' Ms.Sorensen says. ``But it still makes me jump because I know ifthey're calling at that hour, it's important. They know someonewill respond.''   It can be anything from a bomb threat to a diplomatic suicide ora runaway child or a heart attack. ``The daughter of the Indianambassador died the other day of an asthma attack in a matter ofminutes,'' she says.   ``If it's a towed car, we let it wait until morning.''   For her, it is an obvious labor of love. ``I learned how deeplydiplomats care about their work,'' she says. ``I learned how theimage of diplomats as high-living, socializing, striped-pants typesis far from the truth.''   As commissioner, she is a sometimes housemother to people whoare far from home, in an alien environment, vulnerable.   They have their share of stolen cars, stolen car radios, evenstolen license plates. A car belonging to Bangladesh was hijackedat knife point in October. Ms. Sorensen points out that thered-white-and-blue diplomatic plates make them highly visible.   To counteract this, one diplomat put an ``I love New York,''sticker on his bumper. So she made them available to any embassy orconsulate that wanted them. China, Haiti, India, Jordan, the HolySee and Hungary were among the first to order. Hundreds went out.   New York is not an easy environment.   During the telephone strike, there were some 80 calls fromdiplomats who couldn't get their phones installed and were out ofcommunication with their home governments.   Ms. Sorensen and her staff of 14 ``were able on a selective andemergency basis to get their phones hooked up.''   Then there was the time a water main burst and flooded thebasement of the Bulgarian Embassy where they keep important files.The water department responded quickly.   ``Another time, the Chinese Consulate in Manhattan called inconsternation,'' Ms. Sorensen remembers. ``They looked out theirwindows and to their shock there were flaming cars speeding by.''   It turned out to be a movie crew filming a chase scene. The crewhad a permit, but nobody had notified the Chinese. ``World War IIIis not breaking out,'' she reassured them.   Part of her staff's job is to cut through municipal red tape,provide advice on everything from leases to insurance to child careto provisions for the handicapped.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
