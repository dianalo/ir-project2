Mr. Bani-Sadr has appeared on&quot;Donahue,&quot; &quot;Nightline,&quot; at the National Press Club and on anational book tour to present these charges; he has alsogiven closed-door testimony to Congress.   It's surprising that anybody would consider Mr. Bani-Sadra reliable source of information on anything. If, however,his allegations about the underhanded doings of Ronald Reaganare to be taken seriously, so must his allegations about theunderhanded doings of Jimmy Carter.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bani-Sadr's book contains the striking claim thatCarter administration officials secretly supported SaddamHussein's 1980 invasion of Iran as part of a plan to restorea monarchy in Tehran. Mr. BaniSadr claims on page 13 to haveexamined a copy of this plan after his foreign minister,Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, purchased it in Paris from an unnamedSouth American for $200,000:   &quot;This plan {to reestablish a royalist regime} alsomentioned a meeting in Jordan between Zbigniew Brzezinski,President Carter's national security adviser, and SaddamHussein, two months before the Iraqi attack. There wasnothing surprising in this since Iraq could never haveattacked without a greenlight from the Americans andSoviets.&quot;                                                                                                          On page 70:                                                                                                          &quot;Just as Khomeini was certain that no one would attackIran, Saddam was sure that the war would be a simpleexercise. Who put these ideas in their heads?   &quot;We knew that Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's nationalsecurity adviser, and Saddam Hussein had met in the firstweek of July 1980.&quot;                                                                                                          And on page 94:                                                                                                          &quot;I also happened to know that Brzezinski had assuredSaddam Hussein that the United States would not oppose theseparation of Khuzestan from Iran, despite the fact thatCarter had promised to prevent our defeat.&quot;   These charges are by far the most serious made by Mr.Bani-Sadr. If the Carter administration did indeed giveSaddam Hussein a greenlight to invade Iran, that Americandecision precipitated one of the bloodiest and most bitterconflicts in recent history. Iran suffered between 1 millionand 2 million casualties, including 500,000 to 750,000 dead.Iraq probably lost roughly half as many men. Why isn't Mr.Bani-Sadr on television blasting the Carter administrationfor engineering a war that cost his country so dearly?   If Congress is willing to investigate whether theRepublicans stole the 1980 election by dealing secretly withIran, it ought also to find out for the American peoplewhether Zbigniew Brzezinski met with Saddam in Jordan in July1980, and if he did, what they discussed. After all, Mr.Bani-Sadr's two major accusations are intertwined: Withoutunderstanding that Khomeini believed that the Carteradministration had masterminded the Iraqi attack, the &quot;secretdeal&quot; with the Reagan election team makes little sense.   Was Saddam's 1980 invasion part of a Carter administrationconspiracy to overthrow the Iranian government and restorethe monarchy? Do the Democrats have the blood of a millionIranians and Iraqis on their hands? But if Mr. Bani-Sadr'saccusations against Mr. Carter are too crazy to be listenedto, why are his charges against Mr. Reagan worth hearing?   ---   Mr. Palmer is assistant branch head of the U.S. Navy'sHistorical Center in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
