(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Sharon FisherandM;While 3270 terminal emulation and X.25 data transmission may not seem to becompatible products, in fact, a number of packages currently support 3270emulation over X.25-protocol local area networks (LANs).andM;Users are beginning to discover that these two venerable protocols can workwell together to reduce costs and to ease communications problems.andM;X.25 dates back to 1974.andP;  It transmits data between two locations by dividinga message into several smaller pieces, known as packets.andP;  Each packet makesits way to its destination using the best path available at the time.andP;  Sincethis means that packets don't always arrive in order, X.25 also reassemblesthe message at the destination.andM;The route between the two destinations can be a public data network (PDN),such as Telenet or Tymnet, which can be thought of as the data equivalent ofthe telephone system.andP;  Or, the route can be a private, packet-switchednetwork, in which case the company leases telephone lines for its exclusiveuse.andP;  Generally, any destination can be reached by a number of paths, whichmakes X.25 networks reliable.andM;IBM's 3270 protocol dates back to the days of terminals and mainframes.andP;  Infact, what 3270 terminal emulation boils down to is paying several hundreddollars for a communications board that converts an intelligent PC worthseveral thousand dollars into a dumb terminal worth a few hundred.andM;This odd circumstance is required for a number of reasons.andP;  First, manyapplications on IBM mainframes have been written with 3270 terminals in mind,and it would cost far too much in staffing and time to rewrite all thoseapplications.andP;  Second, many users are accustomed to 3270 terminals, andretraining them to use PCs and new applications would also be expensive andtime-consuming.andM;Typically, users whose PCs are emulating 3270 terminals link their PCs to themainframe over a special kind of telephone link called Synchronous Data LinkControl (SDLC).andP;  Yet, to get any decent line speed or line quality, leasedlines are required.andM;Leased lines, however, have several disadvantages.andP;  First, they're expensive;the cost is generally based on distance.andM;Second, leased lines are point-to-point, meaning a company that communicateswith many different mainframes requires many different leased lines -- eachof which is expensive.andM;Finally, leased lines are difficult to get and even more expensive outside ofthe United States.andP;  If a company is trying to communicate with sales officesin Europe, for example, it must deal with a separate agency -- often part ofthe government -- for each country.andM;Users of X.25 links, on the other hand, are generally charged only by thenumber of characters sent, rather than by the distance traveled (since it canvary so much depending on the route the data takes).andM;Although X.25 links can cost more than leased lines if massive files arebeing transferred, they are usually more economical.andM;Because X.25 networks have routing built in, they are not limited topoint-to-point communication.andP;  The destination computer simply has to have aport on an X.25 network.andM;X.25 links are the standard form of computer communication in much of theworld.andP;  More than one European user, for example, has been amazed to find outhow much it costs and how long it takes to get an X.25 line in the UnitedStates.andM;Actually making the 3270/X.25 connection can be strange and awkward, however,since IBM mainframes (and mainframe personnel) aren't always accustomed tosetting up X.25 connections.andM;One of the most common ways is through Network Packet-Switching Interface(NPSI), IBM's Network Control Program (NCP) packet-switched interface.andP;  Thissoftware runs in a front-end processor attached to the IBM mainframe andcommunicates with the Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM)networking environment running on the mainframe, according to Tom Foth, asenior engineer for Microcom Software Division (formerly Relay CommunicationsInc.) of Danbury, Conn.andM;For IBM mainframes that don't support VTAM, another option is software thatperforms a similar function to NPSI but runs in the Emulator Program (EP)box, Foth explained.andP;  Finally, some mainframe vendors provide their ownimplementations of IBM's NPSI software.andM;On the PC end, communication can be via such varied methods as asynchronousmodems, synchronous modems, X.25 cards and multiprotocol cards.andP;  Generally,when a public data network provides the X.25 communication, the PC usersimply dials that (access to CompuServe using Tymnet or Telenetis gained viaX.25).andM;When a private packet-switched network provides the X.25 communication, thePC generally dials a device attached to the front-end processor attached tothe mainframe.andP;  This device breaks the message into packets on one end andreassembles the message on the other end, which is how it got its name:packet assembler-disassembler, or PAD.andP;  Think of it as similar to a modem forX.25 (although an actual modem is also required).andM;If a user has a LAN, there is often a bonus with running 3270 protocols overX.25 connections: support for a LAN gateway.andM;This means that not every PC requires its own board for communicating withthe mainframe over the X.25 network.andP;  Instead, one PC on the LAN gets severalboards, which all the users on the LAN share.andM;Because it is unlikely that all the users on the LAN want to communicate withthe mainframe simultaneously, this greatly reduces the number of boards andtelephone links required.andM;X.25 and 3270 protocols are certainly different.andP;  But instead of thinking ofthem as oil and water, perhaps we should think of them as peanut butter andchocolate -- two great protocols that work great together.andM;----------Sharon Fisher is a San Francisco-based free-lance writer specializing incomputer communications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
