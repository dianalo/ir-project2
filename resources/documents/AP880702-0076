His statement came after 468 of the refugees arrived inone day.   ``The situation in 10 days, if it goes on like this, will becritical,'' John Fortune, chief staff officer of the governmentCivil Aid Services, told Hong Kong television.   Vietnamese refugees have continued to flood this British colony,despite a tough new policy designed to keep them out.   The government considers boat people arriving after June 15 tobe illegal immigrants who will be kept in camps until Vietnamagrees to take them back. Only those fleeing religious or politicalpersecution will be granted refugee status.   Hong Kong previously considered all boat people arriving fromcommunist Vietnam to be refugees eligible for resettlement in othercountries.   Fortune expressed concern that facilities to house the growingnumber of boat people could fill up before new camps are opened.   ``I would like to emphasize that we've got to get across tothese people that they are going straight into detention,'' Fortunesaid.   ``It's absolutely ridiculous to keep on coming here. Theyarrive, they go into detention and they will be eventually all sentback to Vietnam,'' he added.   The new policy was drafted as the number of boat people soared,to about 7,800 this year through mid-June, or about 12 times thenumber who arrived during the same period last year.   During the first half of June alone, 2,850 Vietnamese boatpeople sailed into Hong Kong waters. Arrivals during the secondhalf of the month were just under 1,200, according to governmentstatistics.   On Friday, 468 boat people arrived. Another 172 sailed into thecolony Saturday, according to the government.   It was not immediately clear whether the most recent arrivalsleft Vietnam before the new policy was announced.   Lord Glenarthur, British minister of state in charge of HongKong affairs, told a news conference Friday that it was an``appalling indictment'' of the Vietnam government that its peoplewere willing to stay in crowded camps in Hong Kong rather than livein Vietnam.   The government says the overwhelming majority of boat people areso-called ``economic migrants'' fleeing Vietnam in search of abetter life.   Immigration officers Wednesday began screening new arrivals todetermine who was eligible for refugee status.</TEXT></DOC>
