The settlement effectively sweeps away the last majorlitigation clouding Genentech's marketing of its flagshipproduct, sold under the brand name Activase. In April, theSouth San Francisco, Calif.-based biotechnology companysettled a similar dispute with Wellcome PLC of London.</LP><TEXT>   Under the agreement reached with Abbott, the companiesagreed to dismiss all their respective claims. Other terms ofthe agreement weren't disclosed, and a Genentech spokeswomandeclined to say whether any money changed hands in the pact.   In November 1987, the Food and Drug Administrationapproved the marketing of Genentech's TPA as a treatment forheart attacks. The U.S. Patent Office in 1988 and 1989awarded Genentech patents covering TPA and its manufacture bymeans of gene-splicing, or recombinant DNA technology.Gene-splicing involves insertion of the gene for TPA or otherhuman proteins into micro-organisms, which then act as tinyfactories to churn out the product.   However, since 1978 Abbott Labs had been marketing anatural clot-dissolving substance called urokinase, which isextracted from urine. It also holds two patents covering adrug it calls &quot;plasminogen activator,&quot; which analysts at thetime speculated might refer to a gene-spliced version ofurokinase.   The squabble arose when Abbott claimed Genentech's TPA wasinfringing its patents. The two companies tried to resolvethe matter throughout the winter of 1987-88, but talks brokeoff when Genentech filed suit in March 1988 in federal courtin San Francisco. Genentech asked the court to declare theAbbott patents invalid, and to rule that Genentech hadn'tinfringed upon them.   Abbott countersued, charging Genentech with infringementon its patents.   Ironically, the most formidable competition to Genentech'sTPA has come from neither Wellcome nor Abbott, but from anolder clot-dissolving drug, streptokinase, made by HoechstAG. Streptokinase, which sells for about $200 a dose, hasbeen shown in recent European studies to be about aseffective as TPA, which costs more than 10 times as much.   Genentech has waged an intensive marketing campaign todiscredit that study, arguing that the study failed toobserve the current standard U.S. medical practice ofadministering TPA in conjunction with the blood-thinningagent heparin.   TPA, while a strong revenue source for Genentech, neverrealized the company's original dream of a billion dollarproduct. In the second quarter ended June 30, TPA salestotaled $48.3 million, about flat with the year-earlierperiod, but down from 1990 first quarter sales of $54.9million.</TEXT></DOC>
