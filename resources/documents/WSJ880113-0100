Lawrence Siskind, special counsel for immigration-related unfair employment practices, accused the airline of hiring U.S. citizens over noncitizens to fill pilots' jobs in 1987. All 49 pilots hired by the airline last year were U.S. citizens, the counsel said.    Separately, he charged the airline violated the law last August when it refused to hire as a pilot Zeki Yeni Komsu, a native of Turkey who was legally in the U.S. as a permanent resident alien. At the same time, the counsel charged, Mesa was hiring U.S. citizens with similar qualifications.    The cases are the first the counsel has filed under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. When Congress enacted the bill, which imposed sanctions against employers of illegal immigrants, lawmakers worried it would cause a rise in discrimination against foreign-looking job applicants. So Congress created the special counsel to seek penalties against employers who discriminate against persons because they lack U.S. citizenship. The counsel also handles charges of discrimination due to national origin for employers of four to 14 persons.    In Farmington, a spokesman for the airline said the company hadn't seen the complaint. But, he said, the dispute boils down to a difference in interpretation of how the act should be implemented. In addition, he said, Mr. Komsu wasn't hired for reasons other than his lack of citizenship.    The administrative complaint against Mesa Airlines is due to be heard by an Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing officer. The complaint seeks $1,000 per violation, back pay and benefits to all victims of discrimination, and a court order barring such activity. A decision can be appealed to a federal circuit court.    Mr. Siskind said his office is investigating or seeking more information on 53 claims of discrimination, has settled two and dropped nine for lack of proof. </TEXT></DOC>
