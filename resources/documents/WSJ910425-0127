The suit was brought by Craddock-Terry Shoe Corp., now inbankruptcy court in Lynchburg, Va., against former directorsand other shareholders who sold the company to a buy-outgroup in 1986. The company claimed that the sellingshareholders were paid such a high price for their stake thatthe surviving company couldn't possibly pay off its resultingdebts.</LP><TEXT>   But after considering written evidence and holdinghearings, U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser of Lynchburg,Va., ruled that the defendants couldn't be compelled toreturn the cash they received in the deal. Bankruptcy lawyerssaid that the ruling is likely to be cited by defendants inother such cases, few of which have reached the trial stage.   While Virginia's law is slightly different from that inother states, the Craddock-Terry case is similar to casespending over the failed buy-outs of Revco D.S. Inc. andWieboldt Stores Inc., among other companies. In such&quot;fraudulent conveyance&quot; cases, the plaintiffs generallyallege that people who benefited from a buy-out did so withthe knowledge -- or the reason to know -- that the resultingcompany wouldn't be able to survive.   Under Virginia law, the judge said, a suit can't succeedunless the company received nothing of legal value for whatit paid to buy out former shareholders or unless theparticipants intended to commit fraud at the time of thetransactions. In this case, he said, the company received newmanagement and an infusion of capital. &quot;While the investmentdid not work out well for {the buy-out group's} creditors, itwas neither fraudulent nor unlawful at the time it occurred,&quot;the judge wrote.   Virginia Powell, a Richmond lawyer representing the formerCraddock-Terry directors, said the court's decision indicatesthat &quot;a transaction cannot be set aside merely because thedeal was highly leveraged and the surviving company performedpoorly.&quot;   The Craddock-Terry suit was brought against 45 of itsformer shareholders who received amounts ranging from $6,000to $6 million each in the leveraged buy-out. The successorcompany, C-T of Virginia Inc., has been in Chapter 11bankruptcy proceedings since 1987 and hasn't filed a plan ofreorganization.   Harold Bonacquist, the New York lawyer for the company,said his client hasn't decided whether to appeal. He saidthat while the decision &quot;is not good news for plaintiffs inVirginia,&quot; it did not have wide implications for litigationinvolving failed buy-outs. But Sandra Mayerson, a New Yorklawyer who is a court-appointed examiner in the Interco Inc.bankruptcy proceedings, said that if other courts follow thejudge's ruling, it will make it difficult for plaintiffs towin.   Ms. Mayerson also noted that Judge Kiser considered eachelement of the buy-out separately, such as the bank'sfinancing of the deal, the creation of a buy-out company,shareholders' tendering of their stock and actual payment toshareholders. He found that each element, taken by itself,was properly structured and that there was no broaderevidence of fraudulent intent on anyone's part.   In contrast, Ms. Mayerson said, some other courts havesaid that all the elements of a deal should be consideredtogether to determine whether the overall effect is to renderthe company insolvent. She said Judge Kiser's view, if widelyadopted, would mean that properly structured deals couldn'tbe attacked even if the overall effect of the transaction wasto leave the company insolvent.   ---   POWER FAILURE spawns lawsuit by businesses claiminglosses.   A group of small businesses on the island of Oahu suedHawaiian Electric Co. to recover $75 million in damagesincluding lost profits allegedly caused by an islandwideelectric power failure that lasted up to 12 hours on April 9.   Five plaintiffs, including four restaurant concerns and alaundry machine company, are seeking certification of thesuit as a class action. The class would include all of theutility's business customers on Oahu, said plaintiff attorneyPaul Devens.   The suit, filed Friday in state court in Honolulu, accusesthe utility of negligence and breach of contract. Theblackout occurred because Hawaiian Electric failed &quot;toproperly maintain its utility easements . . . includingcontrol of natural growth of trees that came in contact withelectric wires and lines,&quot; the suit states.   A spokesman for the utility's parent, Hawaiian ElectricIndustries Inc. of Honolulu, said that investigations intothe cause of the outage are continuing, but that the&quot;probable cause&quot; was trees that interfered with power lines.The company's general counsel declined to comment on thesuit.   Customer lawsuits against utilities resulting from poweroutages are rare, but not unprecedented, said a spokesman forthe Edison Electric Institute, a Washington trade group. Mostfailures are due to storms and other natural causes thataren't legal torts, he said.   Commonwealth Edison Co. said it has agreed to settle twoclass-action lawsuits stemming from power outages last summerin Chicago for a total of about $4 million. The utilitydidn't admit any liability, but settled to avoid protractedlitigation and legal fees. Consolidated Edison of New Yorksaid it paid out a total of $2 million to settle more than550 cases brought after a 1977 blackout in New York.   ---   JUDICIAL CANDIDATE wins fight to express views duringcampaign.   A federal judge in Philadelphia struck down a Pennsylvanialaw that severely restricted what judicial candidates couldtell voters about their legal or political views. The law waspatterned after a model code of judicial conduct drafted bythe American Bar Association in 1972 that was adopted tovarying degrees by states that elect trial judges.   Samuel C. Stretton, a lawyer and candidate for a seat onthe Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, challenged thelaw as an unconstitutional violation of his right to freespeech. Mr. Stretton said the law prevented him from statinghis position on key political and social issues.   The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court ofPennsylvania -- represented by the state Attorney General'sOffice -- contended that the law was valid because itprohibited candidates from committing themselves on legal andpolitical issues that they might have to rule on as judges.   U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer of Philadelphia,however, ruled that the law's restrictions were too broad andtoo vague. The ruling applies only to the Pennsylvania law,although it may encourage challenges in other states. &quot;Thereare an array of less restrictive means to preserve the factand appearance of judicial impartiality which do not imposean unconstitutional restriction upon a judicial candidate'sFirst Amendment rights,&quot; the judge said in his opinion.   Judge Newcomer upheld the section of the law that barscandidates from personally soliciting campaign funds.   ---   AIRPORT DISPUTE over landing fees is settled.   The settlement of a class-action suit involving landingfees imposed on small aircraft at Boston's Logan Airport willprovide plaintiffs with about $3 million.   The dispute stems from a plan instituted by theMassachusetts Port Authority in 1988 to reduce congestion byinducing commuter airlines and private planes to switch toother airports in the Boston area. The program prompted aflurry of litigation brought by operators of small aircraftarguing that the increased landing fees were discriminatory.   The litigation was closely watched because other largeairports face problems similar to Logan's and because thePort Authority's revised fees were based not just onequipment weight, the traditional standard, but also onoperational costs.   In late 1988, the U.S. Department of Transportation ruledthat the fees were unlawful, and that decision was upheld bya federal appeals court. Some 20 commuter airlines and theoperators of six or seven thousand other airplanes that seatfewer than 30 people will be entitled to refunds, accordingto Raymond J. Rasenberger, of the Washington law firmZuckert, Scoutt andamp; Rasenberger, who represented the smallaircraft operators.   Roscoe Trimmier, a partner at the Boston law firm Ropes andamp;Gray, said that his client, the Port Authority, has an&quot;informal understanding&quot; with major carriers that it will bereimbursed for a portion of the settlement.   ---   UNEMPLOYED LAWYERS are offered extra training by a lawschool.   Fordham University School of Law, reflecting themarketplace realities of the lean '90s, is cutting a specialdeal for lawyers hit by the recent wave of layoffs. The lawschool will charge lawyers only $25 for continuing legaleducation courses, intended to help practicing lawyers keepabreast of changes in various practice areas. Typically, thefees for the courses range from $65 to $200.   &quot;The courses won't make them experts,&quot; said Ronne Kaplan,director of Fordham's continuing legal education office. &quot;Butoutside of being trained in a firm, there really isn't a wayfor a lawyer to learn a new discipline.&quot;   ---   NOTED: After delivering a 10-minute argument in a casebefore the U.S. Supreme Court, Attorney General DickThornburgh said he is &quot;considering&quot; whether to run for theU.S. Senate seat formerly held by Pennsylvania RepublicanJohn Heinz, who was killed in an air crash April 4.</TEXT></DOC>
