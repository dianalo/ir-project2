The proposal comes at an especially sensitive time. The Federal Reserve Banks have been quietly pressuring banks with low reserve levels to build them up following the $1.6 billion in write-offs of debt owed by developing nations in the second quarter.    H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner in Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, a New York law firm, said, &quot;This rule could have serious ramifications for how banks operate, particularly with regard to less-developed country debt. If adopted, there would be a significant likelihood of legal challenge to the rule.&quot;    Added an accountant who works with major banks: &quot;Right now, it's total confusion out there among banks on what to do about reserve levels and the various options in the debt reduction plan for Mexico. This action by the comptroller further muddies the waters.&quot;    Under the comptroller's proposal, provisions for loan losses would be deducted from calculations for determining banks' capacity to pay dividends. Heretofore, banks deducted only actual charge-offs for bad assets when calculating dividend capacity. If a bank were forced to suspend its dividend payment, its stock price could plummet, undermining confidence in it.    Although the comptroller's rule nominally applies just to national banks, state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System would also be affected unless the Fed takes exception to the comptroller's action. The comptroller is expected to act on the change later this fall. Lawrence Senter, an examiner in the comptroller's policy and research office, said the change in the treatment of loan-loss provisions is intended to harmonize federal law with the new risk-based capital guidelines adopted for international banks. Under the new guidelines, loan-loss reserves aren't counted as capital because they are set aside for anticipated losses.    &quot;If you're making provisions for expected losses, you shouldn't be able to use the provision to calculate a bank's dividend capacity,&quot; Mr. Senter said. &quot;You can't have your cake and eat it, too.&quot;    Speculation has been rife over whether big U.S. banks will replenish their loan-loss reserves in the third and fourth quarters, following the 20% write-off of their Argentine loans in the second quarter. Most banks, following Citicorp's lead, took the write-offs against their reserves without taking a charge against earnings for a significant increase in their quarterly provision to the reserve.    As a result, the reserve coverage for developing nation loans has been dropping at most banks. Notably, several banks, including Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp., have boosted their coverage for such loans.    Pressure on U.S. banks' reserves intensified in the second quarter as the big British banks boosted their reserves for developing nation debt to 50% or more of their exposure. At the dozen largest U.S. banks, reserve coverage for developing nation debt currently ranges from 19% at Manufacturers Hanover Corp. to 38% at Security Pacific Corp., according to IBCA Inc., a bank ratings concern.    Unlike U.S. banks, British banks can take advantage of tax benefits when they make reserve additions. U.S. banks only receive tax benefits when bad loans are written off.    Moreover, U.S. banks may be loath to make big reserve additions right now because they have spent the past 15 months rebuilding their capital base following the last big round of reserve-building. </TEXT></DOC>
