Gold prices finished slightly higher. Republic National Bank ofNew York quoted a bid of $429.30 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4p.m. EDT, up from $428.80 late Wednesday.   The dollar had been losing ground but radically changeddirection upward when several of the nation's leading banks hikedtheir prime lending rate to 10 percent, up half a percentage pointto its highest level in more than three years.   ``When the prime came out, people rushed to buy dollars and wehad a rally, but that just ended up giving sellers a better levelto sell at,'' said George DeLuna, a vice president at Irving TrustCo.   The currency was unable to sustain the gains. Statements by WestGerman Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and continued talk of aGroup of Seven meeting also had a dampening effect on the dollar.   Stoltenberg's comments to reporters that further increases inthe dollar would be ``problematic'' pushed the currency lower bothin Europe and at home.   And rumors that the dollar's strength would be the topic ofdiscussion at a meeting of the Group of Seven major industialnations _ the United States, Japan, Great Britain, West Germany,France, Italy, and Canada _ continued to circulate even though nomeeting has been scheduled.   Traders speculated that at least one central bank had enteredthe market during the trading session. While it was unclear whetherthe Federal Reserve was on hand selling dollars, DeLuna said,``whoever did it did a good job of concealing who they were.'' Hesaid the dollar was sold mainly against the West German mark, butother currencies also were affected.   Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bankin Chicago, said all the rumors ``basically got the market prettynervous,'' and the dollar fell through several technical resistancelevels.   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,the dollar fell 0.85 yen to a closing 134.07 yen. Later in London,it was quoted lower at 133.65 yen. In New York, the dollar closedat 132.74 yen, down from 133.68 yen on Wednesday.   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound.
