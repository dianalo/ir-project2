Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Ms. Comaneci, aformer Olympic star, had been granted refugee status and was ``inthe air on her way to this country.''   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Ms.Comaneci, who complained of repression in her homeland, was grantedrefugee status by U.S. consular officers in Europe.   The officials said Ms. Comaneci, 28, was en route to New Yorkfrom Vienna.   Ms. Comaneci and six other Romanians crossed the border intoHungary on Tuesday and went into hiding.   The officials had no information on where Ms. Comaneci made herrequest to come to the United States. As a refugee, she isconsidered by U.S. officials to have a well-founded fear ofpersecution if she returns to her homeland, whose hard-line Marxistgovernment has rejected the reformist tide sweeping other EastEuropean countries.   The officials said Ms. Comaneci will be eligible to apply forpermanent resident status in the United States in one year.   At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, she earned the firstperfect score ever given to a gymnast. She won three gold medals atMontreal and two gold and two silver medals four years later in theMoscow games.   At one point after Ms. Comaneci's flight to Hungary, it wasthought she would eventually make her way to the United States withher former coach, Bela Karolyi, who defected to America in 1981.Karolyi was in Stuttgart, West Germany, coaching the U.S. women'sgymnasts in a meet.   ``Bela's kids are competing tomorrow and Sunday,'' U.S.Gymnastics Federation spokesperson Patti Auer said Friday, ``so heis not coming back with her. That much we know.''   Because of her achievements, Ms. Comaneci was named a ``Hero ofSocialist Labor'' by President Nicolae Ceausescu, the hard-lineRomanian leader.   Ms. Comaneci won a total of 21 gold medals in Olympic and otherinternational meets during her career, which won her a life ofprivilege in a country that has endured chronic shortages ofconsumer goods for most of this decade.</TEXT></DOC>
