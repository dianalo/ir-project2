The San Diego-based unit, General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services Inc., will among other things, provide mission analysis and mission management services necessary for launching U.S. and foreign satellites.    Last summer, St. Louis-based General Dynamics announced plans to build 18 rockets over the next five years to launch communications satellites as part of a plan to gain a foothold in the commercial space business.    In September, the company received its first firm order to launch a satellite on its Atlas-Centaur rocket, in a contract with a potential value of as much as $177 million. The company was later chosen by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch as many as five satellites for as much as $315 million. </TEXT></DOC>
