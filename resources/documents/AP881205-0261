In spite of brave talk about videotex, picture phones and fiberlinks to the home, the ordinary telephone will continue to hold swayas the most important communications device in the home and office.   Consider that the telephone, backed by a worldwide network worthhundreds of billions of dollars, permits any person to contact anyother person simply by picking up a receiver and dialing a series ofdigits.   Nothing on the horizon promises to rival the telephone as adevice for allowing meetings of the mind, whether between corporatechiefs or members of the Monday bridge club.   ``We will come to realize by the year 2000 the excitement of thetelephone. We take it for granted too much,'' said Michael Noll, aprofessor at the University of Southern California's AnnenbergSchool of Communications.   The 1984 breakup of the Bell System probably sped up theintroduction of new communications technologies, but many of thechanges would have come anyway in response to global competition andthe demands of customers.   The telephone of the future will be more useful than the phone of1988 because of the spread of answering machines and computerizedfeatures such as voice mail, which allows a person to record amessage and have it stored and forwarded at will.   Cellular phones will be so common by the year 2000 that it willbe ordinary for people to make and receive phone calls from trains,planes and canoes.   Facsimile machines that are hooked to the phone network willcontinue to spread, cutting into the business of overnight deliveryservices.   Another old-time communication device, the television, willcontinue to hold sway in the coming era, only the picture and soundwill be better. (The content will probably be about the same, forbetter or worse.)   Human nature will delay the spread of other long-promisedcommunications advances, much to the disappointment of technologybuffs.   For example, the 20-year-old picture phone is likely to reach its40th birthday without finding its way into every home, even if thequality of the picture is much improved.   ``The problem is not technology; it's human behavior,'' Nollsaid. ``People would rather not be seen while talking on the phone.''   Some thinkers are more optimistic about picture phones. ``Isimply cannot believe that people voluntarily will reduce the amountof information they can get by talking to each other,'' said EliNoam, a member of the New York state Public Service Commission onleave from Columbia University.   After repeated failures, videotex is likely to find a niche. Butagain, human nature will probably limit the potential of thetechnology. Many people still want to deal with another person whenthey bank or make airline reservations, even if it would be fasterto do it on a home terminal.   As for getting information on a videotex terminal, the biggestmarket is likely to be business-related research. The day whenpeople read their daily news on a terminal instead of a front pageseems far off.   The biggest bust for the remainder of this century will probablybe the extension of glass fiber cables to homes and smallbusinesses. Fiber can carry thousands of times more information thanthe kind of old-fashioned copper cables that have been in use fordecades, but it is not clear why the extra capacity is urgentlyneeded.   Phone companies say the extra ``bandwidth'' offered by fiberwould permit companies to offer specialized services, such asmonitoring burglar alarms and thermostats from central locations.But those services and most others could easily be handled overexisting cables.   High-quality video is the one thing that could take advantage ofthe huge capacity of fiber. But cable TV subscribers already getvideo coming into their homes on a cable _ even if it does not havequite the carrying capacity of optical fiber.   Direct satellite broadcast is another way to deliver high-qualityvideo into homes without the huge cost of installing fibers. So areimproved video cassette recorders.   Bringing fiber to the home would require replacing 52 millionmiles of existing copper cables, estimated Richard J. Solomon, aresearch associate at the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyMedia Lab.   It will happen, he said, but probably not for 20 or 30 years.   ``There's a horrible tendency to try to take what we have andextend it (in making predictions). What usually happens is there's awhole leap to a brand new technology,'' Noll said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
