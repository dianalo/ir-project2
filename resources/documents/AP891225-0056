Bennett cited 20 people ``on the true front lines'' of the waron drugs for their grass roots efforts, proving that ``It ispossible to fight back _ even to win.''   ``These people are not angels,'' Bennett said in a statementreleased Monday. ``They are not saints. They are men and women whohave seen their communities ravaged by drugs and they have decidedto act.   ``These Americans have figured out what armchair critics havenot. It is possible to fight back _ even to win.''   Bennett said he met those cited during his travels to some threedozen cities throughout the country since the drug control strategyhe developed was presented to the nation by President Bush on Sept.5.   The 20, with background from the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy, are:   _Robert Armstrong, director of the Omaha Housing Authority, who``implemented non-nosense eviction policies and went after knownpushers'' whom, he said, ``nobody else wanted to touch. Once we got'em out, the other residents knew we were serious, and theyappreciated it.''   _Alvin Brooks, founder of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime inKansas City, Mo., also helped start Black Men Together, which isintended to offer role models for young blacks. Members of BlackMen Together walk some drug-infested streets, toting bull horns andwarning drug dealers to get off the street.   _Jack Candelaria, president of the South San Jose NeighborhoodAssociation in Albuquerque, N.M., who brought members of his grouptogether with police to win establishment of a police sub-stationin the neighborhood. Today, police and residents work closelytogether, and Police Chief Sam Baca said, ``months will go by whenthe police don't receive calls about drug pushing in theneighborhood'' which was once overrun by dealers.   _The Rev. George Clements, pastor of Holy Angels Church andSchool in Chicago, who led a boycott of stores in Chicago's SouthSide selling drug paraphernalia after he found that all of hisparishioners had relatives who were either hooked on drugs or haddied because of them. Despite death threats, Clements said, ``We,the citizens, have to get out there and let people know that wereally mean business. ... There are more of us than there are ofthem. Their only weapon is fear. They've conned us into thinkingthey're invincible. They're not. They're cowards, and once thecommunity stands up against them, they tuck their tails betweentheir legs and run.''   _Dorothy Davis, organizer of STOP Crime Watch in Dallas, andAssistant Chief of Police Sam Gonzales. Davis started STOP CrimeWatch after a 12-year-old girl was killed by drug violence in 1988.The grass roots anti-crime and anti-drug organization has helpedcity police and other city agencies in Operation CLEAN, Communityand Law Enforcement Against Narcotics, an effort to root out drugoffenders from targeted residential neighborhoods.   _Edward Johnson, organizer of the Fairlawn Coalition inWashington, D.C., which patrols the streets of the tough Anacostiasection. Members wear bright orange baseball caps, carry radios,video cameras and binoculars and confront drug dealers and userswith stares instead of verbal or physical confrontation. They havedriven the drug buyers out, according to coalition founder JamesForeman. ``This is one program where police and citizens workingtogether bring people closer to law enforcement and let people seethat police are human,'' Johnson said. ``The police know that thepeople here will give them water or coffee and help them to dotheir job better.''   _Ray Leary and Tony Hopson, directors of Self Enhancement, Inc.,in Portland, Ore., a program designed to provide young people withalternatives to gang and drug involvement. ``We want to showchildren that there is a sense of value to their lives,'' Learysaid.   _The Rev.
