Joaquin Villalobos, a leader of the rebel Farabundo NationalLiberation Front, said the government's offer amounted to no morethan ``a call for unconditional surrender.''   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, who is heading the governmentdelegation for the talks that are to last through today, called theproposal ``serious and responsible.''   The rebels proposed a series of military, economic, politicaland legal reforms directed toward achieving peace and democracy.   A source close to the rebels said today the proposal includesremoval of top military chiefs who are directing the war. Theyinclude Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios; Gen. Juan RafaelBustillo, the air force commander, and numerous brigade commanders.   A copy of the government offer obtained by The Associated Presscalls for the rebels to cease hostilities by Wednesday, demobilizeimmediately and organize to participate in elections and thecountry's political life.   The proposal promises only to ``halt military operations withoutprejudice that the armed forces carry out their constitutionalduties.''   It implicitly rejects a rebel proposal for a cease-fire inexchange for a government promise to undertake wide political andsocial reforms, purge the armed forces of rightist officers andnegotiate a permanent end to hostilities.   ``Basically, the government proposal is to stop the fighting,without basis or discussion _ simply silence the guns. This is anabsurd, illogical and inflexible scheme,'' Villalobos said.   Government spokesman Juan Martinez Varela denied the offer wasmerely a scheme to get the rebels to lay down their weapons. ``Weare not asking anyone to surrender,'' he said, but refused toanswer further questions.   This was the second round of talks between the two sides sincePresident Alfredo Cristiani took office in June for a five-yearterm.   Three separate peace meetings from 1984 to 1987 with hispredecessor, former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, also ended indeadlock for similar reasons.   This time, however, both sides appeared eager for an earlycease-fire in the war that has cost more than 70,000 lives, most ofthem civilian.   In last month's first round in Mexico City, with Roman CatholicChurch leaders acting as mediators, the two sides agreed to talksat 30-day intervals after this round until a peace accord isreached.   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 NobelPeace Prize for his efforts to achieve peace in Central America,opened Monday's meeting at a Roman Catholic parish house inMoravia, a town six miles northeast of San Jose.   ``I know that you are going to want to bury that past becauseyou don't want to be leaving here accomplices in the continuationof the war, the pain, the tears and the death,'' he said.   Attending as witnesses on Monday were Salvadoran Catholicbishops Gregorio Rosa Chavez and Marcos Rene Revelo and thesecretary of the Papal Nuncio's office in San Jose, MonsignorVicente Juan Segura.   Alvaro de Soto of the United Nations and Ricardo Givoje of theOrganization of American States attended as international observers.</TEXT></DOC>
