At the conclusion of a special shareholder meeting, M. Thomas Moore, president and chief executive officer, said that on the basis of proxies management had voted, the current board was retained by &quot;a significant margin.&quot;    David Bolger, a New Jersey investor who owns about one million shares, or 6.4% of the total outstanding, called the meeting to oust the current board and force a restructuring of the company. After the meeting, he indirectly conceded that management won the vote.    Cleveland-Cliffs shareholders appear to want a restructuring, as Mr. Bolger proposed, but they decided that the current board and management were best equipped to carry out the plan. The company is primarily an iron ore producer, but it also has interests in lumber, oil and gas drilling and coal.    Three stockholders, one of them a Cleveland-Cliffs employee, spoke in support of management. They said management has &quot;the proper connections&quot; in the iron ore industry, the support of the communities in which it operates and the ability to get top performance from employees.    The meeting was adjourned until 11 a.m. EST Tuesday for final tabulation of the vote.    Mr. Moore said after the meeting that the company will proceed simultaneously with a restructuring and with efforts to sell the entire company. The company plans to carry out the restructuring in the 1988 first quarter, he said. There's also a possibility that the restructured iron ore company will be sold after other assets have been liquidated or spun off to shareholders, Mr. Moore said.    Several companies, both foreign and domestic, have expressed interest in the possible purchase of some or all of the company, Mr. Moore said. He declined to say who the interested parties are.    Mr. Bolger said he had accomplished much of what he set out to do by forcing management to undertake a restructuring, passing along to shareholders assets that have been &quot;locked away&quot; in the company. He said he will &quot;keep their (management's) feet to the fire,&quot; to see that a restructuring is accomplished. He threatened a proxy fight at the annual meeting next April if the company doesn't carry through with its plan. &quot;I won't go away until our goals are achieved,&quot; he said.    Mr. Moore said management advocated a restructuring after discussions with shareholders indicated &quot;a desire for an early return&quot; on their investment. &quot;We have a changing mix of shareholders,&quot; he said, with institutions currently holding 65% to 70% of the company's shares. They have &quot;a shorter-term strategy&quot; than the company's traditional, &quot;long-term oriented shareholders,&quot; Mr. Moore said.    Management's restructuring plan calls for distribution to shareholders of $123 million obtained from the sale of the company's electric power assets, either as a dividend of about $7.50 a share, or through a partial tender offer. Cleveland-Cliffs, like many old mining companies, generated much of its own electric power.    The company's oil and gas drilling business would be spun off to shareholders as a separate concern, or the assets would be sold and proceeds distributed to shareholders. In addition, the company's 26% stake in MLX Corp. would be passed along to Cleveland-Cliffs common shareholders as a dividend.    Also, shareholders would receive any proceeds from the company's bankruptcy-law claims. Cleveland-Cliffs was a partner in iron ore ventures with several steel companies that have filed for bankruptcy court protection, and it has claims against those concerns.    The company would make a tender offer for its preferred shares at $21.40 a share. Most of the more than $50 million required to retire the preferred stock would be borrowed, Mr. Moore said. At the same time, the company would restructure existing bank loans.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cleveland-Cliffs closed at $13.75 a share, down 50 cents.    Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald andamp; Co., said he thinks shareholders will get about $9 a share in the first quarter, mainly in cash and the MLX stock. In the long term, stock in the drilling company may have value, he said, but he isn't assigning much value to it at this point. And it's practically impossible to assign a value to the possible bankruptcy recoveries, Mr. Millis added.    The restructured company would operate iron ore mines in Minnesota, Upper Michigan and Canada. It would have a debt to equity ratio of more than one-to-one, Mr. Moore said, but it wouldn't be as highly leveraged as some restructured companies. </TEXT></DOC>
