FDA is issuing this finalrule after considering public comments on the agency's proposed regulation,which was issued in the form of a tentative final rule, and all new dataand information on aphrodisiac drug products that have come to the agency'sattention.

The notice was based on the recommendations of the AdvisoryReview Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (MiscellaneousInternal Panel), which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluatingdata on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons wereinvited to submit comments by December 30, 1982. Reply comments in responseto comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by January31, 1983.In accordance with andSection; 330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.The agency's proposed regulation, in the form of a tentative final rule,for OTC aphrodisiac drug products was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2168). Interestedpersons were invited to file by May 15, 1985, written comments, objections,or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugsregarding the proposal. Interested persons were invited to file commentson the agency's economic impact determination by May 15, 1985. New datacould have been submitted until January 15, 1986, and comments on the newdata until March 17, 1986. Final agency action occurs with the publicationof this final rule on OTC aphrodisiac drug products.As discussed in the proposed regulation for OTC aphrodisiac drug products(50 FR 2168), the agency advised that the drug products covered by thisregulation would be subject to the regulation effective 6 months afterthe date of publication of the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after January 8, 1990, no OTC drug productsthat are subject to this final rule may be initially introduced or initiallydelivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless they are thesubject of an approved new drug application (NDA). If, in the future, anyingredient is determined to be generally recognized as safe and effectivefor use in an OTC aphrodisiac drug product, the agency will promulgatean appropriate regulation at that time.In response to the proposed rule on OTC aphrodisiac drug products, 35 consumersand 2 health care groups submitted comments. Requests for oral hearingbefore the Commissioner were also received on seven different issues. Copiesof the comments and the hearing requests received are on public displayin the Dockets Management Branch. Additional information that has cometo the agency's attention since publication of the proposed rule is alsoon public display in the Dockets Management Branch.In proceeding with this final rule, the agency has considered all objections,requests for oral hearings, and the changes in the procedural regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>1. Numerous comments requested that the notice of proposed rulemaking foraphrodisiac drug products for OTC use be withdrawn or, as an alternative,that a new Panel be convened with ``appropriate,'' qualified experts includingnutritionists, herbalists, sexologists, or physicians with expertise insex therapy. The comments contended that the Miscellaneous Internal Panellacked expertise in the fields relevant to the use of aphrodisiacs, andbecause the Panel did not consult a ``biochemist, physician, psychologist,or other scientist with successful clinical experience using nutritionalaphrodisiacs,'' it was in violation of FDA's own regulations under 21 CFR330.10(a) which require that the Commissioner appoint ``qualified experts''to the panel. The comments contended that the food supplement industry,food manufacturers, and the public have been denied the benefits of a fullscientific discourse on aphrodisiac products by qualified experts in thefield. The comments also requested a hearing on these issues before theCommissioner.The comments further stated that the Miscellaneous Internal Panel, whichwas mandated to cover a wide variety of drugs, ranging from weight reductioningredients to smoking deterrents, was a biased panel that regarded aphrodisiacsas a ``throw away'' as shown by the fact that only two studies on aphrodisiacswere reviewed, when additional data were available. Stating that the agency``does not like'' aphrodisiac products, the comments claimed that the rathershort ``shrift'' given these products by the Panel, along with the factthat none of the Panel members were experts in this field, suggests thatthe agency may have prejudged the entire issue of the safety and effectivenessof OTC aphrodisiacs.The agency has determined that the Miscellaneous Internal Panel was qualifiedto review OTC aphrodisiac drug products and that such a panel was not inviolation of FDA regulations. The Panel was composed of pharmacists andphysicians. Although the Panel reviewed a wide variety of drugs, and Panelmembers were not specialists in aphrodisiac drug products, the agency believesthat the scientific background and knowledge of the Panel were sufficientto provide an impartial and scientific review of the various classes ofdrug products that were evaluated. Further, representatives of consumerand industry interests served as nonvoting members of the Panel, and thePanel utilized consultants in pharmacognosy and statistics. In summary,the Panel was chosen carefully to insure representation from a varietyof groups, and the Panel called upon individuals with expertise in otherfields as necessary.All interested parties had the opportunity to appear before the Panel,but none made such a request. Further, no submissions of data were madeto the Panel. The Panel on its own initiative found seven references concerningaphrodisiacs (47 FR 43572 at 43575). The agency reviewed two additionalreferences that were submitted in response to the Panel's report (50 FR2168 at 2169). Furthermore, as part of its review for this final rule,the agency has evaluated additional materials in this document. (See comment8 below.)The comments' contention that the entire issue of the safety and efficacyof OTC aphrodisiacs may have been prejudged by the agency is not supportedby any factual basis. The agency concludes that this drug category hasbeen reviewed in accordance with the administrative procedures set forthin 21 CFR 330.10 in the same manner as all other OTC drug categories includedin the agency's OTC drug review program. Thus, the agency has not treatedaphrodisiacs differently from any other class of drugs in the OTC drugreview.The agency also concludes that a hearing on this issue is not warranted.The comment related only to procedural matters and did not identify anyfactual issues relating to the safety or effectiveness of OTC aphrodisiacdrug products.2. One comment objected to the inclusion of topical aphrodisiacs in theproposed rulemaking for OTC aphrodisiac drug products (50 FR 2168 at 2169)on the grounds that neither the Panel nor the agency suggested inclusionof topical aphrodisiacs in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking forOTC aphrodisiac drug products (47 FR 43572). The comment stated that thePanel repeatedly indicated throughout its deliberations that only systemicaphrodisiacs would be considered, and that the advance notice of proposedrulemaking indicated that the rulemaking was restricted to products takeninternally [or for oral use] (47 FR 43572). The comment contended thatexpanding the scope of the proposed regulation at the notice of proposedrulemaking stage to include topical aphrodisiacs as well as those takeninternally violates standard administrative law principles of notice, isinconsistent with the requirement that the agency follow its own rules,and is not supported by adequate evidence or by the record. The commentrequested a hearing on this matter before the Commissioner.The agency disagrees with the comment. At the same time that the agencypublished its first call-for-data notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> requesting data on aphrodisiacs for internaluse (38 FR 31696), the agency also requested data on all external OTC drugproducts ``not previously the subject of a request for data and informationfor this OTC Review'' (38 FR 31697). Any views regarding topical aphrodisiacscould have been presented at that time. A second opportunity for presentingdata and information occurred when the agency made a second request forsupplemental and original data and information (40 FR 38179), which coveredboth OTC miscellaneous external and internal drug products.Further, there is no violation of administrative law principles resultingfrom the inclusion of OTC topical aphrodisiac drug products for the firsttime at the notice of proposed rulemaking stage because that document providedadequate notice and an opportunity for views on this subject to be consideredbefore the rule is finalized. The notice of proposed rulemaking on OTCaphrodisiac drug products was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2168). As stated above,the agency provided adequate notice (12 months for new data, and an additional2 months for comments on the new data) for interested persons to submitcomments, objections, new data, or requests for oral hearing on both OTCinternal and external aphrodisiac drug products. The comment is incorrectin suggesting that the agency cannot include material in a notice of proposedrulemaking that was not contained in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking.The agency also concludes that a hearing on this issue is not warranted.The comment related only to legal interpretations and procedural mattersand did not identify any factual issues related to the safety or effectivenessof OTC aphrodisiac drug products.3. Numerous comments contended that herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids,and other foods truthfully labeled with non-misleading aphrodisiac claimsshould not be regulated as prescription drugs. The comments requested thatFDA hold a full public oral hearing and then withdraw or amend its proposedrulemaking on aphrodisiacs before issuing a final rule.One comment claimed that aphrodisiacs are not drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B)of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)) because they are not necessarily usedto cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. The comment also arguedthat many products with aphrodisiac claims, e.g., zinc, licorice, mandrake,fennel, and anise, are clearly foods and are expressly excluded by theparenthetical phrase (other than food) from the definition of drug undersection 201(g)(1)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C)). The comment concludedthat claims such as ``arouses or increases sexual desire * * *'' or ``improvesperformance * * *,'' which were listed as Category II in the notice ofproposed rulemaking (50 FR 2170), are not drug claims because a personwho takes what is otherwise a food for these purposes is not thereby takinga drug for a disease.The act defines a drug as ``(A) articles recognized in the official UnitedStates Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States,or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B)articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (otherthan food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the bodyof man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as a componentof any articles specified in clause (A), (B), or (C); but does not includedevices or their components, parts, or accessories'' (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).The act defines a food as ``(1) articles used for food or drink for manor other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for componentsof any such article'' (21 U.S.C. 321(f)).It is well established that the definitions of ``food'' and ``drug'' in21 U.S.C. 321 (f) and (g)(1) are not mutually exclusive. An article of``food'' that is intended for use in the treatment of disease may alsobe a ``drug'' under 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B) of the act. See <T3>Nutrilab, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Schweiker, </T3>713 F.2d 335, 336 (7th Cir. 1983) and cases cited therein.Accordingly, when articles of food are marketed as aphrodisiacs for usein the cure, mitigation, or treatment of sexual dysfunction, or relateddisease conditions, they are drugs under 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B).The comment's assertion that the ``other than food'' exception in 21 U.S.C.321(g)(1)(C) applies to aphrodisiac products is also without merit. TheCourt in the <T3>Nutrilab </T3>case, <T3>supra, </T3>noted that double use of the word ``food'' in 21 U.S.C.321(f) requires careful analysis of the parenthetical ``other than food''exclusion in the drug definition in 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C). The Court statedthat in the exclusion Congress obviously meant a drug to be something ``otherthan food,'' but it is not clear whether Congress was referring to ``food''as a term of art in the statutory sense or to food in its ordinary meaning.The Court stated that because all foods are ``intended to affect the structureor any function of the body of man or other animals'' and would thus comewithin the Part C drug definition exclusion, presumably Congress meantto exclude only common-sense foods. The Court concluded that when the actdefines ``food'' as ``articles used for food,'' it means that the statutorydefinition of ``food'' includes articles used by people in the ordinaryway most people use food_primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value.Articles containing ingredients that have food uses but that are marketedwith claims for their aphrodisiac effects do not meet the exception forfood in 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C). The claims made for these products makeclear that their primary intended use is to improve sexual performanceor to increase sexual desire, both of which are functions of the body withinthe meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C). These products are not intendedto be used as a food_that is, they are not intended to be consumed fortheir taste, aroma, or nutritive value.Thus, in determining whether a product is a food or a drug, the agencyconsiders the purpose for which a particular ingredient or product is intended.For example, starch blockers, which are prepared from raw beans, and spirulina,which is derived from algae, have both been declared by the agency to bedrugs because of the claimed effects of the products on the function ofthe body. In both instances, the manufacturers were promoting productscontaining these ingredients for nonfood purposes, even though both arederived from plant sources. The starch blockers were claimed to block orinterfere with digestion of starch (Ref. 1), and spirulina was claimedto act on the brain's appetite center (Ref. 2). The Court in the <T3>Nutrilab </T3>case, <T3>supra, </T3>stated that starch blockers were drugs under 21 U.S.C.321(g)(1)(C). The Court found that they indisputably satisfy the requirementof ``intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of manor other animals'' because they are intended to affect digestion in thepeople who take them.Similarly, aphrodisiacs are drugs because they are offered for a non-foodpurpose (i.e., other than for their taste, aroma, or nutritive value) andpurport to affect the function of the body. The Panel defined an aphrodisiacas ``any drug which is claimed to arouse or increase sexual desire or improvesexual performance,'' (47 FR 43572 at 43573). Dorland's (Ref. 3) definesan aphrodisiac as exciting the libido or any drug that arouses the sexualinstinct. Food, in contrast, when used in the ordinary way is not intendedfor these purposes. Accordingly, products containing ingredients that areintended to be used as aphrodisiacs, whether or not these ingredients havefood uses, and making aphrodisiac claims are clearly drugs within the definitionof 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C).The agency also notes that some aphrodisiacs have been traditionally soldas drugs (Ref. 4). Yohimbine, for example, has been marketed as a prescriptiondrug (5 milligram (mg) tablet) with indications such as used ``experimentallyfor the treatment and the diagnostic classification of certain types ofmale erectile impotence'' and ``may have activity as an aphrodisiac,''(Ref. 4). (Additional discussion of prescription versus OTC status is containedin comment 6 below.)In conclusion, ingredients that are derived from normal food items butthat are sold for their aphrodisiac effects are drugs and not foods becausethey are intended to treat a disease condition or because they are intendedto affect the function of the body. The Commissioner also concludes thata hearing on this issue is not warranted. The issue relates solely to thelegal question of whether aphrodisiacs are drugs and does not raise factualmatters relating to the safety or effectiveness of OTC aphrodisiac drugproducts.References(1) HHS News, FDA, News Release, Subject: Starch Blockers, July 1, 1982.(2) Talk Paper, FDA, ``Spirulina,'' June 23, 1981.(3) ``Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,'' 27th Ed., W.B. SaundersCo., Philadelphia, 1988, s.v. ``aphrodisiac.''(4) Huff, B.B., editor, ``Physicians' Desk Reference,'' 42d Ed., MedicalEconomics Publishing Co., Oradell, NJ, pp. 1111-1112, 1521, 2076, 1988.4. One comment stated that it is well-established in botanical applicationin the healing arts of India, known as ``Ayurveda'' and ``Kayakalpa,''that a variety of herbs and food sources, such as asparagus and mineralpitch, serve to ``revitalize and rejuvenate the human organism'' leadingto ``increased sexual stamina and improved performance.'' The comment citedtwo references and requested a hearing on this subject before the Commissioner,adding that further references and expert testimony will be presented atthe hearing (Ref. 1).The agency emphasizes that the purpose of the OTC drug review is to determinewhether there is general recognition of the safety and efficacy of particularclasses of drugs used for self-medication. Therapeutic practices and proceduressuch as the ``healing arts of India'' and their relation to certain foodsources are outside the scope of the OTC drug review. The agency also concludesthat a hearing on this issue is not warranted because no genuine issuesof material facts were raised relating to the safety and effectivenessof particular ingredients used in OTC aphrodisiac drug products.Reference(1) Comment No. HER002, Docket No. 80N-0419, Dockets Management Branch.5. One comment stated that even if aphrodisiacs are found to be drugs,they are not new drugs. The comment explained that since these drugs havebeen used in this manner for centuries, as noted by FDA at 47 FR 43572to 43574, they are exempt from the NDA requirement of section 505 of theact (21 U.S.C. 355) because they are ``grandfathered.'' The comment furthercited examples of use of these drugs dating back to biblical times. Thecomment requested a hearing on this issue before the Commissioner.To qualify for exemption from the ``new drug'' definition under the 1938grandfather clause of the act, the drug product must have been subjectto the Food and Drug Act of 1906, prior to June 25, 1938, and at such timeits labeling must have contained the same representations concerning theconditions of its use (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(1)). Under the 1962 grandfatherclause of the act, a drug product which on October 9, 1962, (1) was commerciallyused or sold in the United States, (2) was not a ``new drug'' as definedin the 1938 act, and (3) was not covered by an effective NDA under the1938 act, would not be subject to the added requirement of effectiveness``when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended,or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day.'' Pub.L. 87-781, section 107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 788, note following 21 U.S.C. 321.The person seeking to show that a drug comes within a grandfather exemptionmust prove every essential fact necessary for invocation of the exemption.See <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,''</T3> 469 F.2d 875, 878(5th Cir. 1972), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 412 U.S. 938 (1973). Furthermore, the grandfatherclause will be strictly construed against one who invokes it. See <T3>id</T3>.; <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Allan Drug Corp.,</T3> 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 385 U.S. 899 (1966). A change in composition orlabeling precludes the applicability of the grandfather exemption. See<T3>USV Pharmaceutical Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Weinberger</T3>, 412 U.S. 655, 663 (1973).No evidence was submitted to the agency to show that the labeling and compositionof aphrodisiac drug products have remained unchanged since either 1938or 1962. Without such evidence, the products cannot qualify for eithergrandfather exemption. The burden of proof with respect to the grandfatherexemption is not on FDA, but on the person seeking the exemption. See <T3>An Article of Drug * * * ``Bentex Ulcerine,'' supra.</T3>In any event, the 1938 and 1962 grandfather clauses apply only to the newdrug provisions of the act and not to the adulteration and misbrandingprovisions. The OTC drug review was designed to implement both the misbrandingand the new drug provisions of the act. [See 21 CFR 330.10; 37 FR 9466(May 11, 1972)]. The grandfather clauses do not preclude the agency fromreviewing any currently marketed OTC drug, regardless of whether it hasgrandfather protection from the new drug provisions, in order to ensurethat the drug is not misbranded.The agency concludes that a hearing on this issue is not warranted; thequestion of whether a drug is a ``new drug'' is a matter of law and nota material and substantial issue of fact that could be resolved at a hearing.6. One comment contended that the agency's conclusions regarding self-medicationwith aphrodisiacs are inconsistent with the law and public policy. Thecomment stated that the agency had erroneously based its ``conclusion thatOTC distribution of these substances is inappropriate on the nature ofthe condition, not on the risks of the product.'' The comment argued thatnone of the criteria for restricting a drug to prescription status as setforth in section 503(b)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)) apply to aphrodisiacdrug products, i.e., (1) there is no evidence that yohimbine or other herbsare habit-forming drugs to which section 502(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(d))applies; (2) there is no indication of toxicity or other potentially harmfuleffect, method of use, or collateral measures necessary to use that makethese products not safe except for use under the supervision of a doctor;or (3) the product is not limited by an approved application under section505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) to use under professional supervision. Inaddition, the comment asserted that a disorder such as impotence is appropriatefor self-medication because in the majority of cases it is not a seriousmedical disorder and cited an article by Slag et al. (Ref. 1) in supportof this position. The comment requested a hearing on this issue beforethe Commissioner.The agency disagrees with the comment. The OTC drug review is determiningwhether aphrodisiac drug products intended for OTC use are generally recognizedas safe and effective for OTC use. There is no evidence to establish thatsuch drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective. Therefore,an approved NDA is required to permit marketing of such products. The prescriptionor OTC status for aphrodisiac drug products will be determined in conjunctionwith the evaluation of safety and effectiveness data submitted, if any,in support of an NDA. The agency emphasizes that this rulemaking does not,in itself, restrict all aphrodisiac drug products to prescription status.If the data submitted as part of an NDA support OTC marketing for a particularaphrodisiac drug product, then such a product could be marketed OTC underthe NDA.However, as previously stated in both the Panel's report (47 FR 43572 at43575) and the tentative final monograph (50 FR 2168 at 2169), the agencybelieves that, based on the data available to date, individuals sufferingfrom decreased libido and impaired sexual performance should seek treatmentunder professional supervision. Moreover, the agency believes that thestudy on impotence cited by the comment (Ref. 1), rather than illustratingthe suitability of aphrodisiacs for OTC use, gives support to the positionthat these types of products should be restricted to use under a physician'ssupervision. Impotence is defined by Dorland (Ref. 2) as the lack of power,chiefly of copulative power in the male due to failure to initiate an erectionor to maintain an erection until ejaculation. It may be atonic, due toparalysis of the motor nerves without evidence of lesion of the centralnervous system; paretic, due to lesion in the central nervous system, particularlyin the spinal cord; psychic, dependent on mental complex; or symptomatic,due to some other disorder, such as injury to nerves in the perineal region,by virtue of which the sensory portion of the erection reflex arc is interrupted.The article (Ref. 1) identifies a number of reasons for impotence, includingmedication effect, psychogenic causes, neurological and cardiovascularcomplications, diabetes, and hormonal imbalances. The agency believes thatthis information strongly suggests that a physician's diagnostic expertiseis warranted before a sexual dysfunction condition is treated and a physician'ssupervision is required during treatment in order to monitor its progress.The agency disagrees with the comment that the criteria for restrictinga drug to prescription status (as set forth in section 503(b)(1) of theact) may not be applicable to some or all aphrodisiac drug products. Thestatutory criteria in section 503(b)(1)(B) of the act could be applicableto all or some aphrodisiac drugs. The collateral measures necessary touse, e.g., the need for a physician to diagnose the condition, determineits cause, and determine whether drug treatment is the appropriate therapy,are important factors in determining whether aphrodisiac drug productsshould be marketed OTC or on a prescription basis. The Panel stated thatsexual drive (libido) and sexual performance are governed by multiple factors,the most common of which are psychological, and that impotence and frigidityhave often been successfully treated by psychotherapy (47 FR 43572 at 43574).If the psychotherapy included drug treatment, it would have to be undera physician's supervision. The Panel further noted that hormonal factorsalso affected libido (47 FR 43572 at 43574). Any hormonal imbalance wouldalso have to be treated by a physician.In addition, the agency is concerned that the OTC use of some aphrodisiacdrugs could present a safety concern, thus falling within the ``toxicityor other potentiality for harmful effect'' provision of section 503(b)(1)(B)of the act. The agency is aware that several manufacturers currently marketproducts containing yohimbine hydrochloride as a prescription drug indicatedas a sympathicolytic and mydriatic, with possible activity as an aphrodisiac(Ref. 3). The package inserts for these products state that the actionof yohimbine on peripheral blood vessels is similar to that of reserpine(which is a prescription drug). It is also stated that yohimbine exertsa stimulating action on mood and can increase anxiety, but that these actionshave not been adequately studied or related to dosage. The only contraindicationsprovided are sensitivity to the drug and renal diseases. However, the statementis made that ``no additional contraindications can be offered due to thelimited and inadequate information available.'' A warning is provided thatthe drug is not for use in cardio-renal patients with gastric or duodenalhistory or in geriatric patients. It is also stated that the drug shouldnot be used in conjunction with mood modifying agents such as antidepressants,nor in psychiatric patients. In addition, a number of adverse reactionsare listed, e.g., antidiuresis, central excitation, elevation of bloodpressure and heart rate, tremor, and increased motor activity.The agency also has some concerns about yohimbine being available as anOTC drug because of reports of its stimulant and hallucinogenic properties(Refs. 4 and 5). In addition, the agency is aware of at least two reportsof adverse reactions involving overdoses of yohimbine (Refs. 5 and 6).A 2\1/2\-year-old boy died due to direct toxic effects on the capillariesafter ingesting 300 to 400 mg of yohimbine hydrochloride, and a 16-year-oldgirl suffered from headache, hallucinations, dizziness, chest pains, andpartial hearing loss after ingesting 250 mg of yohimbine. Although thereported dosage was high, the reports indicate potential problems in havinga safe OTC dose for this ingredient. For the above reasons, the agencyis of the opinion that the ``toxicity and other potentiality for harmfuleffect'' provision of section 503(b)(1)(B) of the act applies to drug productscontaining yohimbine or any of its derivatives. However, it is possiblethat other aphrodisiac ingredients may be safe for OTC use if efficacyis eventually established under appropriate NDA approval procedures.The agency also concludes that a hearing on this issue is not warrantedbecause issues of material and substantial facts were not raised relatingto the safety or effectiveness of ingredients used in OTC aphrodisiac drugproducts.References(1) Slag, M.F., et al., ``Impotence in Medical Clinic Outpatients,'' <T3>The Journal of the American Medical Association,</T3> 249:1736-1740,1983.(2) ``Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,'' 26th Ed., W.B.

One comment contended that the agency's determination that aphrodisiacproducts are to be available only on a prescription basis, or not at all,will have a severe economic impact that the agency has not considered.The comment stated that this decision will increase costs by requiringpeople who want to use these products for ``enhancement of sexual pleasure''to do so under the supervision of a physician and to incur the costs ofvisits to physicians, which is a ``hardly cost-effective'' means of dealingwith these people's desires. The comment also cited several examples ofthe agency's and Congress' traditionally favorable view of the conceptof self-medication.The comment submitted no documentation in support of its contention thata severe economic impact will occur, and the agency points out that ithas not made a decision that all aphrodisiac drugs products are to be soldonly by prescription. (See comment 6 above.) The agency has concluded atthis time that the traditionally-used aphrodisiac ingredients have notbeen shown to be generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC usebased on currently-available data and, therefore, these products will requirean approved NDA for marketing. In addition, the agency has determined thatthe combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug reviewdo not constitute a major rule according to the criteria established byExecutive Order 12291. (See Part II. below_The Agency's Final Conclusionson OTC Aphrodisiac Drug Products.)The agency therefore concludes that not one of these rules, including thisfinal rule for OTC aphrodisiac drug products, is a major rule. Accordingly,the agency finds that issuance of this final rule will not have an adverseeconomic impact on consumers.8. Many comments contended that yohimbine is an effective aphrodisiac.Citing a number of supporting references (Refs. 1 through 8), one commentmaintained that sufficient data exist to demonstrate the effectivenessof ``yohimbe'' and other herbs for aphrodisiac use. (The comment statedthat it used the term ``yohimbe'' to include the ingredient's derivativessuch as yohimbine, yohimbinum, and yohimbine hydrochloride. The agencyis using the term yohimbine in this document to refer collectively to allof these ingredients.) The comment stated that the Panel rejected the studyby Bruhl and Leslie (Ref. 1) because (1) the drugs were coded A and B andthe code could be deciphered, and (2) the low placebo success rate wasquestionable because ``psychological factors are so important'' (47 FR43572 at 43574). However, the comment contended that there is no evidencethat the code was broken, and that more recent data have suggested thatthe emphasis on psychological factors may have been misplaced (Ref. 9).The comment also noted that the Queen's University study (Ref. 2) concludedthat yohimbine is effective; however, the agency found fault with the studybecause ``the number of satisfactory results is lower than the number givenin previous reports'' (50 FR 2168 at 2169). The comment stated that itwas unaware of any requirement under the law that the ``number of satisfactoryresults'' be equal to or higher than a ``number given in previous reports.''The comments concluded that the available data support the effectivenessof yohimbine and other herbs and substances for aphrodisiac use, and requesteda hearing on this issue before the Commissioner.The agency has reviewed the references (Refs. 1 through 9) cited by onecomment and noted the comment's criticism of the Panel's rejection of theBruhl and Leslie study (Ref. 1). The agency finds that, regardless of thestudy defects mentioned by the Panel (i.e., inadequate blinding, low placeboresponse rate, and failure to define the study measurements of effectiveness(47 FR 43572 at 43574)), this study does not support the effectivenessof yohimbine because the product contained other ingredients in additionto yohimbine. The product contained 5 mg each of methyltestosterone, nuxvomica, and yohimbine. Thus, any favorable results could not be attributedsolely to yohimbine, because there were no studies to demonstrate the effectivenessof that ingredient alone. Furthermore, in four additional studies citedby the comment as supportive of the effectiveness of yohimbine (Refs. 3through 6), the product used also contained a combination of methyltestosterone,nux vomica, and yohimbine. Therefore, these studies cannot be consideredsupportive of the effectiveness of yohimbine alone.The study by Albert-Puleo (Ref. 7) regarding herbs (fennel and anise) asestrogenic agents narrates the history of use of these herbs, but doesnot provide any data relating to safety or efficacy. Clark et al. (Ref.8) found that yohimbine increased sexual motivation in genital anesthetizedrats. Although such data are encouraging, this preliminary animal studycannot be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of yohimbine in humans.Slag et al. (Ref 9) studied the causes of impotence in 1,180 middle-agedmen and concluded that although erectile dysfunction has long been consideredto be primarily a psychogenic disorder, underlying organic disease is oftenresponsible for the impotence. They found that in 25 percent of the patients,the effect of medication was the likely cause of the impotence, 14 percenthad psychogenic causes, 7 percent were of neurological origin (e.g., cerebrovascularaccident), 44 percent were due to organic disease (e.g., urologic problems,diabetes, hypo/hyperthyroidism), 7 percent were due to unknown causes,and 4 percent were of miscellaneous origin. The agency concludes that thisstudy has no relevance to the efficacy of yohimbine, but it does pointout the need for patients to undergo a thorough medical evaluation to determinethe cause of impotence.The study from Queen's University by Reid et al. (Ref. 2) is a 10-week,placebo-controlled, double-blind, partial crossover study involving theuse of capsules containing yohimbine (6 mg) and riboflavin (2 mg) versusplacebo capsules containing only riboflavin. The capsules were taken threetimes a day. The study was designed to determine yohimbine's effect inrestoring erectile function. Forty-eight subjects meeting strict diagnosticcriteria for psychogenic impotence were included in the study. Impotencewas defined as ``failure to obtain an erection sufficient for intromissionfor at least 3 months.'' In phase I of the study, 29 subjects receivedyohimbine and 19 received placebo. Patients and their partners made independentratings of treatment response according to the following scale of 0 through2:2=complete; return to satisfactory sexual functioning with erections sufficientfor penetration.1=partial; some improvement in the quality, frequency, or rigidity of erections,but not sufficient to restore satisfactory sexual functioning.0=none; no change in sexual functioning from pretreatment levels.At the end of phase I, 9 yohimbine patients reported ``complete improvement,''9 reported ``partial improvement,'' and 11 reported ``no improvement.''Of the patients, receiving the placebo, 1 reported ``complete improvement,''2 reported ``partial improvement,'' and 16 reported ``no improvement.''At the end of the first 10 weeks, the 19 patients who had received theplacebo were crossed over to yohimbine (phase II of the study). However,a complete crossover was not used because the investigators felt it wouldbe disruptive to marital relationships to switch those patients who hadtaken the yohimbine to a placebo. Patients who crossed over from placeboto yohimbine did not show a significant change in sexual functioning frompretreatment levels. Three patients reported ``complete improvement,''1 reported ``partial improvement,'' and 15 reported ``no improvement.''No serious undesirable effects were reported.The agency concludes that the study (Ref. 2) provides some suggestive evidencethat yohimbine may be useful in treating male impotence. In phase I ofthe study, 31 percent of the yohimbine patients reported complete improvementversus 5 percent of the placebo patients. However, in phase II, only 16percent reported complete improvement. The investigators speculated thatthis lower response of patients who received yohimbine after receivingplacebo may have been due to a negative expectancy effect. The agency concludesthat this small scale study is not sufficient to establish the generalrecognition of yohimbine or any of its derivatives as safe and effectivefor treating male impotence. Further studies using adequate numbers ofpatients are needed to determine yohimbine's effectiveness in treatingmale impotence. In addition, the agency has safety concerns regarding OTCuse of yohimbine. (See comment 6 above.) The agency encourages furtherstudy of yohimbine or any of its derivatives to establish their safetyand usefulness in relieving male impotence. Such data may be submittedas the subject of an NDA. (See 21 CFR Part 314.) As an alternative, wherethere are adequate data establishing general recognition of safety andeffectiveness, such data may be submitted in an appropriate citizen petitionto establish a monograph. (See 21 CFR 10.30.)The agency has carefully considered the data in the administrative recordand the arguments included in the comments. The agency has determined thatat present there is insufficient evidence to establish that any ingredient,including yohimbine, used in OTC aphrodisiac drug products is generallyrecognized as safe and effective. Because these matters have been fullyconsidered and because the agency concludes that a hearing on this issueis not likely to provide any additional useful information or insights,the agency concludes that a hearing is not warranted.References(1) Bruhl, D.

F., et al., ``Impotence in Medical Clinic Outpatients,''<T3> The Journal of the American Medical Association,</T3> 249:1736-1740,1983.9. One comment requested that publication of the final monograph be delayeduntil data from studies, reportedly ongoing, on yohimbine can be appropriatelyconsidered.The comment was submitted in May 1985. The agency has received no additionalinformation on these or any other studies. The agency cannot further delaypublication of this final rule to await results of any reportedly ongoingstudies. Such a delay would allow products that have not been shown tobe safe and effective to remain in the marketplace for a prolonged periodof time and is not in the public interest. Further, manufacturers havebeen alerted about the proposed nonmonograph status of aphrodisiacs sincethe Panel's report was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43572). The agencyreiterated the proposed nonmonograph status of aphrodisiacs in the noticeof proposed rulemaking over 3 years ago in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2168). Thus, manufacturershave had ample opportunity to conduct clinical trials and to submit theresults to the agency.The agency points out that publication of a final rule does not precludea manufacturer's testing an ingredient. New, relevant data can be submittedto the agency at a later date as the subject of an NDA that may providefor prescription or OTC marketing status. (See 21 CFR Part 314.) As analternative, where there are adequate data establishing general recognitionof safety and effectiveness, such data may be submitted in an appropriatecitizen petition to establish a monograph. (See 21 CFR 10.30.)For the above reasons, the agency will not delay the final rule until publicationof these studies.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Agency's Final Conclusions on OTC Aphrodisiac Drug Products</ITAG>The agency has determined that all products that bear labeling claimingthat they will arouse or increase sexual desire, or that they will improvesexual performance, are aphrodisiac drug products. Moreover, the agencyhas determined that no aphrodisiac drug product has been found to be generallyrecognized as safe and effective and not misbranded for use in treatingsexual dysfunction. Therefore, all aphrodisiac drug products, includingthose containing such ingredients as anise, cantharides, don qual, estrogens,fennel, ginseng, golden seal, gotu kola, Korean ginseng, licorice, mandrake,methyltestosterone, minerals, nux vomica, Pega Palo, sarsaparilla, strychnine,testosterone, vitamins, yohimbine, yohimbine hydrochloride, and yohimbinum,are considered nonmonograph ingredients and misbranded under section 502of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352) and are newdrugs under section 201(p) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which an approvedNDA under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and Part 314 of the regulations(21 CFR Part 314) is required for marketing. In appropriate circumstances,a citizen petition to establish a monograph may be submitted under 21 CFR10.30 in lieu of an NDA. Any such OTC drug product initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce afterthe effective date of this final rule that is not in compliance with theregulation is subject to regulatory action. In response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economicimpact of this rulemaking (50 FR 2168), one comment was received. (Seecomment 7 above.) The agency has examined the economic consequences ofthis final rule in conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTCdrug review. In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this final rule for OTC aphrodisiacdrug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC aphrodisiac drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this final rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 310 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Drugs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.

New andSection; 310.528 is added to Subpart E to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 310.528</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter(OTC) for use as an aphrodisiac.</ITAG>(a) Any product that bears labeling claims that it will arouse or increasesexual desire, or that it will improve sexual performance, is an aphrodisiacdrug product. Anise, cantharides, don qual, estrogens, fennel, ginseng,golden seal, gotu kola, Korean ginseng, licorice, mandrake, methyltestosterone,minerals, nux vomica, Pega Palo, sarsaparilla, strychnine, testosterone,vitamins, yohimbine, yohimbine hydrochloride, and yohimbinum have beenpresent as ingredients in such drug products. Androgens (e.g., testosteroneand methyltestosterone) and estrogens are powerful hormones when administeredinternally and are not safe for use except under the supervision of a physician.There is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of thesafety and effectiveness of any of these ingredients, or any other ingredient,for OTC use as an aphrodisiac. Labeling claims for aphrodisiacs for OTCuse are either false, misleading, or unsupported by scientific data. Thefollowing claims are examples of some that have been made for aphrodisiacdrug products for OTC use: ``acts as an aphrodisiac;'' ``arouses or increasessexual desire and improves sexual performance;'' ``helps restore sexualvigor, potency, and performance;'' ``improves performance, staying power,and sexual potency;'' and ``builds virility and sexual potency.'' Basedon evidence currently available, any OTC drug product containing ingredientsfor use as an aphrodisiac cannot be generally recognized as safe and effective.(b) Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or prompted foruse as an aphrodisiac is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the act), for whichan approved new drug application under section 505 of the act and Part314 of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approvednew drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502of the act. (c) Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug productlabeled, represented, or promoted for OTC use as an aphrodisiac is safeand effective for the purpose intended must comply with the requirementsand procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forthin Part 312 of this chapter.(d) After January 8, 1990, any such OTC drug product initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce that isnot in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank E.
