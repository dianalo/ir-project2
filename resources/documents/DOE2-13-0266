A disc between the ends of the tank separatesthe tank into first and second variable volume chambers and preventsblending of water at different temperatures in the chambers. Conduitsselectively feed water into one chamber while simultaneously removingwater from the other chamber, the disc means moving in the tank in accordancewith the feeding and withdrawal of water from the chambers whereby thevolume of water in each chamber may vary but the total volume of waterin the tank means is substantially constant. The disc is maintained substantiallyperpendicular to a vertical axis of the tank during its movement withinthe tank by a cable and pulley mechanism or vertical guides in associationwith the disc.</TEXT></DOC>
