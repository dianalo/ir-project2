The project -- started by the founder of Frogdesign, which did the industrial design for Steve Jobs's Next work station -- aims to produce a home-entertainment system with much higher-quality television. The system would also contain a Sparc processor and four to eight megabytes of memory -- giving it the power of some Sun Microsystems work stations.    That power would be used to control related devices such as VCRs, stereos and compact-disk players, and make them easier to use. For example, someone programming a VCR would guide the image of a tiny hand on a screen to a TV listing, then grab the program with the hand and drop it into a representation of a VCR.    Some people who have seen early versions say they include a feature that would be sure to stir up controversy: The computer watches for signals that networks send affiliate stations to alert them to the beginning and end of commercials, enabling the VCR to tape shows while skipping ads.    &quot;The technology is very extreme,&quot; says Hartmut Esslinger, the Frogdesign founder who initiated the project and formed Frox Inc., Campbell, Calif., to pursue it. He says he has been working on the project for two years and has 25 people assigned to it.    But he declines to discuss technical details because the product needs more work and considerable financing to become reality.    Whatever happens, the list of those involved is impressive. Besides Mr. Esslinger, there is Andy Hertzfeld, one of the designers of Apple Computer Inc.'s original Macintosh, and Andreas Bechtolsheim, the hardware expert in the group that founded Sun.    Computer for Disabled    Reacts to Human Voice    IF A BLIND person says, &quot;Charlie, please read me the newspaper,&quot; the voice that responds may now be electronic.    Transceptor Technologies Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich., recently started shipping a computer for the disabled called Personal Companion. The user trains the machine to recognize his voice by reciting some standard phrases. He also gives the machine a name, which he must use when telling the computer to do something.    The computer automatically dials an 800 number at 4 a.m. every day and, so to speak, picks up the morning paper -- only USA Today at the moment, but Transceptor says it hopes to have more papers available soon.    If the machine is hooked up to an apartment's central wiring system, a disabled person can use it to turn appliances on or off and to dial the telephone. Software also lets the user store phone numbers -- so he can just say, &quot;Call Mom.&quot;    There are limitations, mainly because speech-recognition technology is still so crude that the computer at the heart of the system can handle just a small number of words in each application.    That means, for instance, that to get the score on a Pirates baseball game, a user would have to ask for the paper to be read, wait as the various sections were listed, say &quot;yes&quot; when the sports section was mentioned, and then wait until the computer read the headline for the Pirates game.    Electronic Cargo Data    May Speed Up Customs    THE U.S. CUSTOMS Service thinks it can shorten the lines for clearing customs -- at least for businesses.    Customs is testing the possibility of letting businesses use an electronic data interchange standard called Edifact to transmit electronically all the necessary information on a shipment as soon as a cargo plane takes off.    If Customs tentatively decides not to inspect the shipment, as happens 98% of the time, it sends back an approval, and the shipment can sail through.    At the moment, lengthy documents have to be written out by hand after a shipment lands, and processing them can take hours. If that means the shipment misses a connecting flight, cargo can be delayed at least a day.    A limited amount of information about shipments already can be sent electronically, but Edifact would significantly increase the volume of data. Edifact will still need fine-tuning at some international negotiating sessions, mainly to broaden the standard to cover more types of information.    &quot;There is a potential for a great deal of time saving,&quot; says Mark S. Campbell, corporate customs manager at Texas Instruments Inc. He says the electronic transmission also will mean less recopying of documents, reducing the number of errors and saving money.    Device Links Faxing    And Laser Printing    HYBRID FAX Inc., Dallas, has started selling a device that hooks up to a laser printer and lets it receive faxes.    The main benefit is that laser printers use regular paper and produce much better copies than normal fax machines.    The new product also shows how fax technology is mutating to let the machines fit better into computer networks. The Hybrid device facilitates automatic distribution of faxes throughout a personal-computer network.    Hybrid's two-inch-wide device costs $1,195, compared with the $5,000 or more price tag for a fax machine with a laser printer as the engine.    The technology isn't all the way there, though: Hybrid's device can only receive faxes, not send them. In addition, the price is still higher than many people will go for when they can buy a regular fax machine for a few hundred dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
