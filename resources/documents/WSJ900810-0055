White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday thatthe administration had no intention &quot;at this time&quot; of drawingfrom the nation's strategic petroleum reserve to offset theoil shortfall caused by the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait. Thedecision came as a surprise to some oil experts, who say useof emergency reserves would push down the price of oil.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If we're not going to use it when we send troops into thePersian Gulf, when are we going to use it?&quot; asked WilliamHogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, whosaid a presidential announcement of plans to draw a modestamount from the reserves could reduce the oil price by &quot;acouple of dollars a barrel.&quot;   Meanwhile, world crude prices fell about 25 cents a barrelyesterday as markets awaited fresh news from the Middle East.And several more oil companies said they were cutting theirgasoline prices.   Texaco Inc., British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit and theConoco unit of Du Pont Co. said they were reducing gasolineprices around three cents a gallon in response to thedeclines in crude, which have fallen more than $3 in the pasttwo days from highs of $29 a barrel.   Phillips Petroleum Co., which led the price cutting with a4.5-cent cut Wednesday, said yesterday it was furtherreducing prices an average of 1.8 cents a gallon. A number ofother major companies have said they were capping gasolineprices for some time.   Oil companies were responding to the drop in the crudemarket and to President Bush's call on the industry to showrestraint. But the swiftness of the gasoline-price reductionsis unusual. &quot;We're not in a normal situation,&quot; said aspokeswoman for BP America Inc. in Cleveland.   The administration's decision not to use its emergencypetroleum reserves is certain to draw political attack. Sen.Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) has already criticized theadministration for its reluctance. &quot;President Bush has takena decisive step by committing American forces to protect ourlong-term interests in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Sen. Bradley said, but&quot;unfortunately, the president has not yet acted to protectthe interests of American consumers, who . . . have facedgasoline-price increases of up to fifteen cents a gallon.&quot;   &quot;We already have a fragile, weakened economy and we don'tneed this kind of impact,&quot; said Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.). &quot;If we've got the {reserve} we built for this purpose,we ought to be willing to use it.&quot;   The administration's decision was made public yesterday asthe International Energy Agency, made up of 21 industrialnations, met in Paris. Following the meeting, UlrichEngelmann, the chairman of the group's governing board, saidthe group had concluded that no physical shortages of oilexist at this time, and therefore there is no need to drawdown emergency reserves.   Later, Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack said inan interview that there is &quot;a general consensus that thingsare on track&quot; and that &quot;there is no need at this time torelease stocks.&quot;   Administration officials say they were reluctant to usethe reserves in part because they didn't want the governmentto get involved in influencing oil prices. In addition, theysaid the White House is reluctant to use the strategicpetroleum reserve because it would take pressure off of SaudiArabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing nations to increasetheir production.   But Rep. Phil Sharp (D., Ind.) said the administration&quot;should be demonstrating to the market place that we havethis major supply of government oil, and we are prepared touse it.&quot; Mr. Sharp is chairman of a House energysubcommittee.   The oil markets were relatively quiet yesterday afternearly a week of pandemonium. &quot;Everybody is waiting for somenew news,&quot; said Ted Eck, Amoco Corp's chief economist.   On the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, oiltrader Eric Bolling said: &quot;It's been such a rumor mill downhere for so long that any rumor would move the market $2.Today nothing came out.&quot;   Oil traders seem prepared to drive prices in eitherdirection. &quot;I wouldn't bet a dollar oil will be $20 or $40 insix months but I would bet a dollar it will hit both ends ofthat range within the next six months,&quot; Mr. Bolling said.   The embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil is expected to removeabout four million barrels a day of oil production from worldmarkets. Mr. McCormack of the State Department saidagreements by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producingnations to boost production can &quot;very largely make up&quot; thatshortfall.   Many private analysts believe, however, that oilproduction may still be as much as one million barrels a daybelow its levels before the embargo. If the administrationwould agree to fill that gap with oil from its strategicreserves, &quot;we'd probably be $3 a barrel lower,&quot; says PhilipVerleger of the Institute for International Economics.   Administration officials say they are still willing to usethe reserves, if conditions call for it. One official said adisruption of Saudi oil fields by the Iraqis might prompt theU.S. to begin pumping oil from its reserves.   For oil companies, the question of security of supply hasbecome crucial, particularly with the curbed flow from theMiddle East and President Bush's reluctance to open thestrategic petroleum reserve. &quot;The best thing is for oilcompanies to make sure they don't have shortages,&quot; saidAmoco's Mr. Eck. &quot;The worst case is shortages,&quot; he added,from local service stations running out of gasoline to oilcompanies short of crude to run their refineries.   Amoco's refining system is running at full capacity, Mr.Eck said, as is virtually the entire U.S. refining system. Itran at nearly 95% of capacity in the week ended Aug. 3, whicheffectively is full-out, refiners say.   Before the Middle East crisis, oil prices had been sharplylower because of perceptions of a world-wide crude glut. Evenin the latest week crude inventories in the U.S. were 46million barrels higher than at this time last year. But nowinstead of an unwanted surplus those barrels are perceived asprecious stocks that companies are loathe to sell.   To avoid any run on gasoline supplies, many refiners havegone to an allocation system at the refinery gate that limitsgasoline sales to individual wholesale buyers to prevent anyhoarding, said Bill Hermann, chief economist for ChevronCorp. in San Francisco. &quot;We're not going to be delivering orletting any individual jobber, distributor or dealer buythree times as much {gasoline} as he bought at this time lastyear,&quot; Mr. Hermann said.
