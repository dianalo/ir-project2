(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nearly a continent away from WallStreet but dead center in its latest insider-trading scandal, junkbond king Michael Milken works on an opulent avenue lined with tonyboutiques and stately hotels.   The decision of his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to paya record $650 million fine to settle criminal securities fraudcharges has reportedly split the company's ranks over the fate ofMilken. But there was little outward sign of that turmoil Thursday.   Employees arriving for work _ the few who would acknowledge areporter _ refused to talk about the case. Attempts to get intoDrexel's unobtrusive offices were rebuffed by uniformed guards whostaff the reception desk of the building on Rodeo Drive, theshoppers' Mecca.   Milken has said through spokesmen that he is prepared to fightcriminal charges believed pending against him. According to some whosaw him socially during the many months the Drexel investigation hasbeen publicly unwinding, Milken appears to have retained hiscustomary enthusiasm for business and extensive charitable interests.   ``He's not a defensive-type guy,'' said Richard Riordan, a LosAngeles attorney and investor and friend of Milken's who last sawhim 10 days ago at a charity event.   ``He acts like nothing has happened and his whole time and effortis spent on the thing at hand,'' Riordan said. ``My guess is he's atough guy ... I think he's going to keep doing business as usual.''   The very fact of Drexel's presence in this enclave of the richand famous is testament to Milken's importance to Drexel, and hiswillingness to flout convention. Not only is Beverly Hills out ofManhattan, it's a good 10 miles from the Los Angeles financialdistrict.   Drexel's offices are spread through two low-rise gray marblebuildings that also house the aristocratic Gump's department store,a clothing boutique and a savings and loan office.   Across Rodeo Drive is the ornate Beverly Wilshire Hotel, whereNancy Reagan stays when she's in town. Up the way are shops ofCartier, Tiffany andamp; Co. and Van Cleef andamp; Arpels jewelers, wherePresident Reagan bought the first couple's wedding ring.   Inside the office, Milken and his lieutenants line up buyers andsellers of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. Much of Drexel's junkbond business depends on this network, with previous issuers ofbonds often being tapped to buy someone else's new issue.   Milken is said to have tired of working in New York and to havepersuaded Drexel that the business could be done by telephone fromanywhere.</TEXT></DOC>
