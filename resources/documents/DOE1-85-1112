Specifically, it is proposed that gravitational scatteringof the massive clouds off each other in the differentially rotating Galacticdisk constitutes an effective gravitational viscosity, which causes anincrease in the random kinetic energy of the GMCs at the expense of theirordered, rotational kinetic energy in the Galactic disk. The energy inputdue to this gravitational viscosity is calculated, and the other termscontributing to the energy balance of the GMCs are computed. These resultsare used to determine the steady state cloud velocity dispersion andits dependence on the cloud mass and radius and on the galactocentricradial distance. 30 references.</TEXT></DOC>
