Despite traders' disappointment that there haven't beenclear signs of the hoped-for U.S. economic rebound, there isstill underlying demand for the dollar.</LP><TEXT>   That was very clear Friday when the dollar rallied duringhectic dealings here. In late trading, the dollar was quotedat 1.7360 marks and 138.20 yen, up from 1.6948 marks and137.45 yen here late Thursday. Friday's intraday dollar highswere 1.7433 marks and 138.68 yen.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 138.70yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 137.72 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.7503 marks, up from1.7013 marks at Tokyo's close Friday.   When Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said it hadlinked the krona to the European Currency Unit to pave theway for Sweden's entry into the European Community, thedollar rocketed higher against the mark and other foreigncurrencies.   The ECU is a unit of account that represents the basket ofEC currencies. Those currencies are the mark, British pound,French franc, Italian lira, Dutch guilder, Belgian franc,Luxembourg franc, Danish krone, Irish punt, Greek drachma,Spanish peseta, and Portuguese escudo.   The krona will be allowed to fluctuate 1.5% above to 1.5%below the central rate of 7.40054 kronor per ECU, allowing atotal fluctuation of 3%.   Now that the Swedish krona is linked to the ECU, Sweden isabolishing the trade-weighted basket of currencies it hasused since 1977 to measure the krona's international value.In that basket, the dollar carried the heaviest weight of21%. Other non-EC currencies in the basket included the yenand the Canadian dollar.   With that basket index being abandoned, the krona willfluctuate more against the dollar and move more closely withthe EC currencies, the Riksbank said.   The dollar rocketed higher Friday on the belief thatSwedish banks and enterprises will have to buy massivequantities of dollars to adjust their investment portfoliosdue to the krona-ECU link, traders say.   Estimates for the amount of potential dollar purchases runas high as $20 billion, some currency specialists contend.   &quot;There is definitely more {dollar buying} to be done,&quot;says a trader at a Swedish bank in New York. Because Friday'snews about the Riksbank move came late in Sweden's tradingday and Monday is a bank holiday in much of Europe, theextent of Swedish investors' dollar needs has yet to be seen,he says.   The dollar rose to 6.2310 against the krona Friday from6.0895 late Thursday.   If there is continued dollar demand because of thekrona-ECU news, there will be &quot;steady pressure&quot; driving thedollar higher, says Francoise Soares-Kemp, manager ofcorporate dealings at Credit Suisse in New York.   Under heavy selling pressure because of concerns about thehealth of the economy only a few days ago, the dollar is nownearing important resistance at 1.75 marks.   &quot;It's been so choppy. We could easily go to 1.78&quot; marks,says Markku Anttila, chief dealer at the New York office ofKansallis Osake Pankki, a Finnish bank.   As for the krona, the thinly traded currency was in thespotlight on a day when the latest U.S. trade data wereexpected to be the major highlight.   An export rise and an import downturn pared the U.S.merchandise trade gap to $4.05 billion in March -- the lowestgap since June 1983 -- from $5.50 billion in February.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $355.20 an ounce, off 80 cents. Estimatedvolume was 2.6 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $355.10 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
