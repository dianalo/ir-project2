CP87-4-000 and CP87-28-000 for alternatefacilities on Texas Eastern's Penn-Jersey system to implement the PennEastSS-I service and the Texas Eastern SS-II Phase V storage delivery. Further,Texas Eastern had earlier received authorization in Docket No. CP85-806-000(36 FERC andpara; 61,273) to construct facilities (together with transportationauthorization) on its Penn-Jersey system to implement the CNG/Baltimore/Washingtontransport, but had deferred with Commission approval the acceptance ofthe certificate. In light of unforeseen delays in processing of the Applicants'application herein and resolution of related environmental issues, Applicantsdetermined to implement the three aforementioned services on the Penn-Jerseysystem as originally contemplated. Accordingly, Applicants communicatedto the Commission their desire that it resume processing the applicationsin Docket Nos. CP87-4-000, as to Phase I, and CP87-28-000. Further, TexasEastern anticipates accepting the certificate in Docket No. CP85-806-000and commencing construction in 1988.(2) As part of the decision to proceed with implementing Phase I of thePennEast SS-I service on the Penn-Jersey system, PennEast on November 2,1987 withdrew Phase II of the application in CP87-4-000 and at the sametime advised the Commission of its intention to pursue Phase II (145,000dt per day) through the capacity restoration facilities to be constructedin 1988 and 1989 as proposed herein.(3) On December 11, 1987, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG) filed withthe Commission an application in Docket No. CP88-128-000 to increase itssale to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and Washington Gas Light Companyfrom the previously authorized 120,000 dt per day to 200,000 dt per daycommencing November 1, 1988. Texas Eastern would concurrently file an applicationto render 80,000 dt per day of additional transportation service to CNGby means of the capacity provided by the facilities proposed herein. Thisportion is part of the capacity previously earmarked for the 120,000 dtper day CNG/Baltimore/Washington transport which would now be renderedby means of facilities constructed on the Penn-Jersey system.(4) On April 30, 1987, PennEast filed with the Commission in Docket No.CP87-312-000 an application to render a firm storage (and transportation)service under a new Rate Schedule PSS utilizing the 100,000 dt per daycapacity designated as Texas Eastern_``new storage service'' in the originalapplication.Applicants state that they fully intend to timely resolve the remainingissues in this proceeding in order to place facilities in service by November1, 1988.Applicants requested authorization to amend their application, as previouslyamended in Docket No. CP87-92-001, to reflect the following changes infacilities for which they request Commission authorization:Phase I (previously designated 1987, now proposed 1988):Delete 7.25 miles of 36-inch pipeline at the discharge of Texas Eastern'sBechtelsville Station in Pennsylvania.

Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102, filed in Docket No. CP61-29-001 apetition to amend the order issued March 10, 1961, in Docket No. CP61-29pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act so as to authorize Williamsto utilize its facilities to provide natural gas for all of the operationsof the Atlas Powder Company (Atlas) plant in Jasper County, Missouri, allas more fully set forth in the petition to amend which is on file withthe Commission and open to public inspection.Williams states that the March 10, 1961, order authorized the constructionof facilities to enable Williams to deliver direct sale gas to Atlas foruse in the manufacture of ammonia and urea at what is known as the nitrogensection of Atlas' plant. It is stated that when the direct connection fromWilliams system to Atlas' facilities was constructed and put into service,different parts of the plant, known as the acid and explosives sections,were being served by one of Williams' resale customers, the Gas ServiceCompany, now known as the Kansas Power and Light Company (KPL). Williamsclaims the connection between KPL and Atlas' facilities is located verynear to the Williams Atlas interconnection.Williams avers that the utilization of gas delivered through Williams'and KPL's facilities was originally very easily identified because gasdelivered through Williams flowed to boilers located in the nitrogen sectionof Atlas' plant and gas delivered through KPL flowed to boilers locatedin the explosive section of Atlas' plant but that since 1986 the utilizationof gas delivered from a particular source has been less well-defined becauseof internal modifications made by Atlas to its facilities.It is stated that Atlas has requested Williams to supply Atlas gas forall of its plant operations. Williams believes that its delivery of itspresently authorized volumes at the delivery point for use by Atlas isfully authorized by its certificate in Docket No. CP61-29, regardless ofwhether such gas is ultimately used to generate steam for either the nitrogensection or explosive section of the Atlas plant. However, to alleviateany potential ambiguity in Williams authorization, Williams states it isseeking an amendment to explicitly authorize it to deliver natural gasfor all plant operations. Williams claims it has submitted this petitionto amend in the event the Comission finds that its existing authorizationdoes not permit it to serve all of Atlas' plant requirements.<T3>Comment date:</T3> February 25, 1988, in accordance with the firstsubparagraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraph</ITAG>F.
