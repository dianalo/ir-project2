Despite such assurances, a senior Israeli Embassy official here said that Israel hasn't allowed U.S. officials to interview the individuals or provided copies of any of the documents Mr. Walsh has been seeking for seven months. The impasse could drag on for years in U.S. courts, suggesting that prosecutors, like Congress, aren't likely to have a full picture of Israel's role in the affair before they present the facts to the American public.    Oded Eran, the embassy official, said in an interview that Mr. Walsh's investigators made it clear they are seeking to question the Israelis -- Amiram Nir and David Kimche, two former Israeli officials, and arms dealers Al Schwimmer and Jaacov Nimrodi -- as witnesses and &quot;don't want them as targets for prosecution.&quot;    Mr. Eran said that Israel's position, which hasn't changed during months of quiet negotiations with Mr. Walsh and his aides, indicates a willingness to cooperate &quot;according to the terms and conditions that are best able to protect our interests.&quot;    The long-simmering dispute between Mr. Walsh and Israeli officials, however, isn't expected to prevent him from seeking charges against Americans involved in the arms sales to Iran. </TEXT></DOC>
