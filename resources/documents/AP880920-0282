Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Davis McCown said hebelieves he is the first prosecutor in the country to have someoneconvicted for destroying computer records using a ``virus.''   ``We've had people stealing through computers, but not this typeof case,'' McCown said. ``The basis for this offense is deletion.''   ``It's very rare that the people who spread the viruses arecaught,'' said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus IndustryAssociation in Santa Clara, Calif., which helps educate the publicabout viruses and find ways to fight them.   ``This is absolutely the first time'' for a conviction, McAfeesaid.   ``In the past, prosecutors have stayed away from this kind ofcase because they're too hard to prove,'' McCown said Tuesday.``They have also been reluctant because the victim doesn't want tolet anyone know there has been a breach of security.''   Donald Gene Burleson, 40, was convicted Monday of charges ofharmful access to a computer, a third-degree felony that carries upto 10 years in prison and up to $5,000 in fines.   A key to the case was the fact that State District Judge JohnBradshaw allowed the computer program that deleted the files to beintroduced as evidence, McCown said. It would have been difficultto get a conviction otherwise, he said.   The District Court jury deliberated six hours before bringingback the first conviction under the state's 3-year-old computersabotage law.   Burleson planted the virus in revenge for his firing from aninsurance company, McCown said.   Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes-complicatedthree-week trial that Burleson planted a rogue program in thecomputer system used to store records at USPA and IRA Co., a FortWorth-based insurance and brokerage firm.   A virus is a computer program, often hidden in apparently normalcomputer software, that instructs the computer to change or destroyinformation at a given time or after a certain sequence of commands.   The virus, McCown said, was activated Sept. 21, 1985, two daysafter Burleson was fired as a computer programmer, because ofalleged personality conflicts with other employees.   ``There were a series of programs built into the system as earlyas Labor Day (1985),'' McCown said. ``Once he got fired, thoseprograms went off.''   The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated168,000 payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more thana month. The virus could have caused hundreds of thousands ofdollars in damage to the system had it continued, McCown said.   The defense argued during trial that Burleson was set up bysomeone using his terminal and code. Burleson's attorneys tried toprove he was vacationing in another part of the state with his sonon the dates in early September when the rogue programs wereentered into the system.   But prosecutors presented records showing that Burleson was atwork and his son at school on those dates.   Defense lawyer Jack Beech maintained Burleson is innocent andbut said his client might not have enough money to appeal.   Besides, Beech said, Burleson is likely to get the minimumsentence of two years' probation.   McCown said he is hoping for a stiffer sentence.   Bradshaw on Tuesday ordered a presentence investigation and setsentencing Oct. 21.   Burleson already has lost a civil case waged against him by USPAin connection with the incident. The jury in that case ordered himto pay $12,000 to his former employers.   McAfee said his organization had documented about 250,000 casesof sabotage by computer virus.</TEXT></DOC>
