The announcement came as the talks, which concern the futurecourse of the country, resumed today after a Christmas break.   Wolfgang Schnur, chairman of the Democratic Awakening Party, wasaccused in the newspaper Junge Welt of using his position to obtaina large apartment that originally had been allocated to a familywith several children.   The 45-year-old lawyer denied the allegations but said he waswithdrawing from the talks until the matter had been clarified. Hesaid he was the target of a ``massive campaign'' aimed atdiscrediting him and his party politically, and he claimed hismother, who is Jewish, has received threats from neo-Nazis.   Schnur, elected chairman of Democratic Awakening earlier thismonth when the opposition group met to constitute itself as apolitical party, said he would seek a vote of confidence from theparty board.   Since the fall of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker onOct. 18, East Germans have been intent on rooting out corruption.Most such allegations have centered on the top levels of thenow-ousted Communist Party leadership.   East German leaders have instituted dizzying changes followingprotests by hundreds of thousands of people for democratic reform.It opened the Berlin Wall as part of loosened travel restrictionsin November, promised free elections and called for the talksbetween Communist and opposition leaders.   Honecker's successor, Egon Krenz, also resigned as president anda non-Communist replaced him in a new coalition government, whichincludes the Communists and four traditionally allied parties.Communist Premier Hans Modrow is handling day-to-day affairs untilthe free elections.   The talks involve 37 representatives from five establishedpolitical parties, including the Communists, and representatives of16 opposition groups.   The discussion group is acting as a watchdog group on Modrow'sgovernment until the elections May 6.   Junge Welt, a youth-oriented newspaper once closely allied withthe Communists, made the allegations against Schnur.   Schnur's party has maintained close contacts with West Germanofficials but is split on the question of reunification. It hasalso called for a free market system in East Germany, althoughthere is a dispute on this topic as well.   His movement has existed as a party for only two weeks, and itsnational influence is still hard to assess.   Schnur said he would sue the newspaper, which has becomeincreasingly independent and aggressive in its reporting. Schnuralso said his mother received anonymous letters containing threatsfrom neo-Nazis.   East German leaders have said they are on guard against apossible rise in nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, as a result ofthe turmoil gripping the Communist country.</TEXT></DOC>
