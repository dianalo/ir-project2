Accounting firms long have claimed it's impossible to uncover fraud when company managers want to hide it. But lawsuits by disgruntled investors, congressional criticism and complaints by financial analysts are forcing auditors to stiffen standards. Next week, the auditing standards board of the American Institute of CPAs will consider sweeping changes in the &quot;auditor's report to financial statements,&quot; untouched for 38 years.    &quot;There's no question the ball is in our court,&quot; says Jerry Sullivan, standards board chairman and a Coopers andamp; Lybrand audit partner. The proposal calls for sharpening the audit to better spot such things as financial errors, irregularities and illegal acts. It would even extend the audit to company predictions of survivability, a responsibility auditors have tried to duck until now. Some financial executives fret that tougher standards will sharply boost audit costs but still not stop fraud.    If accountants don't toughen audits soon, Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) says he'll reintroduce legislation to force auditors to spot management fraud.    TRAVEL GUIDES BOOM, but audio and video formats aren't hot sellers.    Even though 1986 has been &quot;a terrible year for travel,&quot; travel-guide author Stephen Birnbaum says sales of his books are up about 20% over last year. Low air fares and a strong dollar had opened foreign travel to a new market that isn't staying home now despite less favorable economics, he says. Waldenbooks says it is buying travel books &quot;aggressively&quot;; competitor B. Dalton says even guides to Europe have come out of their terrorism-related slump.    The enthusiasm isn't carrying over to the growing number of audio and video travel guides. &quot;If I had to make a living from audio tapes alone, I would have to get a night job parking cars,&quot; says Mr. Birnbaum, who offers a series of audio walking tours. Why? Audio tapes are difficult to use as a reference, he says. The non-portable videotapes have gotten poor reviews. &quot;I haven't seen one I liked,&quot; says Candy Olmstead of Travelers Bookstore, New York. Still, Waldenbooks studies the market for audio and video travel guides with test programs.    EXITING SOUTH AFRICA, big U.S. firms leave their philanthropy behind.    International Business Machines Corp. keeps in place a $15 million, five-year program announced last year. Coca-Cola Co., also pulling out, will leave $10 million with two new foundations. General Motors Corp., now negotiating sale of its South African assets, says its $2 million program also will stay intact. &quot;It's the right thing to do,&quot; says IBM spokeswoman Maxine Yee. South Africa watchers say companies would be embarrassed to go back on their word.    But business strategy may color corporate altruism. South Africa could become &quot;a tremendous market if it gets itself together,&quot; says Daniel Purnell of the International Council for Equality of Opportunity Principles. Some companies willing to take that gamble are &quot;laying the groundwork for the post-apartheid period,&quot; says Corporate Philanthropy Report's Craig Smith.    Companies won't comment about future South African philanthropy. &quot;We haven't looked that far down the road yet,&quot; says a Coca-Cola spokesman.    RENT-A-TREE: Furniture retailer Ikea in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., will rent full-sized Christmas trees to 4,000 customers for $10 plus a $10 deposit. Those who return their used trees get their deposit back. The trees? Recycled into mulch.    UP TO $495 A MILE a year is what the average Boston-area homeowner would pay in increased housing cost to put distance between himself and a hazardous-waste landfill, says a study by economists at Vanderbilt University and the Research Triangle Institute. The study measures the intensity of dislike for such sites.    A BETTER MOUSETRAP? Two companies make that claim. Both offer small plastic boxes that trap a mouse as its weight tips the box and closes a door. The Victor Havahart trap retails at $2.95 a two-pack. The Trap-Ease: $3.98 for two.    HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS take on a more traditional look.    People are &quot;buying things that remind them of their childhoods,&quot; says Rita Moses of Saks Fifth Avenue's ornaments department in Atlanta. Cards are more personalized; Recycled Paper Products Inc. in Chicago reports the biggest growth in individual rather than boxed cards. Even artificial trees have taken an old-fashioned look. &quot;There's a trend in artificial trees toward the natural,&quot; says Rory Rehmert of Flower City in Atlanta.    Sales are up, particularly for quality items. Stella Jernigan of Jernigan's Gallery, Atlanta, sold eight Hummel nativity sets in the past few days, at prices ranging up to $1,300. &quot;I've never sold as many in that short a period,&quot; she says. Waterloo Gardens in Devon, Pa., cuts its inventory of inexpensive ornaments, finding people prefer a few special decorations.    But high tech also sells. Hallmark Cards Inc.'s tree ornament featuring a train that circles a Christmas village was sold out at wholesale in October.    BRIEFS: Spotted on the back of a Green Thumb Nursery truck in West Rockport, Maine: Rhoda Dendron Loves Pete Moss. . . . The Minority Business Telephone Book lists more than 10,000 minority manufacturers, distributors and other companies in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
