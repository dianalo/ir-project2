The announcement marked the third time in recent weeks that Kemphas suspended or canceled Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment programs because of suspected mismanagement and abuseduring President Reagan's eight years in office.   Kemp said mortgage defaults under the five-year-old elderlyhousing program totaled $250 million so far, and he said it had toooften served well-to-do elderly instead of the low- tomoderate-income population it was created to serve. The $119 millionrepresents HUD's direct loss to date in payments to private lenderswho provided financing for the projects in return for governmentbacking of the loans.   As an example of the program's poor targeting, Kemp cited a PalmHarbor, Fla., development he said charged $2,100 a month rent fortwo-bedroom apartments. The audit of Midwestern projects approvedunder the program found many were less than half occupied.   Overall, 30 percent of all the elderly housing projects in whichHUD insured the mortgages are in default, as are 12 percent ofsimilar projects in which HUD is a co-insurer of the financing andliable for 80 percent of the cost of any default. HUD is the insureror co-insurer of 150 such projects, said an agency spokesman whocould not immediately give a breakdown between the number for whichHUD is the full insurer and co-insurer.   Kemp has been trying to get a handle on the agency's troubles ata time when Congress also is investigating allegations of fraud,mismanagement and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reaganadministration.   Kemp made his announcement as congressional investigators saidthey would summon former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce to testifyabout allegations he personally ordered the agency to finance anunrelated project involving a longtime friend.   In earlier testimony, Pierce denied any direct role in suchdecisions. But published reports have quoted a former HUD officialas saying Pierce directed her to approve the project.   Kemp, in announcing he was halting new and pending applicationsfor the Retirement Service Center program, said he planned to revivethe program after its guidelines were rewritten to guaranteeimproved project selection and guaranteed targeting to low-incomeelderly.   ``This is a program that should serve low-income people butinstead is serving upper- and middle-income persons, and doing itvery poorly at that,'' he said. ``I plan a complete redesign of theRetirement Service Center program and will require that it betargeted to low- and moderate-income elderly.''   The program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70who can live on their own and afford market rents. The centers donot provide medical care but do offer such services as centraldining and recreation.   Kemp's decision came six months after HUD auditors completed aharsh report of the program's implementation in the Midwest, whereinvestigators found that 25 percent of the completed projects werein default and said that HUD officials time and time again ignoredagency economists and sided with developers in deciding how manyunits should be included in the developments.   ``We believe the projects failed because the field offices didnot assure adequate markets existed for the projects or did notassure the project sponsors had adequate prior experience,'' saidthe internal audit, released by HUD under the Freedom of InformationAct.   The auditors said that in one case the Cincinnati HUD officeapproved a 254 unit development, as requested by the developer,despite an agency economist's findings that the market would supportjust 125 units. In May 1988, nearly three years after New EnglandVillage opened, only 67 of the 254 units were occupied and themortgage was in default.   The auditors also criticized the Minneapolis-St. Paul HUD officefor approving a 208-unit development overlooking a gravel pit thatan agency economist said should be rejected. Only 76 of the unitswere rented as of May 1988 and the mortgage has been assigned toHUD. The project was not identified by name in the audit andregional HUD officials did not immediately return telephone calls.   The report by Thomas J. Bannon, the region's inspector generalfor audit, listed four projects in Cincinnati with mortgagestotaling $35.2 million and two others in the Minneapolis-St. Paularea totaling $17.9 million that were ``in default or consideredfinancially troubled.''   In less than six months on the job, Kemp also has suspended orcanceled two other programs: HUD's rental rehabilitation program anda loan insurance program for land development that financed suchluxury projects as golf course condominiums.   In many of those projects, HUD and congressional investigatorshave determined that politically connected consultants helped winHUD's backing.   In addition to Pierce, among those to be recalled by the Housesubcommittee investigating HUD are Thomas T. Demery, the agency'sformer assistant secretary for housing, and Lance Wilson, Pierce'sformer top aide.   Also, Republican political consultant Paul Manafort will be askedto testify again because of questions about the accuracy of hisprior testimony about the role of his firm in HUD-sponsoredrehabilitation projects, panel aides said.   Two other former ranking HUD officials, Janet Hale and ShirleyMcVay Wiseman, will be asked to testify for a first time, the aidessaid.</TEXT></DOC>
