(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The US Sprint Communications Co. isexpected to sign an agreement to buy a major stake in atrans-Atlantic cable that could boost its internationaltelecommunications business, a trade publication said this week.   The trade journal, TelecommunicationsWeek, said an agreementwould be signed early this month under which US Sprint would acquirePrivate Transatlantic Telecommunications System Inc. of McLean, Va.   The trade journal did not disclose the financial terms of theproposed acquisition.   Private Transatlantic is installing a trans-Atlantic fiber opticcable in a joint venture with Cable andamp; Wireless PLC of London, along-distance company. Each company owns half of the venture.   Officials at US Sprint, based in Kansas City, declined to commenton the report. US Sprint is the country's third-largestlong-distance telephone company.   Paul Woodrow, a spokesman for Cable andamp; Wireless in London, saidhis company had been talking with several big companies aboutselling a stake. He declined to identify the companies.   About half of US Sprint's overseas calls are transmitted on atrans-Atlantic analog, or copper wire, cable. The rest aretransmitted by satellite.   Fiber optic cables transmit calls digitally by using impulses oflight. Analog transmission, an older technology, is more subject todistortion.   Analysts said that in addition to using the new cable system forits own calls, US Sprint could lease transmission services to otherlong-distance companies.   ``If the deal is completed as rumored, it would be a verypositive event for US Sprint,'' said Joel Gross, an analyst with theDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.   ``Not only would it make the company money, but it would givethem much better access within the European Community, which isimportant, because international long-distance telephone service isgrowing about 24 percent a year, more than double the domesticrate,'' Gross said.</TEXT></DOC>
