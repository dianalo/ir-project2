Corn and oat futures prices fell in line with wheat but soybeanfutures advanced strongly largely on technical factors, analystssaid.   Dry weather during the winter is believed to have caused someirreversible damage to the winter wheat crop in Kansas and othercentral Plains states, but many forecasters are predicting a goodsoaking for the region early next week.   ``Wheat's a tough crop anyway,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a graintrader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``You can kill acrop two or three times and still come back and have a recordharvest. It's happened before.''   Soybeans futures advanced smartly, regaining all of Tuesday'slosses, but analysts could cite no bullish supply-and-demanddevelopments to account for the mostly speculative buying.   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 7\ cents lower with thecontract for delivery in May at $4.26 a bushel; corn was unchangedto 2{ cents lower with May at $2.79 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to3{ cents lower with May at $2.08\ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to8\ cents higher with May at $7.92 a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
