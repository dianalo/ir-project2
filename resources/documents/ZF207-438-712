(PEC) of Fairfax, Va., has designed a tool forusers to gauge the speed and accuracy of large packet networks, such as FTS2000.andM;Paul G. Rice, Performance Engineering's vice president of operations, saidthe idea for the tool was spawned by the government's shift from dedicatednetworks to larger, utility networks.andP;  While utility networks offer economiesof scale, Rice said, users need to be able to measure network performance.andM;&quot;The natural reaction of a new user to a large network is a loss of control,&quot;Rice said.andP;  &quot;The user is really no longer reviewing technically what ishappening.andP;  We see a real need for end users to perform surveillance orperformance monitoring.andP;  The user needs to look at what end-to-end service isprovided so he can enforce the service requirements on a contract and dealwith his internal users.&quot;andM;The measurement tool is a customized Intel 80386 PC that runs UNIX softwareand operates under the X.25 end-user protocols.andP;  Barry Saltzman, a member ofPerformance Engineering's technical staff, said the company installed acommunications board and wrote special software so the PC functions as anX.25 host terminal on a network to test local and remote applications.andM;He said the measurement system is based on American National StandardsInstitute standards 1033 and 1043 for ensuring network performance and theConsultative Committee on International Telegraphy and Telephony'srecommended X.134 and X.137 standards for specifying performance for publicdata networks providing packet-switched services.andM;Saltzman said the tool can measure how long it takes users to access anddisengage from a network and how many bits per second are transmitted.andP;  Hesaid it also can calculate the probability that a user will be unable toaccess or disengage from a network, how long it takes to deliver blocks ofdata and the error rate for delivering that data.andM;Tests can be run on various cross sections of a network, and the results arecollected in a database.andP;  Saltzman said test results are displayed on the PCscreen along with a bar graph showing the number of transactions and the timerequired to perform each function.andP;  He said users can set the parameters foreach test.andM;&quot;Our boxes are actually minicomputers that simulate users sending data overthe network.andP;  We've taken a basic platform of standards and implemented atest set to measure end-to-end user performance,&quot; Saltzman said.andM;&quot;It does all the typical user functions.andP;  Samples are collected from thenetwork, and using graphs, users can fine-tune their way of talking to thenetwork.&quot;andM;Rice said the company began developing the tool about a year ago, and it tookabout four months to produce the first prototype.andP;  The first tests were runat the Veterans Affairs Department while the company was working on acontract to plan, test and accept the VA's new Integrated Data CommunicationsUtility.andM;Rice said PEC wanted a measurement tool that would enable users to monitornetwork service and determine if there were delays in the local area network,wide area network or ADP systems.andM;&quot;A lot of agencies are dealing with users acquiring services from differentplaces.andP;  They need to find where delays are happening, and they seldom findways to look at the network component and the ADP component,&quot; Rice said.andM;Stephen W. Burks, PEC's vice president for program development, said the toolalso can be used to revise or plan service requirements.andP;  Given the largenumber of users on a utility network such as FTS 2000, Burks said agenciesneed a way to monitor service quality and make adjustments.andM;&quot;With the advent of shared networks, each agency has to look out for itselfbecause they all have different requirements.andP;  They can't presume someoneelse is having the same problem,&quot; Burks said.andP;  &quot;They need to measureperformance at the user level, and you can't be sure of providers on anetwork the scale of FTS 2000.andP;  Agencies have budget and service requirementsthey need to protect.&quot;andM;Burks said they have not begun to market the tool as a separate product butwill offer it as one of the company's measurement and analysis reportingservices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
