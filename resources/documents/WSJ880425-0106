As is customary in Swiss bank's quarterly reports, specific profit figures weren't released.    UBS, the nation's largest bank, said the quarter was marked by growth in lending operations, which aided interest income. But the &quot;altered situation on the securities markets&quot; prevented the bank from matching the &quot;very good 1987 result&quot; in off-balance-sheet operations, UBS said. Total assets rose 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($942 million) in the quarter.    No. 2 Swiss Bank said that net interest earnings rose because of an increase in volume but that &quot;skittish&quot; stock-market conditions caused commissions to fall. Assets rose 1.7 billion francs, to 147.9 billion francs, because of &quot;the firming of the dollar,&quot; the bank said.    Volksbank, the nation's fourth-largest bank, said that commissions from securities dealings fell but that cost controls and strong income from foreign-exchange trading and from its own securities operations resulted in satisfactory overall cash flow. Assets grew a slight 200 million francs, to 32.4 billion francs.    Unlike those three banks, Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third-largest bank, didn't characterize its first-quarter performance. It did say that assets were flat at 107.2 billion francs and that brokerage-commission income declined while earnings increased from securities and foreign-exchange trading and interbank business. </TEXT></DOC>
