See the notice related to 7 CFR, Part 3015, Subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this actionwill have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement is needed.The determinations set forth in this notice have been made on the basisof the latest available statistics of the Federal Government and afterdue consideration of data, views and recommendations received from tobaccoproducers and other interested persons pursuant to a Notice of ProposedDeterminations which was published on April 21, 1987 (52 FR 13112). <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kindof tobacco for which quotas are in effect or for which marketing quotashave not been disapproved by producers. With respect to the 1987 crop ofVirginia fire-cured (type 21), Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured (types 22-23),dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), cigar fillerand binder (types 42-44; 54-55) and Puerto Rican filler (type 46) tobaccos,the respective maximum level of support is determined in accordance withsection 106 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the ``Act'').Section 106(f)(6)(A) of the Act provides that the level of support forthe 1987 crop of a kind of tobacco shall be the level in cents per poundat which the 1986 crop of such kind of tobacco was supported, plus or minus,respectively, the amount by which (i) the support level for the 1987 crop,as determined under section 106(b) of the Act, is greater or less than(ii) the support level for the 1986 crop, as determined under section 106(b)of the Act, as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under section106(d) of the Act if the support level under clause (i) is greater thanthe support level under clause (ii). Accordingly, under section 106(f)(6)(A)of the Act, the support level for the 1987 crop of such kind of tobaccowill be the 1986 level, adjusted by the difference between (plus or minus)the 1987 ``basic support level'' and the 1986 ``basic support level.''See calculations published at 52 FR 13112.In addition, section 106(f)(6)(B) provides that to the extent requestedby the Board of Directors of an association through which price supportis made available to producers (producer association) the Secretary mayreduce the support level determined under section 106(f)(6)(A) for anykind of tobacco (except flue-cured and burley) to more accurately reflectthe market value and improve and marketability of tobacco.   During the comment period, which ended May 21, 1987, a total of 13 commentswere received from producer associations, a State ASC committee, and individualsrelating to the level of support for these six kinds of tobacco. Therewere seven comments recommending the price support levels be set at theproposed level (about 0.3 percent below the 1986 support level). One commentfor Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured and one comment for dark air-cured recommendedthe price support level be set at the proposed level tied to adjustmentsin the grade loan rates. One comment for Wisconsin binder tobacco recommendedsetting the price support level at 87.7 cents per pound. Two comments forOhio filler tobacco recommended the price support level be set at 87.7cents per pound, or lower, if a reasonable no net cost assessment fee wasannounced.   The 1987 production of these six kinds of tobacco is forecast to be significantlylower than in 1986 due to reduced acreage allotments. Growing conditionshave been generally favorable but an early dry spring in the Kentucky-Tennesseeregion lead to variable setting dates. Thus, the fire-cured and dark-aircured crops are maturing at variable times. Use of these tobaccos are projectedto decrease 5 to 7 percent below 1986, largely due to increased excisetaxes and declining demand for smokeless tobacco products. Supplies offire-cured, dark air-cured and cigar-binder and filler tobaccos are expectedto remain excessive.   An analysis of the key factors used in determining the support level foreach kind of tobacco for the 1987 marketing year follows the discussionof comments received.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received   </ITAG>Virginia Fire-cured Tobacco (Type 21)_The proposed level of support announcedfor Virginia Fire-cured tobacco (Type 21) was 119.6 cents per pound. Twocomments were received, including one from the loan association recommendingthat the price support level be set at the proposed level (a 0.3 percentdecrease from the 1986 support level).   The support use ratio of 1.7 for 1987 remains below normal because 2.5million pounds of tobacco stocks were destroyed by a 1985 flood. The acreageallotment factor was reduced 10 percent and production is expected to bedown about 5 percent. Due to declining production, market prices are expectedto average more than 7 cents per pound above the support level. Acccordingly,the level of support has been determined to be 119.6 cents per pound.  Kentucky-Tennessee Fire-cured Tobacco (Types 22-23)_The proposed levelof support that was announced for Kentucky-Tennessee Fire-cured tobacco(types 22-23) was 123.8 cents per pound. Three comments were received.Two loan associations recommended setting the support level at the proposedlevel (a 0.3 percent decrease from the 1986 support level). One loan associationrecommended setting the support level at the proposed level with an adjustmentof the grade loan rates.   The supply-use ratio of 4.0 is excessive. The acreage allotment factorwas reduced 40 percent and production is expected to be down about 35 percentfrom 1986. Market prices were expected to be 17 percent above the supportlevel. The inventory of the two Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured tobacco associationsrepresents approximately 0.9 year's use. Accordingly, the level of supporthas been determined to be 119.6 cents per pound.   Dark Air-cured Tobacco (Types 35-36)_The proposed level support that wasannounced for Dark Air-cured tobacco (types 35-36) was 195.4 cents perpound. Three comments were received. Two associations recommended settingthe price support level at the proposed level (a 0.3 percent reductionfrom the 1986 support level). One association recommended setting the pricesupport level at the proposed level with an adjustment of the grade loanrates.   The supply-use ratio of 4.5 is excessive. Declining demand has persistedand the acreage allotment factor was reduced 35 percent this year. Productionin 1987 is expected to be down 30 percent from 1986. This reduction isexpected to improve the supply-use ratio but it is likely to remain excessive.Inventories of the three associations through which price support is madeavailable with respect to dark air-cured tobacco (types 35-36) are equalto almost two years' use (The Eastern Dark Fire-cured Association has 51.8percent of CCC's loan stocks and its members accounts for 55 percent ofproduction; the Western Dark Fire-cured Association has 17.7 percent ofCCC's loan stocks and its members account for 14 percent of the production;and the Stemming District has 30.5 percent of CCC's loan stocks and accountsfor 30 percent of the production). Accordingly, the level of support hasbeen determined to be 105.4 cents per pound.   Virginia Sun-cured (Type 37)_The proposed level of support that was announcedfor Virginia sun-cured tobacco (type 37) was 105.6 cents per pound. Twocomments were received recommending that the support level be set at theproposed level (a 0.3 percent reduction from the 1986 level).   The supply-use ratio of 2.3 is slightly below normal. The acreage allotmentfactor was held constant in 1987, but production is expected to be down50 percent from last year due to low prices over the last few years. Basedupon these conditions it has been determined that a tightening supply situationexists. Accordingly, the level of support has been determined to be 105.6cents per pound.  Cigar Filler and Binder Tobacco (Types 42-44, 53-55)_The proposed levelof support that was announced for cigar filler and binder tobaccos (types42-44, 53-55) was 91.4 cents per pound. Three comments were received. Oneloan association recommended the support level be set at 87.7 cents perpound. Two comments from the Ohio loan association recommended reducingthe support level if it is tied to a reduction in the no net cost fee.CCC has determined that the excessive inventory of the association willnecessitate an increased assessment. This kind of tobacco is largely boughtfrom each producer at a flat price for the entire crop. Although the tradepurchased 85 percent of the 1986 Southern Wisconsin tobacco (type 54) productionat a premium above the support level 76 percent of the Northern Wisconsintobacco (type 55) was pledged as collateral for CCC price support loansand 67 percent of the Ohio filler (types 42-44) was pledged as collateralfor CCC price support loans. Even with a 5 percent acreage reduction, the1987 supply-use ratio at 3.6 years use is still expected to remain excessive.Accordingly, the level of support has been determined to be 91.4 centsper pound. Puerto Rican Filler Tobacco (Type 46)_The proposed level of support thatwas announced for Puerto Rican filler tobacco (type 46) was 75.0 centsper pound. No comments were received. The supply-use ratio is 12.4, which is excessive. There is only one buyerwho has usually purchased the loan tobacco by bid sale at less than theassociation's costs. In the face of declining demand, the poundage productionquota, which is set by the Commonwealth, has not sufficiently restrictedproduction so as to reduce loan stocks. To discourage production and toensure no-net-cost to the taxpayer, the level of price support was sharplylowered in 1984 and a no-net-cost assessment of 52 cents per pound wasinitiated. However, since the Commonwealth subsidizes growers, the anticipatedproduction response associated with lower grower returns is negated. Accordingly,the level of support has been determined to be 74.7 cents per pound. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp9,p8,8/9,i1,s25,10,8,8,10,10</C><T4>Minor Kinds of Tobacco: Estimated Production, Supply, and Loan Activity1987/88</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million pounds]</ITAG><H1>Kind and type</H1><H1>1987/88 Production</H1><H1>1987/88 Total supply</H1><H1>1987/88 reserve supply </H1><H1>1987 Crop CCC loan collateral</H1><H1>1987/88 CCC loans as percent of production</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia fire-cured type 21<D>3.6</D><D>10.0</D><D>8.3</D><D>0.1</D><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured types 22-23<D>23.2</D><D>127.3</D><D>116.7</D><D>1.5</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dark air-cured, types 35-36<D>7.5</D><D>57.3</D><D>54.9</D><D>1.0</D><D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia sun-cured, type 37<D>.1</D><D>.7</D><D>1.0</D><D>\1\</D><D>\1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cigar-filler and binder, types 42-44, 53-55<D>10.1</D><D>64.2</D><D>63.8</D><D>4.3</D><D>43</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Puerto Rican type 46<D>.2</D><D>6.1</D><D>1.5 \2\</D><D>.2</D><D>100</D><F>\1\ Negligible.</F><F>\2\ Three times annual disappearance.</F></ITAG></ITAG>As noted in the above table, the supplies of four of these kinds of tobacco(Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured, dark air-cured, cigar-filler and binder,and Puerto Rican) are currently in excess of the supply deemed adequateto meet domestic use and export needs.
