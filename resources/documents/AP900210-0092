(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA's Galileo spacecraft developedcamera trouble today after zooming around cloud-covered Venus in a``celestial billiard shot'' that speeded the robot explorer towardits 1995 encounter with Jupiter.   Although the glitch threatened to prevent Galileo from snappingfive dozen more pictures of Venus tonight and next week, projectscientist Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory saidit should cause no permanent problems for the mission.   Mission director Neal Ausman said the TV camera shutter, aftertaking 16 planned pictures of Venus early today, clicked open andclosed 452 times, twice per minute, apparently because of faultycommands from the probe's main computer.   Ausman, speaking at a news conference, said the unwantedcomputer commands then stopped for reasons not immediatelyunderstood, and a NASA was working to fix the problem.   The extra exposures weren't recorded, the malfunction won't harmthe 16 pictures that were taken, the camera was undamaged, andengineers shut off the camera until it can be repaired, projectmanager Dick Spehalski said.   The 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at9:59 p.m. PST Friday. It was supposed to pass 10,028 miles abovethe furnace-like surface of the second planet from the sun, butactually came three or four miles closer, said mission science anddesign manager Bill O'Neil.   ``We have clearly achieved the sole objective of going to Venus:a trajectory that will help us ultimately reach Jupiter,'' he said.   As a result, scientists won't be very disappointed if themalfunction prevents Galileo from snapping an additional five dozenplanned pictures of Venus, which has been photographed by numerousother spacecraft, Johnson said.   The 16 pictures taken will be used to study wind and cloudpatterns and search for lightning that might indicate the presenceof volcanoes erupting beneath the clouds.   The spacecraft's ultraviolet, visible and infrared light sensorsstudied the makeup of Venus' carbon dioxide atmosphere, mappedcloud-top temperatures and looked for the glow of the hot loweratmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, Johnson said.   The pictures and data were stored on Galileo's tape recorder,and won't be sent back to Earth until October when the spacecraftis close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna.That antenna now can be used only for communications to keepGalileo operating.   Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled toprotect it from sunlight until after the craft cruises past Earthon Dec. 8.   The $1.35 billion mission also will let Galileo examine Earth,its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separatesinto an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995,they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus.   Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18.   Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above Venus' surface, trappingheat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raises surfacetemperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90times that on Earth.   Ausman said the photos and measurements of Venus were secondaryto the main purpose of the flyby: using the planet as a ``gravityslingshot'' to expand the spacecraft's orbit and boost its speed to88,740 mph from 83,750 mph.   ``We have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiardshot to get the energy we need to make it all the say to Jupiter,''Johnson said.   Galileo will use the Earth as a gravity slingshot next Decemberand again Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed towardJupiter, Ausman said.   NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4,will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar map atleast 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission.   When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe willparachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intenseheat and pressure vaporizes it. The orbiter will photograph andstudy Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling theplanet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyagerspacecraft.   Galileo's roundabout route to Jupiter is an indirect result ofthe 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killedseven crew members. After the tragedy, the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration decided against using powerful, volatile,liquid-fueled Centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they weredeployed from shuttles.   Instead, Galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it wasreleased from Atlantis' cargo bay. That made it necessary to usethe gravity of Venus and Earth to help speed and aim Galileo towardJupiter. A Centaur would have propelled Galileo to Venus in onlytwo years.   Environmentalists failed in court to block Galileo's mission.They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Floridawith plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which generateelectricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium.NASA said the risk was minimal.</TEXT></DOC>
