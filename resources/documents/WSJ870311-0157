The assertion that &quot;Martin Siegel has atoned by singing to the SEC and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani&quot; shows astounding naivete. Ratting on your friends to save your hide is not atonement. It is merely the final act of betrayal. Martin Siegel betrayed the confidence of his employer, his clients and now his friends. Furthermore, the statement that &quot;his tipping Mr. Boesky . . . helped his client achieve what it was paying him to achieve&quot; suggests that the means justify the end. Clearly, Mr. Siegel tipped Mr. Boesky for a suitcase full of cash. Any inadvertent benefits accruing to his client do not justify this illicit, illegal act for ill-gotten gains.    More important, however, the comment that &quot;an investment banker often serves his client's interest in tipping the arb&quot; shows a complete lack of understanding of just who the investment banker's clients are. They are none other than the stockholders of the corporation that he is hired to represent. So, if an investment banker tips an arb about a pending takeover offer, at let's say $100 a share, how are the interests of his clients served who sell their stock to the arb for $70 a share? Who benefits -- the arb and the investment banker with a suitcase full of cash, or the client shareholder?    Therein lies the distinction in the Dirks Supreme Court case. Ray Dirks's disclosure of nonpublic information was not for his self-interest nor for the benefit of a third party at the expense of his clients.
