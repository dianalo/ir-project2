BURTON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesdaystayed the execution of mass murderer R. Gene Simmons, who hadscorned appeals of his death warrant, after a fellow inmate askedthe high court to intervene.   Simmons was to be executed at 7 a.m. Thursday for killing 14members of his family at Christmastime 1987. Simmons, convicted lastmonth, waived his appeals and would have been the first prisonerexecuted by Arkansas in 25 years.   The other death row inmate, Jonas Whitmore, petitioned the U.S.Supreme Court on Tuesday to stop Simmons' execution. Whitmore,concerned about the effect that Simmons' execution could have on hisown case, contended that the U.S. Constitution mandates an appeal incapital cases.   Whitmore filed the petition with Justice Harry Blackmun, whoreferred the petition to the entire court, which stayed theexecution pending Whitmore's filing of a petition asking the courtto review the Simmons case.   Should the court refuse to hear the case, ``this stay terminatesautomatically,'' the unsigned opinion said.   Simmons and Whitmore were not available for comment.   When prison officials told Simmons that his execution would notbe carried out as planned, according to prison spokesman DavidWhite, Simmons was eating his requested ``last meal.''   According to White, Simmons' only reaction was to request if hecould finish his dinner _ which, at his request, included awell-cooked filet, six rolls, six slices of cheese, two raw slicedonions, two tomatoes, a banana and two 7-Ups.   Judge John Patterson, who presided over the trial and setSimmons' execution date, refused comment Wednesday night.   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said the ruling ``came as a completeshock to me and I don't understand it.''   Then, referring to a death sentence in another case againstSimmons for two murders in Russelville, Ark., the governor said,``I'll move now to set the other execution date.''   Whitmore's lawyer, Arthur Allen, said he was relieved by thecourt's ruling. ``Now we have adequate time to address someimportant constitutional issues,'' he said. ``It's obvious the courtrealized an important issue was to be addressed here, otherwise theywouldn't have issued the stay.''   Whitmore's petition contends the federal Constitution requires anappellate court to review a Simmons' conviction to keep the deathpenalty from being imposed arbitrarily. The Supreme Court ofArkansas on Monday rejected Whitmore's petition by saying he lackedlegal standing to address Simmons' rights.   The Arkansas Democrat, a Little Rock newspaper, published aletter Wednesday from Simmons in which he called Arkansas' deathpenalty ineffective.   ``One of the things I wanted to say in court (which would haveanswered one of your questions) is that Arkansas does not have ameaningful death penalty, it is a facade,'' Simmons wrote inresponse to questions contained in a note given to him after a March9 federal court hearing.   In an earlier case involving Simmons, the Arkansas Supreme Courtsaid the U.S. Constitution does not require an automatic appeal. Thecourt said there must be an appellate review of whether a prisonersentenced to death is competent to waive his appeals. On Friday, theArkansas Supreme Court ruled that Simmons was competent when hewaived his appeal last month.   Simmons was arrested on Dec. 28, 1987, in Russellville after ashooting rampage that left two people dead. When police went to hisrural home near Dover, they found the 14 bodies of family members.Simmons was convicted last year of murdering the two Russellvilleresidents and sentenced to die. That execution was stayed, but thatstay was lifted last week.   Whitmore was convicted in the 1986 robbery-murder of formerMontgomery County clerk Essie May Black, 62.   Simmons' execution would be the 107th carried out since the 1976U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the deathpenalty.</TEXT></DOC>
