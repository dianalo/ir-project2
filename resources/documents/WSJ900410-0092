The exact nature of the backing couldn't be learned, butthe executives indicated that it will likely includefinancial support, and may extend to licensing of IBM'sadvanced handwriting-recognition technology. IBM, Armonk,N.Y., may also consider reselling Go's computers to its owncustomers.</LP><TEXT>   IBM and Go declined to comment on the arrangement, sketchydetails of which were reported yesterday in PC Week, anindustry newspaper.   Go, based in Foster City, Calif., is developing ahand-held computer that users control with an electronic&quot;stylus&quot; rather than a keyboard. Instead of typing in dataand commands, users write with the penlike instrument on thecomputer's display.   This type of &quot;slate&quot; computer is being touted as the idealtool for workers on the move -- delivery people, salesrepresentatives, and insurance adjusters, for example.   Grid Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Tandy Corp., FortWorth, Texas, already makes a slate computer. SeveralJapanese companies have introduced slates that recognizeJapanese characters, and are expected to enter the U.S.market soon.   Sony Corp., for example, last month announced a 2.8 poundbook-size slate that it said would create a new computermarket in much the same way the Walkman, its miniaturecassette player, revolutionized the personal entertainmentindustry in the early 1980s. For now, the product isavailable only in Japan.   But Go, founded in 1988 by executives from Ashton-TateCorp. and Lotus Development Corp., has caught the imaginationof many in the computer industry. That interest hastranslated into investment dollars and software promises, andhas also attracted some high-powered talent, such as Dan'lLewin, recently lured from Next Inc.   IBM's involvement will likely enhance Go's ability to setstandards in this emerging industry segment. &quot;If it's true,it's a real good business decision for both companies,&quot; saidRichard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.</TEXT></DOC>
