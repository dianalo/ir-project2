The five-day conference of foreign ministers is to chart the101-member organization's role over the next decade. Organizerssaid 92 members plan to attend, including 70 foreign ministers.   President George Vassilou formally opens the three-dayconference on Wednesday.   But delegates on Monday began considering a 60-page draftresolution dealing with international problems.   The draft sharply criticizes Israel and South Africa, echoingprevious sentiments of the movement.   A copy of the draft notes that since the non-aligned summitconference last year the situation in the Middle East ``hasworsened considerably, particularly as a result of the actions ofthe Israeli occupation forces against the civilian population inthe occupied territories.''   The draft ``salutes the heroic uprising of the Palestinianpeople,'' in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It saysthe Arab uprising in the occupied lands that began Dec. 8 is``tangible evidence of their determination to have a state of theirown.''   It demands United Nations sanctions against Israel.   The draft also expresses ``profound alarm at the sharpdeterioration of the situation in South Africa'' and repeatsprevious demands for sanctions against the South Africangovernment, which is controlled by the country's white minority.   The resolution expresses satisfaction with the July 20cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and states the U.N.-mediated peacetalks in Geneva should lead to a ``a comprehensive and lastingsolution'' in the 8-year-old war between the Persian Gulf rivals.   The draft makes no reference to Iraqi use of chemical weapons inthe war.   Conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity saidIranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is expected to demandIraq's condemnation on that issue when he addresses the conferenceon Wednesday.   More than 1,500 police officers, including specialanti-terrorist units, have been assigned to guard the conferencecenter where the meeting is being held and the delegates' hotels.</TEXT></DOC>
