Nicholas Ridley, the minister of the environment, toldParliament today that the development company Imry Merchant hadagreed to delay work on the office block for as long as a month.   Meanwhile, Ridley said, the government and the conservationgroup English Heritage would work with the developer to preservethe archaeological find. Ridley said the government wouldcontribute to the cost.   The announcement followed an all-night vigil by show businesspeople seeking to save the theater's newly excavated shell.   ``Nothing like this exists in the world. Replicas of Elizabethantheaters are being built everywhere but this is the real thing andyou don't throw away the real thing,'' said actor Ian McKellen atthe excavated Rose Theater.   At daybreak by Southwark Bridge on the south bank of the Thamesriver, McKellen joined Dame Judi Dench, Edward Fox and others toblock the bulldozers.   Preserving the remains and making them viewable is estimated tocost about $3.3 million.   Shakespeare is thought to have made his debut as an actor at theRose in 1592 and to have acted there in his own play, ``Henry VI.''   Rose Alley, which leads to the site, commemorates the theater'sname some 350 years after the theater was pulled down.</TEXT></DOC>
