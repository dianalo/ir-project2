SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hiring permanent part-time workers andcontracting out some services may have to be considered as ways tosave money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Franktold a Senate subcommittee Friday.   Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating upsavings realized through automation, and the massive postal agencyneeds to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs,Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office andcivil service.   ``So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues willexceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as wehad planned,'' Frank reported.   The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based onthe 25-cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago.   Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to dropinto the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991,maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs everythree years.   When postal managers applied for the current rates they wereoverly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the``round figure'' of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.   In the real world, costs have exceeded those expectations,resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for. Alsoaffecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring theagency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt.   Frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universalpostal service, and to save money without affecting the currentpostal employees, his managers are having to re-evaluate alloperations of the agency.   ``Maybe we need to look at permanent part-time people,'' hecommented, noting that such workers are common in other countries.The Netherlands, for example, hires many housewives to deliver mailfour hours per day, Frank said.   Another possibility is contracting out some work. The PostalService currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent ofits rural routes, and may need to expand that share and considerhiring contractors for other tasks, Frank said.   Use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvementsin automation will help speed the mail and save money, but thoseare long-term benefits and not things that will affect the agencyovernight, he said.   In addition, automation requires a considerable investment,Frank said. For example, several years ago managers bought machinesdesigned to read the nine-digit ZIP codes. Those codes were delayedby Congress and never become popular with the public, so themachines are now being converted to perform other tasks.</TEXT></DOC>
