NORMAN SISISKY (D., Va.) says he voted against a proposal last year in the House Armed Services Committee to buy more Oshkosh Truck Corp. ammunition carriers than the Army had requested. The panel's decision was by voice vote, and thus wasn't recorded. Oshkosh officials had listed Rep. Sisisky among the supporters of the increased purchases.
