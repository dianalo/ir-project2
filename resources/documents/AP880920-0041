The $23.7 million missile blasted off a land launch pad Mondayand appeared to be accelerating smoothly across a clear sky when itsuddenly exploded several miles above the ocean.   The Navy reported that the Trident 2 had developed a problem inthe second stage about 60 seconds after liftoff, and when it veeredoff course, the range safety officer sent a radio signal to igniteexplosive packages in the vehicle.   The failure was the third in 15 test firings for the missilebeing groomed as the most powerful in the Navy's nuclear arsenal.But two of the last three have been destroyed by the range safetyofficer.   The 44-foot, three-stage missile has nearly 6,000-mile range,but the Navy declined to disclose how far the unarmed warheadpackage was to have traveled Monday.
