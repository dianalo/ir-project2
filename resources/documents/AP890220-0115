Italian secret agents last week raided separate KGB rings inTrieste, an Adriatic port near the Yugoslav border, and La Spezia,on the northwest Ligurian coast, according to Italian newspapers andtelevision.   Investigators in Trieste said Monday that the spying operationfoiled there could have seriously damaged Italy's defensecapabilities. Authorities in Trieste last week arrested GiorgioStancich, 42, an Italian electronics technician living in Yugoslavianear the Italian border.   Stancich, who worked for a firm in Trieste that manufactureselectronic communications systems, was arrested with documentsrelated to a highly advanced electronic warfare system known asCatrin, the reports said.   The project, still under development but considered one of themost sophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by NATO,involves computer systems capable of directing an entire battle,including ground and air operations, according to the reports.   In La Spezia, Investigating Magistrate Maria Cristina Faillaissued five arrest warrants Monday, news reports said.   Italy's ANSA and AGI news agencies said the warrants were forNatalino Francalanci, 51, a fur dealer from the Pisa area; a formercarabinieri police officer; a former Soviet trade representative inItaly; another Soviet, and a Bulgarian.   Of the group, only Francalanci has been apprehended, the reportssaid. Repeated calls to the prosecutor's office Monday wentunanswered.   Francalanci was accused of trying to procure secrets from OtoMelara, a La Spezia firm developing technology for fiber optics andproducing carbon fiber plating for a new combat vehicle, newsreports said.   Newspapers said Italian agents posed as technicians in the LaSpezia firm and provided Francalanci with documents to trace the spyring.   Newspaper accounts said agents in Vienna, Austria, mastermindedthe KGB network.   In the first official comment on the case, Trieste magistratessaid Stancich's arrest capped ``an extremely arduous and delicateinvestigation.''   ``The brilliant operation foiled the attempt to cause gravedamage to the military defense system,'' said the written statementby Giovanni Virdis and Antonio de Niccolo.   They gave no details, saying the investigation was continuing.   Milan's Corriere Della Sera, without citing sources, said KGBagents and half a dozen Italians involved in the case fled Italywhen they realized the ring was broken.   It said the KGB agent who hired Stancich was a former Tass newsagency correspondent in Rome.   ANSA, quoting unidentified investigative sources, said at least10 people were involved in the espionage network.   The Soviet Embassy in Rome said Monday it never heard of thepeople arrested and that all Soviet diplomats and traderepresentatives in Italy ``worked only for the reciprocallyadvantageous development of cooperation between our two countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
