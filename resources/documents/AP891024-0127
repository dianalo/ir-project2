But dissent by Britain, a major South African trade partner,left a gaping hole in the Commonwealth stance. It meant theorganization of former colonies, long painfully obsessed withapartheid, still looks less of a threat than the United States tothe white-run government.   Spurred by what she described as a ``important and positivechanges'' in South Africa, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherredoubled her lone battle against sanctions during the meeting.   The upshot was a public sparring match between Mrs. Thatcher andthe others, led by Canada and Australia, after she issued _ withouttelling them _ a lengthy repudiation of the summit's declaration onSouth Africa announced Sunday.   The declaration itself, which Mrs. Thatcher signed, incorporatedher objections to key provisions.   They call for tighter financial measures immediately andstipulate that a nine-member foreign ministers' committee will meetin April to gauge how far South Africa's new president, F.W. deKlerk, has moved.   Canada and Australia, the declaration's main authors, thoughtthe dissenting note in the final text should have been enough _ orat least Mrs. Thatcher should have told them she would be issuing aseparate repudiation.   ``If we all behaved like this, every Commonwealth document wouldbe a shambles and it wouldn't be worth very much,'' said CanadianPrime Minister Brian Mulroney.   ``We weren't forewarned. We were blind-sided,'' he added as themain antagonists let loose more recriminations at news conferencesbefore heading home Tuesday.   Mrs. Thatcher countered that the others were being ``absolutelyridiculous. ... These people who make use of free speech mustexpect others to do the same.''   The Commonwealth committee's meeting next April is to gaugewhether de Klerk has embarked on ``irreversible'' change by thattime.   Canadian External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark, the committeechairman, said that would include drawing up legislation to repealthe basic tenets of apartheid that deny the black majority the voteand enshrine racial segregation of land.   Similarly, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohensaid this month that unless de Klerk takes legislative action byJune to end apartheid, the Bush administration will consider newmeasures.   The Bush administration will consult with Congress, its Europeanallies and Japan about tougher sanctions ``if, after the next(South African) parliamentary session, there is very little to showfor it,'' Cohen told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   The next session of the white-dominated South African Parliamentbegins in February and ends in June.   Like the United States, the Commonwealth summit did not specifyany new measures. Anti-apartheid groups want coal, oil and SouthAfrica's huge diamond mining industry targeted.   The United States has already left the Commonwealth well behindon sanctions because Britain resists them and black southernAfrican countries, mainly Commonwealth members such as Zimbabwe andZambia, depend on South Africa economically.   ``The Commonwealth in practice is in step with me ... in what itsays, we take a different view,'' Mrs. Thatcher commented in KualaLumpur.   Under U.S. legislation passed in 1986 after Congress overrode aveto by then-President Ronald Reagan, Washington has imposed thestrictest embargoes of any major South African trading partner.They include bans on the imports of fruit, vegetables, grain,mineral fuels, uranium and radio active materials.   South Africa's two biggest trading partners are Japan and Italy,followed by the United States, West Germany and Britain.   A list of 11 non-binding embargoes agreed to in 1986 by theCommonwealth _ except Britain _ included a ban on air links,agricultural products, tourist promotion and imports of uranium,coal, iron and steel.   Britain imposed only a few token measures as a gesture to theCommonwealth, which South Africa quit in 1961.   Mrs. Thatcher opposes sanctions in principle, saying they hurtblacks most and strengthen white resistance to change. Somecritics, particularly African nations, charge she is worried aboutBritish investments, doesn't want to lose the trade, and issympathetic toward Pretoria.</TEXT></DOC>
