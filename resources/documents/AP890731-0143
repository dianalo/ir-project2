Col. William Higgins who was kidnapped while leading aU.N. organization in Lebanon.   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar also said President Bushasked him to help with the return of Higgens' body.   Perez de Cuellar said he had ``many sources'' to help him complywith the request but he still was seeking verification of Higgins'murder.   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking andabduction.'' The 15-member council also demanded the immediate,safe release of all captives ``wherever and by whomever they arebeing held.''   In another action the council routinely extended for six monthsthe mandate of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL. Thepeacekeeping force is stationed in southern Lebanon where Higginswas kidnapped by Moslem extremists.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, speaking after thecouncil meeting, said of the reports that Higgins had beenmurdered: ``I have been told it could be him (Higgins) because in avideotape (of the purported hanging) ... there are indications itis very much like him.''   He said he planned to meet Higgins' wife, Marine Maj. RobinHiggins, on Tuesday, but gave no details.   Reports had circulated last year that Higgins had been killed byhis captors.   On Monday, while still in Paris for a conference on Cambodia,Perez de Cuellar spoke with two Iranian envoys and appealed to themto ``use their influence to avoid this crime.''   The secretary-general has appealed for Higgins' release but healso expressed ``outrage and revulsion at the (reported) fact thatan innocent man, serving the United Nations in the cause of peace,should be murdered in this fashion.''   Higgins was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, near Tyre, by pro-Iranianfundamentalists while heading the 75-member U.N. Truce SupervisionOrganization working in Lebanon. His abductors claimed he was a spyfor the CIA.   Higgins' captors threatened to execute him Monday unless Israelreleased Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric believedlinked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group. The cleric was abductedby Israeli commandos Friday and Israel has proposed trading him forother hostages, including three Israeli soldiers.   Perez de Cuellar on Saturday deplored the Obeid kidnapping andcalled for his release.   Security Council President Dragoslav Pejic, ambassador ofYugoslavia, told the council that it met ``under the shadow ofcruel reports that Lt. Col. Higgins who serves the United Nationson a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon may have been murdered today.''   The council, he said, urges the parties involved ``to act withinreason, restraint and proper respect for human life and dignity.''   The resolution adopted Monday was the culmination of severalmonths of discussion and the council president called it ``a mosttragic irony that our efforts ... should have coincided with thegrave events of recent days.''   On July 29, 1988, the Security Council specifically condemnedthe kidnapping of Higgins and demanded his release. It called uponU.N. members to exert their influence to secure his release.</TEXT></DOC>
