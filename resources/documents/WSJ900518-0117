To discuss a new civil rights bill (known asKennedy-Hawkins) George Bush met with -- take a long breath-- liberal blacks, Hispanics (subdivided into Cubans,Mexicans and Puerto Ricans), reform and orthodox Jews,Asian-Americans (Japanese and Chinese but no Koreans),Catholics, disabled, multiple women's groups and even a fewtoken conservatives. (Native Americans, somehow excluded,should sue for redress.)</LP><TEXT>   Such loud public listening is often covering fire whensomeone is about to abandon principle, which is what GeorgeBush may soon do on civil rights. That principle, affirmedlast year by the Supreme Court, is that policies of &quot;racialpreference&quot; are doubtful as both law and morality. Now thecivil rights establishment and some in Congress want totopple those court judgments and preserve a racial spoilssystem. A fight is on to prevent them, but principle islikely to be snapped under the force of racial politics.   And make no mistake, the politics is hardball. BenjaminHooks, the quick-to-judge head of the NAACP, walked out ofhis White House meeting to declare the Kennedy-Hawkins bill a&quot;litmus test&quot; of Mr. Bush's support for blacks. Mr. Hooks wasas always presuming to speak for all blacks. Arthur Fletcher,Mr. Bush's own appointee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,declared &quot;a battle for the president's mind&quot; -- as if Mr.Bush would morally offend him if he vetoed the bill.   Messrs. Fletcher and Hooks have allies among GOP politicoswho hope to banish the ghost of Willie Horton. Thepresident's approval ratings are close to 70% among blacks,out of sight for a Republican. Some aides say accommodationwill keep those numbers high. Come 1992, Mr. Bush mightdouble his share of the black vote to 20%. So they --communications aide David Demarest, for one -- arranged thephoto-op with Ben Hooks and other civil-rights liberals.   The dissenters include a few administration conservatives,but, more important, many blacks. Bob Woodson, the blackself-help activist, showed up Monday and asked,impertinently, what this civil rights bill had to do with theneeds of poor blacks. Affirmative-action helps only the blackmiddle class, he said.   &quot;I don't want to see poor blacks sacrificed on the altarof affirmative action to expand the base of the RepublicanParty,&quot; Mr. Woodson said later.   Buster Soaries, a Baptist minister, pointed out that thestudent drop-out rate where he lives, in Trenton, N.J., is53%, and most drop-outs are black. &quot;The passage of the civilrights bill won't affect that,&quot; he said.   The Civil Rights Commission's Mr. Fletcher was soflustered by these points that he dismissed the dissenters as&quot;superconservatives.&quot; (Remember when activists for the poorwere liberals?) Later, on the White House driveway, one ofhis colleagues tried to cut Mr. Woodson off from the press bydeclaring the session &quot;closed.&quot; Earlier, the liberal civilrights leaders had threatened to boycott the meeting with Mr.Bush if black conservatives Thomas Sowell or Alan Keyes werealso invited. The White House bravely acquiesced.   This debate among blacks speaks volumes. Mr. Fletcher,like so many of Mr. Bush's black advisers, is well-to-do.He's prospered on the federal payroll. Joshua Smith, anotherinfluential black Republican, is a rich Maryland businessman.A third, Thaddeus Garrett, is an upper-middle-classWashington consultant. They all fiercely defend policies ofracial preference. Their opponents are blacks who work withthe black poor, who've learned that most of the racial spoilsgo to someone else.   Mr. Bush has at least objected to racial quotas. He mayhave been impressed by Evan Kemp, his Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission chairman, who argued passionately onWednesday that quotas merely enshrine discrimination. Quotasinduce employers to hire the least disabled of the disabled,or the most employable blacks, and no more. While Messrs.Fletcher and Hooks deny that Kennedy-Hawkins contains quotas,Mr. Kemp insists it does. But even if this quota problem isonly partly solved, most sources agree that thissplit-the-difference president will be loath to vetoKennedy-Hawkins.   This is a shame, because Mr. Bush's goodwill amongminorities gives him a chance to shape a new and bettercivil-rights consensus. That consensus would still redressspecific acts of discrimination, but bar reversediscrimination. The current rash of racial violence, in NewYork City and elsewhere, should disturb everyone. Mr. Bushcan do much to soothe it.   But race-conscious remedies -- the quotas, &quot;goals,&quot; andset-asides of Mr. Hooks' agenda -- are sparks on dry tinder.They breed condescension and complacency among whites,resentment among blacks, and cause both to discount realblack achievement. A colorblind vision, however imperfect inpractice, is the only sustainable guiding principle for apolyglot society.   Listen to Buster Soaries: &quot;The 1965 bill was a universalcivil rights bill that helped all blacks. But the Kennedybill is not about civil rights. It is about helping peoplewho have already made it. I fear it will only persuade whitesthat they've done all they can for poor blacks. What we don'tneed is another backlash that damages our cause.&quot;   On civil rights, as on so much else, Washington lives in atime warp.</TEXT></DOC>
