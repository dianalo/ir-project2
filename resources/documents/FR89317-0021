Background on the New Mexico Program</ITAG>On December 31, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe New Mexico program. Information regarding the general background onthe New Mexico program, including the Secretary's findings, the dispositionof comments, and detailed explanation of the conditions of approval ofthe New Mexico program can be found in the December 31, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 86459). Actions taken subsequent to theapproval of the New Mexico program are found at 30 CFR 931.12, 931.13,931.15, and 931.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated April 18, 1988, New Mexico submitted to OSMRE the proposedamendment (Administrative Record No. NM-405). The State submitted partsof this proposed amendment at its own initiative and other parts in responseto required program amendments specified in OSMRE's 30 CFR Part 732 letterdated August 14, 1986.OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 22, 1988,<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 23415) and, in the same notice, openedthe public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearingon the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment (Administrative RecordNo. NM-425). The public comment period closed on July 22, 1988. The publichearing, scheduled for July 18, 1988, was not held because no one requestedan opportunity to testify.After reviewing the proposed amendment and all comments received, OSMREnotified New Mexico by letter dated September 26, 1988, of several provisionsin its proposal that appeared to be inconsistent with the Federal regulations(Administrative Record No. NM-446). By letter dated October 20, 1988, NewMexico provided further clarification of and submitted revisions to theamendments (Administrative Record No. NM-452). These clarifications andrevisions pertained to disposal of excess spoil, general requirements;coal processing waste banks, construction requirements; coal processingwaste banks, general requirements; coal processing waste, dams, embankments,and site preparation; and coal processing waste banks, water control measures.To allow the public an opportunity to comment on the additional materialsubmitted by New Mexico, OSMRE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50245), reopeningand extending the comment period (Administrative Record No. NM-471). Thecomment period closed on December 29, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>The Director finds in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,that the amendment submitted by New Mexico on April 18, 1988, and subsequentlyrevised and clarified on October 20, 1988, meets the requirements of SMCRAand 30 CFR Chapter VII as discussed below. The Director is approving therules, providing that they be fully promulgated in identical form to therule submitted to and reviewed by OSMRE and the public.Although the Director is approving the amendment as submitted, he may alsoin the future require that New Mexico make further changes in its amendedregulations as a result of Federal regulatory revisions and court decisions.Subsequent to New Mexico's submission of its proposed coal mine waste amendment,OSMRE on October 27, 1988, promulgated new coal mine waste regulations(53 FR 43585) in response to the decision of the U.S. District Court forthe District of Columbia in <T3>In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation. (In re PermanentII (Round III))</T3> 620 F. Supp. 1519 (D.D.C. July 15, 1985). If furtherchanges to New Mexico's program are needed as the result of OSMRE's newregulations, the Director will notify New Mexico in accordance with 30CFR 732.17(f) of these needed changes.Coal Surface Mining Commission (CSMC) Rule 80-1-20-71(b): Disposal of ExcessSpoil, General RequirementsThe State proposes to amend Rule 80-1-20-71(b) by adding the word ``qualified''to the phrase ``certified by a registered professional engineer.'' Thisproposed change by the State would require that all coal processing wastebanks be certified by a qualified registered professional engineer.The corresponding Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.81(c)(1) requires thata qualified registered professional engineer, experienced in the designof similar earth and waste structures, certify the design of the disposalfacility.The proposed New Mexico rule does not include the earth and waste structuredesign experience requirements of the counterpart Federal regulation. However,the New Mexico Engineering and Land Surveying Practice Act, Section (O)(Rules of Professional Conduct), Subsection 2 (Specialization and the Performanceof Services Only in Specific Areas of Competence) requires that (1) professionalengineers and professional land surveyors undertake assignments only whenqualified by education, experience, or examination in the specific technicalfields of engineering or land surveying involved and (2) registrants notaffix their signatures or seals to any plans or documents dealing withsubject matter in which they lack competence, nor to any such plan or documentsnot prepared under their general direction and control (AdministrativeRecord No. NM-419).Proposed Rule 80-1-20-71(b), when implemented in conjunction with the NewMexico Engineering and Land Surveying Practice Act as discussed above,requires coal processing waste bank design experience equivalent to thatrequired in 30 CFR 816.81(c)(1). Therefore, the Director finds that proposedRule 80-1-20-71(b) is no less effective than the Federal regulation at30 CFR 816.81(c)(1).CSMC Rule 80-1-20-81: Coal Processing Waste Banks, General RequirementsNew Mexico proposes to revise Rule 80-1-20-81, to add a new subsection(a). This new subsection would require the mine operator to meet the MineSafety and Health Act (MSHA) design and construction requirements for refusepiles at 30 CFR 77.214 and 77.215, and to obtain the approval of the Directorof the Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) when designing and constructingcoal processing waste banks. By adding a new subsection (a), existing Staterule (a) would become (b) and (b) would become (c).The coal mine waste and refuse piles sections of corresponding Federalregulations at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83 require that operators constructrefuse piles in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR 77.214 and 77.215.The Director finds that proposed new subsection (a) of Rule 80-1-20-81,is substantively identical to and therefore no less effective than theFederal regulations at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83.CSMC Rule 80-1-20-85: Coal Processing Waste Banks, Construction RequirementsThe State proposes to delete subsections (b) and (c) from Rule 80-1-20-85and change subsection (d) to (b).Deleted subsection (b) requires that coal processing waste banks have aminimum static safety factor of 1.5. The corresponding Federal regulationsat 30 CFR 816.81(c)(2) and 817.81(c)(2) requires that coal mine waste bedesigned to a minimum, long-term, static safety factor of 1.5. The omissionof subsection (b) does not reduce the effectiveness of this rule sincethe minimum static safety factor of 1.5 is required at Rule 80-1-20-71(f),which is cross referenced in Rule 80-1-20-85(a).Deleted subsection (c) deals with design standards for coal processingwaste banks; the subsection includes compaction and maximum lift thicknessstandards. On June 9, 1988, OSMRE deleted comparable coal processing wastebank requirements from the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR816.81 and 817.83 (53 FR 51764).The Director finds that the proposed deletion of subsections (b) and (c)from Rule 80-1-20-85 does not render the rule less effective than the Federalregulations at 816.81 and 817.81.CSMC Rule 80-1-20-92(b): Coal Processing Waste, Site PreparationRule 80-1-20-92(b) provides design criteria for sediment control measures,requires that diversions be designed to carry the peak runoff from a 100-year,24-hour event, and requires compliance with the entire Rule 80-1-20-43that sets performance standards for the hydrologic balance as it relatesto diversions and conveyance of overland flow, shallow groundwater flow,and ephemeral streams.New Mexico proposes to revise Rule 80-1-20-92(b) to require that diversionsfor coal processing waste banks be designed for a 100-year, 6-hour precipitationevent, and to only require compliance with subsections 20-43 (c), (d),(e), (f), and (g) instead of entire Rule 80-1-20-43. Because the proposedprecipitation event standard is the same standard as in the counterpartFederal regulation at 30 CFR 816.84(d) and 817.84(d), the Director findsthat this proposed revision to Rule 80-1-20-92(b) is no less effectivethan the Federal regulations. Because the requirements of deleted subsections20-43 (a) and (b) are general diversion design standards that are not applicableto diversions for coal processing waste banks, the Director finds thatthe removal of their reference in Rule 80-1-20-92(b) does not render theproposed Rule 80-1-20-92(b) less effective than the counterpart Federalregulations at 30 CFR 816.43, 817.43, 816.84, and 817.84.CSMC Rule 80-1-20-83(b): Coal Processing Waste Banks, Water Control MeasuresNew Mexico's Rule 80-1-20-83(b) requires control of surface drainage onand from above coal processing waste banks in accordance with Rule 80-1-20-72(d).Rule 80-1-20-72(d) sets out surface drainage structure design criteriafor valley fill spoil disposal areas.New Mexico proposes to amend Rule 80-1-20-83(b) to remove the requirementsfor use of the valley fill surface drainage design criteria of Rule 80-1-20-72(d)and to substitute in its place a requirement for use of coal processingwaste bank surface drainage design criteria of Rule 80-1-20-92(b). As discussedin the preceding finding, Rule 80-1-20-92(b) includes directly, or by reference,provisions that are no less effective than the Federal program provisionsat 30 CFR 816.84(d) and 817.84(d) for control of surface drainage on andfrom above coal processing waste banks. Omission of the valley fill surfacedrainage design criteria of Rule 80-1-20-72(d) from the coal processingwaste surface drainage sections of Rule 80-1-20-83(b) does not render Rule80-1-20-83(b) less effective than the Federal counterpart regulations at30 CFR 816.84(d) and 817.84(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments </ITAG>OSMRE did not receive any public comments in response to its June 22, 1988,and December l4, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, and it did not hold public hearingsbecause no one requested an opportunity to provide testimony. Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at30 CFR 732.17(h)(11), OSMRE solicited comments from various Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the New Mexico program. The MineSafety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Soil Conservation Service(SCS) submitted comments on the proposed amendment. MSHA responded to OSMRE's request for comments on New Mexico's April 18,1988, submittal by submitting a letter that discussed MSHA's requirementsat 30 CFR 77.214 and 77.2I5 for compaction of refuse embankment material;it also stated that MSHA's regulations do not address drainage controlaround refuse embankments. In its second submittal of October 20, 1988,New Mexico, consistent with OSMRE's regulations, amended Rule 80-1-20-81,to specify that refuse piles be designed and constructed in accordancewith the requirements of 30 CFR 77.214 and 77.215. SCS commented on the April 18, 1988, submittal and suggested that Rules80-1-20-85 (b) and (c) be deleted and be replaced with wording from 30CFR 816.81(c), which requires that a qualified registered professionalengineer be responsible for coal mine waste designs. In its second submittalof October 20, l988, New Mexico, consistent with SCS's comment and OSMRE'sregulations at 816.81(c), amended Rule 80-1-20-71(b) to require that fillsbe designed and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer.Based on the above discussions, the Director concludes that New Mexicohas in its October 20, 1988, submittal adequately revised its regulationsto address MSHA's and SCS's concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision </ITAG>Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendmentsubmitted by New Mexico on April 18, 1988, and as revised and clarifiedon October 20, 1988. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 931 that codify decisions concerningthe New Mexico program are being amended to implement this decision. Thisfinal rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State programamendment process and to encourage states to bring their programs intoconformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistencyof State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations </ITAG>National Environmental Policy Act The Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, for this action, OSMRE is exempt from the requirementto prepare a regulatory impact analysis, and this action does not requireregulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather, it will ensurethat existing requirements established by SMCRA and the Federal rules willbe met by the State. Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3507. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 931 </ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 10, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond L.
