 Thefollowing macro, which will make a message flash onscreen whenever you pressAlt-A, can be incorporated into your own macros:andM;A  B 1 \A  {paneloff} {goto} MESSAGE ~ 2  /ruMESSAGE ~ /rpMESSAGE ~ 3  {lookKEY} 4  {if KEY=&quot;&quot;} {branch \A} 5  {panelon} {get KEY} 6  {blank KEY} ~ 7 {quit} 8 9 KEY 10 11 MESSAGE Message (Press any key to stop)andM;The cells in column A include range names for the cells next to them incolumn B.andP;  B1 should be named \A, B9 should be KEY, and B11 should beMESSAGE.andM;When Alt-A is pressed, the macro continuously protects and unprotects thecell containing the message.andP;  This alternately highlights and unhighlightsthe text, producing the flashing effect.andP;  Pressing any key stops theflashing.andM;Copy Blank CellsandM;Leaving blank cells in every other row of a column of data can improvereadability in Lotus 1-2-3, but the blanks make it hard to copy a formulainto that column and preserve the blanks.andM;But it can be done.andP;  If, for example, you have a formula in A1 that you wantcopied to A3, A5, A7, A9, A11, and A13, you would use the following commands:andM;COPY A1..A11 A3andM;The command seems backward, but here's how it works: cell A1 (with theformula) is copied to cell A3; cell A2 (blank) is copied to cell A4; cell A3(which now has the formula from A1) is copied to A5; cell A4 (still blank) iscopied to A6, and so on.andM;Note that while we wanted the formula in rows down to A13, we marked the&quot;From&quot; range only down to A11.andP;  That's because we specified the &quot;To&quot; rangetwo rows lower than the beginning of the &quot;From&quot; range.andM;WORDPERFECTandM;Temporary ShorthandandM;WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 let you define handy variables in which you canquickly store long or easily misspelled names, technical terms, foreigncharacters, and the like so that you can use a single keystroke combinationto paste in the pesky terms whenever they appear in a document.andP;  Here's how:andM;Press Ctrl-PgUp and WordPerfect will prompt you for a variable number between0 and 9.andP;  Enter the number and you'll be prompted for a value.andP;  Type a textstring of up to 79 characters.andP;  When you need to insert the text, hold downAlt and press the matching number.andM;To assign up to 120 characters to a variable, first type the text andhighlight it with the Block command.andP;  Then press Ctrl-PgUp and enter avariable number.andP;  WordPerfect turns off block highlighting and returns you tothe editing screen.andP;  Press Alt and the variable number to enter thecharacters in your document wherever the cursor is placed.andM;WordPerfect format codes are stripped from the text in variables, which arenot saved from one session to the next.andP;  If you want to retain boldfacing orother formatting, or if you want to make the shorthand permanent, useWordPerfect's regular Macro Define.andM;Hard Spaces and HyphensandM;You may want to make sure that a name like 1-2-3 appears on one line whenyou're writing with WordPerfect.andP;  After all, a line that begins -2-3 looksawfully silly.andP;  Similarly, you may not want a name or phrase with a space init to be divided between two lines.andM;To ensure that a name that includes spaces and/or hyphens is not split up,press Home before typing each space or hyphen in the phrase to create &quot;hard&quot;spaces and hyphens.andP;  If a phrase containing a hard space or hyphen fallsacross the right margin, WordPerfect will force the entire phrase down to thenext line rather than divide it.andM;dBASEandM;Speed Up CommandsandM;Indexes are very important to most file operations in dBASE.andP;  But if youclose all indexes, you will find that certain commands execute faster.andP;  SUM,RECALL, COUNT, DELETE, and COPY start by going to the top of the file andprocessing each record sequentially until the end of the file is reached.andO;This takes longer if an index is active because indexing imposes anartificial retrieval sequence that doesn't matter when dBASE is processingevery record anyway.andM;If you don't want to turn indexing off, you can simply suspend it by usingthis command:andM;SET ORDER TO 0andM;It provides processing just as quickly as closing the index, and it saves alittle time because you don't have to reopen the index later.andM;Insertion HazardsandM;You can erase text accidentally from a dBASE IV layout screen if you add afield while the Insert mode is turned off.andP;  When Insert is switched on, textmoves to the right to make room for the added field.andP;  But when a field isadded with Insert toggled off, text located under the newly inserted materialis deleted.andM;MICROSOFT EXCELandM;Fixing Packed CellsandM;Sometimes, when you import data into Excel from other applications, data thatshould appear in multiple cells will instead be inserted into a single cell.andO;This happens primarily with formulas or text entries that should appear inseparate columns of your Excel worksheet.andP;  If this happens, the Parsecommand, which is available when running Excel in Full Menu mode, lets youspecify where you want the cell divisions to occur.andP;  To parse an importedcell:andM;1.andP;  Mark the cell or range of cells to be parsed.andP;  (You can mark multiplerows, but parsing should be applied to only one column at a time.)andM;2.andP;  Press Alt-D to display the Data menu, then select Parse.andP;  (Remember, youmust be in Full Menu mode to access the command.)andM;3.andP;  When the dialog box containing the cell you are parsing appears, insertsquare brackets--[ ]--wherever you want cell division to occur.andM;Note: As an alternative, you can specify the choice Guess to have Excel placethe brackets where it thinks they should go.andP;  You can then adjust thebrackets as necessary.andM;Find Notes FastandM;With Full Menus active, the Excel Format menu box displays Select Special...,andO;which contains an option to quickly find all cells in your worksheet to whichNotes are attached.andP;  First, call up the format menu and click on SelectSpecial...andP;  .  Make sure the note option is set to On, its default setting,and then click on OK.andP;  When you return to your worksheet, any cells that haveNotes attached to them will be highlighted.andM;MICROSOFT WORKSandM;Preview PagesandM;One of the features new to Microsoft Works 2.0 is the Print Preview command,which allows you to see on your screen how a page will appear at print time.andO;All margins, justification, headers, footers, page breaks, and other detailsappear on your monitor exactly as they will in printed form, but reduced insize.andP;  To access Print Preview:andM;1.andP;  Press Alt-P to access the Print menu, then V to select Preview.andM;2.andP;  When the Preview option box appears, specify the printing options youintend to use.andM;3.andP;  After all print settings are specified, select the second Preview option.andO;A graphic representation of the first page of the current file (such as adocument, spreadsheet, or database report) is displayed on the right side ofyour screen.andP;  To the left is an options box outlining the operations you canperform from the Preview screen.andM;Works' new Preview screen will save you a lot of the time and supplies youonce wasted on test printings.andM;PAGEMAKERandM;Control File SizeandM;When creating large publications in PageMaker, it's a good idea to check thefile size periodically as you work.andP;  Before you build publications that aretoo large to fit on a floppy disk, consider breaking them into smaller parts.andM;In PageMaker, the file size does not decrease after you delete elements fromthe document.andP;  Use the Save As command and a different filename to reclaimthe space that was used by the deleted portions of the publication.andM;NORTON UTILITIESandM;Replay CommandsandM;The Norton Integrator program that comes with The Norton Utilities AdvancedEdition 4.5 includes two poorly documented commands that can save you time.andM;When you press Ctrl-E at the NI command line, the program backs up throughthe list of utilities you've already run.andP;  Pressing Ctrl-X moves you forwardthrough the list.andP;  To rerun a command, just press Enter when its nameappears; any parameters you entered previously will also be used unless youedit them before pressing Enter.andM;PROCOMMandM;Display Call HistoryandM;The Procomm Plus Toggle Display command lets you view a history of calls youhave placed to numbers recorded in your Dialing Directory.andP;  To use thisfeature, display your Dialing Directory using Alt-D, then press T.andM;The default Dialing Directory display, which normally shows the line settings(baud rate, parity, data bits, and so on) for your directory listings,changes to a row/column display that includes the last date you connected toa number and how many times a given listing has been called.andP;  Pressing T asecond time returns you to the default display.andM;REFLEXandM;Dialog Box ShortcutsandM;When you enter data into a field and/or select check boxes in a Reflex dialogbox, you are asked to select either the Proceed or the Cancel button at thebottom of the box to implement or cancel the dialog box setup.andP;  But you canavoid moving the cursor to highlight the appropriate button and pressingEnter or clicking with the mouse button.andM;When you're sure you want to implement the dialog box setup, pressCtrl-Enter; the settings will be implemented no matter where the cursor is inthe box.andP;  To cancel dialog box implementation, simply press Esc.andM;Qandamp;AandM;Add Record NumbersandM;You've decided to add a record number field to an existing Qandamp;A database.andP;  Howdo you tell the program to number your old records?andP;  From the File menu,choose Mass Update.andP;  At the Retrieve Spec, press F10 to retrieve all records.andO;At the Update Spec, move the cursor to your new record number field and type#1 = @NUMBER.andP;  Press F10 to continue.andP;  At the prompt to confirm each updatemanually, choose Yes to let Qandamp;A update all records without pausing for yourapproval.andM;PARADOXandM;U.S.andP;  States TableandM;If you have several Paradox databases that include addresses, you'll savedisk space by using two-letter state abbreviations rather than the names ofstates.andP;  To make it easier to enter information into a database, create atable of the states, with names and abbreviations, and link this table to allother tables that store address information.andP;  The states table should havethis structure:andM;Field name  Field type State abbreviation  A2* State name  A14andM;Each record in the table, of course, consists of a state name and the postalabbreviation.andM;To link a table into which you're entering address information to the statestable, you need to edit the address table.andP;  Put the cursor in the State fieldand give these commands: Menu ValCheck Define Enter TableLookup.andP;  Then type&quot;States&quot; and press Enter, followed by the commands JustCurrentFieldHelpAndFill.andP;  To retain this value check, you should then give the commandMenu Image KeepSet.andM;With this link in place, when the user is entering or editing information andthe cursor is in the database's State field, the following message willappear at the top of the screen: &quot;Press [F1] for help with fill-in.&quot;andP;  If theuser doesn't remember the state abbreviation, he can press F1, and the statestable will be displayed in alphabetical order by abbreviation.andP;  Then the usercan point to a state name and press F2 to fill in the abbreviation.andM;HARVARD GRAPHICSandM;Fit Long Axis NamesandM;If your X-axis names won't fit on one line across the bottom of a chart, puta piping symbol (*) in front of every other name on the X-axis definition.andO;The names will then be staggered every other line, one up a line and onedown, like this:andM;1ST QUARTER  3RD QUARTER 2ND QUARTER  4TH QUARTERandM;(The name with the piping symbol will be moved down.)andM;SPRINTandM;Assign F11 and F12andM;Sprint's documentation doesn't mention the fact, but Extended Keyboard userscan assign function keys F11 and F12 to work as extra hotkeys.andP;  You can alsocombine F11 and F12 with Ctrl, Shift, and Alt to further extend the number ofpotential hotkey combinations.andP;  Since many Sprint users work with dozens ofhotkeys, the extra combinations can come in very handy.andM;XYWRITEandM;Avoid SideKick ConflictandM;The way XyWrite takes control of your keyboard can generate severe conflictswith SideKick, especially with older versions of XyWrite (II Plus and III).andO;These simple precautions will minimize conflicts:andM;Be certain the hotkey assignment used to call up SideKick doesn't duplicate acommand or macro assignment used by XyWrite.andP;  Usually, the default Ctrl-Altkey combination for calling up SideKick is safe.andP;  The Shift-Shift default maynot be.andM;Never use Esc to exit SideKick--always exit it the same way you entered.andP;  Ifyou called up SideKick with Ctrl-Alt, press Ctrl-Alt once again to return toXyWrite.andM;VENTURAandM;Zap Carriage ReturnsandM;When preparing text for a Ventura document, it's common practice to separateparagraphs within that text with a single carriage return.andP;  That's becauseVentura itself lets you specify how much space should precede each paragraph.andM;Old habits die hard, however, and some writers still separate paragraphs withdouble carriage returns, the way they used to do for typewritten documents.andO;This interferes with Ventura's own paragraph spacing.andP;  Ventura provides aneasy way to eliminate these carriage returns during file import.andM;While editing a document in a word processor, insert the following line atthe beginning of the troublesome wordprocessing file:andM;@PARAFILTER ON =andM;When Ventura reads in a file that begins with this command, it strips awayany double carriage returns that file contains, saving you the trouble ofeliminating them manually or using a complex search-and-replace routine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
