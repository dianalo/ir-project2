Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Lawrence Waddington issued atemporary restraining order Thursday requiring Steven Inwood tostay 250 yards from the couple, their attorney, Jessica Kaye, saidFriday.   The order further prohibits Inwood _ who played the drivenBroadway director in the movie ``Stayin' Alive'' _ from physicallyor verbally harassing them, Ms. Kaye said.   The order, which was confirmed by a court clerk, is in effectuntil a court hearing Sept. 9, Ms. Kaye said.   The 35-year-old actress, who this year starred in the NBC-TVminiseries ``Noble House,'' received the death threats Aug. 16 andhas gone into seclusion for her safety, the attorney said.
