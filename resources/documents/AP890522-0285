It started with ``a clean slate and a bunch of good ideas andgood examples,'' said medical historian King. Of all the Americanschools that were trying to improve medical education, ``Hopkinswent about it with the greatest enthusiasm and effectiveness.''   It was an ambitious enterprise, even apart from requiring acollege degree for entry. Few other schools provided well-equippedlaboratories in basic science for teachers and students. Hopkinsaimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on ofexisting knowledge.   The idea was ``to give the world men who can not only sail bythe old charts, but who can make new and better ones for the use ofothers,'' said John Shaw Billings, a Civil War battlefield surgeonwho became a key architect of the medical school curriculum.   Hopkins also made a policy of learning by doing, both in thelaboratory and in the hospital. With Osler as their mentor at thebedside, students took medical histories of patients, performedphysical examinations, conducted routine laboratory tests andfollowed their patients' course.   As Osler put it, ``the student began with the patient, continuedwith the patient, ended his studies with the patient, using booksand lectures as tools, means to an end.''   The school made full-time jobs out of teaching basic science,rather than using local physicians to teach part time, as mostother schools did. The full-time idea, later extended toinstructors of medical practice, allowed Hopkins to go outside thelocal community to lure top-notch faculty members.   Eventually, the school also offered lengthy training in medicalspecialties to its students who had finished the four years of theregular curriculum.   The result of all this was such that in 1901, Harvard's Eliotcongratulated Hopkins University president Daniel Gilman on a``prodigious advancement of medical teaching.''   Among all the changes in the nation of the previous 25 years,Eliot continued, ``there is none greater than that wrought in thedevelopment of medical teaching and research, and these men whomyou, sir, summoned here have led the way.''   Who were those men? Most attention nowadays goes to the Big Four.   One was Osler, who had come from Philadelphia to becomeprofessor of medicine at the school and physician-in-chief at thehospital. The author of a classic medical text, Osler became one ofthe nation's most highly regarded physicians.   Joining him was William Halsted, a shy and excrutiatinglymeticulous surgeon. He became well-known for such innovations asthe radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and his training of othersurgeons.   Then there was William Welch, a genial, rotund pathologyprofessor who became a power behind reforms in medical educationand stimulated interest in medical philanthropy.   Finally there was Howard Kelly, the gynecological surgeon, whodeveloped and improved that art. He ``took pleasure in quick,flashy operating,'' one student wrote later. ``He'd be in and outof the abdomen almost before you knew it, all the time talking andillustrating what he was doing or about to do.''   Today, Kelly's operating table serves as a library table, itsthick glass top chipped around the edges.   Of the 17 original hospital buildings, only three remain, hemmedin by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medicalschool. The old sitting room where Osler wrote his famous textbookis now split into cubicles by blue room dividers, part of anadministrative office.   The scene today at Hopkins would astonish the Big Four.   Faint rock music nudges the quiet of a white-walled laboratoryas Bert Vogelstein, 39, holds up a dark gray sheet of X-ray film.It shows several series of smudged black lines.   During the days of the Big Four, physicians were just beginningto understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells. Now, thesmudged lines on Vogelstein's film are helping to explain thoseabnormalities. They represent an analysis of colon cancer tissue,suggesting that the tumors arose after normal cells lost protectionfrom a gene that suppresses cancer.   In a room crammed with computer display terminals, ElliotFishman, 36, narrates a series of ghostly images. A skull tumblesend over end, revealing its inner detail. A hip bone sways in itspelvic socket like a pendulum. A dark blue liver rotates to revealpatches of cancer that look like popcorn.   Halsted needed a scalpel to peer within patients like this;radiologist Fishman uses sophisticated scanning machines andcomputer power. The result is three-dimensional images of thebody's interior that can be rotated or manipulated, helpingsurgeons plan operations well in advance.   Victor McKusick, 67, arose shortly after 5 a.m. one recent dayat his Baltimore home. He drank some coffee, read the paper, pickedup a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small taperecorder. It was time to catalog a new human gene.   When the Hopkins medical school was founded, the idea of geneswas not yet generally accepted, for the work of Austrian monkGregor Mendel in the 1860s was not yet widely known. Today,McKusick maintains a list of human genes, accessible by computeraround the world. The entry he dictated before breakfast thatmorning was number 4,584.   But while medicine has advanced greatly since Hopkins began,some things stay the same, notes Hopkins medical historian A.McGehee Harvey.   A committee that reviewed the Hopkins medical curriculumrecently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing, and of not onlyteaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creatingnew knowledge, Harvey said.   ``It's a process of rediscovery,'' he said with a smile. ``Theyrediscovered all the principles that were here when the placestarted.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 4</NOTE></DOC>
