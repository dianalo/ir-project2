Officials at ABC, NBC and CNN were said to have increasedsecurity in the wake of the incidents.;    The voices of three unidentifiedmen were heard over the theme music and anchor Dan Rather's introduction atthe start of the CBS broadcast, done at 3:30 PST.;    The face of one of theprotesters appeared momentarily in front of Rather's as the anchor calmlysaid, &quot;We're going to take a break for a commercial just now. We'll break fora commercial.&quot;;    The screen went black for several seconds before Ratherreturned to say, &quot;Sorry about that. We're going to take things again rightfrom the top.&quot;;    CBS viewers on the West Coast, including those in the BayArea, did not see what happened, since stations here carry the second feed ofthe broadcast, done right after the first at 4 p.m. PST. CNN, however, carriedtape of the incident across the country, as did CBS affiliate KPIX (Ch. 5)locally.;    Rather acknowledged the interruption on the later broadcast.;   CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said she did not know how the protesters got intothe studio on Manhattan's West Side or whether they belonged to any organizedgroup, but it was believed they were also members of ACT-UP, a militant AIDSactivist group.;    Viewers heard protesters, but didn't see them on&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer,&quot; which is done in both Manhattan and Washington.;    JimLehrer in Washington asked MacNeil what was going on when sounds of thecommotion could be heard on the air and when he replied that demonstratorswere in the studio, the show went to a taped story while the protesters wereremoved.;    Not quite the whole story;  Meanwhile, coverage of the Gulf Warcontinued Tuesday on all the networks, now under new censorship rules inIsrael and Saudi Arabia.;    CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said live reportsfrom the network's Tel Aviv bureau aired with an Israel censor off-camera,ready to black out anything he didn't like. Military censors are now stationedat network bureaus in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.;    This was graphicallydemonstrated after the latest Iraqi attack on the city Tuesday evening Israelitime.;    Reporter Richard Roth told viewers at first he could only say therehad been &quot;casualties in the greater Tel Aviv area.&quot;;    When he was asked byan anchor in Atlanta if he could be more specific about where the missile hit,Roth turned to the censor and said, &quot;Let's test this right away. Can I saythis is a residential area?&quot;;    The censor said he could and Roth then saidthat, and mentioned the censor's approval on later reports on the attack.;   Tape of the bloody incident appeared with the words, &quot;Cleared by Israelicensors&quot; superimposed across the bottom of the screen for several seconds atthe start.;    Similar tags have appeared in front of tape shot in SaudiArabia, whose government is also clearing video before it is sent out bysatellite.;    In both countries, officials are worried that reporting preciselocations of Scud missile hits will aid the Iraqis in aiming their rockets.;   The U.S. military also has rules about that, which read in part, &quot;Informationon the effectiveness of . . . direct and indirect fire . . . is notreportable. It could jeopardize and endanger lives.&quot;;    In a relateddevelopment, the Saudis ordered network &quot;pool&quot; cameras off the top of the roofof the primary press hotel in Dhahran, site of the biggest military airport inthe country.;    The camera was moved to a lower floor after the Saudis citedsecurity reasons. They made a similar demand in the capital city of Riyadh,but later allowed that camera to stay on the roof, but it was not known whythey changed their mind there.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID N.
