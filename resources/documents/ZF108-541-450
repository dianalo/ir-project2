 But there's more to it than that.andP;  Ashortage of basic management skills combines with too much verticalintegration, minimal experience in the mass production of consumer goods andthe lack of market feedback to create what would seem to be a situation ripefor computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM).andP;  Or does it?andM;Let's take the case of a hypothetical shoe manufacturer in an EasternEuropean country--it doesn't matter which one because they're all facing thesame problems.andP;  Before the end of each year, the factory management committeereceives from its supervising ministry the production targets for thefollowing 12 months.andP;  The production targets specify the quantities to bemade of each type of shoe.andM;From here, the committee calculates the amount of materials (leather,synthetics, packaging, etc.) that they'll need over the same period.andP;  Theministry then directs other factories to produce and deliver those materials.andO;All this planning is based on population statistics and previous years'production figures.andM;After the first month, some of the factory's own employees report that acertain shoe falls apart after an evening's stroll with the dog.andP;  The problemis tracked to the quality of the leather that's being used.andP;  A westernmanufacturer would react to this problem by switching suppliers.andP;  That can'tbe done in this case, because all alternative suppliers are working to fullcapacity to meet the needs of their other designated customers.andP;  Thesolution?andP;  Continue to make substandard shoes (and meet production targets)or stop making them altogether.andP;  (Incidentally, dissatisfaction with thequality of incoming components is a major reason for the high level ofvertical integration in Eastern European factories--they end up making themthemselves.)andM;Because retail outlets sell whatever they can get, and consumers buy what'sin the shops, there's no effective feedback from the marketplace to thefactory.andP;  Apart from the letters pages of newspapers, there is no way for thefactory's production committee to learn whether they are making shoes thatpeople actually need at a price and quality they can afford.andP;  And, even ifthey had that information, there is little they could do to respond to it.andM;For some time now, countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Soviet Unionhave been giving more freedom to individual enterprises--something called&quot;self-accounting.&quot;andP;  Instead of sending all of their revenues to a centralministry, businesses can reinvest most of it.andP;  Unfortunately, self-accountinghas not been as helpful as it initially promised to be.andP;  Prices are stillfixed at artificially low levels.andP;  And, with the absence of marketing skills,market research and market feedback, production planners have no way ofdetermining how to allocate that investment across existing and new products.andO;Only when it's market-driven can production be optimized: Are we making theright quantity of the right product in order to maximize profits?andM;Without that approach in place, computer-integrated manufacturing isirrelevant.andP;  What's the point of going to all that effort to maximize the useof resources and manpower in the production of a product that nobody wants tobuy?andM;The Good NewsandM;The good news is that the need to change from centralized to market-drivenmanufacturing has already been recognized.andP;  And, Eastern Europe hasunder-exploited strengths in systems theory and in the development ofalgorithms and software, which means that it might be able to use advancedmanufacturing techniques such as CIM to catch up quickly from its trailingposition.andP;  In some cases, Eastern European industry may even be able tosurpass western manufacturers in terms of productivity and quality by the endof the decade.andM;Indeed, computer-aided design (CAD), production control and automation is notunheard of in Eastern Europe.andP;  The region just does not have enough of it,and what does exist cannot be used to its full potential until furtherchanges are made in the way the economy works.andM;Until that time, the capacity and maintainability of the installed base ofcomputers must be improved.andP;  Processors, controllers and peripherals aremanufactured in various Eastern European countries, but they lack the kind ofquality control or advanced design that an IBM might impose.andP;  Disk drives of100 megabytes are considered hot stuff.andP;  Lack of central host capacity, localarea networking capability and terminals or microcomputers conspire togetherto make monitoring production from the shop floor impossible.andP;  Without thisaccess to the system as production lines roll, it's impossible to quicklychange product specifications to suit customer demand.andP;  The availability ofpersonal computers is so limited that they can only be used for officeapplications, such as the processing of product warranties.andP;  Robots andcomputer-controlled inventory storage systems are virtually unknown.andP;  Weaktransportation infrastructures make just-in-time techniques unfeasible.andM;These technological impediments to CIM seem small in this part of the worldwhere change is the name of the game.andP;  Not only are Eastern Europeans eagerto embrace the market economy, but managers are desperately keen to learn newskills and employ new technology.andP;  Where this can be done easily, and wherethe enterprise has the essential hard currency, then automation willcertainly be used.andP;  A good case in point is Up.andP;  Based in Rousinov,Czechoslovakia, Up makes volume quantities of furniture using the latestmachines from West German companies like Nottmeyer and Homag.andP;  The resultshave been good enough to allow the company to export.andM;Up the Learning CurveandM;In March, Eastern Europeans demonstrated an eagerness to learn aboutmanufacturing automation, as record numbers attended the CeBIT trade show inHannover, West Germany.andP;  While approximately 400 Eastern Europeans attendedlast year's show, about 10,000 descended on this year's exhibits, whichincluded an entire hall of factory automation.andP;  Many companies also eagerlyjoined the European MAP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol) User Group(Emug), when they were invited last summer.andM;Eastern European and Soviet interest in MAP (and indeed in all internationalstandards) is nothing new.andP;  General Motors Corp.'s system and productionengineers were guests of the GKNT (State Committee for Science andTechnology) in Moscow as long ago as 1987.andP;  Most work in the area of advancedproduction automation has taken place at an academic level, although it hasbeen supplemented by some practical laboratory work on specific aspects ofthe problem.andM;The biggest impediments to a rapid introduction of CIM in the East, seem tobe the availability of technology, practical expertise and the cash withwhich to acquire it.andP;  In this respect, the days of the Coordinating Committeefor Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) regulations, which restrict theexport of more advanced technology to Eastern Europe, would seem to benumbered.andP;  Already, Western European companies can see the huge unsatisfiedconsumer market in the East and have started to move in with joint venturedeals (and other investments) that include the latest in advancedmanufacturing.andM;The Eastern Europeans are not having too much trouble attracting interest insuch joint ventures.andP;  Over the last decade, the FSM automobile factory inPoland has distinguished itself by allowing production to fall back to350,000 vehicles annually against growing demand.andP;  Originally built in the1970s in cooperation with Fiat and supported by it since, the FSM productionlines are, nevertheless, in urgent need of modernization.andP;  As a result, theItalian car maker is having to fend off competition for the contract fromDaihatsu of Japan.andM;In Czechoslovakia, Skoda, perhaps one of the most advanced companies in theuse of automation, is seeking Western assistance in building a new engineplant to make power units for its latest Bertone-designed Favorit autos.andO;Already, the company has held talks with Citroen, Fiat, Isuzu, Nissan andVolkswagen regarding deals for licenses and technology.andP;  If Skoda can achievea major increase in the 180,000 units it produces annually, it will startexporting to the U.S.andP;  market.andM;Meanwhile, GM is thought to have plans for a $400 million car plant inHungary.andP;  But Volkswagen is ahead of this game in East Germany; an engineplant commissioned in 1988 already supplies engines for use in WestGerman-assembled VW Polos and Rabbits.andM;Last November, General Electric bought a majority stake in Tungsram,Hungary's large electrical goods manufacturer.andP;  The U.S.andP;  giant's newsubsidiary will become integrated into its global empire, but not without aconsiderable injection of sophisticated production technology and managementtraining.andP;  This $150 million deal is believed to be only the first step inGE's plan to invest extensively throughout Eastern Europe.andM;In a parallel move, the Swiss-Swedish electrical-engineering concern AseaBrown Boveri is about to secure a majority interest in Zamech, Poland'slargest producer of turbines and generators.andM;All these deals include a large element of technology transfer as a means ofboosting advanced manufacturing capability.andP;  The result of such earlycommitments to CIM should be a snowball effect that will improve theproduction levels and quality of the essential ingredients--computers,communications, robots and numerically controlled machine tools--until a highdegree of self-sufficiency is achieved.andM;These advances will not be gained without penalties.andP;  In countries thatguarantee full employment, the drive for efficiency and profits is bound tolead to unemployment (which really exists already in the form ofabsenteeism).andM;If the West is indeed genuine in applauding the political changes that havetaken place in Eastern Europe, some say they have a moral obligation to giveEastern Europe the practical support needed to reconstruct its economies.andO;CIM would be a good place to start.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
