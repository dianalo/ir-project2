(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here are brief sketches of theastronauts who will fly aboard the space shuttle Discovery.   NAVY CAPT. FREDERICK H. HAUCK, who has flown on two previousshuttles since becoming an astronaut 10 years ago, will becommanding the first shuttle to fly since the Challenger blew uplittle more than a minute after it left the launchpad Jan. 28, 1986.   Hauck, 47, said he has had plenty of time to dwell on Challengerand won't be concentrating on that when he lifts off.   ``There's no doubt I'll be looking at the screen, that when itsays 73 seconds and it's counting upwards, I'll know we've passedthat particular milestone. But it's not like I'm worried aboutit,'' he said in a recent interview.   The former Navy test pilot, who flew 114 combat and combatsupport missions in Southeast Asia, piloted the Challenger in June1983 and commanded Discovery in November 1984 when the crew madethe first space salvage mission in history, retrieving two disabledsatellites.   Hauck grew up in Winchester, Mass., and Washington, D.C. Hereceived a bachelor's degree from Tufts University and a master'sin nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.   His wife, Dolly, and 25-year-old daughter, Whitney Hauck Wood,planned to be at the launch, he said, but his 23-year-old son,Stephen, a Navy officer, is stationed on a ship that was sent tothe Persian Gulf.</TEXT><TEXT>   AIR FORCE COL. RICHARD O. COVEY, an astronaut for nearly 10years, will pilot the shuttle on which he logged more than 170hours in space on a previous flight.   The 42-year-old former Air Force fighter and test pilot guidedDiscovery on an August 1985 mission and will be thinking about theChallenger astronauts when he lifts off on his new mission.   ``I'll also be knowing that they would be pleased that we havegotten back to the point where we are going to fly again.''   His wife, Kathleen, and daughters Sarah, 14, and Amy, 12 willattend the launch.   Covey was born in Fayetteville, Ark., and grew up in Fort WaltonBeach, Fla. His late father was an Air Force lieutenant colonel.   He earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy in1968 and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from PurdueUniversity a year later.   As an Air Force pilot, Covey flew 339 combat missions during twotours in southeast Asia. He has flown more than 4,000 hours in morethan 25 different types of aircraft.</TEXT><TEXT>   MARINE LT. COL. DAVID C. HILMERS, an astronaut since 1980 andveteran of one previous shuttle flight, will be a missionspecialist aboard Discovery.   Hilmers' first space flight was in October 1985 _ the maidenvoyage of the orbiter Atlantis, on which he was a missionspecialist.   On Discovery, he will help deploy a $100 million communicationssatellite.   Hilmers grew up in DeWitt, Iowa, and graduated with a bachelor'sdegree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Cornell College in1972. He earned a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1977and the degree of electrical engineer from the U.S. NavalPostgraduate School in 1978.   Hilmers said that like the other astronauts, he will be thinkingof their Challenger crew members.   But, he added, ``I think that when it gets right down to thelast couple of minutes, that we're going to be looking up at thesky and not behind us.''   Hilmers and his wife, Lynn, have two sons, Matthew, 13, andDaniel, 9.</TEXT><TEXT>   GEORGE ``PINKY'' NELSON is the only one of Discovery's five-mancrew who has walked in space.   Nelson, 38, logged nine hours of space-walking on his firstflight, aboard Challenger in April 1984. His second mission, onColumbia, began 16 days before the Challenger tragedy.   On this launch, there are no plans for Nelson to walk in space,unless something goes wrong in deploying a $100 millioncommunications satellite.   He is again a mission specialist and this time has the duty ofblowing off an escape hatch and deploying a new escape pole for thefive men if an emergency occurs.   ``On the one point, you have to be doubly focused on what'shappening. On the other hand you just have to be soaking in thisamazing experience,'' he said in a recent interview.   Nelson, an astronomer, is the only one on the five-man crewwithout a military background. He is the son of a high schoolscience teacher, grew up in Willmar, Minn., and earned a bachelor'sdegree in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1972 and a master'sand doctorate in astronomy from the University of Washington in1974 and 1978.   His wife, Susan, and daughters, Aimee Tess, 16, and Marti Ann,13, will be present for the liftoff.</TEXT><TEXT>   JOHN M. ``Mike'' LOUNGE, who first flew into space on Discoveryin August 1985, will again be a mission specialist on NASA's firstflight in 2{ years.   This time aboard Discovery, Lounge, 38, a former Navy aviator,is the lead astronaut in charge of deploying the $100 millioncommunications satellite.   His other flight, which launched Aug. 27, 1985, is described byNASA as its most successful shuttle mission so far, with astronautsdeploying three satellites and repairing an ailing satellite.   Lounge, of Burlington, Colo., said the Challenger tragedy willadd to the anxiety astronauts always feel during the first fewmoments after launch, Lounge said. But, he said, once thespacecraft gets into space ``and it gets real quiet, my heartbeatwill probably go down quite a bit.''   Lounge, a Colorado native, received a B.S. degree in physics andmathematics from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and a master's inastrogeophysics from the University of Colorado.   He completed a nine-month cruise in Southeast Asia aboard theUSS Enterprise and participated in 99 combat missions. He currentlyis a member of the Texas Air National Guard and flies with his unitat least once a week.   He was selected as an astronaut in 1980.   His family, including, his children Shannon, 17, Kenneth, 7, andKathy, 4, plan to be there for the liftoff.</TEXT></DOC>
