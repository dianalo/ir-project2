Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> KR DARTA </CO><IN> TNM RFD </IN><TEXT>   Kroger Co. directors received a sweetened offer of about $5 billion for the supermarket chain from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the New York leveraged buy-out specialists.    Kohlberg Kravis valued its new offer at $64 a Kroger share. It includes $50 a share of cash, $11 of subordinated debentures and a continuing equity interest in Kroger that KKR valued at $3 a Kroger share. Kohlberg Kravis said terms would be set so that the debentures will trade at par.    Cincinnati-based Kroger said its management and legal and financial advisers &quot;are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal&quot; from Kohlberg Kravis, but a spokesman said he was unable to predict when the company will have a more definitive response.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kroger common closed at $55.25, off $1. It was among the most active issues on volume of about 1.2 million shares.    Earlier, Kohlberg Kravis offered $58.50 a share for Kroger, including $50 a share of cash, $6.50 a share principal amount of subordinated debentures and a continuing equity interest intended to have a trading value of $2 a share.    Kroger last month unveiled a restructuring proposal involving payment to shareholders of $40 a share in cash plus a junior subordinated deferred interest debenture with a trading value of about $8 a share. Kroger intended to ward off possible hostile takeover bids, particularly from the Haft family, Landover, Md., who had obtained federal clearance to accumulate a stake in Kroger.    The Haft family, which controls Dart Group Corp., responded with a takeover offer at $55 a share, including $43 a share of cash, plus securities with an intended market value of $12 a share. The Haft offer also included a continued equity interest in Kroger, but a Haft spokesman said the group didn't place a dollar value on that interest. Kohlberg Kravis followed with its $58.50 offer.    Robert Haft, president of Dart Group, yesterday evening issued a brief statement offering to work with Kroger management &quot;to enhance their restructuring program by providing additional equity.&quot;    A spokesman for the family said he was unable to elaborate on that statement. However, it appears that the Haft family seeks to obtain control of Kroger, or at least a major stake, by working with management rather than engaging in a bidding contest with Kohlberg Kravis.    The Kohlberg Kravis offer wasn't announced until after the market closed yesterday, giving analysts little chance to study the terms. However, several said that, at first glance, it appears probable that Kohlberg will be successful in buying Kroger.    &quot;If I were the chairman of Kroger, I'd start talking or start packing,&quot; said Robert Raiff, an analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.    Gary M. Giblen, an analyst with Rotan Mosle in Houston, a division of PaineWebber Inc., said he doesn't think Kroger will proceed with its proposed restructuring because of Kohlberg Kravis's sweetened bid.    Kohlberg Kravis said its offer is subject to negotiation of a definitive acquisition agreement, &quot;a further review of projections recently provided&quot; to Kroger shareholders, arranging of necessary financing and approval of Kroger directors and stockholders.    Kohlberg Kravis said that if Kroger wants to proceed with its special dividend, Kohlberg Kravis was willing to buy the remaining &quot;stub&quot; shares at $13.50 a share, $10 of cash and $3.50 principal amount of subordinated debentures. But shareholders would lose any continuing equity in the company.    Under that proposal, shareholders would receive $61.50 a share, Kohlberg Kravis said, $50 in cash and $11.50 market value of debentures. That approach would involve about $200 million, or $2.50 a share, of additional financing costs, Kohlberg Kravis said, explaining why that offer was lower than what KKR is willing to pay if Kroger cancels the special dividend.    The $64-a-share value Kohlberg Kravis places on its latest offer &quot;represents 28 times the company's earnings for the latest 12 months and is a 100% premium over the $32 trading level of the company's stock prior to the acquisition rumors,&quot; KKR said in yesterday's letter to the board. &quot;In fact, the shares traded at $24.375 earlier this year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
