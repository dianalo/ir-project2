Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Vice President George Bush said he &quot;got an earful&quot; of complaints from the prime minister about the acid rain problem and would relay Mr. Mulroney's concerns to President Reagan at a White House meeting today.    However, Canadian officials said they were more encouraged by Mr. Bush's comments on current U.S.-Canadian negotiations for a free-trade agreement.    Canada blames wind-swept pollution from the U.S. for much of the acid rain damage to Canadian lakes and forests. Acid rain is mainly caused by pollution emitted from power plants and other industrial sources.    The Canadian government has complained that the U.S. government has earmarked only $287 million (U.S.) to deal with the acid rain problem for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Canadian officials said the sum falls far short of U.S. commitments to Canada reached last March between President Reagan and Mr. Mulroney.    At the Washington meeting, President Reagan and Mr. Mulroney endorsed a report calling for the U.S. government and industry to share equally the costs of a $5 billion (U.S.) five-year acid rain control program. The Canadian government said it doesn't agree with U.S. calculations that suggest the U.S. will meet the goal in the coming year.    Mr. Mulroney told reporters after the meeting with Mr. Bush that he wouldn't be satisfied with U.S. acid rain pledges &quot;until I see the cash.&quot; The meeting was arranged on short notice at Mr. Mulroney's request to deal with Canada's concerns over the acid rain issue and trade problems with the U.S.    Senior Canadian officials said after the meeting that Canada continues to regard the acid rain issue as &quot;the litmus test&quot; for the state of overall relations between Canada and the U.S.    They urged that the U.S. set a target, as Canada has done, for reducing acid rain. Canada's target is a 50% reduction in acid rain by 1994.    Mr. Bush told reporters that the U.S. felt it was living up to its spending commitments on acid rain control. He indicated that there isn't a lot of willingness on the part of the U.S. administration to do much more.    The vice president was more forthcoming on Canadian requests for more administration backing for current U.S.-Canadian negotiations for a free-trade agreement. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Mulroney said they believed such an agreement remained possible despite protectionist pressures. Mr. Bush said a free-trade pact with Canada would be &quot;a fine example&quot; for free-trade supporters around the world.    The Canadian officials said they were encouraged by Mr. Bush's positive comments on the trade talks. They also welcomed an assurance by Treasury Secretary James Baker that the administration didn't regard the Canadian dollar as a &quot;problem&quot; currency for the U.S. The U.S. has complained that some countries have been holding down the value of their currencies against the U.S. dollar to sharpen the competitiveness of their exports. Mr. Baker accompanied Mr. Bush on the visit to Ottawa. </TEXT></DOC>
