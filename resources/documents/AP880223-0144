(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has ordered an investigationinto why a doctor waited two months to disclose that one of threehemophiliac brothers exposed to the AIDS virus had been diagnosedwith AIDS-related complex.   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich said in a court orderMonday that she has ``grave concerns'' with Dr. Jerry Barbosa'sstatements to the press that he withheld the diagnosis out ofrespect for the privacy of the family of Clifford and Louise Ray.   In a medical report filed Feb. 12, Barbosa said Ricky, 11 andthe oldest of the brothers, was diagnosed with ARC, AIDS-relatedcomplex.   Barbosa, a physician at All Children's Hospital in St.Petersburg, told the St. Petersburg Times that he knew of thediagnosis in December but didn't report it out of concern for theRays' privacy, the Times said Tuesday.   ``I left out a number of things on purpose,'' the Times quotedthe doctor as saying.   In her order, Ms. Kovachevich asked a magistrate to find outwhat the doctor told a Times reporter and who was aware ofBarbosa's ``intentional omissions from the medical reports and whenthey were aware of the omissions.''   In addition, she said she wanted to know whether attorneys toldthe court any contradictory medical information and whether anindependent doctor should be appointed.   Last August, the judge ordered the DeSoto County School Board toreinstate the three Ray boys _ Ricky, Robert and Randy. Thebrothers, all hemophiliacs, were barred from class after theytested positive for antibodies associated with acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   During a hearing last summer, doctors said the boys probablywere contaminated through plasma products used to clot their bloodand showed no symptoms of having the disease.   The AIDS virus can remain dormant for years. ARC is found whenthe virus causes a set of symptoms that usually are considered aprecursor to AIDS.   Barbosa said in his Feb. 12 report that Ricky's conditionappeared to be stable. The boy has been treated with AZT, ananti-AIDS drug.   The Ray boys' medical records are supposed to be on public fileas a condition of the August injunction that returned them toschool. The family, however, fled DeSoto County a week afterclasses began because of a parental boycott, bomb threats thatemptied the school and a deliberate blaze that destoyed their home.   They now live in Sarasota, where the boys enrolled in schoolwithout objection from school officials, although some parentsobjected.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spreadthrough sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to theiroffspring.</TEXT></DOC>
