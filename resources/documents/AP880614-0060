The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle and made Awadthe 21st Arab to be expelled by Israel since the Dec. 8 start ofthe Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Awad, 44, did not meet waiting reporters at KennedyInternational Airport after his arrival Monday night from Israel.But a spokesman made a brief statement on his behalf and said Awadplanned to a hold a news conference this afternoon.   ``He wanted me to express his deep appreciation'' to U.S.officials who protested his deportation, said Charles Kimball,director of the Middle East office of the National Council ofChurches. He named Secretary of State George Shultz, AssistantSecretary of State Richard Murphy, U.S. Ambassador to Israel ThomasPickering and counsuls general in Israel Morris Draper and BillWilcox.   ``They have worked consistently, arduously and enormouslyhelpfully on his behalf from the beginning of this whole process,and he's deeply grateful,'' Kimball said, his words at timesdrowned out by the chanting of anti-Awad protesters.   The United States condemned Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's order that Awad, a U.S. citizen, be deported. Shamiralleged that Awad played a key role in the Arab uprising in theoccupied territories.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``We thinkit is unjustifiable to deny Mr. Awad the right to stay and live inJerusalem where he was born. If he acted illegally, he should havebeen charged and tried in court with full due process of law.''   Israel has regularly carried out deportations to quell unrest orsubdue Palestinian nationalist activity, notably expelling nineWest Bank mayors between 1980 and 1982. But the number ofdeportations has greatly increased since the Arab uprising began.   Awad, whom supporters call the ``Palestinian Gandhi,'' deniedinciting violence against Israel but has supported the uprising inthe territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.Although he has little influence in the Palestinian community, sometactics he advocates, such as tax boycotts and commercial strikes,were adopted by leaders of the uprising.   Awad, who was incarcerated 40 days in Israel, was kept away fromreporters in Jerusalem before he left, but his letters tosupporters from prison were distributed.   ``Even after my departure, my efforts will continue,'' Awadwrote. ``We have no choice but to continue with the uprising forour liberation.''   He vowed in the letters to return soon. Awad, a Christian, hassaid he might convert to Judaism as a means to return to Israel.   His deportation was protested by about a dozen Israelis at theJerusalem airport and 25 supporters in downtown Jerusalem. Dozensof angry Israelis staged an impromptu counterdemonstration, callingthe Awad supporters traitors.   Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month touristvisa, issued when he entered Israel last August, had expired. TheIsraelis refused to extend the visa, and the Israeli Supreme Courtlast week rejected Awad's appeal to remain.   Some 50 demonstrators _ about evenly split for and against Awad_ gathered at Kennedy Airport.   New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat, leda group of protesters who shouted ``Awad is a terrorist.''Separated from the Hikind group by a line of police officers was apro-Arab group shouting ``Down, down with Israel'' and ``Long liveMubarak.''   Awad, who lived in the United States for 13 years beforereturning to Jerusalem in 1983, is the founder of the PalestinianCenter for the Study of Non-Violence. He has lectured on civildisobedience, counseled teachers against corporal punishment andplanted olive trees in West Bank villages to underscore the Arabs'claim to the land.   He lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio, where he still owns a home. Hiswife, Nancy Nye, flew to New York on Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
