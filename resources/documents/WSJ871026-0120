GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST FREST OM LATAM EUROPAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration's Persian Gulf policy has achieved some diplomatic and political success. European allies, in a rare display of cooperation, have joined the operation to protect shipping; most Arab states applaud the beefed-up U.S. naval presence, and Congress, despite complaints, isn't demanding the removal of U.S. forces.    But the policy has one glaring failure: The administration hasn't had major success persuading other nations, including some close allies, to shut off arms shipments to Iran. Washington isn't willing to go beyond friendly persuasion and put real pressure on nations that are actively involved in selling weapons to Tehran.    This reluctance points out the difficulty of coordinating any sanctions policy. It is far easier to punish enemies than to pressure friends. Broader interests often override short-term goals. But the mild U.S. effort -- hurt badly by last year's revelations that the administration itself was selling weapons to Tehran -- sends signals that the program isn't a top priority.    &quot;There's been an unwillingness to harm aspects of the various bilateral relationships for the sake of what may be, in the long run, not a major element of those relationships,&quot; concedes a U.S. official familiar with the program, known as Operation Staunch. &quot;There's been an inertia against going beyond moral suasion,&quot; he adds.    Nevertheless, the administration took a step beyond moral suasion last week when it suspended plans to make it easier for China to purchase certain American high-technology items. Despite Chinese denials, U.S. officials say they have proof that Beijing sells Silkworm missiles to Iran. Iran has used Silkworm missiles in several recent attacks, including a strike against a U.S.-flagged oil tanker off Kuwait.    But officials say putting pressure on China is an exception, rather than part of a new, assertive effort to curtail arms sales. As a result, most nations will continue to follow their own self-interest, rather than the administration's wishes.    American officials, note, for example, that though Brazil is a major arms seller, it has responded to U.S. requests to crack down on Brazilian companies negotiating arms sales with Iran. But the U.S. claims little credit. Officials say Brazil acted because it has substantial trade with Iraq, Iran's opponent, that would be jeopardized by arms sales to Iran.    On the other hand Portugal, a NATO ally, and Austria sell weapons to Iran despite U.S. pleas, officials say. Both nations have state-owned munitions companies that view Iran as a rich market. U.S. officials say both nations ship artillery pieces and ammunition to Tehran.    Other sales fall into a gray area between lethal and commercial equipment. Last year, for instance, the administration asked West Germany to block the sale of portable bridge materials by a German company to Iran. Bonn refused, insisting the export was for civilian use. And the U.S. Customs Service is investigating Outboard Marine Corp., an Illinois firm, for possible export-rule violations over reports that Iranian speedboats are being powered by its products. The company said it isn't aware of any such sales.    At best, Operation Staunch achieves the modest goal of making it more expensive and difficult for the Iranians to buy weapons. Italian customs has blocked several sales destined for Iran. And when Britain shut Iran's London purchasing office earlier this year, it made it more difficult for Tehran to coordinate the buying and shipping of the many military items it purchases in Europe. Administration officials say Iran now is trying to replace this office with one in Portugal.    The administration is backing a United Nations effort to get Iran and Iraq to agree to a cease-fire. If the effort fails, the U.S. will press for a U.N. resolution calling for an arms embargo. But unless the measure contains sanctions against nations that violate such an embargo, the multibillion-dollar flow of weapons to Tehran isn't likely to be staunched. </TEXT></DOC>
