The decision, issued Friday in Los Angeles, reversed stateregulators' assertions that the bonds were subordinate toconventional insurance and sent prices for the thinly tradedsecurities soaring.</LP><TEXT>   If upheld, Judge Kurt J. Lewin's surprising ruling willsharply reduce prospective recoveries for big policyholdersat Executive Life to about 73 cents on the dollar from anearlier-expected 90 cents and add an estimated $1 billion tothe industry's cost of clearing up its second-largestinsolvency ever -- roughly doubling outlays for an alreadyheavily committed insurance guaranty system.   The so-called &quot;muni-GICs&quot; case concerns claims by holdersof eight issues of unusual municipal bonds totaling $1.85billion that depend on Executive Life for payment ofprincipal and interest. GIC stands for guaranteed investmentcontracts, a form of deposit with an insurer.   Los Angeles-based Executive Life is a unit of FirstExecutive Corp., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings in Los Angeles. A smaller unit, Executive LifeInsurance Co. of New York, has been seized by regulators inthat state. The New York company didn't issue any of theso-called muni-GICs and isn't directly affected by Friday'scourt ruling.   The case may prove one of the most expensive lessons everin state insurance regulation. Although California regulatorsyears ago determined that Executive Life's obligationsbacking the bonds were &quot;unauthorized,&quot; they made no move tostop their issue.   Judge Lewin held that &quot;the {California Insurance}Department's failure to act provided a trap for the unwaryinvestors who purchased the municipal bonds&quot; and added that&quot;a regulatory agency has an affirmative duty to do somethingby way of regulation, not merely make academicpronouncements.&quot;   California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said, &quot;Ifthis decision stands, it is a serious setback for certainExecutive Life insurance policyholders.&quot; He added that hisadvisers were considering an appeal. Lawyers familiar withthe case say an appeal is almost certain.   For the moment, plans to recapitalize and to sellExecutive Life are proceeding. A French investment group leadby Altus Finance, a subsidiary of the French bank CreditLyonnais S.A., said it will pursue its $3.55 billion plan toacquire the company. As reported, the French group was chosenThursday after an extended auction.   Altus and Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France, aninsurer leading part of the proposed sales transaction, saidthe group &quot;remained supportive of Commissioner Garamendi andthe process.&quot;   But speculation rose immediately that Mr. Garamendi'sreorganization plan was in trouble. The National Organizationof Life and Health Guaranty Associations, representing thenation's industry-funded, state insurance guaranty funds,hinted strongly that it will rescind a key agreementcoordinating and facilitating state guaranty fund payments.And bondholders said they will immediately demand interimpayments at the same 70 cents on the dollar rate that otherpolicyholders and annuitants have received since April, whenCalifornia regulators seized the insurer.   Immediately after the decision was handed down at 6 p.m.EST Friday, prices of the bonds jumped 17 points, a gain of$170 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, to a price of 50in heavy trading activity. Municipal bond traders say theyexpect the bonds to open today at a price of about 65 as newsof the ruling spreads.   Advocates for the muni-GIC bonds quickly predicted thedemise of the French group's takeover plan -- a plan thatbond interests say short-changes all creditors.   The ruling is a blow to the nation's life insuranceindustry, which, through state insurance guaranty funds, mustmake good on much of Executive Life's uncovered liabilities.The industry's bill, estimated at about $900 million beforeFriday's ruling, would swell by about a further $1 billion,as limited assets are spread among a bigger pool ofliabilities.   &quot;We are going to have to pull out our pencils and see whatwe can do to best address {the larger bill},&quot; said Eden D.Sarfaty, president, president of the National Organization ofLife and Health Guaranty Associations, which represents theguaranty funds.   The sudden doubling of demands on insurers likely willboost industry pressure to pursue a proposal advanced byNolhga to acquire Executive Life. Nolhga was picked first byMr. Garamendi as the winner of the auction for Executive Lifebut later rejected when the guaranty funds and theircorporate supporters couldn't satisfy special conditionsadvanced by the California commissioner, who asked for firmerfinancial backing to the bid.   Nolhga and others will pursue their bids in courtproceedings that begin today in Los Angeles before JudgeLewin. The court is expected to hear a thicket of demands andmotions from muni-GIC interests as well as other parties in agiant case turned topsy turvy with a single ruling.   In effect, the &quot;muni-GIC&quot; court case goes to the heart ofcompeting, painful claims in Executive Life's insolvency.   When Executive Life was seized in April, Mr. Garamendiheld that so-called &quot;funding agreements&quot; issued by ExecutiveLife to back the muni-GICs weren't conventional insurancebusiness and would rank as subordinate creditors in aposition reserved for suppliers and other unsecuredcreditors, among others. Among other things, Mr. Garamendicited a 1987 opinion by an insurance department lawyer thatthese unusual funding agreements weren't &quot;authorized&quot; asinsurance. The department at the time was headed by RoxannieGillespie, Mr. Garamendi's predecessor.   It was an important decision. By excluding the $1.85billion of municipal GICs from Executive Life's nearly $10billion in liabilities, California regulators have been ableto substantially increase recoveries by conventionalpolicyholders and annuitants.   Critics contended that Mr. Garamendi's exclusion waspolitically motivated. Few holders of the muni-GIC-backedbonds live in California while a large chunk of ExecutiveLife's conventional policyholders and annuitants do. Mr.Garamendi has denied such assertions.   In his opinion, Judge Lewin held that the muni-GICs'funding agreements weren't substantially different fromso-called &quot;pension-GICs,&quot; essentially certificates of depositwith insurers by corporate pension funds and employee savingsplans, which Mr. Garamendi had included as creditors withconventional insurance and annuities. Nor could a 1988 changein California's insurance code apply retroactively to theissue of the bonds.   The muni-GIC bonds, sold in 1986 by obscure governmententities in Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, Tennessee andTexas, were in large part underwritten by Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   Although technically intended as borrowings by municipalagencies for government purposes, money from the sales ofthese bonds -- rated Triple-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. --went directly into funding agreements at Executive Life andwere in turn reinvested largely in junk bonds, many of themsold by Drexel Burnham Lambert.   ---   Sharon R.
