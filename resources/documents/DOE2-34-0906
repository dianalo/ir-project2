The installationof government-sponsored large-scale (andgt; 500 kW) wind systems almost doubledduring 1987 to more than 50 MW. The systems include single large-scalewind turbines and windfarms of small and medium-sized machines. Commerciallarge-scale wind turbine installations, dominated by windfarms in theUSA, are not included. By the end of 1987 the cumulative installed Californianwindfarm capacity was more than 1500 MW, representing about 16000 units.The windfarms generated about 4 TWh of electricity from 1981 to the endof 1987. Several machines and farms are operated at over 95 percent availability.</TEXT></DOC>
