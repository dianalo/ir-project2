Animalswere killed and perfused for whole-brain recovery. US evaluation of whole-brainspecimens was performed. Histologic analysis of brain sections verifiedlesion placement, size, and tissue response to US. These sections werecompared with US studies for correlation data. Correlation data suggestthat US visualization may aid in accurate placement of volume brain lesionsand in evaluation of effects of high-intensity focuses US in normal brain.</TEXT></DOC>
