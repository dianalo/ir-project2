This time, however, the recipe includes some less explosiveelements, and experts say this means a remake of the price crash isunlikely.   For consumers, that means the retail price of gasoline and otherproducts refined from crude oil may be fairly steady this summer.   New clues to the future direction of oil prices are expected toemerge from two meetings of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries this week. On Tuesday, a five-man OPEC panel will meetwith representatives of several non-OPEC oil producing nations, andon Thursday, all 13 cartel members are to open private talks.   In some significant ways, OPEC's current struggle to stopfree-market forces from pushing down oil prices is unfolding muchas it did three years ago.   The most obvious similarity is that OPEC once again is losingthe battle; the world price of oil has been below the cartel'starget level of $18 per 42-gallon barrel for much of this year.   Beyond that, there are these parallels:   _Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer, is going it alone.   In mid-1985, Saudi King Fahd declared he no longer would letSaudi production decline while other OPEC members were cheating onprice and output rules. This was the beginning of the end of OPEC'sattempts to regulate the world price. Last month, Fahd publiclyreasserted this policy, meaning, if effect, that the cartel hadagain lost hope of single-handedly defending a fixed oil price.   _Key OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Indonesia,appear to have decided the cartel should stop fighting the pricedecline by cutting production. When this feeling became widespreadin OPEC in late 1985, the result was a kind of anarchy. OPEC hopedto win back part of its market share from non-OPEC producers, butit did not expect the stunning price collapse that followed.   This time, however, the memory of what happened in 1986 _ whenprices tumbled below $10 a barrel _ is likely to persuade thecartel leadership to at least keep existing production controls inplace. Also, Iran is more aggressively fighting to retain the OPECstrategy of cutting production.   _OPEC is turning to independent producers for help in limitingoil production.   When prices were falling gradually in early 1985, OPEC saw thatits production cuts were too little. Unable or unwilling to cutmore, the cartel stepped up efforts to win restraint from non-OPECproducers. Oil ministers from Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia and otherindependent oil-producing nations attended several OPEC meetings in1984-85 as observers, but the contacts yielded few results. By 1986the outsiders had stopped coming to the OPEC meetings.   This week OPEC is returning to this tactic. Its price-monitoringcommittee _ comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria and Indonesia _ is to meet withrepresentatives of several non-OPEC producers, including Mexico andEgypt, to press for cooperation in limiting production.   In OPEC's view, all oil producers share a responsibility forrestraining production in order to keep prices high enough tojustify the level of investment needed to find oil supplies for thefuture.   Many non-OPEC countries don't agree. The world's two largest oilproducers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and majorproducers Britain and Norway will not be attending the Viennameeting.   The chances of OPEC and independent producers reaching agreementany time soon on joint production cuts appear slim. In the eventthey are unsuccessful the key question is: What will OPEC do next?   In 1985, the cartel's response to getting a cold shoulder fromnon-OPEC was to declare an unofficial ``price war.'' This time thatis much less likely to happen, given the severe financial woundsthat OPEC member countries have suffered in recent years.   The odds of OPEC letting prices fall uncontrollably also arelessened by the fact that prices, adjusted for inflation and thedepreciation of the U.S. dollar, already are as low as they were in1986.   The outlook for OPEC is further clouded by growing frictionwithin the cartel. Relations between the Saudis and Iranians havebeen at a low ebb since riots in the Islamic holy city of Mecca, inSaudi Arabia, last summer killed 402 people, including 275 Iranians.   The political climate between Iran and its Persian Gulfneighbors has worsened this spring with Iranian gunboat attacks onUnited Arab Emirate shipping and oil facilities in the Gulf and thehijacking of a Kuwait Airways plane by Shiite Moslem gunmendemanding the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in Kuwait.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert Burns has covered OPEC for The AssociatedPress for six years.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday April 24</NOTE></DOC>
