(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Pint-sized PCsandM;As the 1980s came to a close, computer users were assailed with claims abouta completely new category of machine -- the pocket-sized PC, in the guise ofAtari's Portfolio.andP;  Meanwhile, Sharp's traditional pocket calculator, the IQ,has acquired new functions, and even that most eccentric of Britishinventions, the Microwriter -- with its extraordinary five-key keyboard --has emerged in an updated form.andM;While these machines can be seen as rivals, about the only similarity betweenthem is their ability to swap data with the PC on our desks.andM;Atari PortfolioandM;Atari's 249 pounds Portfolio is the only pocket-sized PC so far on themarket.andP;  It's wallet-format, weights about 1b, and opens out to reveal a tinyQWERTY keyboard and an eight-line by 40-character supertwist LCD screen.andO;Inside is a 4.9MHz 80C88 processor, 128Kb of RAM (configurable to providesilicon disk space), and 256Kb of ROM holding the operating system and fiveresident applications.andM;Thanks to its automatic power-down function, the battery-life of thePortfolio is impossible to assess accurately, but I've no reason to doubt aclaimed 84 to 112-hour life for its three AA batteries.andM;The most notable aspect of the Portfolio is its claimed MS-DOS compatibility.andO;Indeed, the unit's operating system is called DOS -- but this stands for DIPOperating System.andP;  And the Portfolio's non-standard screen and keyboard, andlimited RAM, mean that most DOS software would need a rewrite to run on thesystem.andM;The Portfolio's second most remarkable feature is its keyboard.andP;  Although toosmall for touch-typing, it's surprisingly effective for three-fingeroperation.andP;  The keys are hinged at their front edge, and an optional beepfunction reinforces the modest tactile feedback.andM;Software for file exchange with a PC has just become available, but thepromised 32Kb, 64Kb and 128Kb battery-backed RAM cards, only the smallestversion is on the market yet.andM;The cards are about the size of conventional credit cards and contain alithium battery with a claimed five to seven-year lifespan.andP;  They cost justover 1 pound per Kb.andP;  Complete with a read/write protect switch, they'reaccessed by filing commands which will prove instinctive to any PC owner.andO;Accidental loss of main battery power during this test showed the RAM cardeffectively preserves data.andM;The Portfolio is most likely to be used by desktop PC owners as a datacapture and portability device.andP;  Crucial to this are the parallel and serialinterface units for the machine, which cost 39.95 pounds and 49.95 poundsrespectively.andP;  These plug into a buss connector on one end of the machine,add around 30 per cent to its size and weight, and are delivered with filetransfer software on both 5-1/4 and 3-1/2 inch disks.andP;  A test of thePortfolio's file transfer abilities revealed no surprises, except for thechore of occasionally having to juggle RAM to and from the silicon disk whiletransferring data.andM;Equally unsurprising is DIP's choice of resident applications.andP;  Calculator,diary, address book, text editor and spreadsheet can be hot-keyed from thesystem prompt.andP;  The last used file is automatically loaded.andP;  A separateClipboard function allows data to be moved or copied between all theapplications except the calculator.andP;  Another thoughtful touch is the UNDELETEfile, which automatically stores data deleted from any of the applications.andM;The calculator, which uses a numeric keypad mapped across the keyboard, isrespectable but unremarkable.andP;  As well as the four basic arithmeticalfunctions, it offers five memories (whose contents can be simultaneouslydisplayed), powers and factorials.andP;  Figures can be displayed in General,Fixed, Scientific and Engineering formats, and a 'tape' function allows youto scroll back through an on-screen calculation, alter figures, and see thosealterations reflected in the final sum.andM;For my money, electronic diaries and address books are too fiddly to be morethan temporary toys for computer junkies.andP;  The only exception is where diaryor address files are ported from a desktop machine.andM;I've met a Portfolio user who claims to get real functionality from themachine's spreadsheet -- which offers a degree of 1-2-3 compatibility.andM;But users should note that the Portfolio's display allows only a 4x6 cellwindow on the maximum 127x255 cell spreadsheet, and that the long list ofunsupported 1-2-3 functions (folio) could limit the attraction of portingLotus files to the machine.andM;It's as a text storage and input device the Portfolio is likely to find itsmost unalloyed utility.andP;  The keyboard allows limited on-the-hoof correctionand creation of text files, which can then be easily swapped to and from adesktop machine.andP;  The editing software offers not only the usual Search,Replace and Goto functions of any text editor, but also real-time WordWrap,file Merge, and the Clipboard and impressive Undelete functions touched onearlier.andP;  However, DIP deserves a sharp rap on the knuckles for omitting aword count command.andM;For PC owners the Portfolio is by far the most useful of the three machinesreviewed here.andP;  Its only potential rival is the Poqet PC, which offers afull-format screen, more RAM and real MS-DOS, but which costs an extra 1,000pounds.andM;Sharp IQandM;The Sharp IQ is book format, with a 16-column x 8-row LCD screen on the leftof the hinge, and on the right a numeric keypad, hot-keys for the residentapplications, and letter keys laid out in alphabetical order.andM;Two flat lithium batteries provide a claimed 90 hours operation.andP;  A busprovides access to an optional RS232C connector, which in turn can connectwith PC Link software from Traveling Software.andM;It's hard to see anything intrinsically wrong with an alphabeticalarrangement of letters.andP;  Non-typists, indeed will doubtless find it easier tolocate the letters than they would on a QWERTY keyboard, and the keysthemselves are the best quality of the sets on test here.andM;Indeed, a whiff of high-quality consumer merchandise attends every functionof the Sharp IQ.andP;  Not only is this the most pocket-friendly of the machinesin terms of weight and shape, it also betrays a level of preparationunfamiliar to us poor computer users.andM;Yes, the Sharp is actually finished.andP;  Forget the usual computer industrystuff about 'real soon' add-ins (translatable as meaning, 'Let's see how manyunits we sell, then we might make the peripherals').andP;  Sharp is now shipping arange of credit card-sized ROM cards, priced at around 40 pounds or 50 poundsand including a combined thesaurus and dictionary, an eight-languagetranslator, a time expense manager -- and 32Kb and 64Kb RAM cards which costa rather surprising 54 pounds and 84 pounds.andM;The cards, inserted into a bay on the base of the machine, are controlled bypressure pads through a transparent cover positioned below the IQ's screen.andM;The applications are no more than adequate.andP;  The combined thesaurus anddictionary, for example, uses British English, has an 87,000 wordspell-checker and provides definitions and synonyms for 42,000 words.andP;  Thesource text (licensed from a US company) had clearly been ported across insome kind of standard format, since it was chopped by the IQ's frame withoutbenefit of word-wrap.andP;  More seriously, however, the package is unpredictablein its abilities: it could find neither definitions nor synonyms for thefirst three words I tried -- 'swap', 'jaw' and 'mandible'.andM;Already contained in the machine -- and paged in and out with a range ofdedicated buttons -- are a calendar and scheduler, a phone book, a memo padfor random notes, a calculator and a world clock giving the time and date in212 cities.andM;The calculator has a so-called 'paperless printer' function: like the 'tape'function in the Portfolio, this allows you to scroll back through acalculation, amend values, and see them reflected in the bottom line.andP;  It'sotherwise limited, offering only two memory stores and percentage and squareroot functions above the four main arithmetical operations.andM;There's no text editor as such, and the memo pad application has none of thecommands you'd associate with word processing.andP;  Sharp presumably doubts theIQ's suitability for serious text input, and I certainly had problems usingthe non-QWERTY keyboard.andM;The PC Link program from Traveling Software is perhaps a little too good forthe machine.andP;  Given the IQ's tiny screen, and the limited desirability ofinputting large amounts of data to it, it's a pity that Traveling's packageis linked to the IQ rather than, say, the Atari Portfolio.andM;Whatever, IQ users will doubtless be grateful that the 99.99 poundscombination of software and RS232 converter allows them limited data exchangewith dBase and Sidekick, and to send some forms of IQ files -- notably fromthe time expense package -- to 1-2-3 on their favorite desktop machine.andO;However, 1-2-3 files can't make the return journey.andM;By the old definition of 'Can you program it?' the IQ isn't a computer.andO;Meanwhile, its lack of a decent text editor, spreadsheet, fast keyboard (atleast for this user), and sensible screen, mean that the device's utility asa data gatherer is strictly limited.andP;  I'm also somewhat dubious about thelong-term appeal of those rather tricksy applications packages.andM;Microwriter AgendaandM;The Microwriter Agenda is a British eccentricity in electronic form.andO;Certainly, its system of one-handed typing is immensely appealing, and mucheasier to learn than the conventional QWERTY layout.andM;Microwriting has been around for several years in a rather larger andclumsier version of the present device.andP;  However, Microwriter has only soldaround 13,000 of the units, and has worked hard to bring the system into theage of matt-black consumer electronics.andM;The Agenda is the prettiest of the machines on review here.andP;  It features thesame five keys as its predecessor, which are pressed in various combinationsto generate all the alphanumeric characters and cursor movements.andM;However, the machine also features conventional calculator-format keys, aswell as hot keys to access the inevitable resident applications.andP;  A76-character LCD screen, and fixed rechargeable power-pack complete the majorhardware features.andM;Despite the presence of the usual diary, notebook and calculator, the Agendawill inevitably be assessed most crucially as a text handler: that, afterall, is the only reason anyone would want to learn its alphabet.andM;Although the earlier Microwriter had a solid keyboard with very positivefeedback, the present machine is almost unusable thanks to its absurdly lightaction.andP;  The keys wobble distractingly, can't support the weight of yourtyping hand in the 'rest' position, provide no feedback, and require alarmingmanipulations to accomplish some simple text editing functions.andM;The Agenda possesses all the right qualifications in terms of software for PCaccess, adequate resident applications, and a generally high level of visualappeal.andP;  However, that strange keyboard means that the machine has all therestrictions of the IQ's calculator keys and small screen, with none of thebenefits of Sharp's slick multinational back-up.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
