The goal of thehot gas cleanup systems analysis effort at METC is to determine the interactionof novel cleanup processes on the remainder of these energy systems andidentify areas where further research could improve efficiency, reducecosts, or increase a processes chances for development and implementationby the commercial sector. These interactions are determined through engineeringanalyses conducted using a variety of tools including computerized processmodels, engineering calculations, and literature studies. Results fromthe following are discussed: assessment of systems and economic issuesfor in-bed desulfurization in fixed-bed gasifiers; analysis of performanceaspects and tail-gas treatment options in gasification island systems;determination of sulfuric acid industry capacity and production; updateof estimate zinc ferrite capital and operating costs; assessment of existingzinc ferrite modeling tools; and determination of applicability of hotgas cleanup for methanol production.</TEXT></DOC>
