<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>To facilitate the penetration of photovoltaic systems in the buildingenvironment, many experimental roof-integrated installations have beenbuilt in Germany, France or USA. The purpose of this work was to providespecific design rules for photovoltaic panels integration. Regardingto the thermal aspects for different integration conditions (insulation,inclination...) the monitoring of an experimental installation providedmeasurements which were used to drive governing correlations betweenthe cell temperature and environmental conditions. Regarding to the mechanicalaspects and weathertightness of the roof, many specific mounting designrules and electricity safety requirements were set up. Two specific photovoltaicapplications are presented; they were developed with industry.</TEXT></DOC>
