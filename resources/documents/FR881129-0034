The standards proposedfor revision regulate the design, construction, and use of means of accessand egress to vessels, buildings, and other structures in shipyards.The existing shipyard employment standards (29 CFR Part 1915) apply toshipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking operations and related employments.However, the present standards in Part 1915 are not comprehensive in theircoverage of shipyard hazards, and are supplemented by the general industrystandards (29 CFR Part 1910) as necessary to provide complete coveragefor all the hazards encountered in shipyards. This document is one of aseries of proposals which are intended to revise Part 1915 to provide comprehensivecoverage of shipyard employment solely within that part. This action will consolidate and update the shipyard employment accessand egress standards and the appropriate general industry access and egressstandards into a single, comprehensive Part 1915 that would apply to allactivities and areas in shipyards (except construction activities coveredby Part 1926). The proposed provisions will delete many existing specificationprovisions which currently limit employer innovation, and where appropriate,use performance-oriented provisions to address the hazards of access andegress. The specific topic of access and egress is currently addressed in SubpartE of the current Shipyard Employment Standards, along with the topics ofscaffolds, ladders, and other walking/working surface considerations. Toformat the rules into a more logical grouping of topics, this and relatedactions would retain coverage of stairways, ladders and other access andegress concerns in Subpart E, and would relocate fall protection and scaffoldsfrom the current Subpart E to a new Subpart M_Fall Protection, and a newSubpart N_Scaffolds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rulemaking must be postmarkedby February 27, 1989.

Gurnham, Office of Construction and CivilEngineering Safety Standards, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background and Approach </ITAG>In May 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under authoritygranted by section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970(29 U.S.C. 655), adopted established Federal standards issued under section41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941),as standards applicable to ship repairing (29 CFR Part 1915), shipbuilding(29 CFR Part 1916), and shipbreaking (29 CFR Part 1917) operations. Inaddition, OSHA adopted other Federal standards and national consensus standardsas general industry standards (29 CFR Part 1910) and construction industrystandards (29 CFR Part 1926) which were made applicable to hazards andworking conditions not specifically covered by Parts 1915, 1916, or 1917.On April 20, 1982, the ship repairing, shipbuilding, and shipbreaking standardswere consolidated into one Part 1915 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations,and titled ``Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment''(47 FR 16984). The consolidation eliminated duplicate provisions and overlappingprovisions, but did not alter substantive requirements. The consolidationdid not affect the applicability of general industry standards in 29 CFRPart 1910 to hazards or conditions in shipyard employments not specificallyaddressed in the consolidated Part 1915 (see 29 CFR 1910.5(c)(2)).In 1982, the Shipbuilders Council of America and the American WaterwaysShipyard Conference requested OSHA to indentify the specific applicableprovisions of the general industry standards which apply to shipyards,and consolidate them with the existing Part 1915 provisions into a singleset of shipyard employment standards. OSHA has determined that such consolidationis appropriate. This and other proposed rulemakings will eventually incorporateall applicable Part 1910 provisions into the existing organization of Part1915. The present Part 1915 organizational format, which is already familiarto present users of the shipyard standards, provides a logical groupingof related provisions based on the type of work activity, hazard, or equipmentinvolved. However, when a regrouping of topics would facilitate understandingof the rules, or when applicable Part 1910 provisions have no counterpartin the existing Part 1915 structure, the proposals would create new subpartsor subpart headings in Part 1915. In addition to consolidating the provisions of Part 1910 and Part 1915,OSHA proposes to revise the consolidated provisions as appropriate. OSHAhas not substantively revised many of the current provisions in these partssince they were promulgated in 1971. OSHA believes some provisions needto be revised to reflect technological advances. Other provisions needto be revised because they are based on national consensus standards issuedprior to 1971, and do not reflect the revisions made since that time. Asthe provisions are consolidated, all such revised consensus standards willbe reviewed, and OSHA's provisions revised as necessary to effectuate thepurposes of the standard and the OSH Act. Where practical, all currentincorporations by reference of national consensus standards and other materialswill be deleted by the proposed standards, and the text of all such requirementswill be proposed for inclusion in the body of the proposed standards, ortheir appendices. This approach is intended to assist employers in determiningwhat duties and obligations are imposed by a provision by minimizing theneed to refer to documents outside Part 1915. OSHA will also use the consolidationproject to replace specification requirements with performance-orientedrequirements where it is known that there is more than one way to providesafety equivalent to that provided by the present specification requirements.In these situations, OSHA sets forth the requirement in performance-orientedlanguage, and relocates the specification language requirements to an appendix.The appendices are discussed in more detail below. Specification requirementswould be used in the main text only where necessary to set appropriatelimits and to clarify duties and obligations. The revision of the shipyard employment standards will be coordinated withefforts to revise parallel provisions in the construction and general industrystandards, so that consistent coverage of hazards which are encounteredin these industry sectors can be provided. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal </ITAG>The topic ``access and egress'' is currently covered by 29 CFR Part 1915,Subpart E_Scaffolds, Ladders, and Other Working Surfaces; 29 CFR Part 1910,Subpart D_Walking-Working Surfaces; and 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart E_Meansof Egress. Consolidating these three subparts into one subpart would resultin a large, cumbersome subpart because of the wide range of topics covered.Therefore, OSHA is proposing to divide the consolidated Part 1915 standardsinto three subparts. The proposed subparts would be Subpart E_Access andEgress; Subpart M_Fall Protection; and Subpart N_Scaffolds. This reformatting,in and of itself, would not create nor delete any requirements. In accordance with paragraph 6(b)(8) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), the agency has reviewed the various nationalconsensus standards that cover working conditions dealt with in this proposal.Where appropriate, OSHA has incorporated provisions from those nationalconsensus standards as part of this proposal. OSHA believes that the proposedstandard will better effectuate the purposes of the Safety and Health Actof 1970 than the national consensus standards which have not been madea part of this proposal, because this proposal is more comprehensive andprovides greater flexibility in its requirements for safety.The following discussion provides a more detailed explanation of the proposedprovisions related to access and egress.Section 1915.71 Scope, application, and definitions applicable to thissubpart.<T3>Section 1915.71(a)_Scope and application.</T3> This paragraph wouldoutline the scope and application of the entire Subpart E. The proposalwould apply to all workplaces and operations found in shipyards, includingthose aboard vessels and subassemblies of vessels, except as follows: Access/egressrequirements for employees involved in the construction, alteration, repair(including painting and decorating) and demolition of shore facilitieswould continue to be addressed by 29 CFR Part 1926_Construction IndustryStandards, which are not affected by this proposal; and access/egress requirementsfor employees on scaffolds would be as provided in proposed Subpart N_Scaffolds.This proposal would incorporate all applicable provisions of 29 CFR Part1910, Subparts D and E, related to access and egress, and those subpartswould no longer apply to access and egress considerations in shipyard workplacesand operations.Certain of the proposed standards contain ``grandfather'' provisions. Theseprovisions would allow employers to continue using facilities and equipmentwhich do not meet the proposed requirements, but which do meet the regulationspresently in effect. Thus, specified facilities which are currently meetingOSHA criteria would not have to be replaced or altered to meet the newcriteria. However, all new facilities and equipment built or installedafter the effective date of this subpart would have to meet the proposedcriteria. For example, proposed paragraph andSection; 1915.85(c)(3) wouldrequire stairrails to be at least 36 inches high, whereas the existingrule requires such rails to be at least 30 inches high. Under the proposedrules, employers would not have to re-install stairrails in existing stairways.However, all stairways created or installed after the effective date ofthis standard would have to have stairrails located at the new height.In the proposed rules, all ``grandfathering'' provisions are indicatedin brackets ([ ]) immediately following the new criteria. If a requirementdoes not contain a bracketed provision, then no ``grandfathering'' exceptionis made. In the Specific Issues section of this preamble, OSHA requestscomments as to whether the provisions proposed for ``grandfathering'' shouldindeed be ``grandfathered,'' and whether or not other provisions shouldbe ``grandfathered.''<T3>Section 1915.71(b)_Definitions applicable to this subpart. </T3>Thisparagraph lists and defines all major words used in the proposed standard.Many of the definitions are the same as those in the existing standards,however, some have been reworded for uniformity or clarity. The followingwords have been added or have been changed substantively from the existingdefinitions:``Cleat.'' In addition to the andSection; 1910.21 definition that this isa ladder cross-piece used for stepping, this term also is used to describetransverse strips of material such as wood or metal used on inclined surfacesto provide footing.``Double cleat ladder.'' This term describes three rail ladders which areused to provide simultaneous two-way access for employees.``Equivalent.'' This term is used in the proposal to allow alternativemeans of complying with the standards. The definition makes clear thatthe employer must demonstrate that all alternative means of compliancewill provide an equal or greater degree of safety than that attained byusing the method or item specified in the standard.``Failure.'' This word is used in performance-oriented paragraphs suchas andSection;1915.85(c)(5) which addresses stairrail strength. The definitionmakes it clear that, along with breakage and separation of component parts,load refusal (the point where the ultimate strength of a component is exceeded)is also considered to be failure. This is the point where structural memberslose their ability to carry loads. ``Fixed ladder.'' This term is used to describe shoreside permanently installedside-step and through-type ladders used in buildings and structures. Suchladders do not include any ladder permanently installed aboard a vesselor vessel section. ``Handrail.'' The proposed definition explains that handrails are usedto provide employees with a handhold for support. The proposed definitiondeletes the existing language which limits handrails to bars or pipes ``supportedon brackets from a wall or partition * * * (to provide) a handhold in caseof tripping.'' The new definition recognizes that handrails are not limitedin form to wall- or partition-mounted bars or pipes. For example, the toprailof a stairrail system may serve as a handrail when installed accordingto paragraph andSection;1915.85(c)(7). ``High hazard contents'' and ``ordinary hazard contents.'' These termsare used to describe conditions where fire or other emergency proceduresare necessary. They are the same definitions as existing andSection;1910.35(f)and (g), except the existing phrase ``to be feared'' would be replacedby the word ``likely.'' ``In dry dock.'' This term is used to describe a vessel's location whenit is in a graving dock, basin, dry dock (including floating dry docks),or on a marine railway. ``Jacob's ladder.'' This term is used to describe a unique type of ladderwith flexible siderails commonly found in shipyards. ``Ladder safety device.'' This term defines such devices as systems, otherthan cages or wells, used in conjunction with a ladder, which will limitan employee's fall from a ladder without that person having continuallyto manipulate the device or any part thereof. This is a change from theexisting definition in andSection;1910.21(e)(13), which describes such devicesas those which eliminate or reduce the possibility of falls on ladders.The proposal recognizes that such devices do not function by eliminatingor reducing the possibility of falls; they do, however, minimize or reducethe actual fall distance traveled. ``Lower levels.'' This term is used to describe the areas to which an employeecould fall. The definition does not apply to the surface on which the employeeis performing work duties. ``Maximum intended load.'' This is a new term used in paragraphs andSection;andSection;1915.86(a)(1)and 1915.87(b)(2) to clarify the types of loads which must be consideredwhen building a ladder or a ramp, and is used in paragraph andSection;1915.86(b)(3)to limit the amount of load which may be placed on a ladder. ``Means of access.'' This term is used in lieu of the following list ofaccess facilities: Ladders, stairways, ramps, runways, gangways, walkways,catwalks, dockboards, and personnel hoists. ``Portable ladder.'' This term is used to distinguish ladders that canbe readily moved or carried, from fixed ladders (those which are an integralpart of a building or structure). ``Riser height.'' This term replaces the term ``rise.'' There is no changeto the definition. for the purposes of this standard, the term ``tread''used in the definition includes landings. ``Single cleat ladder.'' This term is used to describe two rail ladders.``Stairrail system.'' This term replaces the existing term ``stair railing,''which is often used to describe only the top member of a railing system.Stairrail systems protect employees from falling off the side of a stairway,and may consist of a rail system (toprail, midrail, posts, balusters, orsimilar components) or may be a wall. Handrails are the components usedto provide grab holds while climbing or descending stairs. Handrails arenormally mounted on the side of stairrail systems, but when installed accordingto the height criteria of paragraph andSection;1915.85(c)(7), may be thesame component as the topmost piece of a stairrail system (i.e., they maybe the toprail in a rail system, or the top edge of a wall section). ``Unprotected sides and edges.'' This is a new term and defines such areasas those where there is no wall or guardrail system 39 inches or more inheight, or where there is no stairrail system 36 inches or more in height.This definition is consistent with the term as used in the proposed SubpartM_Fall Protection, andSection;1915.201. ``Vessel section.'' This term is used to clarify the areas where certainrules apply. It means all sub-assemblies, modules, and other componentsof a vessel which are not directly attached to the vessel because of thestate of construction, repair, or breaking. Section 1915.72 General requirements for means of access. This section specifies where stairways, ladders, ramps, runways, gangways,walkways, catwalks, or personnel hoists are to be provided in order foremployees to have safe means of access between levels. <T3>Section 1915.72(a)_Where required.</T3> This paragraph would requirestairways, ladders, ramps, runways, gangways, walkways, catwalks, or personnelhoists to be provided at all personnel points of access between workinglevels which are 19 inches or more apart in elevation, and where operationsrequire regular travel between the working levels (including access tooperating platforms on all equipment which require attention routinelyduring operations.) This is essentially the same provision as existingrule andSection;1910.24(b) except the proposed rule applies to vessel accessas well as shoreside access. The 19-inch criterion is added to clarifythe amount of elevation difference which must be present before the rulewould apply. This amount is equivalent to twice the maximum stairway stepspacing presently allowed by andSection;1910.24(e). Spiral stairways wouldbe allowed only where they provide the only practical means of access.This is essentially the same limitation as in andSection;1910.24(b). <T3>Section 1915.72(b)_When required.</T3> This paragraph would requireall systems and duties required by the proposal to be provided and installed,and performed, respectively, before employees begin work from the worksurface where protection is required. This requirement is implied by theexisting provisions of Subpart D of Part 1910 and Subpart E of Part 1915,but is not explicitly set forth. The proposal would clarify that theseprovisions are to be met before work begins in an area. Section 1915.73 Access to vessels. This section sets forth the requirements for access to vessels, and isbased on the provisions currently contained in andSection;1915.74. <T3>Section 1915.73(a)_Access to vessels afloat.</T3> This paragraph wouldapply to all vessels (except floating drydocks) afloat, which are not lyingabreast of another vessel, and which are not in drydock. The followingtable lists the proposed provisions of paragraph andSection;1915.73(a), whichwould not be substantively changed from the corresponding requirementsin the existing paragraphs listed; except as noted: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>Proposed provision </H1><H1>Existing provision</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(1) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(2) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(4)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(3) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(4) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(6)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(5) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(7)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(6) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(8)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(7) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(9)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(9) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(11)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1915.73(a)(10) <D>andSection;1915.74(a)(12)</D></ITAG></ITAG> The gangway, ladder, Jacob's ladder, and stair criteria presently containedin paragraphs andSection;1915.74(a)(1) and (a)(9) are not repeated in proposedparagraphs andSection;1915.73(a)(1) and (a)(7). Instead, these requirementswould be moved to proposed paragraphs andSection;1915.85 <T3>Stairways</T3>, andSection;1915.86 <T3>Ladders</T3>, and andSection;1915.87 <T3>Gangways, ramps, walkways, and catwalks</T3>. The existing andSection;1915.73(a)(2) and (a)(3) requirements relating toguardrail systems on gangways and turntables would be addressed in proposedSubpart M_Fall Protection.   Paragraph (a)(8) of andSection; 1915.73 would provide that obstructions notbe laid on or across means of access. This is the same requirement as andSection;1915.74(a)(10) except the term ``means of access'' replaces the existingterm ``gangway.'' OSHA believes that no obstructions should be placed onor across any means of access. <T3>Section 1915.73(b)_Access to vessels in drydock, and between vessels.</T3>This paragraph would apply to all vessels which are drydocked, andto all vessels lying abreast of each other whether afloat or drydocked.The following table lists the proposed provisions of paragraph andSection;1915.73(b) which would not be substantively changed from the correspondingrequirements in the existing paragraphs listed, except as noted: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25 </C>  <H1>Proposed provision </H1><H1>Existing provision </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.73(b)(1)<D>andSection; 1915.74(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.73(b)(2)<D>andSection; 1915.74(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.73(b)(3)<D>andSection; 1915.74(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.73(b)(4)<D>andSection; 1915.74(b) </D></ITAG></ITAG> The gangway, ladder, Jacob's ladder, and stair criteria presently requiredby paragraph andSection; 1915.74(b) are not repeated in proposed paragraphandSection; 1915.73(b).

When gangways, ramps,or walkways are impracticable, then ladders shall be used. This is thesame requirement as andSection; 1915.74(c)(2) except the existing provisioninadvertently omitted references to ramps and walkways. The ramp and stair criteria presently required by andSection; 1915.74(c)(1)and (c)(3) are not repeated in proposed paragraph andSection; 1915.73(c).Instead, these requirements would be moved to proposed andSection; 1915.87<T3>Gangways, walkways, ramps, catwalks, and dockboards (bridge plates),and </T3>andSection; 1915.85, <T3>Stairways, </T3>respectively. <T3>Section 1915.74 Access to drydocks and drydock wingwalls </T3>This section would set forth the requirements for access to drydocks anddrydock wingwalls, and is based on the provisions currently contained inandSection; 1915.75.

Paragraph (a)(1) of andSection;1915.75 would require at least one safe and accessible ladder in a cargospace into which employees must enter or in which employees are working.This is essentially the same requirement as andSection; 1915.76(a), exceptthe proposed provision clarifies the point that ladders may not be removedas long as someone is in the space. The following table lists the proposed provisions of paragraph andSection;1915.75(a) which would not be substantively changed from the correspondingrequirements in the existing paragraphs listed below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C>  <H1>Proposed provision </H1><H1>Existing provision </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.75(a)(2)<D>andSection; 1915.76(a)(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.75(a)(3)<D>andSection; 1915.76(a)(2) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.75(a)(4)<D>andSection; 1915.76(a)(3) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.75(a)(5)<D>andSection; 1915.76(a)(5) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 1915.75(a)(6)<D>andSection; 1915.76(a)(5) </D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>Section 1915.75(b)_Confined spaces.</T3> This pargraph would set forththe access requirements for confined spaces. Paragraph (b)(1) of andSection; 1915.75 would require more than one accessopening to be provided to a shipboard confined space in which employeesare working, and in which a hazardous or explosive atmosphere can be generatedby the work being performed, except where the structure or arrangementof the vessel makes this provision impractical. This is the same provisionas andSection; 1915.76(b)(1) except the term ``explosive atmosphere'' isadded to clarify the nature of the hazards which pose a danger to employees.In addition, the requirements of this paragraph would not apply to vesselsdesigned in accordance with the rules of the various worldwide classificationsocieties, or with United States Coast Guard (USCG) standards which requireonly one access opening, as the cutting of a second opening may violatesuch rules or standards. Paragraph (b)(2) of andSection; 1915.75 would require that when ventilationducts must pass through an access opening to a confined space, the ductsbe of a type and arrangement as to permit free passage of employees throughat least one of the access openings (two openings if there are two or moreaccess openings to the confined space). This is the same requirement asandSection; 1915.76(b)(2), except the requirement is changed to recognizethat some confined spaces only have one opening. Sections 1915.76 through 1915.79These sections would be reserved for future use. <T3>Section 1915.80 and Section 1915.81 General and specific requirementsfor means of egress from buildings and structures </T3>These sections would set forth the general and specific requirements formeans of egress from buildings and structures. The provisions are essentialto providing a safe means of egress from fire and other emergencies whichoccur in buildings and structures. (The provisions of these sections wouldnot apply to vessels, vessel sections, vehicles, or other mobile equipment,however, public comment is requested on this point in the Specific Issuessection of this preamble). The proposed provisions are substantively the same provisions as existingandSection;andSection;1910.36 and 1910.37. However, as indicated in the tablebelow, some of the provisions would be combined to reduce redundancy, andother provisions have been reworded for clarity. In addition, the proposalwould delete from the main text of the subpart requirements addressingexit capacity, size, and marking, and replace them with performance-orientedrequirements. The deleted provisions would be relocated to Appendix A.That appendix would be a non-mandatory set of guidelines provided to assistemployers in complying with proposed andSection;andSection;1915.80(c)(2) and1915.81(i)(2). The guidelines of Appendix A would be based on andSection;1910.36(b)(1)and (2), and andSection;1910.37(c), (d), (f)(6), (i), and (g)(8). If an employeruses these guidelines, OSHA will treat the resulting exit as meeting theperformance-oriented requirements of andSection;andSection;1915.80(c)(2) and1915.81(i)(2). However, by making these specification provisions non-mandatory,OSHA is allowing other alternative methods to be developed that are justas satisfactory as the presently mandated methods.

In addition, the proposalwould require the stairway to carry these loads without failure, that is,without breaking, separating, or exceeding the ultimate strength of componentparts. Although this is implicit in the existing provisions, the proposalwould clarify the point. Paragraph (a)(10) of andSection;1915.85 would require all parts of stairwaysto be free of hazardous projections such as nails protruding from walls.This is a new rule as there is no similar existing Part 1910 or Part 1915provision. However, OSHA does make this requirement for the constructionindustry in andSection;1926.501(c), and proposes to include it in this subpartbecause of the obvious danger such hazards can pose.<T3>Section 1915.85(b)_Stairrails and handrails. </T3>This paragraph wouldset forth the requirements for all stairrails and handrails (except thosewhich are part of a vessel or vessel section), and would apply regardlessof the stair height above lower levels. In the following discussion, itis important to recognize the difference between the terms ``stairrail''and ``handrail.'' As briefly discussed in the definitions section above,a stairrail is a vertical barrier erected along unprotected sides and edgesof a stairway to prevent employees from falling to a lower level. A handrailis a rail used to provide employees a handhold for support while climbing,descending, or resting on a stairway. On many stairways, the top of thestairrail system doubles as the required handrail. Paragraph (b)(1) of andSection;1915.85 would require stairways having fouror more risers to be equipped with at least one handrail, and one stairrailsystem along each unprotected side or edge. This is essentially the sameprovision as in andSection;1910.23(d)(1) and andSection;1910.24(h), exceptthe proposed requirements do not depend upon the width of the stairway.OSHA believes the existing width criteria are unnecessarily specific anddo not significantly affect worker safety. Consequently, the width criteriaof andSection;1910.23(d)(1) are proposed to be deleted. Paragraph (b)(2) of andSection;1915.85 would require winding and spiral stairwaysto be equipped with a handrail offset to prevent employees from walkingon those portions of the stairways where the treads are less than six incheswide. This is the same requirement as andSection;1910.23(d)(2), except theproposal expands the rule to include spiral stairways. Spiral stairwayswould be included because the problem of too narrow a tread is common toboth types of stairways. Paragraph (b)(3) of andSection;1915.85 would require the height of new stairrailsto be not less than 36 inches (30 inches for existing systems) as measuredfrom the upper surface of the stairrail system down to a point on the uppersurface of the tread in line with the face of the riser at the forwardedge of the tread. Existing andSection;1910.23(e)(2) presently specifiesa minimum height of 30 inches and a maximum height of 34 inches, measuredthe same way as required by the proposed rule. The limits specified inthe existing rule were developed so they would be compatible with existinghandrail limits which were also 30 and 34 inches, and so allowed one railto serve two functions. However, a study by the University of Michigan(Ref. 1:56) shows that the minimum height for railings providing fall protectionshould be 42 inches. That study suggests that even 42 inches may be toolow because ``the height of the stair railing several steps below the pointwhere the fall originates is considerably lower than the stair railingheight at the point where the fall originates, thus, it appears that afall during descent may be more likely to project the subject in the directionof this `lower' railing, and possibly over the railing'' (Ref. 1:57). Nevertheless,in order to recognize the limits already established by many existing buildingcodes, and to allow shipyards to continue the common practice of combiningstairrails and handrails into one railing system, OSHA is proposing thatthe minimum height of stairrails be 36 inches. In addition, because itwould not be feasible to require retrofitting of all existing railingsin shipyards, OSHA is proposing that existing systems be ``grandfathered.''Paragraph (b)(4) of andSection;1915.85 would require midrails, screens, mesh,intermediate vertical members (such as balusters), or equivalent structuralmembers to be placed between the stairways steps and the top of the stairrailsystem. This is essentially the same as existing rule andSection;1910.23(e)(2)which requires stairrails to be similar in construction to guardrails,except specified alternatives to midrails would be allowed. Paragraph (b)(4)(i)would require midrails, when used, to be located midway in height on astairrail system. This is the same requirement as contained in andSection;1910.23(e)(1).Paragraph (b)(4)(ii) would require screens or mesh, when used, to fillthe entire opening between toprail and stairway steps, and paragraph (b)(4)(iii)would require baluster type members to be no more than 19 inches apart.Paragraph (b)(4)(iv) would allow other arrangements of structural membersprovided all openings in the system are not more than 19 inches wide. Theserules would technically be new provisions as the existing rule only addressesthe use of midrails. However, these new rules are not expected to increasecosts of compliance because they are alternative choices to the use ofmidrails, and would allow greater flexibility for the employer providingfall protection. Paragraph (b)(5) of andSection;1915.85 would require handrails and the toprailsof stairrail systems to be capable of withstanding, without failure, aforce of at least 200 pounds applied within two inches of the top surface,in any downward or outward direction, and at any point along the top edge.This is essentially the same requirement as contained in andSection;1910.23(e)(3).Paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(7) of andSection;1915.85 specify the maximum andminimum height for handrails, and stairrails which are to serve as handrails.Although existing rules andSection;andSection;1910.23(e)(2) and 1910.23(e)(5)(ii)specify 30 and 34 inches as appropriate limits, a study by the Universityof Michigan (Ref. 1:43) has determined that 33 inches is the optimum height,and that a variance from this height of plus or minus three inches is appropriate.This new limit, coupled with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3), wouldallow any 36-inch high stairrail system to double as a handrail. However,the upper limit for handrails is proposed to be 37 inches to allow someflexibility in providing a system that can meet the hight criterion forboth stairrail systems and handrail systems. Paragraph (b)(8) of andSection;1915.85 would require stairrail systems andhandrails to be so surfaced as to prevent injury to employees from puncturesor lacerations, and to prevent the snagging of clothes (which in turn couldcause an employee to trip). This is the same requirement as andSection;1910.23(e)(3)(v)(<T3>a</T3>) which covers stairrails, except the proposal would also includehandrails because they can pose the same hazards. This provision wouldnot preclude rails from being surfaced to provide grip enhancement. Paragraph (b)(9) of andSection;1915.85 would require handrails to providean adequate handhold for anyone using them. This is the same requirementas in andSection; 1910.23(e)(5)(i). Paragraph (b)(10) of andSection; 1915.85 would require that the ends of stairrailsystems and handrails be constructed such that they do not constitute projectionhazards. This is the same requirement as in andSection; 1910.23(e)(1) andandSection; 1910.23(e)(5)(i).Paragraph (b)(11) of andSection;1915.85 would require handrails to be spaceda minimun of one and one-half inches away from walls, stairrail systems,and other objects. This is a change from andSection;1910.23(e)(6), whichrequires a minimum clearance of three inches. The proposed change wouldbring OSHA standards into conformance with the current requirements ofmany local building codes, as well as to ANSI standard A12.1-1973, ``SafetyRequirements for Floor and Wall Openings, Railings, and Toeboards,'' paragraph7.6 (Ref. 2). Section 1915.86 Ladders This section specifies the requirements for all ladders used by shipyardemployees, except those which are a permanent part of a vessel or vesselsection. <T3>Section 1915.86(a)_General. </T3>Paragraph (a) of andSection;1915.85would set forth the general requirements for the construction of ladders.Paragraph (a)(1) of andSection;1915.86 would specify minimum strength requirementfor all ladders. Specifically, paragraph (a)(1)(i) would require each portableladder and each job-built ladder to be capable of supporting, without failure,at least four times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted tothat ladder when the ladder is placed at an angle of 75\1/2\ degrees fromhorizontal. This minimum strength requirements for portable ladders isessentially the same requirement as contained in existing paragraphs (a)(4)and (a)(6) of andSection;1915.72, which reference the A14.2-1972 ANSI standard(paragraph 6.1.3) for portable metal ladders (Ref. 4) and the A14.1-1975ANSI standard (paragraph 6.1.3) for portable wood ladders (Ref. 3), respectively.However, breakage, separation of component parts, or load refusal wouldbe used as the failure criteria instead of ``deformation,'' as some rungdeformation will normally result when such loads are applied, and a deformedrung does not necessarily indicate a ladder which is unsafe for use. Job-builtladders do not have minimum strength criteria either in the existing OSHArules or in the ANSI standard for job-built ladders, A14.4-1979 (Ref. 5).However, their potential use is the same as that of manufactured portableladders, and, therefore, the proposed standards would impose the same strengthrequirements.Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of andSection; 1915.86 would require fixed ladders tobe capable of supporting, without failure, at least two loads of 250 poundseach, concentrated between any two consecutive points of attachment, plusother anticipated loads such as those caused by wind and ice buildup. Theparagraph would also require that each step and rung be capable of supportinga minimum concentrated load of 250 pounds, applied in the middle of itsspan. This requirement is based on andSection; 1910.27(a)(1), however, thespecific requirements have been changed to reflect the more recent requirementsof ANSI A14.3-1984 (Ref. 6), paragraph 3.2.1.1. The ANSI criteria are basedon loads of 250 pounds, and are consistent with OSHA's current use of 250pounds as the average design weight of an employee and tools. OSHA believes it may not be practicable for an employer to test every ladderbefore purchase to see if it meets the performance criteria of paragraph(a)(1) of andSection; 1915.86. However, many ladders are manufactured tomeet ANSI ladder standards, and paragraph (a)(1) would recognize such laddersas meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1). Appendix B referencesthe current ANSI standards that apply to portable wood ladders, portablemetal ladders, portable reinforced ladders, fixed ladders, and job-madeladders. Ladders built in conformance with Appendix B would be deemed by OSHA tomeet the strength requirements of paragraph (a)(1). This includes extraheavy duty type 1A ladders built in accordance with the 1982 ANSI standardsfor portable metal ladders (Ref. 4). The standard would also apply to portablereinforced plastic ladders (Ref. 9). ANSI requires these types of laddersto have a safety factor of only 3.3. However, OSHA believes that the extensivetesting procedures also required by ANSI are sufficient to insure adequateladder strength. The use of Appendix B would allow design flexibility for employers whodesire to engineer their own ladders, and would provide an acceptable designfor employers who do not desire to or cannot engineer the ladders theyuse. The important consideration is that the ladder be capable of safelysupporting the loads imposed. Paragraph (a)(2) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder rungs, cleats,and steps to be parallel, level, and uniformly spaced when the ladder isin position for use. This requirement is based on andSection; 1910.25(c)(2)(1)(<T3>b</T3>) which applies to portable wood ladders, and andSection; 1910.27(b)(1)(ii)which applies to fixed ladders. However, OSHA believes that proper footingis necessary on all ladders and this provision would apply to all typesof ladders. Paragraph (a)(3) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that rungs, cleats,and steps be spaced not less than six inches apart, nor more than 12 inchesapart, as measured along the siderails of fixed and portable ladders, andthat the limits be six and 16-\1/2\ inches for individual step or rungladders. The 12-inch limit is the same as andSection;andSection; 1910.25(c)(2)(i)(<T3>b</T3>) and 1910.26(a)(1)(iii). The other proposed limits are basedon the general limits used in ANSI's current standards for the most commonlyused types of ladders (Refs. 5-9). Public comment is requested on theselimits in the Specific Issues section of this preamble. Paragraph (a)(4) of andSection; 1915.86 would specify minimum rung, cleat,and step length for various ladders. These limits are based on currentandSection; 1910.25(c)(2)(i)(<T3>c</T3>), andSection; 1910.26(a)(2)(i), andSection; 1910.27(b)(1)(iii),and andSection; 1915.72(b)(5). The minimum limit of 12 inches for plasticreinforced ladders is based on the requirements set forth for such laddersin ANSI A14.5-1972 (Ref. 9). Paragraph (a)(5) of andSection; 1915.86 would require individual rung laddersto be shaped such that employees' feet cannot slide off rung ends. Thisis the same requirement as andSection; 1910.27(b)(1)(v). Paragraph (a)(6) of andSection; 1915.86 would require rungs and steps ofmetal ladders to be corrugated, knurled, dimpled, coated with skid resistantmaterial, or be otherwise treated to minimize slipping. This is the samerequirement as the portable metal ladder requirement in andSection; 1910.26(a)(1)(v),except it would apply to all ladders as slipping hazards can be presenton all types of ladders. Paragraph (a)(7) of andSection; 1915.86 would require Jacob's ladders tobe of the double rung or flat tread type. This is the same requirementas in andSection; 1915.74(d)(1). Paragraph (a)(8) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit the tying togetherof ladder sections to make a longer ladder, unless the sections are designedfor such use. This provision is essentially the same as andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(ix)and andSection; 1910.26(c)(3)(vi). Paragraph (a)(9) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that a spliced siderailbe equivalent in strength to a siderail of the same length made of onepiece of the same material. This is the same requirement as the constructionindustry provision, andSection; 1926.450(a)(7). OSHA believes this rule shouldapply to all ladders, not just job-made ladders used in construction, asproper splices are important on all ladders in order to maintain properladder strength along its full length. Paragraph (a)(10) of andSection; 1915.86 would require stepladders to beprovided with a metal spreader or other locking device to keep the ladderin an open position when being used. This is the same provision as andSection;andSection;1910.25(c)(i)(<T3>f</T3>), and 1910.26(a)(3)(viii). Paragraph (a)(11) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder surfaces tobe free of puncture and laceration hazards. This provision is essentiallythe same requirement as in andSection; 1910.25(b)(1), andSection; 1910.26(a)(1),andSection; 1910.27(b)(1)(iv), and andSection; 1915.72(b)(2). Paragraph (a)(12) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit wood ladders frombeing coated with any opaque covering except as necessary for identificationor warning labels. This provision is intended to prohibit covering or paintingover any splits or cracks in any wood ladder component which would causethe defect to be unnoticeable to a ladder user. This requirement is basedon the andSection; 1915.72(a)(6) reference to ANSI A14.1-1975 (Ref. 3), whichaddresses this in paragraph 7.1.9. However, the specific wording of theproposal is based on the revised ANSI A14.1-1982 (Ref. 7), paragraph 8.4.6.3.Paragraph (a)(13) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that when two or moreseparate ladders are used to reach an elevated work area, the ladders beoffset and a platform be used between ladders. This would be a new provision,and is based on the need for proper footing at all times, especially whenmoving from one ladder to another. The platform also serves to protectemployees who are descending a ladder which does not extend to the nextlower level from inadvertently stepping off the bottom of a ladder andfalling. Paragraph (a)(14) of andSection; 1915.86 would require a minimum perpendicularclearance of seven inches between fixed ladder rungs, cleats, and steps,and any obstruction behind the fixed ladder. This is essentially the samerequirement as contained in andSection; 1910.27(c)(4). However, the proposaldoes not provide for ``unavoidable'' obstructions as in the existing rule.This change is made in line with the language of the more recent ANSI standardA14.3-1984 (Ref. 6), paragraph 5.4.2.1, and reflects the need for propertoe clearance at all times. Paragraph (a)(15) of andSection; 1915.86 would require a minimum clearanceof 30 inches between fixed ladders and any obstruction on the climbingside of the ladder. This is the same provision as in andSection; 1910.27(c)(1).In keeping with ANSI A14.3-1984 (Ref. 6), paragraph 5.4.1.1, the otherclearance limits presently in andSection; 1910.27(c)(1) would be deletedas unnecessary, because when unavoidable obstructions are present, paragraph(a)(16) of andSection; 1915.86 would allow the minimum clearance to be aslow as 24 inches, provided a device is installed to guide employees aroundthe obstruction. This provision is based on ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph5.4.1.3. Paragraph (a)(17) of andSection; 1915.86 would specify minimum and maximumstep-across distances at landings for fixed ladders of seven inches and12 inches, respectively. This is the same requirement as in andSection; 1910.27(c)(6),except the existing two and one-half inch minimum limit is changed to seveninches to be consistent with the minimum clearance limit of proposed ruleandSection; 1915.86(a)(14). Paragraph (a)(18) of andSection; 1915.86 would require a minimum of 15 inchesside clearance (from the ladder centerline) for all fixed ladders thatdo not have cages or wells. This is the same provision as in andSection;1910.27(c)(2). Paragraphs (a)(19) and (a)(20) of andSection; 1915.86 would require fixedladders to be provided with cages, wells, ladder safety devices, or self-retractinglifelines where the length of climb is less than 24 feet, but the top ofthe ladder is more than 24 feet above lower levels; and for all fixed ladderswhere the length of climb equals or exceeds 24 feet. This requirement isbased on andSection; 1910.27(d)(1)(ii) and (d)(5), which require protectionon ladders longer than 20 feet. However, the proposed requirement reflectsthe updated and clarified language of ANSI A14.3-1984 (Ex. 6), paragraph4.1., and the proposal would allow the use of the self-retracting lifelinesas alternative fall protection to wells, cages, and ladder safety devices.Paragraphs (a)(21) and (a)(22) of andSection; 1915.86 would set forth therequirements for fixed ladder cage and well construction and are essentiallythe same as andSection; 1910.27(d). However, the proposal reflects the updatedand clarified language of ANSI A14.3-1984 (Ref. 6), paragraphs 6.1 and6.2. Significant changes are as follows: Maximum cage size is increasedfrom 28 inches to 30 inches to allow easier employee movement; wells wouldnot be required to encircle the ladder completely and be free of projections;and the bottom access opening for wells would be required to be not lessthan seven feet nor more than eight feet high in order to provide properaccess to the ladder (the existing standard does not clearly address thispoint). Paragraph (a)(23) and (a)(24) of andSection; 1915.86 would set forth therequirements for ladder safety devices and are based on andSection; 1910.27(d)(5).However, the proposal would provide necessary design and performance criteriawhich are not clearly set forth in the existing rule. Paragraphs (a)(23)(i) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder safetydevices and their support systems (such as the ladder to which they areattached) to be capable of withstanding, without failure, a drop test consistingof an 18-inch (.41 m) drop of a 500 pound (226 kg) weight. This provisionis based on the ANSI A14.4-1984 (Ex. 6), paragraph 7.1.3. Paragraph .86(a)(23)(ii)would require the devices to be of a design which permits employees usingthe system to ascend or descend without continually having to manipulateany part of the system. The requirement is essentially the same as paragraph7.3.1 of ANSI A14.3-1984. Paragraph andSection; 1915.86(a)(23)(iii) wouldrequire ladder safety devices to limit the descending velocity of an employeeto seven feet per second (2.1 m/sec) or less within two feet (.61 m) aftera fall occurs. A National Bureau of Standards' report (Ex. 10) suggestsa maximum descent rate of 15 feet per second for uninjured employees, and10 feet per second (3.1 m/sec) for injured employees using descent devices.OSHA is proposing a more conservative rate of seven feet per second (2.1m/sec) for this type of fall protection system, as a descending employeeis exposed to additional risk of injury from contact with the ladder duringdescent. OSHA believes that in addition to providing protection from theforce of the fall, a seven foot per second rate would enable an employeeto regain control on the ladder, or to allow for emergency egress at areasonable and safe speed. It respresents the speed attained after freefalling approximately one foot (30.5 cm). Paragraph (a)(23)(iv) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that the maximumlength of the connection between the carrier or lifeline and the pointof attachment to the body belt not exceed nine inches (23 cm). This requirementis based on a recommendation contained in Drs. Chaffin and Stobbe's report,``Ergonomic Considerations Related to Selected Fall Prevention Aspectsof Scaffolds and Ladders as Presented in OSHA Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910,Subpart D'' (Ref. 11), which indicates that this distance is needed toascend and decend a ladder in a position that is not awkward.Paragraph (a)(24) of andSection; 1915.86 would set forth the mounting requirementsfor ladder safety devices. Paragraph (a)(24)(i) of andSection; 1915.86 wouldrequire mountings for rigid carriers to be attached at each end of thecarrier, with intermediate mountings spaced along the entire length ofthe carrier. This is based on ANSI A.14.3-1984, paragraph 7.3.4. Paragraph(a)(24)(ii) of andSection; 1915.86 would require mountings for flexible carriersto be attached at each end of the carrier, and that when the system isexposed to wind, cable guides be installed at a minimum spacing of 25 feet(7.6 m) and a maximum spacing of 40 feet (12.2 m) along the entire lengthof the carrier to prevent wind damage to the system. These are the samerequirements as in ANSI A.14.3-1984, paragraph 7.3.5. Paragraph (a)(24)(iii)of andSection; 1915.86 would require that the design and installation ofmountings and cable guides not reduce the design strength of the ladder.This is based on ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph 7.1.4.Paragraph (a)(25) of andSection; 1915.86 would require the siderails of fixedladders to extend 42 inches above the top of the access level or landingplatform served by the ladder. This is essentially the same provision asin andSection; 1910.27(d)(3). However, the proposal also provides that fora parapet ladder, if the parapet is cut to permit passage through the parapet,the access level shall be the level of the roof. If the parapet is continuous(i.e., uncut) then the access level is the top of the parapet. This partof the provision is based on ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph 5.3.2.1.Paragraph (a)(26) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder extensionson through-type fixed ladders, which are not equipped with ladder safetydevices, to have the steps or rungs omitted from the extension. In addition,the extension shall be flared not less than 24 inches (18 inches for existingladders) and not more than 30 inches. The existing 18-inch minimum limitof andSection; 1910.27(d)(3) would be ``grandfathered.'' The change of limitis based on the updated requirements of ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph 5.3.2.2.,which require more distance between rails to facilitate employee passage.The proposal would allow a maximum spacing of 36 inches for ladders equippedwith ladder safety devices. This rule is also based on ANSI A14.3-1984,paragraph 5.3.2.2.Paragraph (a)(27) of andSection; 1915.86 would require the siderails andthe steps or rungs of side-step ladders to be continuous in the extension.It is the same requirement as in andSection; 1910.27(d)(3), although thewording is changed to reflect ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph 5.3.2.3.Paragraph (a)(28) of andSection; 1915.86 would require specified individualrung ladders to extend 42 inches above the landing platform, either byproviding additional rungs to serve as grab bars, or by providing verticalgrab bars. This is a clarification of how andSection; 1910.27(d)(3) appliesto such ladders, and is based on ANSI A14.3-1984, paragraph 5.3.3.1.<T3>Section 1915.86(b)_Use. </T3>Paragraph (b) of andSection; 1915.86 wouldset forth the requirements for safe ladder use by shipyard employees.Paragraph (b)(1) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder siderails toextend at least three feet above the upper level or surface to which theladder is used to gain access. This is essentially the same requirementas andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(xy) and andSection; 1915.72(a)(3). The proposalwould provide that when such extensions are not possible because of theladder's length, then the ladder shall be secured at its top and employeesbe provided with a grasping device such as a grabrail. This is essentiallythe same provision as in andSection; 1915.72(a)(3), except that the proposalwould require the securing of the ladder and would not limit alternativesolutions to grabrails.Paragraph (b)(2) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladders to be freeof slipping hazards. This requirement is based on the andSection; 1910.25(a)(1)(xi)requirement that ladder rungs be ``kept free of grease and oil''; and theandSection; 1910.26(c)(2)(vi) (<T3>d</T3>) requirement to keep oil, grease, and slippery materials offladders.Paragraph (b)(3) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that ladders not beloaded beyond their maximum intended load-carrying capacity, nor beyondtheir rated capacity. This rule would clarify the intent of the existingand proposed rules which set forth design criteria for ladders. This provisionwould prevent the overstressing of ladders which can lead to their failure.Paragraph (b)(4) of andSection; 1915.86 would require that ladders be usedonly for the purpose for which they were designed. This provision is basedon the andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(xi) requirement that ladders not be usedas guys, braces, skids, or for other than their intended purpose. Thisprovision is also based on the andSection; 1910.26(c)(3)(vii) requirementthat ladders not be used as braces, skids, guys, gin poles, gangways, orfor other purposes than that for which they were intended, unless specificallyrecommended for such use by the ladder manufacturer.Paragraph (b)(5) of andSection; 1915.86 would require non-self-supportingladders to be used such that the angle of inclination is approximatelyone to four, horizontal distance to working ladder length distance. Thisis the same provision as andSection;andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(i) and 1910.26(c)(3)(1).The proposed rule would also include the language of ANSI A14.4-1979 (Ref.5), ``Safety Requirements for Job-Made Ladders,'' paragraph 4.4.1, whichincreases the required minimum angle to a ratio of one to eight for job-madeladders made with spliced siderails. This steeper angle minimizes the stressesplaced on the spliced siderails when the ladder is in use.Paragraph (b)(5) of andSection; 1915.86 would require fixed ladders to beused at a pitch no greater than 90 degrees from the horizontal as measuredto the backside of the ladder. This rule is based on andSection; 1910.27(e)(4).Paragraph (b)(6) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladders to be usedonly on stable and level surfaces unless secured to prevent accidentaldisplacement. This requirement is based on the andSection;andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(iii)and 1910.26(c)(3)(iii) requirements that portable ladders have a ``securefooting.'' The term ``stable'' is used in lieu of the term ``secure'' asthe latter term is used in paragraph (b)(8) of andSection; 1915.86 to meanphysically attaching the ladder to some anchorage. Examples of unstablesurfaces are boxes and barrels, the same as in andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(v).The additional requirement that the surface must be level or the laddersbe secured is based on ANSI A14.1-1982 (Ref. 7), paragraph 8.3.4, and isincluded because surfaces which are not level do not provide suitable supportfor unsecured ladders.Paragraph (b)(7) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit the use of ladderson slippery surfaces unless they are secured or provided with slip-resistantfeet. This is essentially the same provision as in andSection;andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(i)and 1910.25(d)(2)(xix).Paragraph (b)(8) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladders placed in passageways,doorways, or any location where they can be displaced by other activitiesor traffic, to be secured in place, or a barricade system used to keepactivities and traffic away from the ladder. This is esentially the sameprovision as andSection; 1915.72(a)(3), which requires portable ladders tobe lashed, blocked, or otherwise secured to prevent their being displaced.However, the proposal would allow the alternative of barricading the areaaround the ladder. The proposed rule is also based on andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(iv)which prohibits ladders from being placed in front of a door unless thedoor is blocked, locked, or guarded.Paragraph (b)(10) of andSection; 1915.86 would require the tops of non-self-supportingladders to be placed such that the two siderails are equally supported,or provided with a single support attachment. This requirement would insureproper ladder stability and is essentially the same provision as andSection;andSection;1910.25(d)(2)(iv) and 1910.26(e)(3)(iv).Paragraph (b)(11) of andSection; 1915.86 would provide that ladders not bemoved, shifted, or extended while occupied, and is based on andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(xvi),which prohibits adjustment of ladders while an employee is on the ladder.The proposal would clarify the term ``adjustment,'' and would apply toall types of ladders.Paragraph (b)(12) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladders to have non-conductivesiderails when used where the ladder could contact energized equipment,or when used by employees performing electric arc welding operations. Thisis essentially the same rule as andSection; 1915.72(a)(5), and clarifiesthe requirements of andSection; 1910.26(c)(3)(viii).Paragraph (b)(13) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit using the top ofa stepladder as a step. This is esentially the same provision as andSection;1910.25(d)(2)(xii), except it would apply to all stepladders and not just``ordinary'' stepladders, as the hazard is the same.Paragraph (b)(14) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit using the cross-bracingon stepladders as a step. This is essentially the same provision as andSection;1910.25(d)(2)(xx).Paragraph (b)(15) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladders to be inspectedfor visible defects periodically, preferably before each use, and afterany occurrence which could affect their use. This is essentially the samerequirement as is contained in andSection; 1910.25(d)(1)(x), andSection; 1910.26(c)(2)(iv) and (vi), and andSection; 1915.72(a)(1). Public comment is requestedon the frequency of inspection in the Specific Issues section of this preamble.Paragraph (b)(16) of andSection; 1915.86 would provide that ladders withstructural defects be immediately tagged and withdrawn from service untilrepaired. This is essentially the same rule as contained in andSection;andSection;1910.25(d)(1)(x), 1910.26(c)(2)(viii), and 1915.72(a)(1).Paragraph (b)(17) of andSection; 1915.86 would require ladder repairs torestore the ladder to a condition meeting the design criteria of the ladder.This clarifies the term ``repaired'' as used in proposed paragraph andSection;1915.86(b)(16). It means that if, for example, a Type 1A extra-heavy-duty-ratedladder has a broken rung, the replacement rung also must be capable ofsupporting at least a 300 pound load.Paragraph (b)(18) of andSection; 1915.86 would prohibit the use of singlerail ladders except for emergency or rescue operations. This is essentiallythe same rule as andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(x), except emergency and rescueuse of such ladders would be specifically allowed.Paragraph (b)(19) of andSection; 1915.86 would require Jacob's ladders tobe either hung without slack from their lashings, or be pulled up entirely.This is the same rule as andSection; 1915.74(d)(2).Paragraph (b)(20) of andSection; 1915.86 would restrict the use of blastinghoods, welding helmets, and burning goggles by employees on ladders, andis the same rule as contained in andSection; 1915.77(c).Paragraph (b)(21) of andSection; 1915.86 would require employees who areascending or descending a ladder to face the ladder. This is the same ruleas andSection; 1910.26(c)(3)(v) and clarifies the intent of andSection; 1910.25(d)(2)(vii)which uses the non-mandatory term ``should'' in its requirement.Section 1915.87 Gangways, walkways, ramps, catwalks, and dockboards (bridgeplates). This section would set forth the general requirements for the constructionof gangways, walkways, ramps, catwalks, and dockboards. However, the requirementsfor fall protection (i.e., guardrails and personal fall protection equipment)would be contained in proposed Subpart M_Fail Protection.<T3>Section 1915.87(a)_Gangways and walkways.</T3> Paragraph (a) of andSection;1915.87 would set forth the requirements for the construction of gangwaysand walkways. This is essentially the same provision as existing andSection;1915.74(a)(1), but it would clarify that both gangways and walkways arecovered. The provision would recognize that gangways on vessels inspectedand certified by the U.S. Coast Guard are deemed to be satisfactory foruse by employees, except in cases where the vessel's regular gangway isnot used. This is the same provision as existing andSection; 1915.74(a)(3).<T3>Section 1915.87(b)_Ramps.</T3> Paragraph (b) of andSection; 1915.87 wouldset forth the requirements for the construction of ramps. Paragraph (b)(1)of andSection; 1915.87 would require ramps for employee access to meet thesame criteria as set forth for gangways and walkways. Paragraph (b)(2)of andSection; 1915.87 would require vehicle access ramps to be capable ofsupporting the maximum intended load, without failure and is based on andSection;1915.74(c)(1).However, the proposed requirement would replace the existing requirementthat such ramps ``be of adequate strength.'' The change, coupled with theproposed definitions for ``maximum intended load'' and ``failure,'' clarifiesthe requirement by setting forth the performance criteria to be met.<T3>Section 1915.87(c)_Catwalks.</T3> Paragraph (c) of andSection; 1915.87would set forth the requirements for the construction of catwalks usedon marine railways. It is based on both existing andSection; 1915.75(g) andthe proposed provisions for gangways and walkways discussed above.<T3>Section 1915.87(d)_Dockboards (Bridge plates).</T3> Paragraph (d) ofandSection; 1915.87 would set forth the requirements for the constructionof use of dockboards. It is the same as andSection; 1910.30(a) which coversthe same topic. However, public comment is requested in the Specific Issuessection of this preamble as to whether or not the existing reference toCommercial Standard CS 202-56 (1961) should be updated.<T3>Sections 1915.88 through 1915.90</T3> are reserved for future use.Specific IssuesIn addition to any other comments made on this subpart, the public is requestedto comment on the following specific issues:1. The proposed definitions for ``low hazard contents,'' ``high hazardcontents,'' and ``ordinary hazard contents'' are the same as the existingandSection; 1910.35 definitions for those terms. The andSection; 1910.35 definitionsare essentially the same as the definitions used by the National Fire ProtectionAssociation (NFPA). However, when informed that these provisions mightbe revised, the following comments were made in 1984 by the InternationalBrotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades in respect to these definition:<ITAG tagnum="21">``High hazard contents,'' ``low hazard contents,'' and ``ordinaryhazard contents'' are defined in such a fashion as to be internally inconsistent,vague, non-exclusive, insufficient, and inappropriate in the context ofthe ordinary meaning of the term ``hazardous'' as it is used in other OSHAstandards and in standard industrial hygiene practice. ``High hazard contents,''for example, should include materials that are ``highly reactive, oxidizingor combustible'' as well as those ``capable of generating toxic fumes,dusts, mists or vapors,'' and the definition should certainly include the``fear'' of ``any uncontrolled release of such materials'' not just thosewhich generate fumes. Similarly, ``low hazard . . . requiring the use ofemergency exits * * * '' should not be limited only to ``combustibility.''Finally, ``ordinary hazards,'' leaves unclassified materials ``which burnwith moderate rapidity,'' but do not give off ``considerable smoke'' (theycannot be ``low hazard'' because they burn with ``moderate rapidity'' andthey cannot be ``high hazard'' as neither ``poisonous fumes nor explosionsare to be feared.'')</ITAG>In light of the above comments, public comment is requested on whetherthe proposed definitions should be modified and, if so, how should theybe changed.2. Existing provisions contained in andSection;andSection; 1910.35, 1910.36,and 1910.37 and proposed provisions of andSection;andSection; 1915.80 and 1910.81set forth minimum requirements for providing employees a safe means ofescape from buildings and structures on shore during fires and other emergencies.Public comment is requested on what similar provisions, if any, shouldapply to vessels, vessel sections, vehicles, and other mobile equipment.Comments should include appropriate injury and cost data.3. Paragraph andSection; 1910.38, <T3>Employee emergency plans and fire prevention plans,</T3> ``appliesto all emergency action plans required by a particular standard'' (andSection;1910.38(a)(1)). Presently, the only OSHA standard that requires such plansis Subpart L of Part 1910, Fire Protection. However, Subpart L specificallyomits maritime activities from its application. Such omission was madebecause at the time Subpart L and andSection; 1910.38 were developed, shipyardapplication was not evaluated. Public comment is now requested on areasof shipyard employment in which emergency action plans as described inandSection; 1910.38(a) are appropriate. Comments should address which partsof andSection; 1910.38(a) should or should not be applied and under whatconditions, and should include appropriate injury and cost data. Commentsshould also address whether or not the provisions should apply to vesselsand vessel sections, or only to shoreside facilities.4. Proposed paragraph (b)(15) of andSection; 1915.86 would require laddersto be inspected for visible defects periodically, preferably before eachuse, and after any occurrence which could affect their use. This requirementfor inspection is based on andSection;andSection; 1910.25(d)(1)(x), 1910.26(c)(2)(iv), (vi), and 1915.72(a)(1). Generally, the existing rules do not specifya definite frequency rate for inspections. The proposed frequency, however,is similar to that set out in paragraphs 8.4.1 of ANSI 14.1-1982 (Ex. 7),and A14.2-1982 (Ex. 8), and to the requirement in andSection; 1910.26(c)(2)(vi).Public comment is requested on the specified frequency of inspection.5. Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i) of andSection; 1915.86 would require laddersto have a four to one strength capacity (ladders meeting ANSI specifications(Refs. 3-9) are deemed to meet this requirement). However, once a ladderhas been designed and is in use, it is difficult to assess its strengthcapacity as loading the ladder to four times its rated capacity could permanentlydamage the ladder and render it useless. As an alternative, setting a maximumallowable deflection for a ladder while is use might be an appropriatemethod of evaluating a ladder's capacity. Public comment is requested onwhether or not OSHA should specify a maximum allowable deflection for ladders,and if so, how much should be allowed, and how should it be measured (forexample, horizontally with end points supported and the working load appliedin midspan)?6. Proposed paragraph (a)(3) of andSection; 1915.86 specifies minimum verticalspacing between ladder rungs, steps, and cleats. These limits are basedon the general limits set forth in the ANSI standards for ladders (Refs.5-9). However, the proposed limits reflect OSHA's attempt to consolidatethe wide range of ANSI's limits, and consequently, do not mirror the existingANSI provisions exactly. Therefore, public comment is requested on thefollowing points:(a) Are the proposed limits appropriate, or should the more specific ANSIlimits be adopted?(b) If the proposed limits are appropriate, should they be consolidatedfurther so that there is only one set of rules for vertical spacing, suchas six to 12 inches, and one minimum width limit, such as 11\1/2\ inches?As it is OSHA's intention to simplify the existing rules and use less specificationtype language, proponents for using the more specific ANSI limits shouldstate why the various limits are required for each type of ladder. Commentsshould include appropriate injury and cost data.7. Public comment is requested on whether or not the following rule shouldbe added to Subpart E: ``Workers shall not be permitted to climb a ladderwith their hands full. A handline shall be used for raising and loweringtools and materials.'' Comments should include appropriate injury and costdata.8. The proposed provisions on the minimum height of stairrail systems andSection;1915.85(c)(3) and andSection; 1915.85(c)(7)), and the minimum amount of siderailfare on through-type fixed ladders (andSection; 1915.86(a)(26)) are intendedto bring the shipyard employment standards into conformance with similarprovisions being developed for the construction industry safety standardsand the general industry safety standards. Public comment is requestedon whether or not existing guardrail systems and fixed ladder siderailsin shipyard employment should be ``grandfathered,'' and whether or notother facilities or equipment should also be ``grandfathered,'' and whysuch ``grandfathering'' is appropriate. Comments should include a discussionof related cost, injury, and feasibility data.9. Proposed paragraph (d)(3) of andSection; 1915.87 is based on existingandSection; 1910.30(a)(3) and would require powered dockboards to be designedand constructed in accordance with Commmercial Standard CS 202-56 (1961)``Industrial Lifts and Hinged Loading Ramps'' published by the U.S. Departmentof Commerce. Public comment is requested on whether or not the referencedrequirements should be modified. If so, comments are requested on whatchanges should be made and why they should be made. Relevant cost, injury,and feasibility data are also requested.10. In some of the existing provisions and in some of the proposed provisions,OSHA uses specific numerical limits to define and clarify the duties setforth. For example, see Issue Number 6 above addressing ladder rung spacing,and see existing andSection; 1910.24(e) and proposed andSection; 1915.85(a)(2)which address stairway slope. These and other limits are based on existinglaws and consensus standards, and are used in lieu of more performance-orientedlanguage such as ``provide adequate rung spacing,'' or ``install stairwaysat such angles that tripping is minimized,'' or language which requiresa numerical limit but then allows other configurations which give ``equivalent''protection. OSHA believes that although such performance-oriented languagewould be less restrictive on employers, and thus give them more optionswhen abating a hazard, it does not always tell the employer exactly whatis required (i.e., how to do something ``right''). On the other hand, requiringspecific numerical limits in the rule and allowing the employer to useother limits which the employer can show will provide ``equivalent'' protectionmay respond to both these concerns. OSHA believes that the use of specificlimits in certain provisions (such as those listed above, and those forstairrail, handrail heights, and similar requirements) provides the requirednotice to employers as to how they can comply with a provision comparedto how OSHA intends to enforce the provision. OSHA believes that such noticeserves to inform employees and employers about the proper way to do things;promotes consistency in hazard abatement at all worksites; and also minimizeslegal disputes over the intent of a requirement. On the other hand, specificationlanguage can increase costs without increasing safety, discourage technicalinnovation, prevent the use of safe alternatives, and fail to anticipatethe varying needs and situations in the numerous workplaces covered bythe standard.Public comment is requested on whether or not OSHA's use of specificationlanguage is appropriate, or if it should be moved to a non-mandatory appendixwhich could provide guidance to employers. If not, should the provisionsbe written to provide the desired flexibility and the required fair notice?If the continued use of such limits is appropriate, are the proposed limitssufficient to abate the hazards? Comments should include appropriate costand injury data.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. <T3>References</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis</ITAG>Introduction and SummaryIn accordance with Executive Order No. 12291 (46 FR 13193 February 17,1981) OSHA has analyzed the economic impact of this proposed standard.Under the criteria established in E.O. 12291, OSHA has determined thatthe promulgation of this proposed revision would not be a ``major'' action.BackgroundUnder Executive Order 12291, OSHA is required, in general, to submit anyNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for ``all rules other than major rules''to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) at least 10days prior to publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.In light of the data currently available to OSHA, the economic impact estimatespresented in this preamble are rough estimates which are likely to be refinedas OSHA receives additional information.OSHA solicits further comments on the estimates presented in this preambleand those comments will be addressed and incorporated into the RegulatoryImpact Assessment (RIA) for the final rule.Data SourcesThe primary source for this section is the November 1985, Draft Final Reportby CONSAD Research Corporation entitled, ``Data to Support Regulatory Analysisof the Proposed Standard for Shipbuilding and Repairing.'' In addition,OSHA also used an October 1984, report by Main Hurdman/KMG entitled ``Profileof the Shipbuilding and Repairing Industry.''Industry ProfileThe entire shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking industries wouldbe affected by the proposed consolidation of the provisions found in theexisting Part 1915, Subpart E, and the existing Part 1910, Subpart D, whichgovern ladders, stairways, and access and egress in shipyards. In recentyears, shipyards have not prospered as an industry. By way of illustration,there were about 305 shipyards operating in 1986 which is fewer than halfof the 687 shipyards active in 1982. Another illustration is that therewere orders for 69 merchant vessels (1.82 million tons) in U.S. shipyardsin 1980 but no new orders for merchant vessels since 1985. Although thislost business has been partially offset by the increase in the U.S. Navy'sdemands for ships, the decline in the demand for commercial ships willlikely generate a further decline in the number of active shipyards.Population-at-RiskOSHA has estimated that every shipyard employee will be affected by theprovisions in this proposed consolidation. The actual number of these employeeswill depend upon the level of shipyard work. For example, shipyards employed177,300 workers in 1980 and about 136,300 in 1986. Consequently, giventhe potential for large changes in the demand for this industry's product,OSHA has estimated that the population-at-risk would be between 136,300and 180,000 employees.Risk of Fatality or InjuryOSHA has estimated that the number of annual injuries in shipyards dueto accidents associated with access and egress (e.g., falls from ladders,falls down stairways, etc.) was between 1,165 and 1,875 between 1981 and1986. Of these injuries, 595 to 1,060 were lost workday injuries. As theaverage number of lost workdays per lost shipyard workday injury was between20.4 and 26, OSHA has estimated that the number of lost workdays in shipyardsdue to these accidents would be between 11,480 days and 21,815 days.In addition, OSHA has determined that there would be about one annual fatalityin shipyards associated with access and egress accidents.Feasibility, Benefits, and CostsOSHA has determined that this proposed standard would be technologicallyfeasible because it would permit the use of existing and readily availabletechnology and equipment.There are two potential sources of benefits from this proposed standard.The first source is the benefits that would accrue to those workers whoare at risk from current practices involving access and egress in shipyards.OSHA believes that the proposed consolidation of Parts 1910 and 1915 wouldlikely lead to an increase in future compliance levels because consolidatingtwo sets of access and egress requirements into one set would clarify therules. In addition, the proposal substitutes performance language for muchof the existing specification language. Consequently, it could make complianceless costly while maintaining employee safety. Thus, the consolidated proposalmay lead to an increase in compliance which, in turn, may lead to an increasein employee safety while using means of access and egress.The second source is the benefits and decreased costs that should accrueto those employers who would be allowed to use certain safety systems andequipment and follow certain work practices that are not allowed by theexisting specification requirements but would provide the same level ofemployee safety as that generated by the specifications. The use of theseequipment and practices would allow employers to maintain the necessarylevel of safety for their employees at less cost than is possible for complianceunder the existing standards.OSHA does not have any quantitative estimates of these potential benefitsand is requesting information and comments on this issue. As this is aPreliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment (PRIA), all comments will be carefullyanalyzed by OSHA for incorporation into the RIA for the final rule.The basis of the estimated costs of compliance with the proposed standardis the CONSAD report. In order to obtain this information, CONSAD circulatedcopies of the draft proposed standards to the two major industry tradeassociations and to individual shipbuilders. CONSAD then employed telephonequestionnaires and site visits to elicit information concerning the potentialeconomic impact of the provisions contained in the draft proposed consolidatedstandard. The information was used by CONSAD to develop its estimates ofthe costs of compliance and those costs have been adopted by OSHA as theexpected costs of compliance with the proposed standards.With respect to this proposed consolidation, CONSAD received no informationindicating that shipyards were not in substantial compliance with the existingstandards governing ladders, stairways, access, egress, etc. Thus, OSHAhas determined that there would be no costs of compliance with the proposedconsolidation because there have been no provisions which have been changedsubstantively. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, this is a preliminaryRIA and OSHA invites public comment concerning this determination. Anycomment received will be carefully analyzed by OSHA for incorporation intothe RIA for this final rule.Regulatory Flexibility CertificationPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Assistant Secretary has preliminarily certifiedthat the proposed standard would not have a significant impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities. OSHA invites public comment concerning this certification.The assessment is available for inspection and copying at the OSHA DocketOffice, Room N-3670, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.OSHA invites comments concerning the conclusions reached in both the PreliminaryRegulatory Impact Assessment and the Regulatory Flexibility Certification.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Finding of No Significant ImpactThis proposed rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality(CEQ) (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPAProcedures (29 CFR Part 11). As a result of this review, the AssistantSecretary for OSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significantenvironmental impact.The proposed revisions focus on the reduction of accidents or injuriesby means of work practices and procedures, and proper use and handlingof equipment, and training, as well as on changes in language, definition,and format of the standard. These revisions do not affect air, water, orsoil quality, plant or animal life, the use of the land, or other aspectsof the environment. As such, these revisions are therefore categorizedas excluded actions according to Subpart B, andSection; 11.10, of the DOLNEPA regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Recordkeeping</ITAG>This proposal contains no recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Public Participation</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and argumentswith respect to this proposal. The comments must be postmarked by February27, 1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No.S-044, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,Room N-2634, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.The data, views, and arguments that are submitted will be available forpublic inspection and copying at the above address. All timely submissionsreceived will be made a part of the record of this proceeding.Additionally, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 657) and29 CFR 1911.11, interested parties may file objections to the proposaland request an informal hearing. The objections and hearing requests shouldbe submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office at the address aboveand must comply with the following conditions:1. The objections and hearing requests must include the name and addressof the individual or organization making the objection or request;2. The objections and hearing requests must be postmarked by February 27,1989.3. The objections and hearing requests must specify with particularitythe provisions of the proposed rule to which each objection is taken orabout which the hearing request is made, and must state the grounds therefore;4. Each objection and hearing request must be separately stated and numbered;and5. The objections and hearing requests must be accompanied by a detailedsummary of the evidence proposed to be adduced at the requested hearing.Interested persons who have objections to various provisions or have changesto recommend may of course make these objections or recommendations intheir comments and OSHA will fully consider them. There is only need tofile formal ``objections'' separately if the interested person desiresto request an oral hearing.OSHA recognizes that there may also be interested persons who, throughtheir knowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved,would wish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHAwelcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent accident dataor cost information which may be available, in order that the record ofthis rulemaking will present a balanced picture of the public responseon the issues involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. State Plan Standards</ITAG>The 25 States and territories having OSHA-approved occupational safetyand health plans which cover the issues of maritime safety and health mustrevise their existing standard within six months of the publication dateof the final standard or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g.,because an existing State standard covering this area is already ``at leastas effective'' as the revised Federal standard. Currently five States (California,Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) with their own State planscover private sector on-shore maritime activities. Federal OSHA enforcesmaritime standards offshore in all States and provides onshore coverageof maritime activities in Federal OSHA States and in the following Stateplan States and territories: Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut\1\<NOTE/>, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada,New Mexico, New York\1\, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee,Utah, Virginia, Virgin Islands, and Wyoming.
