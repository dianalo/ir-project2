(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Multiservice PalandM;Broadband is the more complex and older of the two basic categories of LANs.andO;While baseband LANs, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, perform superbly overshorter distances or when only data needs to be transported, broadband LANsshine when large campus backbones must carry many types of transmissions.andM;With its roots in CATV, broadband is the oldest networking technology.andP;  Liketheir CATV cousins, the cable's bandwidth is divided into multiple channels,using a technique called frequency division multiplexing.andP;  Each channel hasits own frequency, and it operates independently of adjacent channels andtheir frequencies.andM;Because it uses many channels within one cable, one broadband cable can carrya combination of video, data, and voice.andP;  For example, one channel may carrydata for a closed-circuit TV security system, a second may support thetelephone system, a third may carry an Ethernet transmission, and a fourthmay run AppleTalk traffic.andP;  Or, one channel may be running NetWare andanother may run 3+Open.andP;  A maximum of 60 different transmissions on the samecable plant is possible.andM;Baseband networks are fundamentally different than broadband LANs.andP;  Abaseband LAN uses the cable's entire bandwidth to transmit a single signal.andO;Some solutions may give the appearance of multiple services in one cable.andO;For example, voice and data can both run on unshielded twisted-pair, yet theservices run in different pairs of the wire bundle.andP;  Baseband LANs tend to besmaller, more localized networks and useful in a wide range of environments.andO;They are typically used for office automation and departmental networking.andM;Broadband networks are installed when a corporation's needs become morecomplicated.andP;  It is used for larger, campus-wide installations.andP;  Its marketis specialized, focusing on factories, universities, hospitals, and theDepartment of Defense.andP;  Broadband's popularity, once high as a high-speedbackbone, has diminished somewhat with the development of fiber.andM;Broad AdvantagesandM;Broadband's multiservice support is its biggest advantage.andP;  With broadband, acorporation does not need separate cabling plants for its phone, security,and data systems.andP;  One cable plant for all these services is very beneficial.andO;A single-cable plant makes installation, troubleshooting, and managementsimpler.andP;  The telecom people, the video people, and the data people can learnhow to manage and troubleshoot one type of cable plant.andP;  Consolidation alsomakes matters easier in cable raceways.andM;Broadband is durable.andP;  Its methods and components have been tested over 40years.andP;  The components have a mean time between failure of 20 years and up.andO;As a contrast and manufactured, a Token Ring interface card won't last ageneration.andM;The shielding on broadband coaxial cable is especially pertinent to designersof factory LANs.andP;  In an office, it is not very difficult to keep the LANcables far away from the photocopier and the fluorescent lights, which arethe primary sources of electromagnetic interference.andP;  But isolating thesources of interference is more difficult on a factory or in a hospital,where much of the equipment emits signals.andM;Finally, another advantage of broadband is distance.andP;  A baseband Ethernetwithout repeaters cannot be longer than a half kilometer.andP;  With repeaters toregenerate and retime the signal, the distance is extended to 2.5 kilometers.andO;Over broadband coaxial, an Ethernet may reach 3.5 kilometers.andM;For all their flexibility, broadband networks are very complex and requireconstant attention.andP;  Technicians must continually adjust the many passive andactive components so that the network literally is not out of tune.andM;Broadband can be very expensive to maintain.andP;  But if the network carriesCATV, voice, and data, the expense may not seem so high.andP;  Compared withbaseband networks supporting the equivalent services, broadband can be muchcheaper.andM;Baseband networks are not as complicated as broadband networks.andP;  Basebandnetworks are limited by distance and the number designer conforms long as thenetwork designer conforms to manufacturer specifications, the network willfunction correctly.andP;  Broadband is a nexus of electrical components.andP;  Networkengineers must make hundreds or even thousands of calculations to gaugeproper signal levels.andP;  Few MIS departments have the experience or resourcesto perform such work.andP;  A third-party vendor is almost always required todesign, install, and maintain a broadband network.andM;Because a broadband network often supports a company's entire informationneeds, administrators need to ensure the network's robustness and integrity.andO;For example, if a cable break occurs in a baseband network, the company couldlost its information services but retain its telephone and security services.andO;With broadband, a company will lose all three services.andP;  Centralizingservices over a single-cable plant may be cost effective but the network isthe point of failure.andM;Broadband TopologyandM;Broadband networks use a tree topology (Figure 1).andP;  As one might expect, thetree's central cable is called a trunk.andP;  At the root of the tree is thecentral retransmission facility, more commonly called the headend.andP;  Feederand drop cables are interspersed along the trunk.andP;  Feeder cables provideconnection points for drop cables.andP;  Users' devices are attached to thenetwork via these drop cables and radio frequency modems.andP;  The modem is setat a particular frequency for transmitting and receiving data.andM;Linking the devices to the headend are a maze of passive and activecomponents.andP;  Active components such as amplifiers require power; passivecomponents do not.andP;  Passive components include taps, splitters, directionalcouplers, and coaxial cable.andM;Taps connect the drop cable to the bus and feeder cables.andP;  Splitters anddirectional couplers divide the signal between two cable paths.andP;  Splittersdivide the signal equally, directional couplers divide the power unequally.andO;Directional couplers are &quot;directional&quot; because signals can not go between thethough-output leg and the down leg, although they are permitted to travelbetween the input and down leg.andM;The cable is passive.andP;  Coaxial cable is used because of its capacity.andO;Typically, the trunk is 0.750 semirigid cable, meaning its diameter is 0.75inches.andP;  The feeders are 0.500-inch diameter,andM;semirigid, aluminum cable.andP;   The dropsandM;are small, RG-6, 75-ohm cables.andM;Cables that burn easily must be run through conduits.andP;  Conduits are hollowtubing, like plumbing, to carry cabling.andP;  The 0.750 and 0.500 cables have ametal outer jacket.andP;  Since metal does not burn easily, a conduit is notrequired.andP;  Even for underground installations, conduits are not needed if anarmored or flooded-armored cable is used.andP;  In these instances, a cable withan integral flooding compound is used to keep moisture out.andP;  Cable runoutdoors or in other in harsh environments is coated with a blackpolyethylene jacket.andM;How Broadband WorksandM;Unlike baseband networks, broadband networks transmit analog signals.andP;  Aradio frequency modem converts the computer's digital signals to thebroadband's analog signals.andM;The two types of radio frequency modems are fixed frequency and frequencyagile.andP;  At the factory, fixed frequency modems are set at a specificfrequency.andP;  They are usually used in point-to-point communications.andP;  Forexample, a fixed frequency modem is often used for terminal-to-hostcommunications or to send jobs to a printer.andP;  With fixed frequency modems,only one device transmits at the particular frequency.andP;  New hardware isrequired to change the frequency, which is usually done at the manufacturer'sfactory.andM;Frequency agile modems enable the user to switch between several frequencies.andO;This change can be manual or automatic.andP;  When automatic, a device similar toa Private Branch eXchange (PBX) is used.andP;  As an intelligent switch, it pollsdevices or checks requests to determine which frequencies are available.andP;  Ifa frequency is available, the switch notifies the computer.andP;  If it is notavailable, the user receives a busy signal.andM;Two paths are required to connect a user's device to the headend.andP;  Theupstream or return path carries the transmission from the user's device tothe headend.andP;  The downstream or forward path carries the transmission fromthe headend to the device.andP;  Whether these paths are virtual or physicaldepends on whether the broadband system uses a single- or dual-cable system.andM;In dual-cable networks, each cable is dedicated to a specific path.andP;  Whenrunning dual cables, the headend moves the data from one cable to another.andO;Because the transmissions are contained in two cables, the transmissionfrequencies used on the forward and return paths are the same.andM;A single-cable network is more complicated.andP;  It simulates a dual-cable systemby dividing the single cable's bandwidth into forward and return paths.andO;Separating the forward and return paths is a guard band.andP;  The guard bandprevents signals traveling on either side from interfering with each other.andM;The two paths are connected at the headend.andP;  As data approaches from theinbound path, the headend modulates the data; the headend changes theincoming signals's frequency to that of the outbound path.andP;  The signal issent to the destination device.andM;The bandwidth of a single-cable system can be divided three ways.andP;  Eachmethod results in a different number of forward and return paths, and areapplicable for different purposes.andP;  Some transmissions, for example CATV,require only a transmit path.andP;  Data and voice, however, require transmit andreceive paths.andM;The three methods of the bandwidth are high split, midsplit, and subsplit.andO;High split sets 29 return channels and 30-40 forward channels.andP;  Midsplit sets17 return channels and 38-46 forward channels.andP;  Subsplit sets four returnchannels and 40-55 forward channels.andP;  High split and midsplit are commonlyused for applications calling for data transmissions.andM;When a device transmits, the computer's digital signal is converted toanalog, then the signal is modulated to the proper frequency.andP;  The data isencoded and placed on the carrier wave, which is the wave of a frequency.andM;The signal travels along the inbound path to the headend.andP;  If it is adual-cable system, the headend moves the data from the inbound to theoutbound path.andP;  If a single-cable system is used, the headend alters thetransmission frequency to that of the outbound path.andP;  In either case, thesignals travels to the destination device where it is demodulated intodigital form.andP;  The user has now received the transmitted data.andM;The advantage of a single-cable system is the initial financial savings.andO;However, because single-cable systems divide their bandwidth, they supportonly half the channels that a dual-cable systems does.andP;  A single-cable systemmay seem to provide more bandwidth than your application will ever need, butif full-motion video or electronic imaging are in your plans, think again.andO;These applications need a lot of bandwidth.andP;  In the long run, a dual-cablesystem with its expanded bandwidth may be more cost-effective than asingle-cable network.andM;Broadband networks are malleable.andP;  They can carry many services over a longdistance.andP;  But they are not easy to design and maintain.andP;  All passivecomponents--including coaxial cables, splitters, taps, and connectors--haveinsertion losses that must be considered in system design.andP;  Each componentreduces the communications signals's strength as it moves through thenetwork.andP;  The amount each component depletes is constant and can be accountedfor in the network design.andP;  Accounting for this signal loss and placingamplifiers to compensate for the loss is a key in the design process.andM;Signal loss can be subdivided into cable loss (caused by cable) and flat loss(caused by the other passive components).andP;  The amount of cable loss dependson the frequency.andP;  Regardless of the length of coax, the loss will not beequal over a range of frequencies.andP;  For example, the cable signal loss at 175MHz is 6.8 times greater than at 5 MHz.andP;  Or, at 450 MHz, the cable signalloss is 1.474 times greater than at 216 MHz.andP;  The overall cable loss dependson cable lengths and diameter and the dielectric material used in the cable.andM;The interplay between passive and active devices is governed by the unitygain principle (Figure 2).andP;  Unity gain stipulates that the input signal levelto each amplifier must equal the signal level produced by the previousamplifier less the signal loss.andM;In this way, unity gain ensures that the signal level remains constantthroughout the system.andP;  For example, if an amplifier has 25 dB of usablegain, a cable segment can be designed with a maximum loss of 25 dB at thehighest usable frequency.andP;  Since the lower frequency will have lower loss,resulting in a higher signal level input to the amplifier, an equalizer mustbe selected to impose the same loss at the lowest frequency band edge.andM;The reverse amplifier path uses a different unity gain principle.andP;  Its outputis pretilted to overcome the next reverse direction cable and componentlosses so that all reverse signals arrive at the next reverse amplifier inputor headend at a predetermined level and are &quot;flat&quot; across the bandpath.andM;If the amplifiers exceed the design cascade or if the amplifier is set toohigh, problems occur.andP;  Cross modulation, for example, occurs when a carrier'sdistortion is imposed on another.andP;  The two signals bleed together and distorteach other.andM;Similarly, crosstalk occurs when one signal picks up the signal from anadjoining frequency.andP;  Unlike cross modulation where the signals are modulatedtogether, crosstalk mirrors the other's frequency.andM;Another problem caused by inaccurate setting of the amplifier's level iscompression.andP;  Compression occurs when a one dB increase in input signal doesnot produce a one dB increase in output signal.andM;Ingress is also problematic.andP;  When electromagnetic radio waves are picked upfrom the surrounding environment and radiated onto the network, ingressoccurs.andP;  Ingress should not occur if the cable is installed correctly.andP;  Ifthe cable is loose or not terminated properly, it acts as an antenna andreceives signals from the surrounding environment.andM;Jabbering modems are another headache for administrators.andP;  A modem can failand transmit randomly onto the network.andP;  A jabbering modem can bring downthat channel.andM;Because broadband is complex, there are several cable design packagesavailable that can save the network engineer from performing laboriouscalculations.andP;  Cable design software is a series of databases.andP;  A componentdatabase holds each component's manufacturer, price, type, model number, andelectronic specifications.andP;  most packages contain preliminary data for themajor broadband component manufacturers, so the network engineer doesn't haveto enter this data.andP;  The user can modify the data as well.andP;  For specificdevices, the user modifies the data.andM;The LAN is constructed by choosing items from this list.andP;  The selectedcomponents are then stored in a LAN-configuration database.andP;  The rules ofconstructing a broadband LAN are consulted twice.andP;  First, a design engineruns a preliminary signal analysis on the database, then a full-rule checkerinspects the network for compliance with the specifications.andM;The electronic specification is extremely important.andP;  Many broadband designsoftware packages specify within a range, rather than exact numbers.andP;  It isbest if network designers customize this range based on their experiences andknowledge.andM;George Livergood, president of Lambda Communications, a consulting firm inBelle Canyon, Calif.andP;  notes, &quot;Some tap manufacturers publish a maximum andnominal insertion loss with an error factor ranging from +/- 0.1 dB to +/-0.5 dB.&quot;andP;  The design engineer has seven values from which to choose.andP;  Withoutartificial intelligence, natural intelligence and experience are invaluable.andO;It is better to use actual field measurements for this data than to randomlychoose a number, advises Livergood.andM;Managing BroadbandandM;Although a variety of tools can be used to maintain and troubleshoot abroadband LAN, none is as important as the status monitor.andP;  A status monitoris a central observation point for the network.andP;  Devices scattered across thesystem report to the status monitor.andP;  The status monitor, in turn, reportsits findings to the network administrator.andP;  Status monitors are expensive andcomplex but are critical to the success of broadband networks.andM;A status monitor is a group of components that work together to provide acomprehensive picture of the broadband cabling.andP;  usually made up of amicrocomputer, a master modem, and remote reporting devices, the statusmonitor detects and locates problems before they seriously affectperformance.andM;The remote devices, called transponders or pilot devices, are the workhorsesof the status monitor.andP;  They gather statistics about forward and return radiofrequency levels, the temperature of the components, the current levels onthe trunk and return cables, radio frequency carrier level accuracy, and thestatus of the standby power supply.andP;  The standby power supply's status isespecially important, since the additional power is often available for only10-12 minutes.andM;The transponders are placed at drop points, in amplifiers and back-up powersupplies spliced into the wire, and at device interfaces.andP;  Periodically themaster modem, sitting in the headend, queries the transponders for theirdata.andP;  When the transponders receive the signal, they send the informationalong the return path to the modem, where the information is stored in adatabase.andM;Without a status monitor, network managers must wait for problems to arise.andO;They would not have a central location from which to troubleshoot the system.andO;A status monitor catches the problems before they are catastrophes.andP;  If anamplifier is placed in a nonventilated closet, for example, the heat itgenerates cannot escape.andP;  Its signal level will diminish, and the devicesrelying on the amplifier will be affected.andP;  With the transponders in place,an alarm notifying the operator will be sounded.andP;  The operator redirectstransmission flow and can remedy the problem without a lapse in service.andO;Such proactive management is only now finding its way into baseband networks,but it has been commonplace for broadband for years.andM;Broadband EthernetandM;Since Ethernet is one of the first and most popular access methods, it is notsurprising to find a version of Ethernet for broadband cabling.andP;  The IEEE802.3 10Broad36 standard calls for 10M-bits-per-second transmission overbroadband cabling with a maximum distance without repeaters of 3.5kilometers.andP;  This distance is a significant improvement over baseband'smaximum of 2.5 kilometers.andP;  The improvement is largely due to the attenuationand distortion encountered with baseband cabling.andP;  Broadband is not facedwith those problems, so it is only limited by the maximum distanceestablished by the standard.andM;Although baseband and broadband use the same CSMA/CD access method, theimplementations differ.andP;  On baseband, data is sent over alternating current(AC).andP;  A single transmission also uses a certain amount of direct current(DC).andP;  Collisions are detected by sensing the DC levels.andP;  When atransmission's DC level is exceeded, a collision is occurring.andM;Since it uses analog transmission, not digital, a broadband Ethernet cannotrely on the DC voltage level.andP;  It devotes a 4 MHz band of its 18 MHz channelto detecting collisions.andP;  The remaining 14 MHz is for transmitting data.andO;When a station detects a collision, it notifies all stations by signaling inthe collision enforcement channel.andM;Collisions can be detected on broadband in three ways.andP;  The broadband packetstarts with a short preamble followed by a series signaling the end of thepreamble called the Unscramble Mode Delimiter (UMD).andP;  After the UMD, the datais transmitted.andP;  When a packet is sent, the modem stores the first 1,450 bitsfollowing the packet's UMD.andP;  It then compares the stored bits with the first140 bits following the UMD on the received packet.andP;  If there is adiscrepancy, a collision has occurred.andM;The second detection method is a special case of bit comparison called UMDtimeout.andP;  With UMD timeout, a collision is assumed if an UMD is not detectedafter 34 bits.andP;  The last instance is when a modem receives a packet while thecomputer is sending a packet to the modem.andP;  Any packet has 75 bits of delaybefore the modem notifies the computer of the packet reception.andP;  This delayis due to the stripping away of preamble bits necessary for the broadbandnetwork.andP;  The computer can begin transmitting as the modem receives thepacket.andM;After a collision is detected, the modem immediately signals collisionenforcement onto the medium to guarantee every broadband device senses thecollision.andP;  Every modem senses collision on the medium and signals to itsattaching controller that a collision has occurred.andP;  The collidingcontrollers respond by terminating their transmissions and rescheduling themfor later.andM;Broadband's biggest competitor is fiber optics.andP;  Fiber optics offers foursignificant advantages over broadband cabling.andP;  One advantage is noiseimmunity.andP;  Broadband cabling requires heavy shielding to prevent it fromfalling prey to electromagnetic interference.andP;  Fiber, however, is inherentlyimmune to electrical noise, and consequently, it does not require shielding.andO;Partially because of the lack of shielding, fiber optic cables are smallerthan coaxial; this is important for those cable raceways that are filled.andM;Fiber is more secure.andP;  On a copperbased cable, signals radiate beyond thecabling, making it easy to listen in without being caught.andP;  The cable neveris penetrated, making detection nearly impossible.andP;  Light, however, does notemit signals.andP;  Snoopers must cut the cable and tap into the signal, causingthe light level to fluctuate.andP;  A light meter monitoring the system can detectintrusion and notify the administrator.andM;The third advantage is signal distance.andP;  As mentioned, broadband increases anEthernet network to 3.5 kilometers.andP;  With fiber, the maximum distance isextended to 4.5 kilometers.andP;  Token Ring is increased from 100 meters to fourkilometers.andM;Bandwidth is another advantage.andP;  Coaxial cabling measures its bandwidth inmegahertz.andP;  Fiber measures its bandwidth in gigahertz.andP;  It can supporthigh-speed transmissions of massive amounts of data.andP;  FDDI will define speedsof 100M bits-per-second.andP;  Coaxial does not come close.andM;Broadband's primary advantage over fiber is its multiservice support.andP;  Whilefiber may count bandwidth in gigabytes, only a fraction of that is availablefor transmitting user data.andP;  The LEDs emit and receive the light used forpassing signals along the fiber optic cabling.andP;  Unfortunately, thewave-lengths of the currently used diodes are not continual if they were,frequency division multiplexing could be carried out and fiber could carrymore than one type of transmission in the same cable, the way broadband does.andM;Research for performing frequency division multiplexing over fiber hasachieved moderate success.andP;  Five video channels can run concurrently over onepair of multimode fiber.andP;  ATandamp;T (Morristown, N.J.) and Anixter (Skokie, Ill.)andO;claim their solutions can run up to 30 channels on single-mode fiber.andM;How long it will take fiber to replace broadband remains to be seen.andP;  Fiberis costly and many LAN installers are unfamiliar with it.andP;  Acquiring theexpertise is not difficult, but it is yet another thing LAN installers mustlearn.andP;  More installers are comfortable with broadband, on the other hand.andM;Broadband will have place in the market, but its share will diminish.andP;  &quot;Atone time, broadband commanded 40 percent of new installations,&quot; says DonPisarcik, vice president of business development for Allied DataCommunications Group (Atlanta, Ga.).andP;  &quot;Today that figure is certainly under20 percent.andP;  It will probably end up between eight and 10 percent of newinstallations.andP;  Over the past three years, broadband has gone fromconstituting 80 percent of our business to 25 percent.andP;  The remaining 75percent is fiber and twisted pair.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
