Background</ITAG>On September 25, 1981 (see 46 FR 47426), EPA issued an interim final rulethat conditionally exempted from the Subtitle C hazardous waste regulationsany waste samples collected solely for the purpose of monitoring or testingto determine their characteristics or composition. These regulations includethe generator and transporter requirements of Parts 262 and 263 and thetreatment, storage, and permitting requirements of Parts 264, 265, and270. In particular, the regulations exempt waste samples from the SubtitleC requirements when: (1) The sample is being transported to the laboratoryfor testing or is being transported back to the sample collector afterthe testing; (2) the sample is being stored by the sample collector orlaboratory before testing or after testing prior to its return to the generator;(3) the sample is being analyzed to determine its characteristics or composition;or (4) the sample is being stored at the laboratory for a specific purposesuch as a court case or enforcement action. However, samples subject tothe exemption must still comply with U.S. Department of Transportation(DOT), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), or other applicable shipping requirements.The sample must be packaged so that it does not leak, spill, or vaporizefrom its packaging.The Agency granted this exclusion because of the <T3> de minimis </T3>public health and environmental risks involved. Inparticular, the Agency found that certain incentives already existed thatwould assure protection of human health and the environment without requiringthese samples to be subject to the full set of Resource Conservation andRecovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. These incentives include(1) the costs associated with sample collection, shipping, analysis, andstorage; (2) the generator's need to obtain results of analyses to determineif and how they must comply with the RCRA hazardous waste requirements;and (3) the considerable likelihood that a testing laboratory would returnthe sample to the generator as part of a contractual agreement (partlybased on the generator's desire to protect proprietary information andpartly based on the testing laboratory's desire to avoid the costs of disposal),reducing the concern that the sample would be indiscriminately disposed.The preamble stated that the exclusion did not cover large-size samplesthat are used in treatability or other testing at pilot scale or experimentalfacilities. However, the preamble did not specify whether the exclusionapplied to small- or bench-scale treatability studies at laboratories orother testing facilities. Today's final rule directly addresses this issue.The preamble of the 1981 interim final rule also stated that the Agencyhad considered and rejected a quantity limit for the samples subject tothe exclusion. Its basis for this was that the available information indicatedthat the size of samples shipped for characterization or analytical purposesusually did not exceed 1 gallon. Therefore, the Agency saw no need to seta specific quantity limit. However, the preamble also stated that EPA wouldconsider imposing a limit on sample size if comments or experience indicatedthat such a limit was necessary (46 FR 47427).While the comments received on the 1981 interim final rule generally supportedthe exclusion for samples shipped for waste characterization, a large percentageof commenters also recommended that the sample exclusion provision be expandedto include waste samples used in treatability studies, including large-sizesamples used in pilot-scale units or at experimental facilities.Furthermore, on June 2, 1987, the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC)submitted a rulemaking petition requesting that the Agency promulgate regulationsto provide limited exemptions from the permitting requirements of RCRAto facilities conducting treatability studies. The petition proposed athree-part solution: (1) Expand the sample exclusion provision to allowtreatability tests to be conditionally exempted from regulation; (2) expandthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act(CERCLA) permits exclusion at 40 CFR 300.68(a)(3) to include off-site treatabilitytesting when performed at the direction of an EPA or State on-scene coordinatorto implement a response consistent with CERCLA section 121; and (3) issueinterim guidance to implement, at least in part, the suggested changesdescribed in (1) and (2) above (<T3>i.e.,</T3> interpret the existing sample exclusion in 40 CFR 261.4(d)to include treatability studies, and issue interim guidance to on-scenecoordinators regarding off-site treatability studies). The petition proposedseveral limitations for small-scale treatability studies. The petitionalso recommended regulatory changes that would allow large-scale treatabilitystudies to be conducted provided that the facility complies with the manifestingrequirements and certain interim status standards. (See section II.C.,Limitations, discussed below.)The petition asserted that immediate regulatory relief was needed becausethe present RCRA Subtitle C permitting requirements unnecessarily interferewith the experimentation and research necessary to evaluate the varioustreatment options for CERCLA cleanup activities. HWTC further argued thatthese same problems will have a similar effect on RCRA corrective action.Agency experience with the Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE)program and CERCLA cleanup actions support the HWTC's assertion.Based on these factors (<T3>i.e.,</T3> comments on the sample exclusion interim final rule, theHWTC petition, and EPA's own experience), EPA published a Notice of DataAvailability and Request for Comment on September 18, 1987 (50 FR 35279).The Notice reopened the comment period on the earlier interim final ruleand specifically asked whether EPA should expand the sample exclusion provisionin 40 CFR 261.4(d) to include waste samples used in small-scale treatabilitystudies. The Notice also presented information and requested comment concerningthe appropriate limitations that could be imposed if the sample exclusionprovision were expanded.Almost all commenters to the notice recommended that the Agency expandthe sample exclusion provision to include waste samples used in small-scaletreatability studies. The commenters generally agreed that the Agency couldpromulgate such an exclusion and allow meaningful studies to be conductedbecause of the <T3>de minimis</T3> risk to human health and the environment. However,a number of commenters argued that the limitations discussed in the Noticewere overly stringent and suggested that higher limitations be allowed.Based on the Agency's own experience and the comments received, EPA istoday issuing a final rule that conditionally exempts waste samples usedin small-scale treatability studies from regulation under Subtitle C ofRCRA. The Agency will address the second part of HWTC's petition concerninglarger scale studies at a later date. The remainder of the preamble discussesthe major comments received on the Notice of Data Availability and EPA'sresponse to them. All other comments, both from the Notice of Data Availabilityand to the original interim final rule, are discussed in a background documentthat is available in the docket to this rulemaking. (See EPA RCRA docketaddress in preceding section.)<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Major Issues</ITAG>A. IntroductionA total of 40 comments were received in response to the Notice of DataAvailability. The commenters in general agreed with HWTC that the Agencyshould expand the sample exclusion provision to apply to waste samplesused in small-scale treatability studies. However, there was a wide rangeof opinion as to the scope of activities that should be allowed under theexemption and the appropriate limitations that the Agency should impose.Before discussing these, however, it is appropriate to discuss the needand rationale for today's rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG><T3>Need and Rationale for Today's Rulemaking</T3>In the Agency's experience, permitting requirements for offsite treatabilitystudies have resulted in delays in evaluating remediation alternativesfor both CERCLA site clean-ups and the RCRA corrective action program.Additionally, the current and upcoming Land Disposal Restrictions Programis another factor arguing strongly for a need to develop alternative treatmenttechnologies.The overriding objective of Congress in the 1984 RCRA Amendments_to reduceland disposal of hazardous wastes_has already resulted both in heavy demandsfor existing treatment technologies and in increased urgency for developingnew and better treatment methods as an alternative to the land disposalof hazardous waste. In addition, developing techniques to minimize thegeneration of hazardous waste, and to promote recycling and reuse of waste,are all important Agency goals and Congressional mandates. EPA is committedto facilitating research and development activities that will help meetthese objectives.The Agency believes the current regulatory framework that sets forth RCRApermitting requirements for Subtitle C facilities is unnecessarily stringentfor regulating certain activities, <T3>e.g.</T3>, small-scale treatability studies. As noted above, commentsin 1981 suggested a need to extend the sample exclusion provision to treatabilitystudies because of the low risk and the large benefits of conducting thesestudies if RCRA permits were not required.The HWTC petition summarizes this position on behalf of many facilitiesthat conduct treatability studies as part of their research activities.In addition, HWTC stressed that the development of new treatment capacity,needed to meet the demands placed on industry as the land disposal restrictionstake effect, is not facilitated by the current regulations. The potentiallack of treatment capacity, using either new or improved existing technologies,means that EPA may have to issue additional variances to the land disposalrestrictions, posing an increased threat of ground water and surface watercontamination.Maintaining unnecessary regulatory barriers to conducting treatabilitystudies is, therefore, contrary to the Agency's implementation of the mandatedland disposal restrictions. Furthermore, these regulatory barriers sendthe wrong message to the regulated community. The Agency intends to promote,not defeat, research and development in support of the national objectivesto reduce land disposal of hazardous wastes and to increase reliance onwaste minimization and treatment technologies that reduce risk to humanhealth and the environment. However, the Agency remains pledged to carryout its primary statutory obligation to ensure that removing regulatorybarriers does not result in unwarranted or increased risks to human healthand the environment. The Agency has determined that this balance can beproperly maintained in promulgating a RCRA exemption for small scale treatabilitystudies.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Determination of De Minimis Risk</T3>Since Congress passed RCRA in 1976, the Agency has developed and implementeda ``cradle to grave'' program to protect human health and the environmentfrom the improper management of hazardous wastes. A principal purpose ofthe RCRA hazardous waste regulations is to ensure that hazardous wastesare safely transported to facilities properly designed and operated tomanage these wastes in a manner that will minimize the threat to humanhealth and the environment. Hazardous waste generators, transporters, andowners and operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs)each have specific responsibilities for properly managing those wastesdefined as hazardous.The Agency believes that it can exempt hazardous waste that is used insmall-scale treatability studies from the RCRA hazardous waste regulationsbecause a number of factors will combine to ensure that the risks to humanhealth and the environment are <T3>de minimis.</T3> These factors include: (1) A limitation on the sizeof the sample that is exempted; (2) the high cost of collecting and shippingthe sample; (3) a limitation on the quantity of waste that can be shippedat any one time; (4) the applicability of the Department of Transportation(DOT), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), or other regulations governing the transportationof hazardous materials; (5) a limitation on the amount of hazardous wastethat can be stored at a laboratory or testing facility; (6) a limitationon the amount of hazardous waste that may be processed (<T3>i.e.,</T3> tested in a treatability unit) in any one day; (7) the prohibitivecosts involved in conducting legitimate treatability studies as an alternativeto commercial treatment and disposal; (8) a limitation on the time thata waste sample used in a treatability study or any residues generated fromsuch studies may remain at the laboratory or testing facility without beingsubject to the hazardous waste regulations; (9) the RCRA requirement thatany unused sample and residues from a treatability study must still bemanaged as a hazardous waste (if, in fact, it is still hazardous); and(10) certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements that will enablethe Agency to conduct inspections and bring enforcement actions againstpersons who abuse this exemption. In addition, regulations and requirementsadministered by other Federal agencies such as the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration (OSHA) also ensure proper management.The Agency believes that all the above factors contribute to an argumentfor <T3>de minimis </T3>risk. Some factors, such as the sample size, shipmentsize, transportation standards, and storage limitations, directly relateto the <T3>de minimis </T3>risk in each phase of the treatability study process.Other factors such as the recordkeeping and reporting requirements andthe one-time 1000 kg per waste stream limitation ensure that treatmentand disposal of hazardous waste do not occur under the guise of conductingtreatability studies.More specifically, under the conditional exemption being promulgated today,the generator or sample collector may not ship more than one of the followingin any single shipment: (1) 1000 kg of non-acute hazardous waste; (2) 1kg of acute hazardous waste (see 40 CFR 261.33(e)); or (3) 250 kg of acutehazardous waste that is contained in contaminated soils, water, or someother contaminated medium. Since the shipments remain subject to DOT, USPS,or other applicable shipping regulations, they must be packaged and labeledin the same manner as other shipments of hazardous materials. One differenceis that these waste samples will not require a manifest. EPA believes thata manifest is not required in this situation, since the generator is spendinglarge sums of money to obtain the results of a treatability study. Thus,it is highly unlikely that the sample would be indiscriminately disposed.Furthermore, the generator or sample collector is likely to have a contractualarrangement with the laboratory or testing facility conducting the treatabilitystudy either to have the facility return any unused sample and/or any residuesthat are generated from the treatability study for subsequent manifestingand shipment to a designated facility (see 40 CFR 260.10) or recyclingfacility or to have the laboratory or testing facility directly manifestand ship the wastes to an appropriate designated facility within specifiedtime limits. Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of this termin today's preamble and rule does not imply that the facility is requiredto be permitted or to have interim status. The generator must also maintaincopies of the shipping papers and the contract with the testing facilityfor a period ending 3 years from the completion date of the study.The operator of a vehicle transporting waste samples is still requiredto comply with the applicable DOT requirements, including notificationof the National Response Center in the event of a hazardous material spillof more than a reportable quantity and initiation of cleanup measures inaccordance with 49 CFR 171.15.Owners and operators of a laboratory or testing facility conducting suchtreatability studies must comply with the limitations regarding shipment,storage, treatment rate, and disposition of unused sample and residuesafter completion of the studies. The overall limitations on storage andtreatment rates, discussed later in today's preamble, are sufficientlyrestrictive to compel a laboratory or testing facility to carefully coordinatethe size and timing of treatability sample shipments. The owners and operatorsof these laboratories or testing facilities must also comply with applicableregulations promulgated by OSHA.Further business and financial incentives compelling a laboratory or testingfacility to properly handle these samples include the cost-intensive natureof conducting treatability studies, the need to provide the client withdocumented test results, the desire of the laboratory or testing facilityto maintain its corporate reputation, and the desire to avoid any liability.After the treatability study is completed, the owners or operators of alaboratory or testing facility must either return the unused sample andresidues to the generator or manifest and ship them to a RCRA designatedfacility (if the material is a RCRA hazardous waste) within the time limitationsspecified. A laboratory or testing facility not operating within theselimitations must comply with the appropriate RCRA requirements.Finally, the Agency is stipulating recordkeeping and reporting requirementsthat will document compliance with the limitations and will allow the Agencyto take enforcement action against persons who attempt to abuse the exemption.The specific reporting and recordkeeping requirements are discussed laterin today's preamble.B. Scope of the Exemption<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definition of Treatability Study</ITAG>In the Notice of Data Availability, the Agency included a definition of``treatability study'' similar to that proposed by HWTC. According to thisdefinition, a treatability study is one in which a relatively small amountof hazardous waste is subjected to a known treatment process to determinethe following: (1) Whether the waste is amenable to a treatment process;(2) what pretreatment (if any) is required; (3) the optimal process conditionsneeded to achieve the desired treatment; (4) the efficiency of the treatmentprocess; or (5) the characteristics and volume of residuals from a particulartreatment process. (See 52 <T3>FR </T3>35280.)The commenters generally agreed with the definition of treatability study.However, many commenters expressed concern that the use of the term ``knowntreatment process'' was overly restrictive and might hinder the developmentof innovative technologies. Thus, these commenters recommended that theword ``known'' be deleted from the definition in the final rule. HWTC'sproposed regulatory language did not include a restriction to ``known''technologies.  The Agency agrees with these commenters. As stated earlier, it is importantto promote the development of treatment technologies that will reduce theland disposal of hazardous waste and increase the reliance on waste minimizationand treatment technologies that reduce risk to human health and the environment.In so doing, EPA does not want to restrict industry to the technologiesthat are already established or ``known''; rather, it wants to promotethe development of innovative technologies. Therefore, the Agency has modifiedthe definition of ``treatability study'' accordingly. At the same time,it is concerned that the treatability study sample exemption may be improperlyused as a means to avoid regulation when regulation is warranted. To preventthis, EPA has included specific language in the definition of treatabilitystudy to guard against such abuse. This language makes it clear that theexemption is for the evaluation of a treatment process and is not to beused for commercial treatment or disposal of hazardous waste. Furthermore,the Agency emphasizes that the definition of treatability studies coveredunder the exemption does not apply where the practice could result in asignificant uncontrolled release of hazardous constituents to the environment.It would, therefore, include neither open burning nor any type of treatmentinvolving placement of a hazardous waste on the land (<T3>e.g., </T3>in situ stabilization).  Several commenters also suggested that the Agency list, in the rule, thetypes of treatment studies to be included in the final definition. Althoughthe Agency can see some merit in this suggestion, it has decided not toincorporate a specific list into the regulations. EPA believes that sucha list could hinder the development of innovative technologies. For example,if it included a list in the rule, the Agency would be required to go throughrulemaking before new or innovative treatment technologies would get thebenefit of the treatability exemption. As previously discussed, the Agencybelieves that as long as the limitations imposed in today's rule are met,any treatability study will pose a <T3>de minimis </T3>risk. Examples of the types of treatability studiesincluded in the exemption are physical/chemical/biological treatment, thermaltreatment (incineration, pyrolysis, oxidation, combustion) solidification,sludge dewatering, volume reduction, toxicity reduction, and recyclingfeasibility.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Inclusion of Liner Compatibility and Other Studies  </ITAG>In the Notice of Data Availability, the Agency solicited comment as towhether the exemption should include other waste testing studies, suchas liner compatibility studies. Many commenters agreed that the exemptionshould be expanded to include other types of studies. The commenters arguedthat, in addition to liner compatibility studies, the exemption shouldalso include studies of corrosion, toxicological and health effects, andother material compatibility studies (<T3>e.g. </T3>pumps and personal protective equipment). While such studiesare not strictly treatability studies under the proposed definition, thecommenters argued that waste testing is necessary to develop improved hazardouswaste management technologies.  The Agency agrees with the commenters that such studies, although not strictlytreatability studies, are necessary for the further development of hazardouswaste management technologies. Furthermore, the Agency believes that suchstudies can be conducted using small quantities of hazardous waste underlaboratory conditions. Also, these types of studies are subject to thesame financial and business incentives for safe handling as are treatabilitystudies. Therefore, with the imposition of the limitations in this finalrule, these studies will involve only <T3>de </T3><T3>minimis </T3>risk and need not be subject to RCRA permitting regulations.The Agency is, therefore, allowing the following types of studies to beconducted and exempted under the hazardous waste regulations: liner compatibilitystudies, corrosion studies, toxicological and health effects studies, andother material compatibility studies (<T3>e.g., </T3>relating to leachate collection systems, geotextile materials,other land disposal unit requirements, pumps and personal protective equipment).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Effects on Exporters of Hazardous Waste</ITAG>EPA, in today's rule, is exempting samples sent for treatability studiesfrom Subtitle C requirements. These include the requirement to notify EPAprior to export of hazardous waste (40 CFR 262.50 <T3>et seq</T3>.). At the time export requirements were promulgated, EPAdiscussed in the preamble its rationale for allowing the export, withoutnotification, of wastes exempt from manifesting requirements (51 FR 28664,August 8, 1986). In this discussion on export notification requirements,EPA specifically focussed on the sample exemption in 40 CFR 261.4(d).The rule promulgated today expands the scope of this exemption as contemplatedin 1986. For the same reasons discussed in the August 8, 1986, rule relatingto andSection; 261.4(d) samples (51 FR 28664 <T3>et seq</T3>.), exporters of treatability study samples who comply withthe limitations of today's rule are also exempt from the export notificationrequirements of Subpart E of Part 262.While the Agency is exempting these treatability study samples from theexport notification requirements at this time, the Agency is revisitingthe question as to whether it should exclude unmanifested waste from theexport notification requirements and may modify its position in the future.C. LimitationsIn the Notice of Data Availability, the Agency requested specific commenton what types of limitations should be placed on the exemption if it wereto be expanded to include treatability studies. In addition, EPA specificallyrequested comment on the limitations suggested by the HWTC in its petition.The HWTC suggested quantity limits for shipping, storage, and treatmentof hazardous waste samples for the purpose of conducting a treatabilitystudy. In particular, the Notice suggested the following limits: (1) Noshipment may exceed 250 kg; (2) no more than 1000 kg of exempted waste(including residues derived from the treatability study) may be presentat the laboratory or testing facility conducting the treatability studyat any one time; and (3) no more than 250 kg of exempted waste may be introducedinto the treatability study in any one day.A wide range of opinions concerned appropriate limitations that would providefor meaningful treatability studies. While most commenters believed thatthe limitations they suggested were necessary to conduct treatability studies,no commenters provided data indicating that their suggested limits wereprotective of human health and the environment. The following indicatesthe range of quantity limits proposed by commenters for shipment, treatment,and storage:<ITAG tagnum="16">Shipment:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">mean quantity: 554 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">standard deviation: 794 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">range: 250 to 4000 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">most frequently cited suggestion: 250 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Treatment:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">mean: 448 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">standard deviation: 417 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">range: 250 to 2000 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">most frequently cited suggestion: 250 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Storage:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">mean: 2000 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">standard deviation: 2285 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">range: 250 to 10,000 kg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">most frequently cited suggestion: 1000 kg</ITAG>Many commenters were supportive of the limitations suggested by HWTC inits petition. However, some commenters argued that the limitations suggestedin the notice were not sufficient; although these commenters provided nodata suggesting that their limits were protective of human health and theenvironment, they maintained that larger quantities of waste sample werenecessary to conduct treatability studies. In particular, some commentersargued that the storage limitations were unnecessarily restrictive. Additionally,some commenters urged that a higher treatability study limit was necessaryas some of the treatability tests required quantities of waste in excessof 1000 kg. Finally, some commenters recommended that the Agency includea mechanism for approval of case-by-case variances from the HWTC quantitylimitations or the quantity limitations ultimately chosen.Nevertheless, all commenters generally agreed that suitable limitationscombined with economic forces would prevent the exemption from becominga means to circumvent the RCRA Subtitle C regulations for treatment anddisposal of hazardous waste. Additionally, many commenters noted that itwould not be economically feasible for a person to perform an endless seriesof tests, since treatability study costs are much higher than commercialtreatment or disposal costs on a per pound basis. In particular, Shirco(TSEF-001) stated that most treatability tests had unit costs greatly inexcess of costs associated with treatment and disposal options. Shircocited an example where treatability study costs were about $1,000 per poundversus $0.80 to $1.20 per pound for disposal at a commercial facility.Numerous other commenters stated that the high costs associated with performingtreatability studies would render invalid any concern the Agency had thatthe exemption could become a ``loophole'' in the RCRA Subtitle C regulations.The Agency believes that the limitations established in this exemptionwill ensure that it does not become a ``loophole'' and will ensure <T3>de minimis </T3>risk so that no significant threat to human healthand the environment will occur. The following sections discuss the limitsselected by the Agency and present the rationale for the limitations adopted.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Quantity Limits per Waste Stream per Treatment Process</ITAG>In response to the Notice of Data Availability, several commenters recommendedthat limits should be set for each generated waste stream to guard againstthe possibility that generators and facilities might conduct a plethoraof treatability studies in lieu of hazardous waste treatment or disposal.While data was provided that would suggest this would not happen, the Agencyhas decided that some limitations should be imposed as an extra precaution.Thus, to avoid the potential for such an abuse, the Agency has first madeit clear in the definition of ``treatability study'' that the exemptionis for the evaluation of a treatment process and is not to be utilizedas a commercial treatment option. In addition, the Agency has placed limitson the amount of waste that can be subject to a treatability study evaluationper generated waste stream. Thus, the rule provides for an exemption of1000 kg of non-acute hazardous waste per waste stream per treatment process;1 kg of acute hazardous waste per waste stream per treatment process; or250 kg of soils, water, or debris contaminated by acute hazardous wasteper waste stream per treatment process. The Agency, in making this decision,realizes that a generator may need to evaluate alternative treatment processesfor a particular waste stream. EPA believes that the limits set will beadequate to allow sufficient studies to be conducted. Furthermore, thequantity limits are consistent with other limits discussed elsewhere intoday's preamble.The Agency is broadly defining ``waste stream'' such that a waste streamand the quantity limit are not based on the EPA waste code alone; rather,the Agency will interpret and apply the quantity limit for each mediumor physical form in which the waste appears. The Agency believes that thisbroad interpretation is necessary since each medium (<T3>i.e., </T3>soils, water, or debris) might require a different treatabilitystudy and may need to be shipped to a different laboratory or testing facilityfor such studies to be conducted. The Agency is also broadly defining ``treatmentprocess'' to allow a generator to evaluate various alternative approaches.For example, a generator could send 1000 kg of non-acute hazardous waste,or 1 kg of acute hazardous waste, or 250 kg of soils, water, or debriscontaminated with acute hazardous waste for each generated waste streamto a number of different processes: biological treatment, incineration,fixation, etc. As allowed by this exemption, the generator or sample collectorwould be limited to a total of 1000 kg of nonacute hazardous waste of aparticular waste stream to investigate alternative fixation processes (or,as applicable, 250 kg of soils, water, or debris contaminated with acutehazardous waste, or 1 kg of acute hazardous waste). The Agency has selectedthe above limits recognizing that in some instances there may be a needto evaluate alternative treatment processes. Finally, the Agency has decidednot to put any limits on the number of treatability studies that a laboratoryor testing facility can perform per year. However, if this proves to bea problem, the Agency may consider additional regulations.As noted above, some commenters suggested that higher quantity limits arenecessary in order to evaluate certain treatability study processes orthat additional amounts of waste may be necessary in instances where unforeseencircumstances have affected the results of all or part of a treatabilitystudy evaluation. They suggested that case-by-case allowances in excessof the amounts specified above should be made available if need can bedemonstrated. The Agency agrees that some flexibility should be made availableto allow studies to be completed properly. However, the Agency wishes toensure that adequate controls are placed on all such evaluations to protecthuman health and the environment. Accordingly, the Agency has includeda provision that allows the Regional Administrator to grant requests forwaste stream quantity limits in excess of those specified above, up toan additional 500 kg of non-acute hazardous waste, 1 kg of acute hazardouswaste, and 250 kg of soils, water, and debris contaminated with acute hazardouswaste. The Regional Administrator shall only allow additional quantitiesof hazardous waste when it can be demonstrated that one of the followingcircumstances or situations exist: (1) That there has been an equipmentor mechanical failure and that additional waste is needed to conduct astudy; (2) that there is a need to verify the results of a previously evaluatedtreatment process; (3) that there is a need to study and analyze alternativetechniques within a previously evaluated treatment process; or (4) thatthere is a need to do further evaluation of an ongoing treatability studyto determine final specifications for treatment. These adjustments maybe authorized only if the 1000 kg (or 250 kg for soils, water, or debriscontaminated with acute hazardous waste, or 1 kg for acute hazardous waste)quantity limit per waste stream per treatment process has been subjectedto a treatability study evaluation and insufficient data are availableto properly design a treatment process. When authorizing additional quantities,the Regional Administrator will only authorize adjustments for the minimumquantity necessary to complete the treatability study evaluation. The Agencybelieves that most treatability studies can be completed utilizing an extra250 kg of sample or less, and only in unusual circumstances will quantitiesgreater than 250 kg be required.Generators and/or sample collectors seeking such an authorization for additionalquantities must furnish sufficient information to the Regional Administratorsto verify that they have met the conditions allowing for quantity adjustments.Generators and/or sample collectors will be required to submit, in writing,the specific reason why an additional quantity of sample for the treatabilitystudy evaluation is necessary (<T3>i.e., </T3>one of the four situations described above). He or she shallalso provide: (1) Verification of the additional quantity necessary; (2)documentation accounting for all samples of hazardous waste from the wastestream which have previously been sent for treatability study evaluation;(3) a description of the technical modifications or change in specificationswhich will be evaluated and the expected results; and, (4) if further studyis being required due to equipment or mechanical failure, the generatorand/or sample collector must include information from the laboratory ortesting facility indicating what handling procedures or equipment improvementshave been made to protect against further breakdowns. The Regional Administrator may perform or require additional analyses andinvestigations as are necessary to determine the minimal amount of additionalwaste necessary to conduct the study and yield the additional data necessaryto properly design and/or evaluate the performance of the treatment process.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Transportation Shipment Limits_Generator and Facility </ITAG>The HWTC, in its petition, suggested that shipments of waste samples weighingless than 250 kg (approximately one standard 55-gallon drum) should beexempted when such samples are being shipped for the purpose of conductingtreatability studies. The petition also recognized that larger size samplesmight be necessary for conducting treatability studies on contaminatedsoils or water; hence, the HWTC recommended that a provision for exemptinglarger size samples should be available. A number of commenters indicatedthat the 250-kg shipment limit was too restrictive and suggested that thelimit be increased to 1000 kg. These commenters argued that the risk associatedwith shipping a larger amount (<T3>e.g.</T3>, 1000 kg) is no greater than that associated with four shipmentsof 250 kg each when one considers the potential for transportation accidents.After careful consideration of all the issues, the Agency has decided toset a single shipment limitation of 1000 kg of non-acute hazardous waste;1 kg of acute hazardous waste; or 250 kg of soils, water, or debris contaminatedwith acute hazardous waste. These shipment limitations (which, in effect,govern the exemption from the RCRA hazardous waste transporter regulationsand manifesting requirements) will apply to the shipment of waste samplesfrom the generator or sample collector to the laboratory or testing facilitywhen such samples are being sent for the purpose of conducting a treatabilitystudy. The exemption will also apply when unused waste samples and residuesgenerated by the treatability study are returned to the generator or samplecollector following completion of the study. The Agency is setting this limit to be consistent with the quantity limitsset on generators for the amount of waste that can be subject to the treatabilitystudy sample exemption as discussed in the previous section. The Agencyagrees with commenters that the risk associated with shipping the maximumlimit of 1000 kg is no greater than that associated with four shipmentsof 250 kg each. However, it also believes these levels will pose <T3>de minimis </T3>risk. In addition, as already discussed, the Agency believes other factors existthat will ensure safe delivery of the waste samples to and from the laboratoryor testing facility. For example, the waste samples will still be subjectto the applicable DOT or USPS regulations regarding shipment of hazardousmaterials. If the shipments do not fall under DOT or USPS jurisdiction,the generator or sample collector and the laboratory or testing facilitymust follow the requirements for labeling and packaging as set forth byEPA in this amendment. The requirements state that a sample must be packagedso that it does not leak, spill, or vaporize from its packaging. In addition,the following information must accompany the sample: (1) The sample collector'sname, address, telephone number, and EPA identification number; (2) thelaboratory or testing facility's name, mailing address, telephone number,and EPA identification number; (3) the quantity of the sample; (4) thedate of shipment; and (5) a description of the sample. Finally, the Agencybelieves that most shipments will be considerably smaller than the limit,since other forces, such as storage limits and treatment rates at the laboratoryor testing facility, will require careful control of the amount of wasteshipped to the laboratory or testing facility. The costs to conduct thestudy and to collect, pack, and ship the sample will tend to limit thesample size to the smallest amount practicable. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Treatment Rate Limit </ITAG>The HWTC, in its petition, suggested that the treatment rate limit shouldbe 250 kg per day per laboratory or testing facility. Many of the commentersagreed; however, others argued that the limit should be larger and thatit should be based on either the number of treatment units or the numberof treatment processes that the laboratory or testing facility was capableof conducting. For example, if a facility was capable of conducting severalsoil fixation studies or biological treatment studies at one time, thenthe limit should be 250 kg per process. Other commenters argued for evenhigher limits, indicating that it should be 250 kg per unit. After reviewing the available information and considering the comments,the Agency has adopted a treatment rate limit of 250 kg per day of ``asreceived'' waste for the entire laboratory or testing facility. The term``as received'' has been chosen by the Agency because some of the treatmentprocesses involve the addition of non-waste material to reduce the environmentalmobility of hazardous constituents. ``As received'' refers to the wasteshipped by the generator or sample collector as it arrives at the laboratoryor testing facility. Based on the information provided by the HWTC, informationsubmitted by other commenters in response to the Notice of Data Availability,and EPA's own experience, the Agency believes that most treatability studiescan be conducted at or below the treatment rate limit of 250 kg per day.The Agency believes this level will allow many wastes to be treated andevaluated as part of a treatability study, while posing only a <T3>de minimis </T3>risk to human health and the environment. For example,if a laboratory or testing facility were to conduct a treatability studyon a waste using bench-scale incineration and the study achieved a 99%destruction removal efficiency, only a small amount of toxic material wouldbe released into the environment. In most instances, the amount releasedis much lower than any level of concern. In addition, since in most casesthese studies will be conducted on an intermittent basis, there is lessconcern with repeated exposure. Laboratories or testing facilities that are conducting treatability studiesand that meet the treatment rate limit are exempted from the requirementsto obtain a Subtitle C treatment permit. The Agency wants to emphasizethat the purpose of the exemption is for conducting treatability studies,not for the commercial management of hazardous waste. The Agency believesthat facilities anticipating the need to conduct an excessively large numberof studies, or those having numerous treatment units allowing them to conductmany studies concurrently, will probably need to obtain a Research, Development,and Demonstration permit (40 CFR 270.65). It should also be noted thatthe Agency recently promulgated a new set of permitting standards underSubpart X of Part 264 (52 FR 46946, December 10, 1987) for miscellaneoushazardous waste management units. The Agency is also considering developingregulations under Subpart Y that would establish permitting standards forexperimental facilities conducting research and development on the storage,treatment, or disposal of hazardous waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Storage Limits</ITAG>The HWTC, in its petition, recommended that a facility be allowed to store1000 kg of hazardous waste on site without a storage permit, as long assuch waste is for the purpose of conducting treatability studies. HWTCargued that this amount is essentially equal to the small quantity generator(SQG) limits and that the 1000 kg of waste included all waste (both receivedwaste and treated residue). Many commenters argued that the 1000-kg storagelimit would not allow them sufficient inventory to conduct certain treatabilitystudies or argued that the storage limit should be based on the numberof units present at the facility.After evaluating this issue, the Agency has decided to adopt a storagelimitation of 1000 kg per laboratory or testing facility. However, theAgency has also decided to specify the 1000-kg storage limitation for ``asreceived'' waste. The 1000-kg storage limitation per laboratory or testingfacility can include 500 kg of soils, water, or debris contaminated withacute hazardous waste or 1 kg of acute hazardous waste. The Agency is makingit clear in this rule that the storage exemption only applies to laboratoriesor testing facilities conducting treatability studies. The quantity limitationsallow sufficient inventory to conduct small-scale treatability studieswhile ensuring <T3>de minimis </T3>risk to human health and the environment. Higher storagelimits would not give us this same assurance. Also the Agency notes, asdiscussed previously, financial and business incentives are present thathelp to ensure <T3>de minimis </T3>risk levels are maintained.The Agency limits for soils, water, and other debris contaminated withacute hazardous waste were selected to allow small-scale treatability studiesto be conducted on media contaminated with dioxin wastes and certain pesticidessuch as aldrin and aldicarb. Although the 500-kg storage limit is higherthan that currently established for SQGs, the Agency believes that the500-kg limit will still be protective of human health and the environmentand pose <T3>de minimis </T3>risk, since in most instances the sample will onlybe stored for a short period of time prior to being utilized in a study.Furthermore, this category is limited to materials in which the acute hazardouswaste involves a contaminant in a medium such as water or soil. Therefore,EPA would expect the concentration of the acute hazardous waste to be verylow. Furthermore, the contaminant may be bound to the medium itself. Forother acute hazardous wastes (<T3>i.e., </T3>the actual listed waste), the Agency has adopted a 1-kglimit consistent with the SQG regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Residues and Unused Samples-Time Limitations</ITAG>Although the Notice of Data Availability did not propose any time limitationsfor completion of a treatability study, some commenters strongly recommendedthat appropriate time limits be placed on the storage of the ``as received''waste samples and the residues generated from the treatability study. Suggestionson appropriate time limits varied widely. However, the commenters generallyindicated that 1 year provides ample time to complete most treatabilitystudies.The Agency is in agreement with commenters that specific time limits forcompleting treatability studies are necessary. Time limitations are necessaryto guard against potential abuses such as use of a laboratory or testingfacility for long-term storage to avoid treatment and disposal. Any untreatedsample and any residue generated during the treatability study must bereturned to the generator within 90 days of study completion or within1 year from the date of shipment by the generator to the laboratory ortesting facility, whichever is earlier. Otherwise, these materials mustbe managed, by the laboratory or testing facility conducting the treatabilitystudy, as a RCRA hazardous waste (unless the waste is no longer hazardous).These time limits provide the laboratory or testing facility conductingthe treatability study enough time to do the evaluation, but at the sametime do not allow persons to store these wastes indefinitely. The 1-yeartime limit proved to be noncontroversial when adopted in other areas. Forexample, the 1-year time limit is consistent with the speculative accumulationprovision and the closed-loop tank provision. Under these provisions, personsor facilities holding materials have 1 year to accumulate them before theyare potentially subject to regulation.Laboratories or testing facilities that do not return the unused sampleor the residues to the generator or sample collector within the specifiedtime limits are subject to appropriate regulation. Facilities must determineif they meet the SQG requirements of andSection; 261.5 or the accumulationrequirements of andSection; 262.34, and they may need to obtain a storagepermit and comply with its conditions. Once samples and residues are returnedto the generator, they are no longer exempt under today's rule. Ultimately,the unused sample and residues that are still hazardous must be manifestedand disposed of in a RCRA-designated facility by the laboratory or testingfacility, the waste generator, or sample collector.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Mobile Treatment Units</ITAG>Although the issue of mobile treatment units (MTUs) was not addressed inthe Notice of Data Availability and Request for Comment, concern was expressedover how this exemption applies to MTUs. EPA has determined that MTUs conductingtreatability studies may qualify for this exemption. However, each MTUor group of MTUs operating at the same location is subject to the treatmentrate, storage, and time limitations and the notification, recordkeeping,and reporting requirements that are applicable to stationary laboratoriesor testing facilities conducting treatability studies. That is, a groupof MTUs operating at one location will be treated as one MTU facility forpurposes of andSection; 261.4 (e) and (f). Furthermore, these requirementsapply to each location where an MTU will conduct treatability studies.D. Reporting and Recordkeeping RequirementsAlthough the Notice of Data Availability did not specifically recommendthat reporting and recordkeeping provisions be adopted, some commenterssuggested that some form of reporting and recordkeeping should be requiredin the treatability study exemption. They argued that, without some formof reporting or recordkeeping requirements, EPA would not have a meansof determining who is violating the exemption or the amount of waste subjectedto treatability studies.The Agency strongly agrees with the commenters and believes that reportingand recordkeeping requirements are necessary to facilitate inspector reviewand, if necessary, to assist in enforcement action. In fact, 40 CFR 216.2(f)already requires that persons who claim that their waste is conditionallyexempt from regulation must provide appropriate documentation that theymeet the conditions of the exemption. Therefore, the Agency is stipulatingspecific reporting and recordkeeping requirements that will document compliancewith the quantity and time limitations set forth in this rulemaking. Thereporting and recordkeeping requirements stipulated below are the minimumrequirements necessary to ensure compliance with the limitations in thetreatability sample exemption.1. The generator of the sample (who may also be the shipper or sample collector)and the laboratory or testing facility conducting the treatability studymust keep the following records for 3 years after the completion of thestudy:a. A copy of the contract (between the generator and the laboratory ortesting facility) to conduct the treatability study;b. Copies of all shipping documents. (If the waste was shipped to an MTU,copies of the shipping papers must be kept with the unit for inspectorreview.)2. Generators and sample collectors must also maintain records indicatingthe following: (1) The amount of waste (per waste stream and treatmentprocess) shipped under the exemption; (2) to whom the shipment was sent(name, address, and EPA identification number of the laboratory or testingfacility conducting the study); (3) the date shipment was made; and (4)whether or not any unused sample or any residue generated from the treatabilitystudy was returned. In addition, beginning in 1989, generators must reportthis information in their biennial reports. 3. In addition, laboratories or testing facilities conducting or intendingto conduct treatability studies must accomplish the following:a. Send a letter to the EPA Regional Administrator or the authorized Stateinforming the Agency that the laboratory or testing facility intends toconduct small-scale treatability studies. This letter must be receivedno less than 45 days before the facility begins conducting treatabilitystudies. The letter should indicate the address and EPA identificationnumber of the laboratory or testing facility conducting studies and thetypes of treatability studies anticipated. Owners and operators of facilitiesthat do not have an EPA identification number must obtain one before conductingany treatability studies under this exemption. This reporting requirementand the requirement to obtain an EPA identification number apply to ownersand operators of MTUs at every treatability study location (except at CERCLAsites where, under CERCLA section 121(e)(1) and 40 CFR 300.68(a)(3), RCRApermits are not required).b. Maintain appropriate records and documentation for a period of 3 yearsfollowing completion of each treatability study that show compliance withthe appropriate quantity and time limitations addressed in the final rule.The records must indicate that the laboratory or testing facility is meetingthe requirements for shipment limits, treatment rate limits, and storagelimits. Specific minimum information, by treatability study, that mustbe maintained include the following:andbullet; The name, address, and EPA identification number of the generatoror sample collector of the waste samples;andbullet; The date the shipment was received;andbullet; The quantity of waste accepted;andbullet; The quantity of ``as received'' waste in storage each day;andbullet; The date the treatment study was initiated and the amount of ``asreceived'' waste introduced to treatment each day;andbullet; The date the treatability study was concluded; andandbullet; The date the unused sample and residue were returned to the generatoror, if sent to a designated facility, the name of the facility and itsEPA identification number. As noted above, the laboratory or testing facilitymust keep copies of all shipping documents associated with transport ofthe waste to and from the facility.c. By March 15 of each year, submit a report to the authorized State orRegional Administrator that includes an estimate of the number of studiesand the amount of waste expected to be used in treatability studies duringthe current year and the following information for the previous calendaryear:andbullet; The name, address, and EPA identification number of the generatoror sample collector of each waste sample;andbullet; The date the shipment was received;andbullet; The quantity of waste accepted;andbullet; The total quantity of ``as received'' waste in storage each day;andbullet; The date the treatment study was initiated and the amount of ``asreceived'' waste introduced to treatment each day;andbullet; The date the treatability study was concluded; andandbullet; The date any unused sample and residues generated from the treatabilitystudy were returned to the generator or sample collector or, if sent toa designated facility, the name of the facility and the EPA identificationnumber.d. Notify the Regional Administrator or authorized State by letter whenand if the laboratory or testing facility is no longer planning to conductany treatability studies at the site. (For example, when an MTU completesa treatability study at a site, the owners or operators must submit therequired notice that they will no longer be conducting treatability studiesat that site.)E. EPA Identification Numbers_Applicability of OSHA Training RequirementsSome commenters suggested that any laboratory or testing facility conductingtreatability studies should be required to have an EPA identification number.These commenters argued that such a restriction would ensure that the facilityis in compliance with the requirements to have a facility contingency plan,has established emergency procedures, and is in compliance with OSHA'shazardous waste workers' training and medical monitoring requirements.(See 29 CFR 1910.120, 51 FR 45654, December 19, 1986.)The Agency partially agrees and is requiring any laboratory or testingfacility conducting treatability studies to notify the Agency and obtainan EPA identification number if the facility does not already have one.However, as already explained, the Agency believes laboratories or testingfacilities conducting treatability studies within the limits specifiedpresent a <T3>de minimis</T3> risk. For example, the OSHA hazardous waste operatorsand emergency response requirements (29 CFR 1910.120) are applicable exceptfor SQGs and facilities complying with the accumulation time requirementsof 40 CFR 262.34. Other OSHA requirements, such as the OSHA laboratorystandards and general duty clause (29 USC 654(a)(1)), may apply dependingon the type of laboratory or testing facility and the nature of its activities.Thus, EPA believes requirements such as contingency plans and emergencyprocedures are not necessary for the protection of human health and theenvironment.F. Incentives for Safe TransportIn the Notice of Data Availability, the Agency specifically requested commenton whether the incentives for safe transport and storage of waste characterizationsamples would also apply to treatability samples. Most commenters agreedthat suitable incentives exist to ensure proper handling and shipping oftreatability study samples.The Agency generally agrees. In particular, a principal purpose of thegenerator and transporter requirements is to assure that shipments of hazardouswastes are safely delivered to an appropriate destination (<T3>i.e.</T3>, a permitted or interim status hazardous waste managementfacility). This is accomplished through the requirements for manifesting,recordkeeping, packaging, and labeling of hazardous waste. The principalpurpose of the manifest system is to ensure ``cradle to grave'' accountabilityfor shipments of hazardous waste from the generator to a TSDF.In the case of treatability study samples, EPA wants to ensure that thesamples are delivered to the facility conducting the treatability study,and that both the unused sample and all residues generated in the treatabilitystudy are sent back to the generator or sample collector or, alternatively,shipped to a designated facility if the waste remains hazardous.The Agency believes that sufficient incentives and requirements are inplace to provide for the safe shipment of samples to and from laboratoriesand testing facilities conducting treatability studies. In particular,they include:1. Maintenance of corporate reputation and public confidence;2. The high cost of these studies coupled with the generator's or samplecollector's need for properly documented results;3. The need for the generator or sample collector to verify results ofa treatability study; and4. Requirements in today's rule for either returning the unused samplesand residues to the generator or sample collector, or for manifesting andshipping these materials to a TSDF for ultimate disposal.The Agency believes that the above incentives and requirements will guardagainst any facility not complying with the limitations or conducting bogustreatability studies. Furthermore, DOT or other regulations and guidelinescontrol the transportation of such samples even in the absence of EPA regulation.The requirements to comply with DOT shipping regulations regarding packagingand labeling will be substantially the same as present requirements forshipping hazardous waste. Additionally, the USPS has stringent guidelinesgoverning the shipment of hazardous materials, including samples. (Seethe ``Domestic Mail Manual,'' Part 124 and Publication 52, ``Acceptanceof Hazardous or Perishable Articles.'') For the above reasons, the Agencybelieves that the transport of small quantities of hazardous waste poses<T3>de minimis</T3> risk during shipment to a laboratory or testing facilityor when being returned to the generator or sample collector.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Today's Amendment</ITAG>The Agency believes that the full complement of the hazardous waste regulationsfound in 40 CFR, Parts 260 through 268 and 270, when applied to waste samplesused in small-scale treatability studies, are more comprehensive than necessaryto adequately protect human health and the environment. In addition, theAgency believes that it needs to promote research and the development ofinnovative technologies to manage hazardous wastes. Therefore, EPA is amendingthe regulations to conditionally exempt waste samples processed in small-scaletreatability studies from the hazardous waste regulations under certainconditions.In particular, EPA is today adding new paragraphs (e) and (f) to 40 CFR261.4 which accomplish the following: First, persons who generate samplesare exempted from the generator and transporter requirements when samplesare shipped by the generator, or any other person who collects the sample(the ``sample collector''), to a laboratory or testing facility for thepurpose of conducting a treatability analysis, or when shipped from thefacility back to the sample collector, provided that certain packagingand labeling requirements are met. Second, any laboratory or testing facilitythat conducts treatability studies may store these waste samples and residuesgenerated from the treatability study within the quantity and time limitsspecified and not be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR, Parts 264,265, and 270. Third, the actual testing of the samples does not requirea permit, provided the laboratory or testing facility complies with thelimitations specified in today's rule.Laboratories and testing facilities that conduct treatability studies mustalso keep records and documents regarding each treatability study as enumeratedin II.D.3.6. above. Additionally, today's rule requires facilities conductingtreatability studies to submit an annual report to the authorized Stateor Administrator of the EPA Region in which the laboratory or testing facilityis located. The required annual report must be a distinct document preparedby the owner and/or operator of the laboratory or testing facility indicatingthe previous calendar year's activities regarding treatability studies.The report must be submitted by March 15 of each year and must identifythe laboratory or testing facility by name, EPA identification number,and the location (site address) at which the treatability studies wereconducted. Paragraph II.D.3.c. above lists specific information requiredin the report. The obligation to submit annual reports continues untilthe laboratory or testing facility discontinues treatability studies, returnsall unused ``as received'' samples and any residues generated in the treatabilitystudies back to the generator or sample collector, and notifies the RegionalAdministrator or State Director that the laboratory or testing facilityno longer plans to conduct any treatability studies at the site.Paragraph (e), Treatability Study Samples, provides an exemption for generatorsof samples of hazardous waste to be evaluated in treatability studies,while they are being prepared for transport or being transported, providedthat these samples and their residues are returned to the generator withinspecified time limits. The exemption limits the sample collector or generatorfrom shipping more than 1000 kg per non-acute hazardous waste stream pertreatment process (or 250 kg of soils, water, or debris contaminated withacute hazardous waste, or 1 kg of acute hazardous waste). Shipments mustcomply with the applicable DOT, USPS, or other applicable regulations forshipping hazardous materials.The generator or sample collector must also maintain records indicatingthe amount of waste shipped under the exemption, the name and address ofthe laboratory or testing facility, the facility EPA identification number,type of study, and the expected duration of the study. Beginning in 1989,the generator or sample collector must also include the above informationin its biennial report.Paragraph (f), Samples Undergoing Treatability Studies at Laboratoriesor Testing Facilities, describes the limitations that apply to a facilityconducting treatability studies under this exemption. The facility maysubject no more than 250 kg of ``as received'' waste to treatability studiesin any one day. The facility may store a maximum of 1000 kg of ``as received''waste, of which 500 kg can be soils, water, or debris contaminated withacute hazardous waste or 1 kg of acute hazardous waste. The facility mustalso return any unused sample and residues to the generator within 90 daysafter completion of the study or within 1 year after initial shipment (whicheveris earlier), or otherwise manage the sample and residue as a RCRA hazardouswaste, if the residue is still hazardous. The facility must meet certain specified reporting requirements. The facilitymust provide notification (by letter) to the Regional Administrator orauthorized State indicating that the facility intends to conduct treatabilitystudies under the exemption. It must obtain an EPA identification numberif it does not have one. The facility must also maintain records documentingcompliance with the specified time and quantity limits for treatment andstorage and must keep records of all shipping documents for 3 years fromthe completion of the treatability study. The owner or operator of a facility conducting treatability studies mustalso submit a report to the Regional Administrator or authorized Stateindicating the type and number of treatability studies conducted duringthe previous calendar year, for whom each study was conducted, the quantityof hazardous waste utilized in each treatability study, when each studywas conducted, and the final disposition of residue and any unused sample.The report must include an estimate of the number of treatability studiesto be conducted and the quantity of hazardous waste expected to be usedin treatability studies during the coming year. The facility must alsonotify the Regional Administrator or authorized State by letter when andif the facility is no longer planning to conduct any treatability studiesat the site. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. State Authority </ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR, Part 271 forthe standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 7003, and 3013 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States atthe same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto implement those requirements and prohibitions in an authorized State,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim. B. Effect of State Authorizations Today's announcement promulgates regulations that are not effective underHSWA in authorized States, since this rulemaking does not impose requirementsor prohibitions contained in HSWA. Thus, the regulations will be applicableonly in those States that do not have final authorization. In an authorizedState, the regulations will not be applicable until the State revises itsprogram to adopt equivalent regulations under State law. 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2) requires that States having final authorization mustmodify their programs to include equivalent regulations within a year ofpromulgation of these regulations if only regulatory changes are necessary,or within 2 years of promulgation if statutory changes are necessary. Thesedeadlines can be extended in exceptional cases (40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). OnceEPA approves the modification, the State requirements become Subtitle CRCRA requirements. States with authorized RCRA programs may already have regulations similarto those in today's rule. These State regulations have not been comparedwith the Federal regulations being promulgated today to determine whetherthey meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorizedto implement these regulations in lieu of EPA until the State program modificationis submitted to EPA and approved. Of course, States with existing regulationsmay continue to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter ofState law. Authorized States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgatesFederal regulations that are more stringent or broader in scope than theauthorized State regulations. For those changes that are less stringentor reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required tomodify their programs. This is a result of section 3009 of RCRA, whichallows States to impose more stringent or broader regulations than theFederal program. The regulations promulgated today at andSection;andSection;261.4 (e) and (f) are considered to be less stringent than or reduce thescope of the existing Federal regulations because today's rule exemptscertain activities now within the purview of RCRA. Therefore, authorizedStates are not required to modify their programs to adopt regulations consistentwith and equivalent to this rulemaking.  Even though States are not required to adopt today's rulemaking, EPA stronglyencourages States to do so as quickly as possible. As already explainedin this preamble, today's rule is needed to facilitate evaluating remediationalternatives for CERCLA clean-ups and the RCRA Corrective Action Program,and to speed research and development for treatment alternatives to landdisposal and waste minimization, recycling, and reuse. States are, therefore,urged to consider the adoption of today's rule; EPA will expedite reviewof authorized State program revision applications.States are also encouraged to use existing authorities to provide for comparabletreatability exemptions prior to adopting and receiving authorization fortoday's rule. Some States may have authority comparable to RCRA Section7003, which allows EPA to order response action in the case of imminentand substantial endangerment to health or the environment ``notwithstandingany other provision of this Act.'' An authorized State may use comparablesection 7003-type authority to authorize treatability studies and may waivethe generator, transporter, notification, and permit requirements consistentwith today's rulemaking.In addition to, or in lieu of, a section 7003-type authority, a State mayhave general waiver, permit waiver, or emergency permit authority. Consistentwith this rule, states are encouraged to use any such authority to granttreatability exemptions in a manner consistent with today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Effective Date</ITAG>Section 3010(b) of RCRA provides that EPA's hazardous waste regulationsand revisions to those regulations take effect 6 months after promulgation.The purpose of this requirement is to allow facilities that handle hazardouswastes sufficient lead time to prepare for and to comply with major newregulatory requirements. Given the potential of this rule to increase thetimeliness of CERCLA remedial clean-up activities, RCRA corrective actions,and compliance with the land disposal restrictions, the Agency believesthat an effective date of 6 months after promulgation would unnecessarilydisrupt implementation of the regulations and would not be in the publicinterest. Since this amendment reduces, rather than increases, the existingrequirements for facilities that handle waste samples, there is no basisfor allowing a lengthy time period to prepare for compliance. The samereasons provide good cause to make this rule effective immediately uponpublication notwithstanding section 4(d) of the Administrative ProcedureAct, 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this amendment takes effect immediatelyupon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The application of this final rule is prospective only. Any treatabilitystudies covered by this final rule that were conducted before the effectivedate of this regulation are subject to the Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations,including permitting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Analyses</ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291Under Executive Order No. 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis. This final regulation is not major because it will not resultin an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, and it will not increasecosts or prices to industry. Rather, this regulation will reduce the overallcosts and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulationsby eliminating permitting requirements for laboratories and testing facilitiesintending to conduct treatability studies. The Agency estimates that perhaps400 facilities and laboratories nationwide will be affected by promulgationof this rule. Facilities and laboratories will be spared the time (as muchas 2 years) and the costs (estimated to be between $100,000 and $200,000)otherwise necessary to obtain a RCRA permit. In addition, there will beno adverse effect on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete withthe non-U.S.-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because thisamendment is not a major regulation, no Regulatory Impact Analysis hasbeen conducted.This amendment was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order No. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an Agency is required to publish general noticeof rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and makeavailable for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describesthe impact of the rule on small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. As noted previously in this preamble, the universe of facilitiesaffected is estimated to total about 400; of these, perhaps 200 are smallbusiness entities. By eliminating time-consuming and costly permittingrequirements, the Agency anticipates that promulgation of this rule willhave a positive effect on small entities.This amendment will have no adverse economic impact on small entities.In fact, it should reduce the burden imposed on small entities that conducttreatability studies and comply with the provisions of this rulemaking.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this final regulation will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This regulation therefore does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et. seq., </T3>and have been assigned the OMB control number 2050-0088(Treatability Studies Notification and Recordkeeping).Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 90 to 250 hours per response, with an average of 155 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information includingsuggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch,PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
