Fuel is arranged to flowthrough the injector at constant temperature, pressure, and flow rateand the pressure drop across the nozzle is monitored to provide an indicationof the amount of deposition. After deposits have formed, the nozzle isremoved from the test rig and its spray performance is compared withits performance before deposition. The spray characteristics measuredinclude mean drop size, drop-size distribution, and radial and circumferentialfuel distribution. It is found that small amounts of deposition can producesevere distortion of the fuel spray pattern. More extensive depositionrestores spray uniformity, but the nozzle flow rate is seriously curtailed.20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
