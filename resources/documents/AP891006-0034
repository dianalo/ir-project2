The House-passed measure now returns there for consideration ofchanges made by the Senate. It calls for up to a $1,000 fine and ayear in jail for burning or otherwise defacing the flag.   A constitutional amendment to ban flag burning is set to come upin the Senate on Oct. 16; the House also is expected to take upsuch a measure.   Republican senators kept up pressure for a constitutionalamendment as the only effective counter to a June Supreme Courtdecision that threw out the conviction of Texas flag-burner GregoryLee Johnson on free-speech grounds.   They scoffed at the notion that the Democratic-sponsored billwould meet the high court's test of constitutionality.   Democrats countered that free speech guaranteed by theConstitution should be limited only as a last resort. They claimedto have carefully worded their bill to protect it against anexpected new court challenge on free-speech grounds.   Bush was among those saying the bill didn't go far enough.   ``I respect the intention of those who voted for (a statutoryban),'' Bush told reporters. ``But I continue to believe such anapproach is inadequate in light of the Supreme Court decision.''   Before passage, the Senate voted 53-47 to table, or kill, anamendment offered by Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to apply thedefacement ban only to those who acted in public.   It added an amendment from Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., thatwould make it illegal to ``physically defile'' the flag.   ``The Dole amendment was the potential killer amendment,'' Sen.Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, saidafterward.   Biden had told the Senate the Dole and Wilson amendments wouldskew the language and push the bill closer toward the danger zonein which a court could find that it limited free speech.   Biden said after the Senate acted, however, there was not muchto fear from the Wilson amendment.   ``Wilson's OK,'' he said. ``I just didn't want a trend to startand that's why I opposed it. My expectation is that the House willaccept our changes and I think they may act fairly quickly.''   House Democratic leaders tried Thursday afternoon to bring thebill to the floor for final action, but Republicans succeeded inblocking that move.   Biden said it was too early to forecast the prospects for theproposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. ``It'll betight,'' he said.   It was clear that some lawmakers hoped support for the billwould insulate them from charges on the campaign trail next yearthat they failed to support the constitutional amendment. A numberof lawmakers indicated that they would vote for both the bill andthe amendment.   Burning the flag already is outlawed under federal law, but fewbelieve that statute could withstand a court test such as the onein the Texas case.   Democratic sponsors sought to design a bill that would ban anyact of defacement, regardless of whether it involved politicalprotest. That way, they said, there would be no danger of it beingheld unconstitutional.   Those voting against the measure were Sens. Howard M.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.;Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Dole; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; CharlesGrassley, R-Iowa; John H. Chafee, R-R.I.; and Gordon Humphrey,R-N.H.</TEXT></DOC>
