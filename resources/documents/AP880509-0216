The miniseries ``Baby M,'' which ABC will televise Sunday andMonday, tells the story of what turned into a historic custodybattle between Whitehead and William and Elizabeth Stern.   Whitehead, a New Jersey homemaker, signed a contract three yearsago to bear a child for the Sterns. When the baby was born shecould not give the child away, and fought to keep her daughter. TheSterns were awarded custody, but a New Jersey Superior Courtrecently granted broad visitation rights to Mary Beth, who in themeantime was divorced and remarried and uses the name Mary BethWhitehead Gould. She is also pregnant again.   The four-hour miniseries is an unauthorized show done withoutany input from Whitehead or the Sterns.   ``You would have to get all the rights or you'd have to tell itfrom one viewpoint,'' Williams says.   She said Whitehead declined to cooperate if the Sternsparticipated.   ``Before I became involved my sympathy more or less was with theSterns,'' Williams says. ``But as I played Mary Beth I began to seeher point of view. I found myself more torn. When I began to seethe kind of pain both sides went through it became less easy for meto make a judgment.   ``In the beginning, from what I had seen in the media, Mary Bethhad done some very extreme things. I couldn't understand some ofher behavior. The more I got into it the more I began to see thekind of stress she was under and how she could do these things.''   Eight months of preparation and research went into the making ofthe series.   ``There is an enormous amount of material available on thecase,'' Williams says. ``I had followed the story in the papers andon TV, but I didn't know any details. But like everyone else in thecountry, I was fascinated by it.''   ``Baby M'' also stars Bruce Weitz as Rick Whitehead, Mary Beth'shusband; John Shea and Robin Strasser as the Sterns; Anne Jacksonas Lorraine Abraham, the legal guardian appointed to protect thebaby's interests; Dabney Coleman as Gary Skoloff, Stern's attorney;Bruce McGill as Harold Cassiday, Whitehead's attorney; and DakinMatthews as the trial judge, Harvey R. Sorkow. James Sadwith wroteand directed.   ``I think people are not aware of the number of people in thiscountry with fertility problems,'' Williams says. ``I wassympathetic to the Sterns because of that.''   Later, she says, ``I'm a woman who very much wants a child. Ithink Mary Beth subconsciously really wanted the baby...Runningaway with the baby is something I can relate to. Her maternalfeelings were very strong.''   The Sterns signed a contract in January 1985 to pay Whitehead$10,000 to become pregnant with semen from Stern by artificialinsemination. She agreed to carry the child to full term and turnit over to the Sterns at birth.   Mrs. Stern suffers from multiple sclerosis and pregnancy wouldhave been too great a risk for her. Whitehead at the time was themother of two children.   This is the fourth time Williams has played a real person. Shewas Reve Walsh in ``Adam'' and again in ``Adam: His SongContinues'' _ as the mother of the child who was kidnapped andmurdered in Florida. In ``Murder Ordained,'' she was LornaAnderson, who is now serving a prison sentence for her involvementin the deaths of her husband and the wife of her lover, who was aminister in Kansas.   ``It's different when you play a real person,'' she says. ``Yousort of work in a different way. When you play a fictionalcharacter you can let your imagination run free. You can find yourown parameters.   ``When you play a real person you start with the physical thingsand look for the emotional links. Then you have to find the thingsthat support those emotions. You work backward. It's morechallenging. I would certainly never do an imitation, but you dotry to capture the essence.''   Before ``Baby M,'' Williams completed ``Memories of Me'' withBilly Crystal and Alan King. She describes it as a serious story,but adds, ``When you get Billy and Alan together you're going tohave a comedy.''   Williams, a native of Houston, is best noted for such movies as``The Big Chill,'' ``Stir Crazy,'' ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''``Poltergeist'' and ``Teachers.''   This September, she and Kris Kristofferson will star in``Passage,'' to be directed by Franklin Schaffner. She plays awoman who has long believed her husband was killed in Vietnam _until the day he comes home.   Williams' husband is John Pasquin, who specializes in directingpilots. Williams says she would do a series herself if the rightscript came along. She has turned down a few that have gone on tobecome very successful.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 22</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
