Alas, it has an oddly tame, although pleasant, premiere.   Filmed in Chicago at Harpo Studios, where Winfrey also does hersyndicated talk show, the series is about the lives of big-cityblacks in 1967. It has a lot of things going for it, particularlyWinfrey's acting.   She's eminently believable as the lead character, MattieMichael, a wise, steady single woman to whom fate has dealt a fewhard knocks, but who faces life with dignity and a certaindown-home grace.   The show's other pluses: an optimistic view of life, a fineensemble cast and David Shire's sprightly, lovely no-words themesong that verges close to Bach in its rendition by the fine acapella group, Take Six.   (A first-rate singer and composer, Oscar Brown Jr., also lurksin the cast as Jessie, the husband of the neighborhood busybody.)   But the show's future episodes are going to need a bit more biteand true grit if the series is to make its way in this wickedworld, a world in which the new buzz phrase of networks is ``getweird,'' as in ``Twin Peaks.''   Co-written by Earl Hamner, who did ``The Waltons,'' the premiereis a gentle lesson on the need, after misfortune strikes, to pickyourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again, preferablyin a new direction.   But Winfrey's Michael, with all her strength, can't bringherself to make such a dramatic move, even when fired from herhairdresser's job at a local beauty parlor after refusing to helpbilk her trusting customers.   Save for work as a domestic, her job prospects are dim becauseof her lack of formal education and skills that could lead to, say,a secretary's job.   She has a nest egg that she's saved up in recent years. But shecan't bring herself to bet it on herself in a business venture. Thereason: she was financially ruined before by her own son.   It turns out he had been arrested _ the charge isn't specified _and jumped bail. He left his mother, who had put up her home assecurity for bail money, flat broke.   When she's fired from her hairdresser's job, her best friend,Etta Mae (Brenda Pressley), urges a big change _ becoming herpartner in a local Italian restaurant. Etta Mae has a beau who willloan her half the money.   Etta Mae isn't embarrassed that her friend says she's dreaming.``Damn right,'' she snaps. ``And you look to me like you could usea good dream.''   The restaurant is being sold by an old, decent man who blamesage, not the changing racial nature of the neighborhood, for theslide in his business.   ``The neighborhood's changed,'' he says. `` All my customers,they got old like me, moved to Miami.''   There are such men, to be sure. But this suggestion of racialharmony just doesn't ring true. Neither does the generally sweet,good-hearted nature of most everyone in and around thismake-believe Brewster Place.   And you know, almost from the start, that Mattie is going to seethe light and take a chance. Of course, that's after othercharacters are established and she helps her widowed cousin and histhree kids, all fresh in from Arkansas, move into their newBrewster Place apartment.   In a way, the opening show is almost a black urban counterpartof Hamner's ``The Waltons,'' with its emphasis on decency andoptimism, and even occasional narration by the lead charatcer.   It's all well and good to revive what that rural, predominantlywhite-cast CBS series represented _ kinder, gentler television.   But a bit more realism would help ``Brewster Place,'' too.   Incidentally, the show will be seen again next Tuesday. The dayafter that, it will settle into ABC's Wednesday night schedule.   Two Tuesday showings may seem an odd way to get a Wednesdaynight series going. But gosh, folks, that's why they invented TVexecutives.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...
