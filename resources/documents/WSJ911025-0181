For example, in the ZambeziRiver Valley of northern Zimbabwe -- an area twice the sizeof Maryland -- there are 2,000 elephants, 56,000 capebuffalo, 2,000 lions, 230,000 impala, and 50,000 warthogs.Such wildlife numbers stagger the imagination. Can adeveloping country such as Zimbabwe maintain them? Amarket-based program holds promise, and provides lessons forthe U.S. as well.   In the Third World there is constant tension between ruraldevelopment and maintenance of the ecological base for suchdevelopment. As regions develop, wild, indigenous flora andfauna give way to domesticated species. Forests are clearedfor crops; cattle displace wildlife. This often leads todepletion of soil fertility, soil erosion anddesertification. Throughout southern Africa, traditionalcommunal land tenures have been replaced by fields separatedby barbed wire; wells and dams have moderated the pressuresfrom drought but also have reduced wildlife habitat.</LP><TEXT>   Conflicts with development are particularly significantwhen it comes to the large mammals, such as elephants,rhinos, lions and leopards. These animals kill people andlivestock and destroy crops -- and thus are viewed as anuisance. At the same time, their ivory, horns and skinscommand high prices. It is little wonder that locals oftenwork for the elimination of wild animals.   Believing that markets are the heart of the problem, manyenvironmental groups advocate suppressing markets and pricesand substituting an &quot;environmental ethic.&quot; For example, manygovernments -- taking their lead from such groups -- havesigned the treaty that bans the ivory trade in order to saveelephants.   Such approaches, however, offer little hope for long-termsuccess. Fidelis Lungu, a wildlife manager in Zambia, tellsabout his experience taking an elephant poacher to court. Thejudge asked several local villagers to testify. When askedwhy they helped the poacher, one man responded that hereceived a bag of sugar; another, that he received a pair ofpants. Under subsistence conditions, an environmental ethiceasily gives way to survival.   While visiting researchers with the World Wildlife Fund'sMultispecies Project in Zimbabwe, I learned about analternative to trade bans. Zimbabwe's Department of NationalParks and Wild Life Management has developed a program thatshifts responsibility for wildlife management from the stateto local councils. Known as Campfire (Communal AreaManagement Program for Indigenous Resources), the program isbased on the principle that the benefits from wildlife mustgo to those who pay the financial and social costs of havingto coexist with wild animals: Locals are encouraged to&quot;profit&quot; from wildlife resources.   Campfire has been implemented by several Zambezi RiverValley councils, two of which illustrate the importance ofincentives.   The Nyaminyami District Council, which initiated theCampfire program in 1989, sold permits that year to hunt 14elephants, 82 cape buffalo and 26 lions and leopards. Thesepermits generated more than $120,000 in 1989. In addition,meat from sport hunting and herd reduction to controlpopulations was provided to the natives, and compensation fordamage to crops and livestock was paid.   A report from the World Wildlife Fund estimates that thetotal &quot;wildlife dividend&quot; in 1989 -- the profit from theseprograms -- increased household incomes by 15% to 25%. Thoughthe program is still in its infancy, it appears to reducepoaching and habitat destruction, as the local people beginto view wild animals as a valuable asset.   The nearby Guruve District Council, which also entered theprogram in 1989, has not fared as well, primarily because ithas not allowed local people to benefit much from theprogram. This council earned less profit than did theNyaminyami council, partly because it chose to divide itswildlife quota between its own communal safari company and aprivate one. Because of bureaucratic inefficiencies, thecouncil's safari company earned net profits that were 60%less than those earned by the private enterprise.   More significantly -- in contrast to the Nyaminyamidistrict, where compensation was paid for crop and livestockdamagethe locals in the Guruve district have received nocompensation. The council claims to have retained itsearnings from hunting in a &quot;reserve fund,&quot; which it says willbe invested in wildlife. But the locals who must bear thecost of living with the wildlife are seeing no immediatereturn. Because the wildlife benefit-cost ratio has notchanged, the World Wildlife Fund report concluded that thelocals &quot;will continue to regard wildlife as a liabilityrather than an asset, and act accordingly.&quot;   Wildlife in the U.S. could benefit from the innovations ofCampfire. Although some American ranchers are able to earnmoney from wildlife by charging fees for hunting access, inmost instances state agencies maintain control over wildlifemanagement. As a result, those who bear the cost -- such asranchers whose crops are eaten by deer and elk -- often havelittle opportunity for wildlife dividends.   An exception is the White Mountain Apache Reservation. Aslong as elk are within the Arizona reservation's boundaries,they are the responsibility of the tribe, and the tribe ismanaging the wildlife for profit. Careful monitoring ofanimals and their habitat has enabled tribal wildlifemanagers to sell about 50 permits a year for bull elk, at$15,000 each. (Even at that price they have a queue.) Therevenues and jobs provided to tribe members give them adirect incentive to husband their wild animals.   The lesson from these programs is clear: &quot;If it pays, itstays.&quot; By establishing a local proprietary interest inwildlife, including the ability to profit from it, it ispossible to sustain wild animal populations in the face ofdevelopment. What is economical is also ecological.   ---   Mr. Anderson, an associate of the Political EconomyResearch Center in Bozeman, Mont., is co-author of &quot;FreeMarket Environmentalism&quot; (Pacific Research Institute andWestview Press, 1991).</TEXT></DOC>
