Background</ITAG>On April 25, 1985, EPA proposed to amend the regulations for hazardouswaste management under RCRA by listing as hazardous two wastes generatedduring the production of methyl bromide.\1\<NOTE/> (See 50 FR 16432-16436.) These wastes were proposed as: (1)Wastewater from the reactor and acid dryer from the production of methylbromide (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K131), and (2) spent adsorbent and wastewaterseparator solids from the production of methyl bromide (EPA Hazardous WasteNo. K132).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ It should be noted that the Hazardous and Solid WasteAmendments of 1984 require the Agency to make a determination as to whetherwastes from organobromine manufacturing should be listed as hazardous.This regulation is promulgated in accordance with that requirement.The hazardous constituents of concern in these wastes are methyl bromideand dimethly sulfate. Methyl bromide causes numerous acute and chroniceffects. Acute effects include convulsions and seizures in humans, centralnervous system depression, human fatalities due to pulmonary edema, andpsychic, motor, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Chronic effects includehyperplasia of the fore-stomach of rats, direct damage to the brain cortexand peripheral axons of humans, and pathological changes in animal kidneys,parathyroid glands, and thyroid glands. Dimethyl sulfate is toxic and hasbeen demonstrated to be carcinogenic in a variety of test animals.Methyl bromide is found at levels up to 5% in waste K131 and at levelsup to 1.5% in waste K132. Dimethyl sulfate is found at levels up to 0.5%in waste K131. Because of their moderate solubilities in water and highsolubilities in organic solvents, these constituents are expected to migratefrom the wastes and to be mobile in the environment. In addition, dataare available which indicate that methyl bromide and dimethyl sulfate maypersist in the environment and reach environmental receptors in harmfulconcentrations, thereby posing a significant hazard if these wastes aremismanaged. Furthermore, waste K131 is corrosive. (See the preamble tothe proposed rule at 50 FR 16432-36 for a more detailed explanation ofour basis for listing these wastes.)After evaluating these wastes against the criteria for listing hazardouswastes (40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)), and for the reasons stated in the preambleto the proposed rule, EPA has determined that these wastes are hazardousbecause they are capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazardto human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported,disposed of, or otherwise managed.The Agency received several comments on these proposed waste listings.We have evaluated these comments carefully, and conclude that they do notrefute our justification for listing these wastes as hazardous. This noticemakes final the regulation proposed on April 25, 1985, and provides EPA'sresponse to the comments received on that proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments</ITAG>This section presents the comments received on the proposed rule, as wellas the Agency's response. Comments were received from a manufacturer ofmethyl bromide.A. Comments on the Description of the Manufacturing ProcessThe commenter stated that the process described in the listing backgrounddocument does not address the process they employ to produce methyl bromide.In particular, they argue that methyl bromide is produced at their plantas a co-product in the tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) process. In the commenter'sprocess, hydrobromic acid (HBr) is produced as a co-product in TBBPA productionand subsequently methylated to produce methyl bromide. They state thatthe hydrobromic acid is not produced <T3>in situ </T3>by reacting with either sulfur or sulfur dioxide as describedin the listing background document.The Agency disagrees with the commenter that their process is not describedin the listing background document. The listing background document describestwo typical production processes for methyl bromide. The first processdescribed involves the reaction of methanol with hydrobromic acid. Thisis, in fact, the process used at the production facility of the commenter,where hydrobromic acid is produced as a by-product from the manufactureof another chemical, and then methylated to produce methyl bromide.The Agency never intended to exclude from the listing wastes that are generatedfrom methyl bromide production where it is produced along with anotherproduct, namely TBBPA. In fact, the listing background document clearlystates, ``Hydrobromic acid is often produced as a by-product of a differentprocess at a plant so it can be added directly as feedstock to the reactor.''We believe that the production of co-products along with methyl bromidedoes not alter the fact that the wastes generated by the process will stillcontain the toxic constituents at levels of concern. Analytical data submittedby this commenter and others who produce methyl bromide along with a co-productalso supports our contention that these wastes contain significant concentrationsof methyl bromide.The background document has been revised to more clearly describe the differentmanufacturing processes for methyl bromide that are subject to the hazardouswaste listing.B. Comments on Individual Waste Streams<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Wastewater From the Reactor</ITAG>The commenter provided several rationales to support their claim that thewastewaters generated from their methyl bromide-TBBPA co-production processwould not be covered by the K131 listing description. ``Wastewater fromthe reactor * * * from the production of methyl bromide.'' The Agency'sresponse to these comments is provided below.a. <T3>Generation source of wastewater.</T3> The commenter claimed that theirprocess wastewater is not discharged directly from the methyl bromide processreactor. Instead, their reactor wastewater is carried along through a precipitationand filtration step before it is removed from the process and sent to thedistillation column for treatment. The commenter argued that the sourceof this wastewater, therefore, was not the methyl bromide reactor.The Agency disagrees with the interpretation that the wastewater generatedby the commenter's facility does not meet the listing description for ``reactorwastewater.'' In the commenter's process, wastewater is generated in themethyl bromide production reactor. This wastewater, therefore, is properlydesignated as wastewater <T3>from </T3> the methyl bromide reactor. The additional product recoverysteps described by the commenter through which this wastewater is carrieddoes not alter the fact that the original source of the wastewater is themethyl bromide reactor. Furthermore, the commenter supplied informationthat this wastewater is removed from the process line prior to the productionof any other product, such as the commenter's subsequent manufacture ofTBBPA. As a result, the source of this wastewater cannot be claimed tobe from a production process other than the methyl bromide process. Thewastewater leaving the commenter's precipitation and treatment steps clearlymeets the listing description, and full notice of this fact was provided.b. <T3>Effective treatment of wastewater. </T3>The commenter further statedthat they have a patented treatment process to remove hazardous constituentsfrom their wastwater stream discussed above. In support of their position,the commenter provided a copy of an inter-office memorandum which statedthat the wastewater stream after this treatment process contained 5 ppmor less methyl bromide, the detection limit of the analytical method used.As a result, the commenter contends that the wastewater no longer containedsignificant concentrations of toxic constituents, and suggests that theirwastewater should be excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste.The Agency does not consider the information submitted by the commenterto be adequate as a basis for excluding this waste, after such treatment,from the listing description. First, the actual concentration of methylbromide remaining in the wastewater after treatment could have been ashigh as the detection limit, 5 ppm. Without more definitive analyticalcharacterization of this waste, the Agency cannot make a determinationas to whether or not it would present a potential hazard to human healthand the environment. In addition, the Agency has inadequate informationon the commenter's test methods, how the samples were collected, or theQA/QC used. If the commenter wishes to provide further evidence to demonstratethat their treated wastewater should be excluded from regulation, theyshould submit a delisting petition pursuant to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22.(See ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Wastes: A Guidance Manual,'' NTISPB-85-194488, available from: NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,VA 22161 (request by telephone at (703) 487-4650) for a detailed discussionon the type of information and data that should be included in the petition.)C. <T3>Reuse of wastewater after treatment in another process. </T3>The commenterfurther argued that their methyl bromide process wastewater would be exemptfrom the K131 listing description since, after wastewater treatment, thewastewater is ``recycled to process.'' In fact, the wastewater is injectedinto the ground to extract brine.The Agency does not consider the reuse of the wastewater described by thecommenter to be a reclamation or reuse activity subject to the exemptionfrom regulation as a solid waste. The Agency notes that this form of ``recycling''is use constituting disposal, and therefore not subject to the exemptionfrom the definition of a solid waste. (See 40 CFR 261.2(c)(1)(A).)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Spent Sulfuric Acid</ITAG>a. <T3>Exemption of reclaimed sulfuric acid. </T3>The commenter stated thattheir process does not produce a waste sulfuric acid stream as describedin the listing background document. Instead, the acid is first strippedto remove methyl bromide, and then returned to the supplier to be usedto produce virgin sulfuric acid. They argue, therefore, that this streamis not a solid waste by virtue of 40 CFR 261.4(a)(7), which excludes spentsulfuric acid used to produce virgin sulfuric acid, unless it is accumulatedspeculatively.Although the Agency agrees that the spent acid, after stripping, meetsthe description of 40 CFR 261.4(a)(7), the Agency notes that the commenter'sspent sulfuric acid, which meets the K131 listing description as generated,is not used to produce virgin sulfuric acid until after treatment to removemethyl bromide. The Agency believes that such reclamation is treatmentof a hazardous waste (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the spent sulfuric acid as generated).The specific exemption for spent sulfuric acid was meant to apply onlyto spent sulfuric acid that is used as a feedstock ingredient in the productionof virgin sulfuric acid, by introduction into the original sulfuric acidproduction process. (A discussion of the types of sulfuric acid reclamationprocesses intended for the exemption may be found in paragraph 6, column1, of 50 <T3>FR</T3> 642.) In this case, the spent sulfuric acid is not exempt asgenerated since it is not suitable for feedstock in sulfuric acid production,<T3>i.e.,</T3> it must be stripped of methyl bromide prior to being suitablefor introduction into the sulfuric acid production process. Thus, any timethe spent sulfuric acid stream is generated, it is a hazardous waste untilstripped to produce feedstock for virgin sulfuric acid production.Also, the Agency clarifies that waste K131, as defined in the proposal,includes both the reactor wastewater stream and the acid dryer stream,either as separate wastes or combined. In order to clarify this point (<T3>i.e.,</T3> that waste K131 includes the sulfuric acid stream), however,we have modified EPA Hazardous Waste No. K131 to read, ``Wastewater fromthe reactor and spent sulfuric acid from the acid dryer from the productionof methyl bromide.''b. <T3>Concentrations of dimethyl sulfate and methyl hydrogen sulfate.</T3>In addition, the commenter states that this waste stream does not containsignificant amounts of dimethyl sulfate, the hazardous constituent of thiswaste; it does, however, contain methyl hydrogen sulfate, which the commenterstates is non-toxic, and is destroyed in the reclamation furnace.The Agency does not believe that the commenter has supplied any evidenceto sustantiate the contention that the sulfuric acid stream prior to strippingcontains dimethyl sulfate at concentrations that would not be significantin terms of potential hazards to human health and the environment. If thecommenter wishes to provide further evidence to demonstrate that theirwaste should be excluded from regulation, they should submit a delistingpetition pursuant to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22.Regarding the commenter's point about methyl hydrogen sulfate, the Agencyagrees that there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate thatit is toxic. Therefore, it was not included as a constituent of concernfor this waste. As we stated in the proposed rule, however, the waste doescontain considerable amounts of methyl hydrogen sulfate (up to 25%). Sincemethyl hydrogen sulfate is an acid similar to sulfuric acid, this wasteis expected to exhibit the corrosivity characteristic specified in 40 CFR261.22.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Spent Alumina Adsorbent</ITAG>The commenter stated that their spent alumina is steam-stripped to removemethyl bromide before the adsorbent is removed from the purification column.The spent alumina was analyzed after stripping and before landfilling,and no methyl bromide was detected (at a detection limit of 5 ppm). Thecommenter cited as evidence the same inter-office memorandum as was citedin their comment on wastewater from the reactor.The Agency has reviewed the evidence submitted by the comments and hasconcluded that the spent alumina contains significant amounts of methylbromide before steam-stripping. Insufficient data was provided to determinewhether this procedure sufficiently cleans the alumina so that the wasteleaving the column would contain insignificant concentrations of hazardousconstituents so as to allow an exclusion of the stripped (derived from)waste from the regulation. In particular, the Agency has inadequate informationon the commenter's test methods, how the samples were collected, or theQA/QC used. If the commenter wishes to provide further evidence to demonstratethat their waste should be excluded from regulation, they should submita delisting petition pursuant to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22. (See ``Petitionsto Delist Hazardous Wastes: A Guidance Manual,'' NTIS andplusmin;PB-85-194488,available from: NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (requestby telephone at (703) 487-4650) for a detailed discussion of the type ofinformation and data that should be included in the petition.) Becausethe stripped absorbants are landfilled, there is no question that the absorbantsbefore such treatment (stripping) are solid wastes.C. MismanagementThe commenter believes that the listing background document is misleading,and that it implies that they mismanaged their methyl bromide wastes, resultingin air pollution incidents around its plant in Magnolia, Arkansas. Thecommenter stated that it did not begin producing methyl bromide at theMagnolia, Arkansas plant until December, 1983.EPA had no intention of implying that mismanagement of methyl bromide wastesby the commenter resulted in air pollution incidents. It was stated thatmethyl bromide was found in trace quantities around several plants, oneof which was the commenter's plant in Magnolia, Arkansas. In fact, thelisting background document specifically states that the data cannot bedirectly correlated with industrial practices. Moreover, the Agency hasconcluded that the source of the methyl bromide could not be determined.To further clarify this point, however, we have moved this discussion fromthe mismanagement section to the environmental fate and transport sectionof the listing background document to show the persistance of methyl bromide.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Relation to Other Regulations</ITAG>A. Proposed Toxicity CharacteristicAs one of the mandates of HSWA, the Agency proposed to expand the toxicitycharacteristic (TC) by including additional chemicals. Once promulgated,the TC might capture wastes generated by the methyl bromide industry thatare not covered by wastes K131 and K132. Such wastes could include wastewatersand wasterwater treatment sludges.B. Land Disposal RestrictionsHSWA mandated the land disposal restrictions for waste listed prior tothe enactment of HSWA under a specific schedule (see 3004(g)(4)(c)). Ifthe Agency failed to prohibit the wastes within the period specified, thewastes were restricted from land disposal. HSWA also requires the Agencyto make a land disposal prohibition determination for any hazardous wastethat is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR part 261 after November 8,1984 within six months of the data of identification or listing (RCRC section3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). However, the statue does not providefor an automatice prohibition of the land disposal of such wastes if EPAfails to meet this deadline. The Agency is evaluating treatment standardsfor newly listed wastes K131 and K132 and will propose such standard inthe future.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Test Methods for New Appendix VII Compounds</ITAG>Appendix III of 40 CFR part 261 is a list of test methods that are approvedfor use in demonstrating that the constituents of concern in listed wastesare not present at concentrations of concern. The approved methods formethy bromide are 8010, 8240, and 8260.The purposed listing (50 FR 16432) suggested use of Method 8250 for theanalysis of dimethyl sulfate in Hazardous Waste No. K131. Because mostcommercial laboratories now prefer to use capillary column chromatographyto improve the chromatographic resolution, we are also adding Method 8270to the list of those suitable for analyzing dimethyl sulfate. The differencebetween these two methods is the use of a capillary column gas chromatographytechnique instead of a packed column technique.Persons wishing to submit delisting petitions must use these methods todemonstrate the concentration of methyl bromide and/or dimethyl sulfatein their wastes.\2\<NOTE/> (See 40 CFR 260.22(d)(1).) As part of their petitions, petitionersshall submit quality control data demonstrating that the methods they haveused yield acceptable recoveries (<T3>i.e.,</T3> &quot;80% recovery at concentrations above 1 ug/g) on spikedaliquots of their waste.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Petitioners may use other test methods to analyze formethyl bromide or dimethyl sulfate if, among other things, they demonstratethe equivalency of these methods by submitting their quality control andassurance information along with their analysis data. (See 40 CFR 260.21.)The above methods are in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/ChemicalMethods,'' SW-846, 3rd Ed., available from: Superintendent of Documents,Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, (202) 783-3238, DocumentNumber: 055-002-81001-2.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. CERCLA Designation and Adjustment</ITAG>All hazardous wastes regulated under a RCRA hazardous waste number arehazardous substances under section 101(14)(C) of the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA).Under section 103(a) of CERCLA, notification must be made to the Federalgovernment of a release of any CERCLA hazardous substance in an amountequal to or greater than the reportable quantity (RQ) assigned to thatsubstance.3<NOTE/> Pursuant to section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous wastesnewly listed under RCRA will have a statutorily imposed RQ of one poundunless and until adjusted by regulation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>3 See 40 CFR part 302 for the list of CERCLA hazardous substancesand their RQs, as amended August 14, 1989, 54 FR 33418 and 54 FR 33426.If the person in charge of a vessel or facility from which a RCRA hazardouswaste containing CERCLA hazardous substances is released knows the percentagecomposition of the waste, then the ``mixture rule'' (40 CFR 302.6(b)) maybe applied. Under the mixture rule, releases of mixtures and solutionsare subject to CERCLA reporting requirements only where a component hazardoussubstance of the mixture or solution is released in a quantity equal toor greater than its RQ (40 CFR 302.6(b)). If the concentrations of allof the hazardous constituents present in the mixture are not known, reportingis required if the total quantity released equals or exceeds the lowestRQ of any of the hazardous constituents.Adjustments from the statutory RQs established under section 102 are basedupon an adjustment methodology described in the final rule adjusting theRQs of 340 hazardous substances. (See 54 FR 33426 (August 14, 1989).) Theadjusted RQs for newly listed wastes are based upon the RQs of the ``hazardousconstituents'' identified under RCRA with respect to the new hazardouswaste. Thus, if a newly listed hazardous waste has only one constituentof concern, the waste will have the same RQ as that of the constituent.If the waste has more than one constituent of concern, the lowest RQ assignedto any one of the constituents present in the waste stream is the RQ assignedto the waste.Under section 102 of CERCLA, all hazardous wastes newly designated underRCRA will have a statutorily-imposed RQ of one pound unless and until adjustedby regulation under CERCLA. In order to coordinate the RCRA and CERCLArulemaking with respect to new waste listings, the Agency proposed regulatoryamendments under CERCLA authority in connection with listing to: (1) Designatewastes K131 and K132 as hazardous substances under section 102 of CERCLA;and (2) adjust the RQs of waste K131 to one pound (1 lb.) and waste K132to one thousand pounds (1,000 lbs.), based on the application of the RQadjustment methodology under section 102(a).The RQs for each waste and for each of the hazardous constituents are identifiedin the table below. One of the constituents of concern, dimethyl sulfate,has an RQ that has now undergone adjustment since the April 25, 1985 proposedlisting of methyl bromide production wastes, and was finalized in the August14, 1989 final rulemaking (54 FR 33426). The final RQ of waste K131 hasthus been changed based on the outcome of this rulemaking from one poundto 100 pounds.The adjustment of the RQs of wastes K131 and K132 from the statutory one-poundlevel is based on the current RQs of the constituents in these listings.Because the constituent in waste K131 with the lowest RQ is dimethyl sulfate,with an RQ of 100 pounds, the RQ of waste K131 is 100 pounds. Because theconstituent in waste K132 with the lowest RQ is methyl bromide, with anRQ of 1,000 pounds, the RQ of waste K132 is 1,000 pounds. These RQs willbecome effective on the effective date of today's action, when the wastessimultaneously become hazardous substances under CERCLA.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Hazardous substance</H1><H1>Constituent</H1><H1/><T3>RQ</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Waste No. K131<D/><D>100 lbs.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Dimethyl sulfate</D><D>100 lbs.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Methyl bromide</D><D>1,000 lbs.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Waste No. K132<D/><D>1,000 lbs.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Methyl bromide</D><D>1,000 lbs.</D></ITAG>Finally, although each listed hazardous waste automatically becomes a hazardoussubstance under CERCLA section 101(14), the Agency also has authority toindependently designate hazardous substances under section 102. In orderto eliminate confusion over whether a released substance in a particularform is subject to CERCLA authority, the Agency designates under section102 all hazardous substances designated under the other statutes listedin section 101(14). Accordingly, the Agency in today's rule also is designatingwastes K131 and K132 as ``hazardous substances'' under CERCLA section 102.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR part 271 forthe standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization,EPA retains inspection and enforcement authority under sections 3007, 3008,3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcementresponsibility.Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States atthe same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, the HSWA applies in authorized Statesin the interim.Today's rule is promulgated pursuant to section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA, a provisionadded by the HSWA. Therefore, it has been added to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j),which identifies the Federal program requirements that are promulgatedpursuant to the HSWA, and that take effect in all States, regardless oftheir authorization status. States may apply for either interim or finalauthorization for the HSWA provisions identified in Table 1, as discussedin the following section of this preamble. Because EPA promulgated rulesregarding the timing for HSWA listings after this rule was proposed, theexisting regulatory time frames supercede the discussions in the preambleto the proposed rule.B. Effect on State AuthorizationsAs noted above, EPA will implement today's rule in authorized States untilthey modify their programs to adopt these rules, and the modification isapproved by EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to the HSWA,a State submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interimor final authorization under section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of regulations that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications undersection 3006(b) are described in 40 CFR 271.21. The same procedures shouldbe followed for section 3006(g)(2).Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. State programmodifications to conform to today's rule must be made by July 1, 1991,if only regulatory changes are necessary, or by July 1, 1992, if statutorychanges are necessary. See 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(iv) and 271.21(e)(2)(v).These deadlines can be extended in exceptional cases. See 40 CFR 271.21(e)(3).States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similarto those in today's rule. These State regulations have not been assessedagainst the Federal regulations being promulgated today to determine whetherthey meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorizedto implement these regulations in lieu of EPA until the State program modificationis approved. Of course, States with existing regulations may continue toadminister and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law. In implementingthe Federal program, EPA will work with States under cooperative agreementsto minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able todefer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, ratherthan take separate actions under Federal authority.States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these standards in their applications.However, the State must modify its program by the deadlines set forth in40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standardsin their application. Section 271.3 sets forth the requirements a Statemust meet when submitting its final authorization application.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Compliance Dates</ITAG>A. NotificationUnder the Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980, (Pub. L. 96-452) EPAwas given the option of waiving the notification requirement under section3010 of RCRA following revision of the section 3001 regulations, at thediscretion of the Administrator.The Agency has decided not to require persons who generate, transport,treat, store, or dispose of these hazardous wastes to notify the Agencywithin 90 days of promulgation that they are managing these wastes. TheAgency views the notification requirement to be unnecessary in this casesince we believe that most, if not all, persons who manage these wasteshave already notified EPA and received an EPA identification number. Inthe event that any person who generates, transports, treats, stores, ordisposes of these wastes has not previously notified and received an identificationnumber, that person must get an identification number pursuant to 40 CFR262.12 before he can generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose of thesewastes.B. Interim StatusBecause HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized States at the sametime as in unauthorized States, EPA will regulate K131 and K132 until Statesare authorized to regulate these wastes. Thus, once this regulation becomeseffective, EPA will apply Federal regulations to these wastes and to theirmanagement in both authorized and unauthorized States. Facilities thattreat, store, or dispose of K131 and K132 but that have not received apermit pursuant to section 3005 of RCRA and are not operating pursuantto interim status, might be eligible for interim status under HSWA (seesection 3005(e)(1)(A)(ii) of RCRA, as amended). In order to operate pursuantto interim status, the eligible facilities are required to possess an EPAID number pursuant to 40 CFR 270.70(a), and will be required to submita part A permit application by April 6, 1990.Under section 3005(e)(3), by April 6, 1991, land disposal facilities qualifyingfor interim status under section 3005(e)(1)(A)(ii) also are required tosubmit a part B permit application and certify that the facility is incompliance with all applicable ground water monitoring and financial responsibilityrequirements. If the facility fails to do so, interim status will terminateon that date.All existing hazardous waste management facilities (as defined in 40 CFR270.2) that treat, store, or dispose of K131 and K132 and that are currentlyoperating pursuant to interim status under section 3005(e) of RCRA, willbe required to file with EPA an amended part A permit application by April6, 1990.Under current regulations, a hazardous waste management facility that hasreceived a permit pursuant to section 3005 is not able to treat, store,or dispose of K131 or K132 until a permit modification allowing such activityis approved in accordance with andSection; 270.42. Note that EPA has recentlyamended the permit modification requirements for newly listed or identifiedwastes. See 53 FR 37912 et seq. (September 28, 1988.)<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is``major'' and, therefore, subject to the requirements of a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis. In the proposed listing, EPA addressed this issue by citing theresults of an economic analysis; the total additional incurred cost formanaging these wastes as hazardous by the industry was estimated to beapproximately $23,000. The Agency received no comments on this figure.Since that time, the Agency has re-evaluated the total additional coststhat would be incurred for managing these wastes as hazardous by the industryas approximately $43,500.Since EPA does not expect that the amendments promulgated here will havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, will result ina measurable increase in costs or prices, or have an adverse impact onthe ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete in either domestic orforeign markets, these amendments are not considered to constitute a majoraction. As such, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however,if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.The hazardous wastes listed here are not generated by small entities (asdefined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act), and the Agency received nocomments that small entities will dispose of them in significant quantities.Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation,therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">X.
