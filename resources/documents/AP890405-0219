Company Pleads Guilty to South African Deal</HEAD><BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the first prosecution under a 1986anti-apartheid law, an aviation company and its chairman pleadedguilty Wednesday to importing four jet engines that were owned bySouth African Airways.   Air Ground Equipment Sales Inc. of West Babylon, N.Y., and itschairman, Robert Fessler, had been indicted Monday.   Their guilty pleas were part of an agreement with federalprosecutors, who said the case was the first prosecution under theComprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.   Fessler told U.S. District Judge Mark A. Costantino of Brooklynthat he had been negotiating to buy the engines from South AfricanAirways before the law was enacted. The company went ahead with thepurchase and shipped the engines to Israel, where a deal to sellthem to an Israeli company fell through, he said.   ``A business judgment was made to continue the deal after thelaw was enacted,'' Fessler said. The engines were shipped to theUnited States in August 1987.   ``I realized at the time we were dealing with a subsidiary ofthe South African government,'' he said after he pleaded guilty tothe charge.   The 1986 law bans the importation of goods ``grown, produced,manufactured by, marketed or otherwise imported'' by organizationsthat are part of or controlled by the South African government.Congress enacted the sanction in an effort to pressure SouthAfrica's white-minority government to modify its system of racialseparation.   As part of the plea agreement, three other counts in theindictment against Fessler are to be dismissed at sentencing June9. Fessler faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   The company entered its plea through an attorney, Jerry Markham.It pleaded guilty to the anti-apartheid law and customs fraud forusing falsified documents.   Air Ground agreed to pay a $1 million fine and forfeit theengines to the U.S. government. The engines, which are used inBoeing 747 jumbo jets, are valued at $1 million apiece.   The company buys, sells and leases airplane equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
