It is shown that tar sands and frontierdevelopments are constrained by high costs, natural gas is abundant butdevelopment is threatened by lower prices, and an improved economic andpolitical climate has resulted in increased oil exploration activityin Alberta and British Columbia. Coal is then discussed as a large potentialenergy source. After noting that Alberta's new coal policy may constrainnew coal developments for environmental reasons, a number of possibleroutes for such developments are mentioned. One is the use of coal toproduce low Btu gas, either for use as a fuel or as a feedstock to makeoil, methanol and ammonia. Production of such gas requires long leadtimes and large capital expenditures, and government policies are notnecessarily favorable to low Btu gas plants. Construction of such plantscan be justified on economic grounds, and use of such gas in petrochemicalor fertilizer plants could free natural gas for export. However, theincentive to consider coal gas as an energy source is low in Albertabecause of the low price and ready availability of natural gas; if coalgas is to be a realistic alternative, an appropriate national energypolicy, possibly including financial incentives, would be required.</TEXT></DOC>
