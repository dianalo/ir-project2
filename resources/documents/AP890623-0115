The findings suggest that modern techniques of treatingpost-traumatic stress syndrome, such as that suffered by Vietnam warveterans, may actually be aggravating the disorder instead of curingit, said Peretz Lavie, a psychology professor at Technion-IsraelInstitute of Technology in Haifa where the study was conducted.   In a paper prepared for presentation today at the annual meetingof the Association of Professional Sleep Societies, Lavie said astudy of a group of survivors of the Holocaust found those who werethe most healthy mentally had learned to suppress recall ofvirtually all dreams.   This, he said, was a defense mechanism against the awful memoriesof the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II.   These survivors also spent little time while awake thinking aboutthe wartime trauma and showed little interest in reviewing theirexperiences. Yet, when prompted, they could recall those days indetail.   ``These data suggest it is better to suppress some types oftrauma,'' Lavie said in an interview Thursday. ``It's better toforget it than to year after year expose them to the trauma throughtherapy.''   One Washington psychiatrist, defending the current conventionaltreatment, suggested that Lavie needed to prove his theory bytesting the alternative theories with matched sets of Holocaustsurvivors.   In the study, Lavie and an associate, Hanna Kaminer, used 23Holocaust survivors to investigate the long-term effects of mentaltrauma by recording the dreams recalled when awakened in the midstof deep sleep.   The group included 11 survivors who were determined by tests tohave adjusted very well to life after the war. The other 12continued to suffer the effects of the Holocaust with emotional andmental problems and general dissatisfaction with life.   For four consecutive nights, each of the subjects slept in alaboratory while their body processes, such as heart beat,respiration and brain activity, were monitored.   When slumber reached a point called rapid eye movement, or REM,sleep, they were awakened and asked to recount their dreams.   Previous studies have shown that most people awakened during REMsleep can recall dreams about 80 percent of the time.   ``The well-adjusted had only 30 percent dream recall,'' saidLavie. ``When we woke them up they denied dreaming. They weredisappointed that they couldn't remember any dreams because theytruly wanted to help our study.''   This group, he said, also ``had no sleep disturbanceswhatsoever,'' enjoying peaceful and untroubled sleep before andafter the awakenings.   The poorly adjusted Holocaust survivors, however, had a 60percent dream recall, and ``showed all the signs of post-traumaticstress disorders'' in their sleeping pattern, said Lavie.   ``There were multiple arousals, they suffered from difficulty infalling asleep and there were body movements,'' he said. ``But theyremembered twice the dreams than the well-adjusted did.''   Lavie said the few dreams recalled by the well-adjusted wereshort, simple and devoid of emotions.   ``The dreams of the poorly-adjusted included anxiety, regression_ inwardly directed. It was mostly all anxiety,'' he said.   Based on further tests, Lavie said it became evident thewell-adjusted survivors had coped with their Holocaust experience byavoiding the memory.   ``They sealed it off and this enabled them to go on with theirlife,'' said Lavie. ``This was the mechanism that allowed them tosurvive and adapt and adjust.''   The mechanism even included what the study called ``massive dreamrepression'' that protected against any unconscious recall of thedistressing memories.   Lavie said the study suggests that similar ``sealing off'' shouldbe taught to Vietnam and other war veterans who continue to sufferemotional traumas from their experiences.   Currently, he said, the practice is to treat such stressdisorders by forcing the patients to recall the trauma and to relivethe emotions. The idea is rather like lancing and draining a wound.   But Lavie said it may be better to seal the wound with mentalscar tissue and, instead, to teach the PTSD patient to forget.   ``We say that in some cases, repression is the key to cure,''said Lavie. ``We should stop all of the nonsense of going back overand over the trauma, and just treat them in the here-and-now anddivert their attention from the experience.''   Lavie said his group is now conducting research, using thesuppression technique, on veterans of the Israeli wars and hopes toconfirm this new method of treating PTSD.   Dr. Stephen M. Sonnenberg, a Washington psychiatrist and authorof the book ``The Trauma of War: Stress and Recovery in Viet NamVeterans,'' said he has not seen details of the sleep study, nortalked with Lavie.   But, he said, the theory of treating poorly adapted traumasurvivors by causing them to forget experiences ``runs counter tocurrent conventional wisdom among those who provide psychotherapyfor survivors.''   ``Most of us feel that the essence of treatment is in assistingthe survivor in thinking about the traumatic experience andmastering it,'' said Sonnenberg in a telephone interview.   He said that to test the Lavie's theory there should be matchedgroups of survivors treated in different ways, with one groupencouraged to remember their traumatic experiences and the otherencouraged to forget.   ``Only then would Dr. Lavie's hypothesis be reasonably tested,''said Sonnenberg.</TEXT></DOC>
