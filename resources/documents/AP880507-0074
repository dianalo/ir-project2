In Jerusalem, Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American ordered deported byIsrael for encouraging the Palestinian uprising, was on a hungerstrike in his jail cell, his wife, Nancy Nye, said.   She said Awad, 44, began the strike after being arrestedThursday night but revealed it to his attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,today.   Ms. Nye said prison officials took away Awad's mattress andblanket today ``as punishment for refusing to eat,'' but that herhusband planned to continue the action ``until the (deportation)order is rescinded.''   The United States protested the order and urged Israel toreconsider deporting Awad, an advocate of non-violent protests toend Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel accused Awad of playing a role in inciting the five-monthrebellion. According to U.N. figures, the uprising has claimed thelives of 184 Palestinians and two Israelis.   Violence broke out Friday night in the West Bank town ofTulkarem, an army spokesman and hospital officials said.   The army said troops on patrol in the town ran into a barricadeof burning tires and then fired live ammunition at an Arab-ownedautomobile that was heading away from the riot.   An Arab reporter in Tulkarem said a 40-year-old man driving thecar and a 24-year-old passenger suffered bullet wounds from theincident. He said the driver denied the soldiers gave any order tostop before firing. A third Arab was injured by broken glass.   The army said three injured people were taken to TulkaremHospital after the incident and that it was checking the source oftheir injuries.   Soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters who blocked a mainroad with boulders in Anabta, a town near Tulkarem, said the Arabreporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Hospital officials said a 25-year-old woman was treated afterbeing hit by four rubber bullets. The army said it was checking thereports.   Also today, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse protesters whothrew stones and blocked roads with burning tires in Rafah, Arabwitnesses said. They said teen-agers also burned tires in the cityof Gaza and in Khan Yunis.   The violence occurred hours after Moslem preachers distributedleaflets at morning prayers urging Palestinians to step up theuprising during the last 10 days of the holy month of Ramadan.   The leaflet was printed Friday by ``Hamas,'' an Arabic acronymfor the Islamic Resistance Movement, one of the undeground groupsleading the uprising.   Referring to Israel, the page-long flyer said ``the Zionistentity and collaborators and enemies of the nation try to silencethe voice of the intefadeh (Arabic for uprising).''   ``We will continue our intefadeh with all our strength anddetermination, whatever sacrifices are necessary,'' the leafletadded. ``More sacrifices, more attacks on the enemy, the enemy ofthe nation.''   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, several merchantsopened their shops but later obeyed military orders to shut them,witnesses said.   A leaflet issued by a PLO underground had urged the merchants toopen today in defiance of a military order which ordered thebusinesses closed through today.   The army edict was the latest attempt to break Palestinianobedience to underground leaders.   By Israeli law, Awad has three days to appeal to the SupremeCourt. Kuttab, Awad's lawyer,said an appeal is likely.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering asked an official in PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's office to reconsider the move, accordingto a State Department official in Washington.   Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, heads theJerusalem-based Center for Non-Violent Studies and has also servedas a spokesman for the Palestinian cause.   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Shamir, said Awad, ``beneath hisdisguise of non-violence ... is one of the most dangerous peopleworking behind the scenes of these riots.''   Shamir signed the deportation order, which prompted quickprotests from left-wing Israelis.   Awad issued a statement, saying he thought he was beingvictimized by Israeli extremists but believed coexistence betweenIsraelis and Palestinians was possible.   ``I also believe the Palestinians can get their rights throughnon-violence and a campaign of civil disobedience. This has beenthe message of the uprising,'' the statement said. ``It is a muchbetter way the our attempting to kill one another.''   Palestinian leaders of the uprising have adopted many of Awad'sstrategies for resistance, including commercial strikes, nonpaymentof taxes, and a boycott of Israeli products.</TEXT></DOC>
