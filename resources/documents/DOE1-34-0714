The publication is intendedto provide accurate and authoritative information on the recovery anduse of biomass fuels as an alternative to fossil fuels. The informationto be included will address areas of concern or interest: (1) fuel supply,(2) conversion technology and engineering, (3) environmental considerations,(4) economics and financing, and (5) specific equipment descriptionsand representative prices. A draft report The Biomass Energy ProjectGuide Book has been submitted and reviewed. As laid out, the handbookhas four main purposes: (1) to acquaint the readers with biomass fuelsand biomass energy projects, particularly those used in the Pacific Northwest(2) to explain how to assess the feasibility of using biomass fuels,(3) to present the steps involved in planning a biomass energy project,and (4) to point readers to sources of additional information.</TEXT></DOC>
