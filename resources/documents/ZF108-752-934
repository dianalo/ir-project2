(products).andO;Product:   Automate/Anytime (Utility program).andO;Topic:     EvaluationSchedulingForeground-Background ProcessingSoftware Packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AUTOMATION, ANY TIMEandM;Have you ever wished that someone could print out that big accounting reportin the middle of the night when it didn't tie up valuable PC time?andP;  Or thatyou could find someone to send out E-Mail memos when the phone rates are lessexpensive?andP;  Perhaps you want to find a way to back up your network serverwhen no one is working.andM;One possible solution is Automate/Anytime, from Atlanta-based ComplementarySolutions, Inc. Automate/Anytime, dubbed &quot;the invisible operator for yourPC,&quot; can become that &quot;someone&quot; to perform tasks at more convenient times, aswell as automate repetitive tasks.andM;The product combines a scheduler, a batch job function, a keyboard macrorecorder function and backup capabilities.andP;  These features provide a widerange of potential uses, from simple unattended backups to sophisticatedreport printing or database indexing operations.andM;At the heart of the program is a small memory-resident kernel that occupiesabout 20K of RAM.andP;  Once loaded, this kernel tracks all scheduled jobs, runsthem at their assigned time and then resumes whatever current operation (ifany) was in progress.andM;SIMPLE MENUandM;Automate/Anytime has an extremely simple menu structure with only three mainoptions: Schedule, Jobs, Job Setup and Configuration.andM;To create a job, you select from either batch, keyboard or a compressedbackup job.andP;  A batch job can be any series of commands that are executablefrom the DOS prompt.andM;There is a 100-command limit.andP;  However, it is unlikely that one would want tocreate a job involving more than 100 DOS-based commands.andP;  The program willnot support pauses in this mode, so that any command requiring a wait forkeyboard input will terminate (or at least suspend) the job execution.andM;In the keyboard macro mode, Automate/Anytime allows the recording of anykeystroke sequence, along with the length of time between each command (ortime-dependent operations).andP;  Recording can be suspended and restarted whenrecording a macro sequence, and any time pauses are supported in this mode.andM;The program includes its own file/compression backup function that allowsfiles to be backed up to any logical DOS device.andP;  It can also be used inconjunction with other commercial backup programs as a front end to scheduleunattended backups.andP;  Because the front end for the backup feature is the sameas the simple front end for the rest of the program, some users might findthat the product is worth considering just for its backup ability.andM;Viable uses for Automate/Anytime go well beyond the backup function, however.andO;The product has a straightforward, flexible scheduling function.andP;  Jobs can beset for any time during the day; multiple jobs can be scheduled; andpriorities can be set for jobs.andM;For example, you could set up Automate/Anytime to reindex a large dBase fileevery night, backup all word processing files to your network server everyThursday evening, and print out a spreadsheet accounting report every Fridaymorning prior to business.andP;  You could also set it to run a disk optimizationprogram on your PC every Sunday, so that your PC is at optimum efficiency forthe work week.andM;Because the program can be used to run jobs while you are working at your PC,the keyboard macro facility can be used to reduce lengthy, but regularly usedkeystroke sequences to a single command.andM;One drawback to Automate/Anytime is the documentation, which is merelyadequate.andP;  Otherwise, this program can be put to effective use in almost anybusiness.andM;Automate/Anytime could prove to be well worth its $149 price in time saved.andM;Pepper is a freelance writer and computer consultant based in Sunderland,Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
