Here's what it got in return: a logistical and productionnightmare that will entail airing 116 hours of events from 13sites splayed across 600 square miles of rugged terrain. CBSmust do so in a time zone that will render prime-timecoverage less than &quot;live.&quot; Audiences will know the resultslong before they plop down in front of the TV set eachevening.</LP><TEXT>   The obstacles are as formidable as the French Alps thatsurround Albertville. CBS will spend $70 million more tocover the events, plus $10 million promoting its coverage inother media, plus millions more in on-the-air spots and otherexpenses. Analysts predict the network could end up with aloss of $3 million. The deficit could grow if CBS fails todeliver.   In return for the unprecedented spending spree at CBS, thenetwork also must pre-empt for 16 nights the No. 1 prime-timelineup in television, shunting aside such hits as &quot;MurphyBrown,&quot; &quot;Rescue 911&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and givingrivals an opportunity to steal away CBS fans who won't stickaround for the likes of the biathlon and the luge.   Undaunted, CBS has dispatched more than 800 staff members(including freelancers) and over 60 cameras to catch everyswoosh and swish. It hopes to turn the time-zone differenceinto a production asset, honing the most dramatic events intoa slick, three-hour show &quot;with a coherent beginning, middleand end,&quot; says Mark Harrington, vice president of Olympicscoverage for CBS Sports.   &quot;People want to watch even if they know who won. They wantto see the drama and the beauty, and that's what we're goingto bring them,&quot; he adds. While Albertville's goings-on willoccur six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, &quot;we do hopeto keep some suspense.&quot; Tim McCarver from CBS Sports andPaula Zahn, on loan from &quot;CBS This Morning,&quot; will co-host thenightly show.   The time difference also will let CBS avoid getting boggeddown in a boring event and free the network from the vagariesof weather. In December, Albertville had its worst snowstormin almost 50 years. ABC's coverage of the 1988 Winter Gamesin Calgary was thrown into turmoil several times because ofheavy winds that delayed downhill skiing.   &quot;We have to be ready for anything -- and we are,&quot; says Mr.Harrington. He notes happily that 10 nights of figure-skatingcompetition, the most popular event among women, take placeindoors.   All of this is a far cry from 1960, the most recent timeCBS aired the Winter Olympics. Back then, newsman WalterCronkite anchored the proceedings and CBS ponied up a mere$50,000 for broadcast rights, covering the events with only12 cameras. Since then, ABC Sports has dominated Olympicscoverage, pioneering the &quot;up close and personal&quot; approach.   CBS Sports won't stray from that pattern. Its prime-timeshows will be heavily peppered with profiles -- CBS alreadyhas over 150 taped pieces -- and backgrounders on the varioussports. CBS News stars including &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondentMike Wallace will file reports on weightier issues, includingdrug use.   The network is gambling mightily on Albertville. CBS willair 21 1/2 more hours than ABC aired in 1988 and hasguaranteed advertisers that 17% of U.S. homes with TV setswill watch during prime time. CBS averages a 13% prime-timerating for its regular programming; for the 1988 WinterGames, ABC averaged 19.5%.   If CBS fails to deliver the guaranteed numbers, it wouldbe forced to provide so-called makegoods, giving free spotsto sponsors on later telecasts.   Some 50 hours of CBS's 116-hour total will air in primetime, with the balance coming in other parts of the day. Inthe afternoon, live coverage will be handled by TurnerBroadcasting System Inc.'s TNT cable network, which paid CBS$50 million to cover some lesser events of the 1992 and 1994Winter games. TNT will telecast five hours each weekdayafternoon, when CBS airs its menu of soap operas.   CBS, however, says its cable rival won't dilute its ownratings. &quot;If anything, it'll build excitement,&quot; says CBS'sMr. Harrington. TNT is prohibited from covering the reallygood, nail-biting stuff, but Kevin O'Malley, senior vicepresident for Turner Sports, tries to put a nice shine onthat limitation. &quot;We can show events unfold live and exposeAmericans to sports they may not be that familiar with.&quot;   For instance, curling. The sport, a &quot;demonstration&quot; in thefirst Winter Olympics in 1924, is bowling meets shuffleboard.The athletes use brooms to sweep a &quot;stone&quot; across a sheet ofice that is 146 feet long and 15 1/2 feet wide. TNT is theofficial curling network because CBS won't cover the event atall.   While Turner's TNT goes live with the little stuff, CBSwill have time &quot;to interview the winners and losers and puteach story in perspective,&quot; Mr. Harrington says.</TEXT></DOC>
