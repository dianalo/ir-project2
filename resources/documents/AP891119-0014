The census will determine whether Africa's most populous nationhas grown to 100 million people, as estimates say, and whether itis likely to become the world's third most populous country by themiddle of the next century, as some predict.   The census will be politically sensitive because regional andethnic groups reportedly inflate their numbers to gain power in thenational government.   Shehu Musa, the chairman of the National Population Commission,said the census will be conducted in October 1991, the News Agencyof Nigeria reported.   Musa said a trial census will be conducted in November 1990 toassess the commission's ability to make a fair count. The countrywill be divided into 10,000 areas for the purposes of the counting.</TEXT></DOC>
