The high court's decision blocks Genetics Institute, basedin Cambridge Mass., from selling its version oferythropoietin, or EPO, in the U.S. It gives Amgen, based inThousand Oaks, Calif., a legal monopoly over domestic EPOsales to kidney dialysis patients.</LP><TEXT>   EPO enables the human body to make red blood cells andthus is valuable in treating anemia, kidney failure and AIDS,among other afflictions.   Genetics Institute had hired Harvard University LawProfessor Laurence Tribe to represent it before the SupremeCourt in hopes of bolstering its case. However, the justicesrarely review technical patent issues decided by the federalcircuit, and Genetics Institute's chances of getting theSupreme Court to hear the case weren't considered good.   &quot;We're obviously pleased by the decision of the court,&quot; aspokesman for Amgen said.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, GeneticsInstitute shares fell $1.375 to close at $38.125, while Amgenshares rose $2 to close at $54.875.   Despite the outcome of the U.S. patent case, GeneticsInstitute's version of EPO can be made overseas and isalready on sale in Europe and Japan.   A spokeswoman for Genetics Institute said its executiveswere &quot;disappointed, but not surprised&quot; the high court didn'treview the patent case. She also said the court's rejection&quot;doesn't change anything for us financially or operationally&quot;and that the company had already accounted for the setback asa charge against earnings.   Genetics Institute took a charge in the first quarterended Feb. 28 that included $11 million for litigation costsrelated to the EPO case.   Linda Miller, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, said Geneticshas several other promising products well along indevelopment, including recombinant Factor VIII, a bloodfactor that stops bleeding in hemophilia. &quot;They are ready tomove on,&quot; she says.   Genetics Institute agreed to sell a 60% stake to AmericanHome Products Corp. last month in a transaction valued at$666 million.</TEXT></DOC>
