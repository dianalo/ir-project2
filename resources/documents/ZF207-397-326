 In HP8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer systems, these transitions are provided bythe HP 83400 family of lightwave sources and receivers, which are designedfor easy integration into HP 8702A measurement systems.andP;  Power supplyconnections, RF connections, signal levels, and calibration data are alldesigned for direct compatibility with the HP 8702A, which is the signalprocessing unit in the system.andM;To date, four lightwave sources and two lightwave receivers have beenreleased.andP;  They are:andM;* HP 83400A Lightwave Source--1300 nm, 3-GHz modulation, single-mode9/125-[mu]m fiberandM;* HP d83401A Lightwave Source--1300 nm, 3-GHz modulation, multimode50/125-[mu]m fiberandM;* HP 83402A Lightwave Source--1300 nm, 6-GHz modulation, single-mode9/125-[mu]m fiberandM;* HP 83403A Lightwave Source--1550 nm, 3-GHz modulation, single-mode9/125-[mu]m fiberandM;* HP 83410B Lightwave Receiver--1300 or 1550 nm, 3-GHz modulation, multimode62.5/125-[mu]m fiberandM;* HP 83411A Lightwave Receiver--1300 or 1550 nm, 6-GHz modulation,single-mode 9/125-[mu]m fiber.andM;Source Design and OperationandM;The signal path through each source starts at the rear-panel RF connector andproceeds through a matching circuit, an RF attenuator.andP;  The attenuator outputis transformed into a modulated light signal by a laser diode.andP;  The opticallaser output signal is transmitted through a short piece of optical fiber tothe front-panel connector (see Fig.andP;  1).andM;Power for the source is supplied from the probe power jacks on the frontpanel of the HP 8702A.andP;  Bias current requirements of the internal componentsexceed the 400 mA available from this 15V supply, so each source includes adc-to-dc converter, which changes the supply to 3V, 1A for the thermoelectricheat pumpandM;It was decided to use a laser diode rather than an LED as the source elementto take advantage of laser diodes' high modulation-rate capability, highpower, and narrow optical spectrum.andP;  Lasers are, however, fairly sensitive totemperature variations.andP;  Output power and wavelength vary as a function oftemperature.andP;  The lifetime of the laser is affected by the temperature of theenvironment as well.andP;  The degradation of operating life as the diode junctiontemperature is increased is shown in Fig.andP;  2.andM;To help minimize these temperature effects, a thermal control loop is used toregulate the temperature of the laser to a constant 20[deg.]C.andP;  20[deg.]C waschosen to give optimum laser lifetime and temperature regulation range.andP;  Thethermoelectric heat pump has a range of cooling of approximately 40[deg.]C.andO;The thermal loop maintains the temperature of 20[deg.]C within 0.1[deg.]Cover the specified environmental temperature range of 0[deg.]C to 55[deg.]C.andM;The laser diode and a temperature sensor are both mounted on the surface ofthe thermoelectric heat pump.andP;  A voltage proportional to the temperature ofthis surface is generated by the sensor and external circuitry and thenapplied to an integrator as an error signal.andP;  The integrator output serves asa control signal for the 70-kHz pulse width modulated current controlcircuit.andP;  The output of this circuit goes to an H-bridge (see Fig.andP;  3) whichdirects current through the thermoelectric heat pump in the proper sense toeither heat or cool the laser.andM;The laser operating point is set by another control loop (see Fig.andP;  4)consisting of a photodiode, an amplifier, and the laser bias current source.andM;The laser diode chip has a front facet and a back facet from which light isemitted.andP;  The front-facet light is coupled into the fiber and goes to thefront-panel connector.andP;  The back-facet light is coupled into a photodiode togenerate a current proportional to the emitted light.andP;  The bias controlcircuit receives this current and generates an error voltage, which controlsthe laser bias current source.andP;  The control loop's bandwidth is limited towell below the applied RF frequencies.andM;It is not desirable for the modulating signal to drive the laser current toits threshold value, since this would cause clipping of the optical signal.andO;I.sub.threshold is the current at which the laser diode begins the lasingoperation, that is, when the laser bias current is large enough to produce again that exceeds the losses in the laser cavity.andM;The dc transfer function of the laser diode is shown in Fig.andP;  5.andP;  At veryhigh diode current, a droop in laser output may occur.andP;  This phenomenon isknown as a kink.andP;  If the laser current is allowed to swing into this region,distortion of the modulation will occur.andP;  Therefore, the laser diodeoperation point is bounded by I.sub.threshold on the low end and the kinkregion on the high end.andM;RF modulation is applied to the laser through a dc blocking capacitor and anRF attenuator.andP;  An impedance matching network is included to match the50[omega] input to the laser impedance (Fig.andP;  6).andP;  Some adjustment of thelaser transfer function is accomplished by varying the RF attenuator to matchthe RF swing to the individual laser.andM;The impedance matching network matches the low-impedance laser diode to50[omega].andP;  A variable capacitor is included in the matching network toflatten the modulation frequency response of the laser.andP;  Adjustment of thiscapacitor results in a typical frequency response flatness of[plus-or-minus]1 dB to 3 GHz.andM;The source microcircuit package is a straightforward deep-well design.andP;  Thelaser package is retained in the microcircuit package by two wedging clampswhich force it against x-axis and y-axis datum surfaces while keeping itsbottom surface pressed against the housing floor.andP;  This approach was chosento locate the laser precisely relative to the sapphire microcircuit whileensuring adequate heat sinking for the laser's internal thermoelectric heatpump.andP;  The thin-film microstrip circuit provides the RF interface between anSMA connector and the RF terminals of the laser package.andP;  An epoxy-glassprinted circuit board interconnects the dc terminals of the laser with thefiltered feedthroughs of the microcircuit package (Fig.andP;  7).andM;Receiver Design and OperationandM;The signal path through the receiver starts at the front-panel opticalconnector (see Fig.andP;  8).andP;  Once the modulated optical signal is inside thereceiver module, it travels through a short input fiber to the opticallaunch, where it is coupled to a pin photodiode chip.andP;  The output of thephotodiode is an alternating current at the same frequency as the modulation.andO;This signal is amplified by a transimpedance amplifier.andP;  The output of theamplifier is routed to the back panel of the receiver by a short length ofcoaxial cable.andM;While simple in concept, the optical launch is difficult to realize becauseof the dimensions and parameters of the components involved.andP;  The mostobvious approach, launching the light directly from the fiber end, was triedfirst.andP;  This approach was abandoned because of poor and inconsistentperformance, fragility, and difficult assembly.andP;  The final design, whichoffers numerous advantanges, is shown in Fig.andP;  9.andM;A graded-index (GRIN) lens is the primary optical element in the launch.andO;Whereas normal lenses (e.g., planoconvex) use material with a constant indexof refraction material and curved surfaces to refract light, graded-indexlenses have flat end faces and refract light by virtue of their quadraticallyvarying internal index of refraction.andM;The path of a light ray in a graded-index lens is sinusoidal.andP;  The length ofthe path is used to describe the fundamental parameter of the lens, known aspitch.andP;  If a light ray traces a sinusoid of 180 degrees, the lens is said tobe half-pitch.andP;  If the ray traces a sinusoid of 90 degrees, the lens is saidto be quarter-pitch, and so on.andM;The lens used in the lightwave receiver optical launch is just slightly lessthan half-pitch.andP;  Light enters the lens from the input fiber.andP;  It thendiverges along sinusoidal paths.andP;  About halfway through the lens the lightbeam is collimated and is at its maximum width.andP;  Past this point the beamstarts to converge.andP;  Just before the beam converges, it exits the lens.andO;After traveling a short distance through air, the beam converges and forms aninverted image of the input fiber on the face of the photodiode.andM;The GRIN lens is mounted in a machined ceramic cap.andP;  The ceramic cap waschosen to minimize the effect on the electrical performance of the microstripthin-film circuit.andP;  The ceramic material used provides a thermal match to thesapphire circuit.andP;  This is important since the cap is solidly attached to thecircuit.andM;Alignment of the optical launch and photodiode is critical if all of theincident light is to impinge on the small active area of the photodiodedetector.andP;  Misalignments on the order of a few micrometers can result insubstantial signal loss.andP;  Achieving this alignment solely through mechanicalprecision would have been difficult and expensive.andP;  Instead, alignmentaccuracy is achieved by using an interactive technique, as shown in Fig.andP;  10.andM;The interactive alignment technique works as follows.andP;  First, the receivermicrocircuit is placed in a test fixture and power is applied.andP;  An opticallaunch assembly consisting of a GRIN lens mounted in a ceramic cap is thencoarsely aligned with the photodiode.andP;  Modulated optical power is applied tothe GRIN lens by the test system lightwave source.andP;  Next, micropositionersare used to adjust the position of the optical launch while the output of thereceiver microcircuit is monitored by the HP 8702A.andP;  When the position of thelaunch assembly has been optimized for power output, the assembly is fastenedto the sapphire thin-film circuit.andM;The conversion from optical signal to electrical signal takes place at thepin photodiode.andP;  The photodiode is of a proprietary design, optimized forthis application.andP;  Some of its requirements are that it respond strongly tolight in the wavelengths of interest, have a flat frequency response that isuniform across its entire active area, have an active area large enough sothat all of the incident optical signal can be focused onto it, be linearover a wide range of input power, and possess good antireflection propertiesto keep reflected optical signals to a minimum.andM;The pin photodiode gets its name from its structure.andP;  The top layer is p-typesemiconductor, the middle layer is i-type or intrinsic semiconductor, and thebottom layer is n-type material.andP;  Photons enter the photodiode through thetop layer.andP;  The bandgap of the material is such that it appears transparentto the photons and they pass right through.andP;  An electrical signal isgenerated when photons are absorbed in the i layer of a reverse-biasedphotodiode, creating an electron-hole pair.andP;  A strong electric field thensweeps out the carriers, creating a current that is amplified and detected inthe HP 8702A Lightwave Component Analyzer.andM;Once the signal has been generated by the pin photodiode, it must betransferred into the measurement system.andP;  As is typical in high-frequencyapplications, the system uses 50-ohm terminations and coaxial cables.andM;Output impedance is one of the receiver parameters optimized to facilitatesystem integration.andP;  In a system where termination impedances are notwell-controlled, standing waves may result.andP;  Careful control of the receiveroutput impedance and the well-controlled input impedance of the HP 8702Aminimize these standing waves and the measurement errors they can cause.andM;The HP 83410B Lightwave Receiver also includes a trans-impedance amplifier toincrease signal strength.andP;  Specifications for the amplifier are derived fromHP 8702A system requirements.andP;  The fundamental specification of the amplifieris gain.andP;  A value for gain is arrived at by considering the output noise ofthe amplifier and the sensitivity of the HP 8702A's receiver.andP;  To realize thebest system performance with the least expense and complexity, the amplifierhas just enough gain so that its output noise is approximately equal to theinput sensitivity of the HP 8702A receiver.andP;  Any more amplification and thesensitivity of the HP 8702A receiver would be wasted; any less and the systemsensitivity would drop.andM;The amplifier is realized using thin-film circuit construction for optimumwideband frequency response.andP;  Silicon bipolar transistors are used instead ofGaAs FETs to minimize 1/f noise.andM;Mechanical ConsiderationsandM;It was felt that small, rugged modules would offer significant advantages tothe user in ease of positioning relative to the DUT and in environments suchas light tables, where space is at a premium and operation remote from theanalyzer is required.andP;  The die-cast housings offer the right combination ofsize and shape.andP;  When assembled to the modules' aluminum center body, orspine, (the modules' single structural component), these survived shock andvibration levels during strife testing that were ten times the qualificationtest levels.andP;  All components--microcircuits, printed circuit boards, fiberoptic and electrical I/O, and cabling--are mounted to the spine, which allowsfull assembly and testing of the modules before they are installed in theirrespective enclosures (Fig.andP;  11).andM;The fiber optic connector adapter system developed by HP's BoblingenInstrument Division is used on both source and receiver modules.andP;  Based onthe precision Diamond HMS-10/HP fiber optic connector,.sup.1 the design ofthese adapters allows easy access to the ferrule for cleaning, and allows theinternal HMS-10/HP connector to be mated to any of five different connectorsystems: HMS-10/HP, FC/PC, ST, biconic, and DIN.andP;  A hinged safety shutter isprovided on the source modules to comply with safety regulations in certainlocalities.andM;Assemblability evaluation method techniques were used throughout thedevelopment of the source and receiver modules.andP;  This method was an extremelyuseful tool in exposing hot spots in the mechanical design, areas where thenumber and/or complexity of the steps in an assembly operation make itparticularly difficult.andP;  Perhaps more important, it provided a simplestructured way of comparing designs and making rough estimates of their costof assembly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
