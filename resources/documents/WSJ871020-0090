The ministry sent notes to major commercial banks, regional banks and other financial institutions, as well as to local governmental authorities, asking them to tighten their monitoring of real-estate dealings.    Japanese land prices have soared largely because of speculation. Last May, as well as in December 1986, the ministry issued instructions to banks to restrain lending that could fuel speculative land dealings.    In its latest note, the ministry called on the financial institutions and local governments to make certain that real-estate loans are for transactions that have been certified by authorities as conforming with official regulations. The ministry also asked the institutions and governments to examine in detail the utilization of land where houses or other buildings are to be constructed.    Because of fears about inflation and excessive monetary growth, the central bank has been curbing commercial-bank lending. Financial sources said yesterday that Japanese banks are likely to raise their long-term prime rate above 6%, perhaps as high as 6.9%, from the current 5.7% before month's end. The rate is charged by banks on long-term loans to their best customers.    The sources said that discussions are being held within the three long-term credit banks -- Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. -- and that informal meetings with Finance Ministry officials also are taking place. </TEXT></DOC>
