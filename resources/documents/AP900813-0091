The ceremony, the first joint memorial of the Aug. 13, 1961,construction of the Berlin Wall, included a prediction by a localpolitician that the scar left by the crumbling barrier will neverend.   East German Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann demanded criminalprobes of those responsible for the shoot-to-kill orders at thewall under the former Communist regime.   Eppelmann said the now-ousted Communist officials must bebrought to justice ``in a fair way.''   Communist border soldiers killed 80 East Germans making dashesfor freedom at the wall, while hundreds of others were caught andimprisoned for trying.   Germans are engaged in an emotional debate over whether thesoldiers themselves should be brought to trial.   ``The open wound is closing,'' said prominent West Berlin citycouncilor Erich Paetzold at the ceremony. ``But a scar will lastforever.''   He spoke beside a rough-hewn cross erected in memory of18-year-old East Berlin worker Peter Fechter, who was shot and bledto death while trying to escape in 1962.   His death has come to symbolize the bitter separation thatfollowed the collapse of Nazi Germany after World War II.   East Germany's Communists suddenly started erecting the wall,stunning the world 29 years ago, to halt the flow of refugees tothe West.   Paetzold said a part of the wall will be preserved ``so that wedon't forget what happened here, so that no one forgets whathappened here.''   Despite Paetzold's promise, it may be difficult to find asuitable memorial site.   Many of the most famous stretches of the wall have been torndown since last fall's reforms swept East Germany and othercountries in Eastern Europe. Other sections have been hacked awayby entrepreneurs and souvenir-hunters.   East German and West German newspapers were filled withrecollections of the wall Monday.   They included a picture of the wall's mastermind, ErichHonecker, shown talking to East German troops the month after thewall was built.   Honecker ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ouster lastOctober.   Honecker, 77, is under investigation for possible murder chargesstemming from the deaths of those who tried to flee to the West.   On Nov. 9, Honecker's desperate successors opened the wall inhopes of halting another exodus that already numbered 200,000.   East Berlin's democratically elected mayor, Tino Schwierzina,reminded the 300 listeners at Monday's ceremony that the BerlinWall caused widespread suffering.   ``The situation in the German Democratic Republic makes thisincreasingly clear,'' Schwierzina said. ``We who are living behindthe almost disappeared wall need quick and effective help.''   Schwierzina said the nation's economy was in ``catastrophic''condition.   East German demands for money from Bonn have led to tensionsbetween the two countries as they head into the last stretch beforeunification, scheduled for December at latest.   The representatives of the two halves of Berlin spoke at a crossset up in honor of Fechter after his Aug. 17, 1962 death.   Fechter bled for nearly an hour before his body was hauled away.   ``Here where Peter Fechter died, we can feel how much sufferingthe wall caused,'' said the East Berlin mayor.   A weathered photograph of the young man lying in agony is tackedto the cross' dark wood. More than a dozen large flowerarrangements were placed by the cross.   Although the wall has disappeared there, windows on the Easternside still have the bars that kept people from jumping to freedomfrom nearby buildings.   In years past, the Communist East Germans marked the wall'sanniversary with bombastic military parades that drew the wrath ofthe Western Allies.   More than 2.5 million East Germans fled to the West from 1949until the wall went up.   Communist border soldiers killed more than 200 people attemptingto flee from East Berlin or other parts of East Germany to the West.</TEXT></DOC>
