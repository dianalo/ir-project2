HuntStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> JERUSALEM  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir assailed the prospect of a major U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia, suggesting instead that the Saudis rely on Israel for protection.    &quot;Until an Arab country is active in peace with Israel, it shouldn't get sophisticated U.S. weapons,&quot; the prime minister said in an interview just prior to the start of the Jewish new year. The Reagan administration is considering a major arms sale to the Saudis this autumn that would include F-15 jet fighters and Mavericks, which are air-to-ground missiles. Mr. Shamir criticized both proposed sales. The F-15s, he said, are &quot;the best aircraft in the world&quot; and the Mavericks are &quot;very efficient and very dangerous missiles.&quot;    The administration earlier this year was forced to withdraw a proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia in the face of strong opposition in Congress, which can block arms sales of more than $14 million. Continuing strong opposition from Israel's supporters in Congress has forced the administration in recent days to discuss a compromise that might include dropping the Maverick missiles.    Administration officials cite increased Persian Gulf tensions in recent weeks as the reason Saudi Arabia needs more U.S. weaponry to protect itself.    But Prime Minister Shamir dismissed the notion that the Saudis can defend themselves -- or count on the U.S. to do it for them. &quot;It's very hard for them {the Saudis} to rely on outside powers, even the U.S.,&quot; for protection, he said.    Instead, he said, moderate Arab nations should turn to Israel, the strongest military power in the Mideast, and a nation that shares their interest in regional stability. &quot;We are here. We are in the region. We are here forever,&quot; he said.    Opposition to the arms sale unites fractious Israeli politicians who agree on little else. Ariel Sharon, a former defense minister and hard-line rival of Mr. Shamir, said he is &quot;all out&quot; against the sale, noting that Saudi Arabia is a &quot;major supplier of Iraq and the Palestine Liberation Organization.&quot;    Besides, he said, U.S. military personnel accompany U.S. weapons, and Israel, which enjoys a special relationship with the U.S., wouldn't like to face the prospect of harming Americans inadvertently should it ever have to &quot;take steps to free itself of danger&quot; from Saudi Arabia.    Yossi Beillin, a prominent Foreign Ministry official in the opposition Labor Party, also criticized the proposed sale. &quot;It is very difficult to get the Saudis to agree to use these against one country and not another,&quot; he said.    Most Israeli officials acknowledge privately that their opposition to the arms sale is based more on psychological and political concerns than security ones. For one thing, the dozen F-15s the Saudis would be permitted to buy would remain in the U.S. and be available only to replace damaged or destroyed jet fighters in the fleet of 60 F-15s Saudi Arabia bought in the late 1970s. In addition, Israel's air force reportedly has concluded that the Mavericks wouldn't seriously threaten Israel.    Asked how Israel proposes to secure strategic cooperation with reluctant moderate Arab states, Mr. Shamir said, &quot;Through direct negotiations.&quot; The prime minister insisted he believes face-to-face talks with nations like Saudi Arabia and Jordan would be possible if his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, would stop deluding them with promises of an international peace conference involving not only the Arabs and Israelis but the superpowers.    &quot;If the Arabs don't have the option of an international conference, they'll come to the conclusion&quot; that direct negotiations are the way to peace, Mr. Shamir said. </TEXT></DOC>
