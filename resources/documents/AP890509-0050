(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Special advertising campaigns will bedirected toward blacks, Hispanics and Asians in an effort to ensureminorities are not underrepresented in the 1990 census.   C. Louis Kincannon, deputy director of the Census Bureau, saidMonday that undercounting is a problem today as it was 200 yearsago during the first census.   He and other federal officials joined Gov. William DonaldSchaefer in kicking off a national publicity campaign for thecensus next year and urged Americans to stand up and be counted.   This town of about 3,100 people on Maryland's Eastern Shore waspicked for the celebration because in 1790, it was the youngAmerican nation's population hub. About the same number of peoplelived north, south, east and west of Chestertown.   The day's main event was a parade down Chestertown's tree-linedstreets commemorating American history from 1790.   The parade featured old trains and cars, a covered wagon and arocket, a make-believe George Washington _ state Comptroller LouisL. Goldstein in a burgundy period costume _ and an astronaut, AirForce Col. Loren J. Shriver, who served as grand marshal.   In 1790, Thomas Jefferson and Washington were hoping the censuswould show there were more than 4 million people. They weredisappointed when the count came in at 3.9 million, according tothe Census Bureau's Raymond Bancroft.   Undercounting was a problem 200 years ago that persists today,he said.   The two American leaders wanted a larger population ``to showEngland we were a big country,'' Bancroft said. But there are morepractical reasons today for making sure everyone is counted, hesaid.   Kincannon said a great deal is at stake in the census, includingabout $35 billion a year in federal aid distributed to state andlocal governments according to population.   Census statistics also determine the makeup of electedlegislative bodies from the U.S. House of Representatives to citycouncils.   Kincannon estimated that about 99 percent of the people who livein the United States were counted in the 1980 census.   Regional Census Director Laverne Collins said she hopes peoplerealize census information is confidential. Illegal aliens are notreported to immigration officials, and income levels are not turnedover to the Internal Revenue Service, she said.   The 1990 census will cost about $2.6 billion during a 10-yearperiod, and about 500,000 people will be employed at the peakcounting, Ms. Collins said.</TEXT></DOC>
