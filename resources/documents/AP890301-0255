The new president, who has given his National Security Council 90days to come up with a plan, is expected to shift emphasis from StarWars to the deployment of a new generation of mobile missiles.   That is more than a cosmetic change, returning U.S. doctrine todeterrence instead of Reagan's radical vision of a world free ofnuclear weapons.   Senior administration officials have said in interviews with TheAssociated Press that Bush does not want to shift direction soradically as to derail Strategic Arms Reductions Talks with theSoviet Union.   ``The talks are too far along for that,'' said one top official,who spoke on condition that he not be identified.   Caution, consistency and coherence are emerging as the credo ofthe new administration, and the Bush's first defense budget will beclosely scrutinized to see how he translates rhetoric into reality.   In a speech last month, Bush offered few details beyond askingthat defense spending be kept even with the inflation rate, a 2percent cut from the request Reagan sent Capitol Hill in January.   But more is involved than moving money from one program toanother to, in the president's words, ``insure that our capabilitiesand resources meet our commitments and strategies.''   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, directing the nucleardoctrine review, has described Reagan's nuclear policy as one of``near total ... confusion.''   Scowcroft signaled where he is headed in a report that he draftedfor the Center for Strategic and International Studies before hejoined the administration. The report suggested staggereddevelopment of weapons started under Reagan, concentrating on thesingle-warhead Midgetman mobile missile rather than the 10-warheadMX or the B-2 stealth bomber.   Bush postponed until April a choice between the MX and theMidgetman, pending completion of the review. The chief of theStrategic Air Command, Gen. John Chain Jr., opposed the Midgetman ina Jan. 26 letter, saying, ``We can't afford it now.'' Acongressional estimate in 1988 put the cost of the Midgetman at$13.8 billion, about three times the price of putting 50 MX missileson mobile rail cars.   Continuing all the weapons started by Reagan would cost closer to$400 billion a year than the $308.8 billion requested by Bush,according to Congress.   While Congress and the administration have dickered for a decadeon whether to deploy a mobile missile, the Soviets have fielded two,the rail-mobile SS-24, with 10 warheads, and the road-mobile SS-25,with one.   Mobile missiles help stabilize the nuclear balance because anenemy can never be certain where the missiles are, and they can bemoved many miles in the 20 or so minutes that it takes a warhead toreach its target, according to Scowcroft and other strategicthinkers.   That means neither superpower can be guaranteed victory in asurprise attack. Variations of that kind of deterrence have been atthe heart of U.S. nuclear doctrine, a concept summed up in theacronym MAD _ the belief that a nuclear attack by either superpoweron the other would result in Mutual Assured Destruction.   ``We have for 40 years relied on the threat of nuclear weapons tokeep the Soviet hordes at bay,'' Scowcroft wrote in a bitingcritique of the bargaining positions that Reagan staked out at the1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.   ``If we do have a strategic concept that brings order to all thedisparate actions and proposals of the administration, of whichReykjavik is a prime example, it would be reassuring to know what itis,'' Scowcroft wrote.   In a 1983 speech, Reagan argued that technological advances madeit possible to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles.That might allow the superpowers to eliminate their atomic arsenals,said Reagan, borrowing a line from the anti-nuclear movement.   Reagan vigorously pursued his call for a space-based missiledefense and said a decision on deployment would come in themid-1990s.   Bush stopped short of that commitment, and said last month thathe ``will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative.''   The Center for Strategic and International Studies report withwhich Scowcroft was affiliated struck a similar note. ``Althoughactive strategic defense is a long way from negating deterrencebased upon mutual vulnerability, there is still an open questionabout the long-term advantages of large-scale ballistic missile andair defenses,'' it said. ``These systems might eventually be worththe price of deployment beyond the year 2000.''   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower has called Reagan's visionof a anti-nuclear umbrella unrealistic. And for several years, thescientists, engineers and military officers assigned to carry outReagan's research, in the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,have aimed for a system to enhance deterrence by making some U.S.systems harder to destroy.   Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, who retired as head of SDIO on Feb. 1,argues that puts the United States on the same nuclear wavelength asthe Soviet Union, which he said never abandoned the doctrine ofstrategic defense and maintains an Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)defense system around Moscow, as allowed under the 1972 ABM treaty.The United States has no such system.   The Soviets also maintain an extensive system of undergroundbunkers which the Pentagon says are designed to protect the Kremlinleadership in wartime, and has ``hardened'' numerous military andindustrial targets to help them survive a nuclear attack.   ``The central political objective of U.S. nuclear policy is todeter aggression against the United States and its primary allies'interests,'' according to CSIS.   By contrast, ``Soviet nuclear policy has as its primary objectivethe deterrence of a U.S. first use (of nuclear weapons) duringcrisis of war.'' ``Unlike the United States, Soviet writings andstatements made primarily by military professionals convey strongpreemptive overtones,'' the CSIS report said.   Reagan's 1983 speech gave the Soviets the impression that theUnited States was radically shifting its nuclear doctrine to astrategy of preemptive attack. Such a doctrine, bolstered by thetechnological superiority of the West, set off alarm bells in theKremlin.   The Bush administration is sending signals that strategicdefenses may be in the nation's future, but that for the time being,deterrence remains the bedrock of U.S. nuclear doctrine.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 5</NOTE></DOC>
