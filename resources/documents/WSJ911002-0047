They're right to be worried -- but not for the reasonthat has driven the stock down 14% in the past six weeks.   What's been hurting the stock is anxiety about howCongress might change the student loan program, the bread andbutter of Sallie Mae, less familiarly known as the StudentLoan Marketing Association. Such jitters probably areunfounded, analysts say, as Congress probably won't do much.</LP><TEXT>   But maybe investors should worry about Sallie Mae'slong-term growth prospects.   The college population is hardly growing at all, anddemand for student loans is growing slowly. Until now, SallieMae has defied these trends by increasing its share of thestudent-loan market, to around 40% currently. But the companyhas reached a position similar to that of, say, Budweiserbeer: It can achieve volume growth only by carving out anever-bigger share of a slow-growing market.   In the government-guaranteed student loan program,students borrow at a set annual rate, often 8% for fouryears, then 10% for six more years. But banks don't likemaking set-rate loans. To encourage the banks, the governmentpromises them 3.25 percentage points above the rate onTreasury bills. If students aren't paying enough to hit thattarget, Uncle Sam makes up the difference. The governmentusually pays all the interest while a student is in school,and picks up the tab for defaults. All this costs taxpayers$4 billion a year.   Sallie Mae, a for-profit corporation based in Washington,D.C., buys student loans from the banks that initiate them.It gets its operating funds by borrowing in the bond marketat extremely favorable rates, typically about 0.6 to 0.7percentage points above the rates on Treasury bills or notes.   So well has this system worked that Sallie Mae has enjoyeda lip-smacking annual return of 24% to 28% on stockholders'equity the past four years. Per-share earnings over afive-year period have grown at a better than 30% yearly clip.   Brokerage-house analysts fret that Congress may knock downthe stock, not necessarily by passing adverse legislation,but merely by considering it. The chief bogeyman is aproposal for the government to start making student loansdirectly -- bypassing the banks and Sallie Mae. A lesser butmore likely threat is a cut in the interest-rate guarantee tothree percentage points over T-bills, or even 2.75 abovethem. T-bill rates now are below 5.2%.   Analysts such as Eric Hemel of First Boston and NancySpady of Shearson Lehman Brothers think the stock will bevolatile for months as legislators mull things over. Mr.Hemel downgraded the stock to a hold last week, citing thedanger of &quot;wild-card proposals&quot; in Congress. Yet he left hisearnings estimates unchanged at $3.55 a share this year and$4.10 next year.   Ms. Spady says Congress will generate &quot;a lot of noise anda lot of proposals that make people worry about the future ofthe company.&quot; Other analysts, including Peter Treadway ofSmith Barney and Robert Hottensen of Goldman Sachs, agreeSallie Mae shares are likely to jump around, but see it as achance to buy on weakness.   Gordon Fines, manager of the New Dimensions Fund at IDSFinancial Services in Minneapolis, sold all of his 404,000Sallie Mae shares this spring. &quot;It was a sense of a slowinggrowth rate on a longer-term basis,&quot; he says. He figures thegrowth rate is &quot;still in the teens somewhere&quot; but is &quot;likelyto decline,&quot; bringing the stock's price/earnings ratio downfrom its current level of 18 times the past four quarters'earnings.   Frank Suozzo, analyst at S.G. Warburg, says student-loanvolume has been growing only 3% to 4% a year, and theDepartment of Education expects the number of students torise less than 1% a year in the near future. As a result, hesays Sallie Mae is &quot;slowing from a 20% rate of {profit}growth to what looks like an underlying rate of 10% to 11%.They'll be at a 50% market share by 1994 or 1995. It's goingto be very difficult for them to move that number up.&quot;   Sallie Mae's chief executive, Lawrence Hough, says there'sstill room for growth. He thinks Congress will liberalizeeligibility requirements so students from more-affluentfamilies can qualify for loans. To keep the cost to taxpayersdown, he suggests, Congress will probably make students startpaying interest -- perhaps at 6% -- while they are still inschool. And he says there are further opportunities in &quot;workforce retraining&quot; and serving &quot;nontraditional students.&quot;   Even if Congress doesn't expand eligibility, Mr. Houghsays Sallie Mae's earnings can grow at a 15% clip the nextfew years. That's well below recent levels, but above whatpessimists expect. &quot;There's a lot more to the story thandemographics,&quot; he says.   Maybe so. But to bet on Sallie Mae's stock at currentprices, you pretty much have to believe that Congress willexpand benefits in an era of tight budgets and unprecedenteddeficits.   ---   Sallie Mae   (NYSE; Symbol: SLM)                                                                                                          Business: Student loan financing                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Net income: $300.9 million; $2.96 a share                                                                                                          Second quarter, June 30, 1991:   Per-share earnings: 87 cents vs. 72 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 336,946 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 92.8 million</TEXT></DOC>
