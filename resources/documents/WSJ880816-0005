But here's what the GOP platform has to say about AIDS policy: AIDS victims &quot;deserve our compassion and help,&quot; and &quot;should be encouraged to seek early diagnosis and to remain on the job or in school as long as they are functionally capable,&quot; while the government &quot;must also protect those who do not have the disease.&quot;    There is a good reason for the vagueness. Below the surface, AIDS is an emotional issue that genuinely divides the Republicans gathered here.    On one side of the AIDS debate are party conservatives who think government policies are becoming too skewed toward protecting those who have the AIDS virus -- largely homosexuals -- and not concerned enough with rigidly controlling the spread of the disease. They suspect AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is being used by homosexuals as a vehicle to win legal rights and privileges they couldn't otherwise obtain.    On the other side are moderate Republicans who want the party to stress compassion for AIDS patients and support a law barring discrimination against them, while avoiding moralizing about homosexuality.    In the middle are Vice President George Bush and his lieutenants, relieved that they managed to craft a general statement partially satisfying both sides for the party platform, which is to be adopted formally today. &quot;The fact that it wasn't a blowup indicates we were successful,&quot; says Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of the platform committee.    As the AIDS debate illustrates, beneath the tranquillity that prevails here are a few issues on which Republicans are locked in quiet but sometimes emotional debate. And as the outcome of the AIDS debate also shows, the Bush camp has managed to defuse these tensions by offering carefully crafted platform language, arguing against controversial changes and sometimes convincing factions to agree to disagree.    It was relatively easy for Republicans to avoid divisive debates this year because of a tactical decision Mr. Bush made months ago. In a nod to the party's conservative wing, he agreed to use the deeply conservative 1984 Republican platform as the foundation for this year's platform, seeking only limited changes on selected issues important to Mr. Bush.    That move meant that Republicans didn't have to build a platform from scratch on big and potentially explosive issues like U.S.-Soviet relations and tax policy. The chances for controversy were greatest on just a handful of narrower issues -- such as child care, drugs and AIDS -- that have exploded in importance since 1984.    AIDS has been perhaps the most sensitive of these topics, generating tension between the party's vocal right wing and its moderates. Both conservatives and moderates think they have influenced the policy debate, yet each side still feels dissatisfied. &quot;I am disappointed,&quot; says Porter Davis, an Oklahoma conservative who pushed the party to adopt a tougher position on AIDS testing. &quot;I'm not happy,&quot; says Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, who champions the moderate view.    The intra-party debate on AIDS today turns on a seemingly obscure point: whether Congress should adopt a law barring discrimination against those who are infected with the AIDS virus. The anti-discrimination question has become a symbol of a broader philosophical struggle over whether to place greater stress on help for AIDS victims or containment of social forces that have helped the disease to spread.    Sen. Weicker has advocated a law barring discrimination against those who carry the AIDS virus. The idea got a big boost this summer when a commission appointed by President Reagan endorsed it.    But conservatives are appalled at the prospect, and President Reagan didn't endorse his own commission's call for an anti-discrimination statute. Conservatives argue that such a law would open a Pandora's box, allowing both AIDS patients and homosexuals generally to claim rights and privileges extending well beyond those intended by its advocates.    &quot;I'm not sure everyone who is advocating anti-discrimination status understands what the consequences of that step would bring,&quot; says Rep. William Dannemeyer of California, a prominent conservative activist on AIDS policy.    Opponents argue that an anti-discrimination law could force the Army to reverse existing policy and accept recruits infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS; force blood banks to take donations from infected persons; and make life-insurance companies write policies at regular rates for those infected with the HIV virus. And they say it could force changes that transcend the AIDS problem, such as forcing seminaries to accept homosexual students even if they teach that the gay life style is immoral.    Indeed, Mr. Dannemeyer asserts that homosexual activists want to use the AIDS epidemic as a wedge to win full legal protections under civil-rights statutes. &quot;They look upon the AIDS epidemic as a means of achieving recognition of their life style,&quot; he says.    Sen. Weicker responds that conservatives are merely engaged in moralizing about homosexuality when Republicans should be worried about helping sick people. &quot;The history of the U.S. has been that we didn't ask how people got sick,&quot; he says. &quot;It was sufficient that they were sick and we tried to help them.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Bush initially endorsed the report of the presidential commission on AIDS and its language decrying discrimination against AIDS patients. Aides say he embraces the &quot;concepts&quot; of anti-discrimination legislation, but that his position doesn't mean he is endorsing any specific bill. Mr. Bush has left himself enough wiggle room that conservatives such as Mr. Dannemeyer still think they can talk him out of endorsing legislation.    Beyond the debate over discrimination, conservatives also are calling for strict requirements that health workers must report patients infected with the HIV virus and trace their contacts with others. And Mr. Davis, the Oklahoma delegate, proposed a platform plank calling for AIDS testing of all pilots, bus drivers and train operators. He argues that a growing body of evidence indicates that those who carry the AIDS virus suffer from &quot;dementia,&quot; or deterioration of brain functions.    But Bush forces squelched that proposal, as well as Sen. Weicker's proposal to endorse the presidential commission's report. The platform avoids even mentioning the word discrimination.    &quot;We're at the stage where most Americans, including members of this committee, are just starting to address the substance of this issue,&quot; says Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, a member of the platform committee.    ---        Summary of Republican Platform Plank on AIDS   -- AIDS victims deserve compassion.   -- The Food and Drug Administration should establish a &quot;process for expedited review&quot; of AIDS drugs.   -- Education should stress &quot;abstinence from drug abuse and sexual activity outside of marriage.&quot;   -- Infected persons should stay on the job or in school &quot;as long as they are functionally capable.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
