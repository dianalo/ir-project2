The Air Force and Congress agreed last year to terminate the topsecret program, opting instead for satellites that could providethe same intelligence information for less money.   But in report language accompanying a $4 billion spending billPresident Bush signed last month, lawmakers called on the Pentagonto maintain the aircraft _ by tail numbers _ so that flightoperations could begin within 90 days of an emergency.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney criticized the provision, whichthough non-binding would do serious damage to the relationshipbetween Congress and the Pentagon if the department ignored it.   The Air Force and congressional committees negotiated acompromise that Cheney detailed in a June 21 letter to Sen. RobertC. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.   ``We will place three SR-71A aircraft and six associatedreconnaissance sensors and electronic countermeasure suites intolong-term storage as a hedge against a protracted conflict sometime in the future,'' Cheney said in the letter.   ``The time it will take and the cost of restoring these storedaircraft and sensors to a condition that would support safeoperations will depend on the length of the storage period.''   The defense secretary also said the Pentagon will make traineraircraft, two SR-71A aircraft, flight simulator and all associatedSR-71 spares and support equipment available for loan or transferto NASA.   The space agency, according to a memorandum from Cheney to AirForce Secretary Donald Rice, would assume the cost for operatingand maintaining the aircraft and parts.   No estimate was included in the letter.   Cheney said reconnaissance operations involving the black,dagger-shaped planes could not resume ``in a safe manner'' on90-day notice. He also noted that maintenance crews, air crews andother personnel with skills to operate and care for the Blackbirdare gone.   ``We no longer have an SR-71 flight capability,'' Cheney said.   During more than two decades of service, the Blackbird regularlyflew missions over heavily defended North Vietnam and providedintelligence in many other regions, including the Middle East,China and the Persian Gulf.   The plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never beenshot down.   In March, in a flight marking its retirement, a Blackbird set arecord for a coast-to-coast flight, flying from Los Angeles toWashington, D.C., in 68 minutes, 17 seconds.</TEXT></DOC>
