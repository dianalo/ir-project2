I must say some words about ethics.    Among 30-year-old business school graduates making $300,000 incomes, the latest fashion has been guilty pleas to felonies. The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who made his money at E.F. Hutton, has pledged to fund the bulk of a $30 million fund for a certain Boston-area business school to provide its graduates with a finishing-course in ethics. So let me move quickly to appease the Fates -- by stipulating that all has not been well recently with Wall Street ethics, and by offering a bit of ethical instruction:    If in your careers you find yourselves muttering code words on street corners to collect suitcases of cash, or if you find yourselves routing your trading income through secret accounts on some obscure island, you had better stop to think for a moment about the ethics of what you are doing. Ask yourselves why you're doing things you want to hide. This is as sturdy a moral compass as anything Harvard is likely to find with John Shad's $30 million. But that concern over business morality did not arise with what has become known as the insider-trading scandal.    The SEC's emphasis on insider trading superseded its interest in suspect foreign payments. And the offense of converting &quot;old&quot; crude oil into &quot;new&quot; crude oil under price controls led some of the world's largest oil companies to pay some of history's largest fines, and sent commodities trader Marc Rich into exile.    During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt castigated the &quot;Insulls and the Ishmaels,&quot; neatly linking Isaac's outcast half-brother with the electricity magnate who'd fled to Europe to escape prosecution for fraud after the collapse of his public-utility holding company. And no doubt moral suspicion of the businessman reaches back at least into the Middle Ages, when the profit motive was pitted against the myth of noblesse oblige.    In his moral misery, today's businessman, indeed, at least has the comfort of company. A congressional committee and a special prosecutor are plumbing the morality of a president's relation to the law. The leading presidential candidate of the opposition party has been destroyed by allegations of immoral behavior. A former cabinet member has spent months in the dock answering charges of impropriety concerning a minority contractor, and another special prosecutor is undertaking to study similar charges against the attorney general of the U.S. We find, in fact, that we can't trust even the morality of preachers or the loyalty of Marines.    Looking on this scene, many have asked whether we are living in an age of moral collapse. My answer is, anything but.    In the Gary Hart episode, there is at least the glimmer of recognition that we are today condemning public figures for moral lapses not even mentioned in earlier times. Similarly, no one dreamed of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate whether President Franklin Roosevelt &quot;broke the law&quot; in delivering destroyers to Britain when Congress was striving to keep us out of World War II; today, Lawrence Walsh is applauded for launching a criminal case alleging conspiracy to incorrectly interpret the tax code.    We have always known our Elmer Gantrys and Benedict Arnolds. Washington has long been stuffed with former officials turned lobbyists, a la Michael Deaver, and some of them have become some of our most famous and most respected citizens. So it is, too, with business ethics.    So far, at least, the amazing thing about the insider-trading scandals is that they have found so little insider trading. One trader has pleaded guilty to a net capital violation, scarcely imagined as a criminal offense a year ago. Another pleaded guilty to market manipulation in one stock. After being allowed to unwind his stock position without revealing he was being put out of business, Ivan Boesky pleaded guilty to a reporting violation. Mostly what we have are &quot;parking violations,&quot; an apt name, it seems to me, for buying stock secretly on behalf of someone else.    This is not to excuse these violations. Part of ethics is playing by the rules, Wall Street depends on following rules, and breaches should be punished. But what the cases do not add up to is a systemic, Wall Street-wide effort to rig the takeover game. This is what has been insinuated, and the insider-trading prosecutors keep excusing light sentences by promising more important cases to come. But the one big case so far, the only one seriously contested, has produced the curious result of the defendants clamoring for a trial and the prosecutors begging for delay. They should have delayed, it seems to me, before they barged into trading rooms and slapped anyone in handcuffs.    No, we do not live in an age of moral collapse. We more nearly live in an age of moral zealotry. We are applying to ourselves, or at least to our public and private leaders, standards of ethics never before expected of ordinary mortals.    Much of this is to our credit, of course. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example, expected higher standards of American businesses operating abroad than of their competitors. While this may not have helped our trade balance, many American businesses have found it a useful protection from extortion. And I believe it has helped spread higher standards around the world.    Wall Street and business generally are today more concerned than ever about ethics; surely this is good. America's accomplishments have always owed much to its moral concern.    And yet, history shows that untrammeled morality carries its dangers. One need only look at the great religious wars, the Inquisition, or our own great moral experiment of Prohibition. And it seems to me, as it seems to many people around the world today, that America's preoccupation with morality distracts it from the political and economic leadership the world so badly needs.    I have some concern about business ethics, but what really worries me is the ethics business: the use of ethical issues to undercut other kinds of achievement, to prove that even overachievers have feet of clay, or worse, to best an adversary on the field of battle. In 1969, Yale President Kingman Brewster convened a program on the question, &quot;What is happening to morality today?&quot; The great constitutional scholar Alexander Bickel answered him, &quot;It threatens to engulf us.&quot;    In such an atmosphere, business labors under two handicaps. The first is persistent misunderstanding of the word &quot;profit,&quot; as in &quot;profit motive.&quot;    Business is immediately suspect because it is seen as motivated by greed. Yet in fact the market very efficiently polices excesses, as even the great oil cartel discovered. And profit, as known to the great public corporations, is only another ongoing cost. It is used, after all, to expand the business or is paid out as dividends to reward past investments and induce new ones -- &quot;interest on equity,&quot; one of my business friends calls it. I doubt that pursuit of profit is any more corrupting than pursuit of power, glory or even martyrdom.    The second handicap is the politicians' habit of outlawing markets.    If the government kept trying to outlaw gravity, physicists would quickly become a suspect class, constantly embroiled in allegations of lawbreaking. Yet the government feels competent to declare that one kind of crude oil should sell for one price, while a higher price goes to another kind of crude oil, distinguishable only by pedigree. And the government feels competent to declare that certain contracts must go to businesses owned by certain races. The market will somehow do what must be done to deliver oil and build tunnels or weapons, and some businessman will be charged with breaking a law that would have made his job impossible.    This is even true in the current Wall Street problems. The law says that someone making a tender offer must stop and declare when he owns a certain percentage of the stock. The market sprouted the whole profession of risk arbitrage to fill the gap between the declaration and the final price. The proprieties of gap-filling are what are at issue in court today, and the issue is not yet decided.    In the 1930s, Samuel Insull returned from exile to stand trial for mail fraud. He was acquitted, and stood trial for bankruptcy violations, and was acquitted. And then stood trial for embezzlement, and was acquitted again. So often the latest fad in &quot;business ethics&quot; concerns how the businessman deals with the hoops the politicians set for him to jump through. Trying to protect yourself from ethical assault is quite a different preoccupation from trying to deal ethically with your community. In a moral Gresham's law, the former drives out the latter.    Take, again, the insider-trading controversy. Clearly, the most ethically questionable behavior in the takeover wars is the payment of greenmail by an incumbent management faced with a raid. To preserve its own position, the management uses resources belonging to all shareholders to reward some shareholders. Ethically, I see no credible defense for this behavior, yet because it is done by respectable CEOs and not flamboyant raiders, and because the politicians have not yet erected hoops around it, it carries no flavor of scandal. So, new graduates, let me conclude with a thought or two not about the scandals you may face but about the actual ethical problems you are likely to encounter in your careers ahead.    Your customers, you will discover, will be hard to cheat. The ethical problems will more likely be internal -- when to fire employees, for example. The more common error is not soon enough for all concerned. What loyalty do you owe your employer or supervisor when you would have made a different business decision? Much. How do you treat a career competitor? With camaraderie. Please give these problems some thought; they are the stuff of life.    If you are a typical graduate of the 1980s, the most serious ethical problems you are likely to face will not be business problems but family problems: managing your obligations to spouses and children, to aging parents. This is an enormous challenge, more daunting than either business ethics or the ethics business. Be honest and fair with one another, and you will find the courage and conviction to deal with both your critics and your conscience.    ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal.
