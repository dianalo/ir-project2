In a summit-finale news conference, Reagan also said that it wasGeneral Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev who changed his view of theKremlin as an ``evil empire.'' He said Gorbachev, his partner atfour summit meetings, was ``different than previous Soviet leadershave been.''   The president said he hoped to conclude a U.S.-Soviet treaty tocut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office, butsaid it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet aJanuary deadline.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute toPresident Reagan on Wednesday for retracting his characterizationof the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' but he blamed theAmerican side for the failure to make more tangible progress at thefourth superpower summit in 30 months.   In the first nationally televised Moscow news conference by aKremlin leader, Gorbachev hailed the continuing U.S.-Sovietdialogue and said ``it is vitally necessary'' that his meetingsresume after Reagan's successor takes office in January.   In a good-natured, wide-ranging session with Soviet and foreignreporters, the Communist Party chief held forth for nearly twohours, alternately praising the tone of U.S.-Soviet dialogue whilecriticizing specific U.S. positions.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev dropped allpretense of a hand-holding friendship Wednesday in a feistycompetition for the spotlight that Mrs. Reagan called a ``Mexicanstandoff.''   President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachevtraded generous comments as their fourth summit drew to a close,but their wives managed to erase within minutes the image of a warmrelationship they'd tried to portray earlier in the week.   Although the two women maintained the appearance of cordialityduring a tour of an icon storage vault, their contest for thespotlight was the toughest of any of their get-togethers since theymet in Geneva in 1985.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to astrategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over themain impediment, the U.S. Star Wars program.   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we couldeliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said. Butthere seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.   After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered theirnegotiators to return to Geneva on July 12 to work on a proposedtreaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50percent.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   By muting his criticism of Soviet human rightsabuses, President Reagan may be trying to speed up negotiationsthat would substantially cut Red Army forces in Eastern Europe.   Reagan, who built a political career bashing Reds and in hisfirst term called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' confoundedobservers on Tuesday and Wednesday by attributing Kremlin humanrights abuses to bureaucratic inertia and praising Mikhail S.Gorbachev for trying to reform it.   Reagan and his aides attributed the softening of the president'srhetoric to Gorbachev's efforts to reform the system.</TEXT><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While police searched London's sewers for bombsand set up barricades Wednesday, the Lord Mayor's harried staffspruced up the 12th century Guildhall where President Reagan willspeak en route home from the Moscow summit.   Clearly unaccustomed to the tumult surrounding U.S. presidentialvisits, the mayor's spokeswoman, Carole Barbone, glanced at thecity's motto inscribed on the Guildhall _ ``Domine Dirige Nos.''   ``It means `God Direct Us,' or the alternative version, `GodHelp Us,''' she chuckled as workers strung up American flags,lugged in potten chrysanthemums and polished the Lord Mayor'ssilverware.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government said Wednesday its chiefeconomic forecasting gauge rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, anincrease analysts said signaled continued healthy economic growthfor the rest of this presidential election year.

That conclusion comes from Japanese biologists who havedetermined the entire genetic code of the AIDS virus that infectsAfrican green monkeys. Some researchers have suggested that thesemonkeys may have been the source of the human AIDS virus.   The Japanese team found that the African green monkey AIDS virusdiffered from the two known human AIDS viruses in several importantrespects. If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recenttimes, the viruses would be identical or nearly so.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Elyse Sanchez tried on her new self-esteemWednesday and found that it fit just right.   ``I've finally done something in my life!'' the 35-year-oldmother of four said as her children clung to her long black gown.

But in his final year in office, Duarte already had become avirtual lame duck. His absence is not expected to have a profoundeffect on El Salvador's problems.
