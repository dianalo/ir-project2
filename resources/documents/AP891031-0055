(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Boeing agreed to pay the federal government$11 million in connection with alleged overcharges on Air Forcecontracts but denied wrongdoing.   Federal officials in Wichita and Washington announced Mondaythat Robert L. Dryden, president of Boeing Military Airplanes,signed the settlement, which the company characterized as agood-faith disagreement over pricing procedures.   In Philadelphia, meanwhile, jury selection began in a case inwhich General Electric Co. and two employees are charged withbilking the government of $10 million for a battlefield computersystem.   Jury selection is expected to be completed by Thursday. GE,facing its second such fraud case in four years, is charged withmail fraud and making false statements. The fine could reach $71.9million.   In the Kansas case, the Boeing Inc. division did not acknowledgethe validity of the government's claims.   However, a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurorscontained a company official's calculations of how much money wouldbe generated by the overcharges.   Under the settlement, the company must pay the $11 millionwithin five days. The agreement says Boeing won't face civil orcriminal prosecution in the case, except possible Internal RevenueService claims.   ``We're certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could bereached,'' said company spokesman Richard L. Ziegler.   Ziegler refused to discuss the potential IRS liability or howthe alleged overcharges occurred.   The case involved contracts for new aluminum skins, or outercoverings, on KC-135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to1986. Government investigators alleged Boeing overcharged foraluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices insteadof their actual costs, which were 12 percent to 13 percent less.   A federal grand jury in Wichita, where the division is based,heard hundreds of hours of testimony, and inspected thousands ofdocuments for more than nine months before prosecutors withdrew thecase late last month.   In Philadelphia, the government also has filed a civil lawsuitagainst GE seeking $23 million in overcharges and damages in the$234 million project from 1983 to 1986.   Under the no-bid contract, the GE subsidiary Management andTechnical Services Co. in the Philadelphia suburb King of Prussiawas to provide 233 mobile units in five production years beginningin 1984.   The government alleges the company padded the costs and failedto notify the Pentagon of savings negotiated with subcontractors.   Accused with GE are James Badolato, 41, of Springfield, Pa., andGerald A. Leo, 51, of King of Prussia.   The company and officials have pleaded innocent, although GEacknowledged an internal investigation uncovered discrepanciestotaling $3.69 million, which the company has refunded.   GE, the nation's second-largest defense contractor, pleadedguilty in May 1985 to illegally claiming $800,000 in cost overrunson Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles and paid a $1.04million fine.</TEXT></DOC>
