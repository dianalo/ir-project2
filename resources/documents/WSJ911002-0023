Deep inside the containment vesseland behind layers of defense against core problems, the thicksteel reactor vessel over decades has lost some of itsductility and by definition is now more brittle than whenfirst put in place.   Reactor vessel embrittlement is well known and has beenstudied for decades. Simply stated, some neutrons from thecore's reactor bang the vessel's insides, microscopicallymisaligning the metal's structure and accumulating stressmostly on the inside of the vessel.</LP><TEXT>   The industry has responded in several ways. The rate ofneutron irradiation is slowed, almost blocked, by rearrangingthe fuel bundles to screen the vessel from neutrons. Neutronabsorbers are placed between the vessel and fuel. To avoidextreme thermal shock in the unlikely event of aloss-of-coolant accident when stored water would be injectedto replace lost reactor water, the emergency cooling water isstored preheated.   Because the vessel's stress is merely physical, engineersperiodically test and evaluate its loss of ductility in orderto decide when to return the metal to its unstressed state byannealing. A somewhat expensive but simple heating process,annealing is carried out by infrared and induction heating ofthe vessel's inside. When heated to its austenitic point, themetal relieves its accumulated stress by recombination andcancellation of stresses. The end result is a vesselsufficiently ductile or resilient to provide again a largemargin of safety in its role as but one of the many safetylayers built into light-water nuclear-power plants.   I rely upon those competent to make safety judgments atnearby Rowe, not upon the palpably anti-nuclear Union ofConcerned Scientists (UCS), which lives off public fear. I ammore troubled by their hysteria than by the state of YankeeRowe's reactor vessel.   Frederick C. Harwood   American Institute for Economic Research   Great Barrington, Mass.   ---   Your article assumed the worst -- not yet established --about one reactor's pressure vessel and used that to condemna large part of the nuclear industry. There was no attempt toexplain that the industry is well aware, and has been foryears, of the problem of embrittlement and has developed waysto control the problem.   If your reporter had contacted the utilities he singledout on your front page in the &quot;Fragile Reactors&quot; chart -- andhe did not -- he would have found that they have takencorrective action that is the basis on which they are allowedby federal regulators to continue operation.   He would have known that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) closely monitors the progression of embrittlement andwould not allow plants to operate without adequate margins ofsafety.   Incidentally, our correct name is U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness. We are the public-information association for thenuclear industry, and not a lobbying organization.   Carl A. Goldstein   Vice President   Public and Media Relations   U.S. Council for Energy Awareness   Washington   ---   You sprinkle your article with effective quotes andjournalistic emotional words and phrases, to wit: &quot;a disasterwaiting to happen,&quot; &quot;aging vessel has become so brittle,&quot;&quot;plume of radioactive steam,&quot; &quot;madness,&quot; &quot;a lightning rod,&quot;&quot;signs of deterioration,&quot; &quot;worn and wheezy,&quot; &quot;matter of timebefore trouble strikes,&quot; &quot;national insanity,&quot; &quot;play Russianroulette.&quot; The Yankee Rowe reactor vessel is not brittle, butit is less ductile than when new, and the NRC will shut theplant down when, and if, the consensus judgment of engineersand scientists determines its hazard is unacceptable. The UCScannot sell its alarmist views to its peers in theengineering/scientific community, so it uses the media toalarm the public.   Polls reveal that 75% to 80% of U.S. citizens agree thatmore, safe nuclear-power plants must be built in the U.S.soon to supply our growing electricity needs. Why not giveyour readers the real positive truths that will allow them tobe comfortable that nuclear power in the U.S. is in goodhands for the future?   Conrad M.
