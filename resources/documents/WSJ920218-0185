A few years ago, many big investors shied away fromtop-quality corporate bonds after a string of leveragedbuy-outs turned high-quality securities into low-priced junkbonds overnight.</LP><TEXT>   No transaction riled investors more than the $25 billionleveraged buy-out of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the giantfood and tobacco company. Shortly after the company announcedplans of the transaction in late 1988, the price of thecompany's existing bonds fell 17% and the company's creditrating on most of its debt was downgraded to junk bondstatus. Many still bitterly consider the event as thecorporate bond market's version of the Black Monday stockmarket crash of 1987.   But demand for blue-chip corporate bonds is now strongerthan ever. Daily trading volume of corporate bonds, now inexcess of $25 billion a day, is setting records. From 1985through most of 1990, daily volume was between $10 billionand $18 billion.   Issuance of new corporate bonds also is running at recordlevels, exceeding $40 billion so far this year. Demand hasbeen so strong that underwriters have often increased thesize of some popular new issues to accommodate the blizzardof orders.   There are several reasons for the change in attitudetoward corporate bonds, but several analysts attribute thebulk of the change to the decline in leveraged buyouts,perceptions that corporate credit quality is improving andexpectations for an economic recovery later this year. Also,at a time when many interest rates are declining, moneymanagers are hoping that the 7% to 9.5% yields available onmany high-grade corporate bonds will help to boost themanagers' performances.   These are factors, money managers say, that will enablehigh-grade corporate bonds to outperform most otherfixed-income securities this year.   In the bond market, investors look at performance inrelative terms. Because many managers believe that bondprices will remain flat this year or move up just modestly,they are searching for ways to increase yield in hopes for adecent total return.   &quot;There is a feeling that you are not going to buy a bondtoday and see it downgraded tomorrow,&quot; said BarbaraKenworthy, portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. If anything,she says, &quot;I think credit quality will improve. The creditrating agencies got too carried away {in the past two years}and downgraded corporation debt and bank debt too much.&quot;   Signs that the financial conditions of corporate Americaare improving abound. Even some debt of RJR, less than threeyears after it stunned the market with its massive LBO, wasupgraded in December to investment-grade from junk status.Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. assigned a triple-B-minus rating toRJR's senior debt and Moody's Investors Service Inc. gave ita Baa-3.   Now, investors are scrambling to identify other companieswhose financial fortunes are destined to improve. High on thelist are the bonds of retailers, auto makers and other&quot;cyclical&quot; companies, whose profits rise and fall with thebusiness cycle. Such companies are expected to benefit morethan others if the economy picks up momentum later this year,which many analysts are forecasting.   &quot;If the economy improves, the credit quality of retailersand auto makers should also improve,&quot; said Tom Washall,senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty Co. inPhiladelphia. Mr. Washall is particularly positive on Sears,Roebuck andamp; Co. Although Sandamp;P recently downgraded Sears's debt,which has depressed the prices of its bonds, Mr. Washallbelieves the company stands to benefit from an economicupturn. Moreover, he said, &quot;Sears has announced more job cutsand management is finding other ways to cut costs and improverevenue. We think their paper looks relatively attractive.&quot;Sears has said that 21,000 non-sales employees will losetheir jobs by midyear.   In Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s latest credit market report,fixed-income strategist William King suggests that investorsstick to high-quality regional banks, such as Norwest Corp.,Banc One Corp., PNC Financial Corp., CoreStates FinancialCorp., SunTrust Banks Inc. and Wachovia Corp. Although pricesof bank bonds already have appreciated in the past severalweeks, he remains &quot;constructive&quot; on the group. Even ifforecasts of economic recovery prove overly optimistic, theseregional banking concerns, said Mr. King, &quot;are among theleast likely to suffer significant fundamentaldeterioration.&quot; If the economy grows at a strong pace thisyear, he expects a credit rating upgrade for Bank of New YorkCo., Mellon Bank Corp., and Fleet/Norstar Financial GroupInc.   &quot;We're predicting that corporate bonds will perform betterthan Treasury bonds in 1992 and at least as well as{mortgage-backed} securities,&quot; said William Malvey, a bondspecialist at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. Last year,intermediate-term Treasurys posted a total return of about18.2%, compared with 16.7% for intermediate-term corporatesand 15.8% for mortgage-backed securities, according to aMerrill Lynch index.   Much of the demand for new corporate bonds has come frominsurance companies, which are devoting a greater amount ofinvestment dollars to bonds and less to real estate, duemostly to changes in regulatory guidelines that favor oneinvestment over the other. Mr. Malvey of Kidder Peabody saysthe heavy buying on the part of insurance companies hascaused the &quot;spread&quot; between the yield on corporate bonds andTreasury bonds to narrow, despite the record volume of newissuance.   The &quot;spread&quot; is a key gauge of investor confidence in bondissuers. When corporate bond spreads widen relative toTreasury securities, corporate bonds are said to beinexpensive, and when spreads narrow, corporate bond priceshave appreciated in price relative to Treasurys.   At the end of a recession, spreads often narrow because itis assumed that economic growth will lead to rising corporateprofits and stronger credit quality, which enhances theappeal of corporate securities. That, in turn, causescorporate bond prices to appreciate relative to Treasurybonds.   However, not everyone is optimistic that events will gothat way. John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's, says thatwhile credit quality will probably not deteriorate furtherduring 1992, the recovery will not be strong enough to boostcredit quality very much.   &quot;You are going to have a sub-par recovery, which is not aslikely to produce cyclically driven improvements in corporatecredit quality as normally would be the case during arecovery. Credit quality may not get much worse, but we donot look for broad-based meaningful improvements.&quot;   He says the optimism in the corporate bond market &quot;may besomewhat overdone. I think investors should be prepared fordisappointments.&quot; The problem, he says, is excess capacityutilization that will make it difficult for companies toreach their targeted earnings growth.   Consider the auto industry, he said: &quot;Even after the sharpcutbacks, there could be far more capacity than demand,{which} will have the effect of trimming the recovery.&quot;Although, he said, the decline in LBOs is a significantpositive trend for the market.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bonds ended a volatile day of trading little changed,recovering from what participants described as a &quot;panic&quot;sell-off during early trading.   The market closed three hours earlier than normal, at 2p.m. EST, to give participants a jump start on the three-dayweekend. The U.S. bond market was closed Monday in observanceof the Presidents' Day holiday.   In early trading Friday, the bond market's bellwethersecurity, the 30-year Treasury bond, was quoted 5/8 pointlower, or $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. But bythe end of the day, the market had reversed course and thebenchmark bond ended nearly 1/4 point higher, a gain ofnearly $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond ended at 100 31/32to yield 7.90% compared with 100 24/32 to yield 7.92% onThursday.   Despite the impressive comeback, the mood in the bondmarket remains cautious as traders and investors sense thatthe economy may be at a turning point. Bond investors oftenturn bearish on signs of economic growth because they fear astrong economy will eventually lead to higher inflation andinterest rates -- trends that erode the value of bonds.   Supply also weighed on the market. The Treasury sold $36billion in new notes and bonds last week during its quarterlyrefunding of the federal debt. The bulk of those securitiesremain in dealer inventories.   In the corporate bond market, prices drifted aimlessly.Last week was a busy week for new corporate bonds. In thefiveday period ended Thursday, nearly $4 billion ofnonconvertible corporate debt was offered to investors. Thatwas almost as heavy as the previous week when about $4.2billion of corporate debt was sold.</TEXT></DOC>
