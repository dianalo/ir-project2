U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson at 3 p.m. Monday signedthe order barring an Amtrak walkout until at least 3 p.m. Wednesday.At that time, he will conduct a hearing on whether to issue a longerrestriction.   Amtrak lawyers had sought the restraining order.   The judge signed a similar temporary restraining order Sundayblocking unionized employees of the Long Island Rail Road, theMetro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit from stagingsympathy strikes in conjunction with the Eastern strike.   The International Association of Machinists, which struck Easternon Saturday, has said it may picket at the railroads, and railroadunions have said they would not cross those picket lines. That wouldcripple rail transit.   This morning, the union filed an appeal with the 2nd U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals of Patterson's orders involving the localrailroads, and a hearing was set for Wednesday morning. The Amtrakorder was not mentioned in the appeal papers.   Sheldon Engelhard, a lawyer for the union, said it would ask the2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear an appeal of Patterson's ordersTuesday. He said the machinists union is legally entitled to set upsecondary picket lines and the rail workers' contracts state theycan't cross picket lines.   Union spokesman Jim Conley would not say if the union planned topicket the railroads if the temporary restraining orders are lifted.   ``That's part of the overall strike strategy and it won't bereleased ahead of time,'' Conley said.</TEXT></DOC>
