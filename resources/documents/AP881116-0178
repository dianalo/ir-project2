Legal experts said Wednesday that the British investigation alsomay mean new trouble for Boesky if he had not disclosed the allegedfraud against Drexel to U.S. prosecutors when he negotiated aplea-bargain agreement two years ago.   Under that pact, Boesky is required to divulge all wrongdoingeven though he won't be indicted for it. But if he fails to be fullycandid, prosecutors can scrap the plea agreement and charge him withevery crime he had admitted.   ``Certainly, if anything material was omitted by somebody under anormal cooperation agreement, it would permit the prosecutor toreopen the charges and do what he pleases,'' said a lawyer familiarwith the case, who spoke on the condition he not be identified byname.   Officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission andManhattan U.S. attorney's office would not comment on preliminaryresults of the British probe, first reported in Wednesday editionsof the New York Times.   Charles Carberry, a private attorney in New York and formerfederal prosecutor who helped draft the Boesky plea agreement, alsodeclined to comment, as did Charles Davidow, a Boesky attorney inWashington.   Formerly Wall Street's best-known speculator, Boesky shocked thebusiness world two years ago when he paid the SEC a record $100million to settle previously undisclosed charges of insider trading,the misuse of secret information to profit in the financial markets.   In exchange for his cooperation in implicating other wrongdoers,Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge ofconspiracy to lie to the SEC, for which he began serving athree-year term in March.   Partly as a result of Boesky's disclosures, the SEC accusedDrexel Sept. 7 of numerous frauds, many involving an alleged schemeto use the speculator as a front to profit from insider trading,manipulate stocks and hide them in his name to avoid reportingrequirements, an illegal practice called stock parking. TheManhattan U.S. attorney's office is expected to seek criminalcharges against Drexel as well. The firm has denied any wrongdoingand has denounced Boesky as a scheming liar.   While the thrust of the U.S. allegations suggests Drexelexploited Boesky for its benefit, the British stock exchangeinvestigation indicates Boesky was victimizing Drexel. Lawyers saidthe British probe could boost Drexel's legal defense by convincing ajury that Boesky was deceptive and conniving.   ``Anything a witness has done that casts discredit on his honestyis obviously useful to someone against whom that witness istestifying,'' said Gerard Lynch, a Columbia Law School professor.``That's especially true if the witness has gotten some deal fromthe government.''   Another attorney familiar with the Drexel-defense strategy, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``If Boesky takes the stand,he's going to be hammered about this ... It clearly helps Drexel'scase.''   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder, asked for comment about theBritish probe, said, ``It would appear to us that if theseallegations are proven to be true, it is yet another example thatIvan Boesky is unreliable and not believable.''   The British probe suggests a Drexel-backed Boesky partnershipcalled Seemala Corp. broke an agreement with the firm and violatedstock reporting requirements by parking securities in a secretaccount, unknown to Drexel.   The probe also suggests the London brokerage Seligmann Harris andamp;Co. participated in Boesky's alleged scheme to cheat Drexel. RobertHarris, the brokerage's senior partner, may face disciplinarysanctions by the exchange.   Harris was quoted by the New York Times as saying he didn'tknowingly break any rules and feels deceived by Boesky as well.   There was no answer at Seligmann Harris's London office lateWednesday. But Stanley Arkin, a New York lawyer retained by Harris,said, ``It would be characteristic of Boesky to play both endsagainst the middle.'' </TEXT></DOC>
