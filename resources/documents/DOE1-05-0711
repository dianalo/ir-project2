This plan, expected to be completed in 1989, is aimed at constructinga reactor with performance of the highest level in the world by modifyingJRR-3 while utilizing as many of the existing facilities as possible.Prior to the modification work, the removal of facilities that will notbe used for the new reactor was started in August 1985. This report outlinesthe removal of reactor cooling components. The components removed includethose for (1) handling and storage of nuclear fuel substances, (2) reactorcooling, (3) measurement control, (4) disposal of radioactive waste,(5) management of radiation and (6) reactor containment. First, the basicscheme for the removal work is outlined concerning work methods, partitionof the work area, installation of temporary shields, installation ofa greenhouse and ventilation equipment, and disposal of large-sized wastes.Then, the work procedures for arrangement, initiation, component identification,removal work, washing, pipe cutting, sealing of openings and disposalof wastes are described. Various measures were carried out for the reductionin exposure, prevention of contamination and reduction in the amountof wastes. Numerical data on the work force, exposure dose and amountof wastes disposed of are also listed. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
