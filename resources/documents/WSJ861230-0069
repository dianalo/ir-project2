But South Korea's regulatory climate has altered so drastically in the past year that many banks must scramble to keep up with the changes. Some are wondering if they should leave.    None of the 47 foreign banks in South Korea has pulled up stakes, although two, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Wells Fargo Bank of the U.S., have downgraded their operations. A few others are coming in, such as Australia's Westpac Banking Corp., Britain's National Westminster Bank, Bank of California and Japan's Yamaguchi Bank and Yasuda Banking Corp., all of which opened branches or offices here this year. (Foreign bankers say that most of the recent entrants had been waiting for licenses since long before the climate changed, and that some have mixed feelings about coming in now.)    South Korea's economy has boomed, largely with money borrowed from foreign banks. But Seoul has made it clear in recent months that it intends to fund most of its needs with the proceeds from its record exports and domestic savings.    The Ministry of Finance has frozen dollar loans by all banks operating here and has seriously discouraged borrowings in the local currency, the won, by Korean businesses. Bank of Korea, the central bank, is issuing &quot;monetary-stabilization bonds&quot; with rates higher than what commercial banks can offer for deposits.    Accompanying those measures, which hurt all banks, has been curtailment of so-called swap facilities, which foreign banks say is aimed at them. The swap arrangement allows banks to bring a certain amount of foreign exchange into the country and swap it at Bank of Korea for won to use in local-currency lending. After a predetermined period, the bank may reverse the swap to get foreign currency -- without risk of loss on fluctuating exchange rates.    Since South Korea first opened its doors to foreign banks in 1967, they have enjoyed substantial advantages over domestic banks, including guaranteed profits from the swap and protection from excessive lending risks. &quot;We had this quasi-safety net for loans to major groups, under which the government guaranteed all of their foreign loans,&quot; says a foreign banker.    The result has been sustained profitability for foreign banks. In more than 20 years, few have had a losing year here. Last year, the Finance Ministry says, foreign banks earned a total of $103 million, up 35% from a year earlier -- while the profits of five leading domestic banks dropped 46%, to $49.5 million.    The Bankers' Group, made up of foreign-bank representatives here, says comparing the profits of foreign and domestic banks isn't &quot;particularly relevant or constructive. . . .&quot; In a letter to Korean government and financial leaders this year, the group deplored &quot;misconceptions about foreign-bank privileges and some lack of appreciation of the services . . . rendered&quot; to South Korea.    &quot;The problem is the government of Korea,&quot; says a U.S. banker. &quot;It won't stay out of our business. It won't stay out of anybody's business.&quot; (Foreign bankers spoke only on condition that they weren't identified. As one explains, &quot;Foreign bankers are in a very precarious position here. . . so we have to be very careful about what we say.&quot;)    The foreign banks' push to compete on equal terms with domestic banks was led by three big U.S. banks, Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Bank of America, and backed by pressure from Washington to reduce market barriers. In April 1984, Seoul bowed to U.S. trade pressure and agreed to ease restrictions on foreign banks. The Ministry of Finance announced liberal measures, including a &quot;national treatment&quot; policy designed to give foreign banks equal opportunity to compete with their Korean counterparts in won lending. Other measures in the past two years include partial lifting of legal lending restraints on foreign banks and partial access for them to the discount window, a central-bank facility with which assets may be converted to cash at a favorable rate.    But foreign bankers say many discriminatory practices and regulations remain, including some that the government agreed in 1984 to correct but so far hasn't. The Banking Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea contends in a report there are &quot;many significant barriers that prevent American banks from engaging in important business activities available to domestic banking institutions.&quot; The committee officials and other foreign bankers also say most of the liberalization measures since 1984 have been largely ineffective because of restrictive and costly conditions imposed by the government.    Korean officials say the foreign banks' advantages were &quot;privileges&quot; premised on the government's need for credit for development. &quot;We have given extraordinary favor to the foreign banks because we needed to borrow heavily from abroad,&quot; says Park Sung Sang, Bank of Korea's governor. Now that the government doesn't need to borrow so much, he says, &quot;they are getting equal opportunity. But no more special privileges.&quot;    Shim Hyung Sup, director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, balks at the suggestion by some foreign bankers that South Korea owes them a living. &quot;They seem to be saying to us that because they lent to us for years, and made a lot of money doing it, we should keep borrowing,&quot; he says.    &quot;Friends aren't only for sunny days; they are for cloudy days as well.&quot; If they aren't, says Mr. Shim, South Korea is prepared to live without them.    The bankers are particularly bitter about a government requirement that 35% of a foreign bank's new lending go to small and medium-sized businesses. Foreign banks already are required to extend 25% of their new loans to such businesses, many of which the banks find risky.    Foreign banks have been pressing for years for the right to sell certificates of deposit. The government finally opened that door in September but limited the amount to 7% of a bank's capital. (The amount domestic banks can issue is based on a changing formula.) And it restricted interest rates on deposits to a range set by a cartel of domestic banks -- which the foreign banks say severely limits competition.    In addition, the government ruled that for every dollar in CDs that a bank sells, it must give up a dollar of its swap allowance. And for every won amount equivalent to a dollar that it wants from the central bank's discount window, it must give up 50 cents of its swap limit. The central bank says it intends to completely phase out swap facilities over the next three or four years.    All this has led foreign bankers to conclude, as one banker put it, that Seoul is &quot;feigning liberalization to get Washington off its back, while actually building new walls to keep us out.&quot;    The U.S. government hasn't officially commented on the complaints, saying only that banking liberalization is still up for discussion with Seoul. Privately, however, U.S. officials concede, &quot;We can't really argue with what they've done in a treaty sense,&quot; says a U.S. official. &quot;Recognizing the internal pressures the Koreans face, what they have achieved in banking liberalization so far isn't unimpressive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
