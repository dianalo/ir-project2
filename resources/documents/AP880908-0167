Thursday as the first American cruise missiles to leaveEurope under U.S.-Soviet arms treaty were flown home fordestruction.   Two of the 18 cruise missiles deployed at nearby Molesworth U.S.Air Base were loaded on a C-141 and their 55-foot mobile launchersaboard a C-5 Galaxy for the 12-hour flight to Davis-Monthan AirForce Base near Tucson, Ariz. They are to be broken up at the baseunder the eye of Soviet inspectors.   The missiles arrived unannounced less than a year ago, but theirdeparture was public.   They were encased in canisters atop camouflage-painted launchersthat lumbered from Molesworth under police escort, past the baseinsignia of U.S. and British flags crossed over the slogan ``PeaceThrough Partnership,'' then along seven miles of rural lanes toAlconbury.   As the two mobile launchers and a launch training vehicle movedout of Molesworth about 40 anti-nuclear protesters rushed forwardand showered the convoy with their peace symbol, multicolored paperpetals. They shouted ``Go home!'' and ``Good riddance! Don't comeback!''   Several Hare Krishna followers in white and gold robes joinedthe protesters, softly beating drums and tambourines.   Police grabbed one protester who tried to run toward the leadvehicle shouting, ``What about the warheads?''   Destruction of the warheads is not required under the superpowerIntermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. They were not in the convoy andAmerican officials said they would be returned to the United States``in due course.''   The agreement to eliminate the approximately 2,700 Soviet andU.S. land-based nuclear missiles from Europe by 1991 was signed byPresident Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December andratified by the Senate in May.   Some Soviet SS-20s aimed at Western Europe were removed inFebruary and nine Pershing 2 missiles were taken from a West Germanbase Sept. 1.   Cruise missiles first arrived in Europe in November 1983 andwere deployed at the Greenham Common base west of London. It nowhas 96 missiles.   Missiles deployed at Molesworth were the last to arrive, inNovember 1987, and Defense Secretary George Younger said they willbe gone within three months.   Younger declared at a news conference in a Molesworth hangarthat, despite Gorbachev's policies of reform, the Soviet Unionremains on the military offensive.   U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II said the world was now``marginally safer'' and added: ``We are are witnessing the removalof the cruise missiles because we, the NATO allies, have beenstrong and united.''   ``We are not here because some individuals, well-intentioned andinnocent of the world's realities, kept vigils at our bases,'' hesaid, referring to protesters who have camped outside Greenham andMolesworth.   Younger said the treaty and missile removal was ``a stingingrebuke'' to those who had sought unilateral Western disarmament.   Outside the gates of Molesworth, members of the anti-nuclearmovement saw it differently.   ``We're delighted that the missiles are going. We've kept up thepressure on this government ... and we claim part of the credit,''said Meg Beresford, secretary of the Campaign for NuclearDisarmament. ``But we are very concerned about the possibility ofnew weapons being brought in which certainly break the spirit ofthe treaty.''   She expressed fear that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgovernment will accept U.S. F-111 bombers carrying air-launchedcruise missiles, which are not banned by the treaty.   Younger did not deny Britain may deploy new U.S. air- orsea-launched nuclear missiles, as well as maintaining its ownnuclear arsenal. He said Britain will keep nuclear weapons ``todeter, in such numbers and at such locations as are necessary.''</TEXT></DOC>
