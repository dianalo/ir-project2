Kilpatrick summed it up well when he described &quot;theintensity of tribal prejudice&quot; that prevents Congress from exhibitinggenerosity.andM;I have my own theory as to who the murderer was.andP;  I think the pay raise wassmothered to death years ago by the federal government's personnel managementsystem, and the body has just been discovered.andM;The Real CulpritandM;The problem runs deeper and encompasses non-competitive salaries at alllevels, obsolete position descriptions, a pension system that varies at thewhim of Congress, early-out programs rewarding the non-productive butwithheld from valued employees, flexible work plans administered withoutregard for their impact on service delivery to the public....andP;  The list goeson and on.andM;The president and the Congress must reform the personnel management system ifthe public is to be convinced that a pay raise for any branch of the federalgovernment makes sense.andP;  In the words of Constance Horner; former director ofthe Office of Personnel Management, &quot;The current system is slow; it islegally trammelled and intellectually confused; it is impossible to explain.&quot;andM;The National Commission on the Public Service, under the chairmanship of PaulVolcker, has made two recommendations that would provide a foundation forreform.andP;  The first recognizes that the current goal of national paycomparability in the executive branch is unworkable.andM;The commission recommends a pay system under which federal employees wouldcontinue to receive the same base pay for the same job but would receive anallowance to compensate for higher living costs and labor competition on ageographic basis.andM;Fairness Is UnderstoodandM;Providing competitive pay based on the job and the local job market would goa long way toward convincing the public that increasing the pay of theexecutive branch is a rational act.andP;  It is understandable and fair and wouldbe accepted by the American public in a way that an increase for the topbrass alone will never be.andM;The commission's second recommendation deals with the role of the Office ofPersonnel Management.andP;  Observing &quot;there has been a sense that OPM may havebecome more of an obstacle than a leader,&quot; the commission suggests thefollowing:andM;* OPM's current operating responsibilities such as specialized training andapproval of routine personnel decisions should be decentralized to thefederal departments and agencies.andM;* OPM should provide policy guidance and technical support on personnelstandards and practices and oversee implementation by the departments andagencies.andM;* The president should highlight OPM's role and ensure the director of OPMparticipates in cabinet-level discussions of human resource managementissues.andM;The personnel officers in the agencies, who are straitjacketed by the presentsystem, should do the agency personnel management job.andP;  In the commission'sview, the government's chief personnel agency then must provide theday-to-day leadership and guidance needed to help the agencies build aculture of performance.andM;Can it be done?andP;  Is it possible to build a culture of performance ingovernment operations?andP;  The comptroller general, Charles Bowsher, seems tothink so.andM;&quot;We know the human talent is there,&quot; he said recently.andP;  &quot;We need to find goodpeople, pay them competitive salaries, hold them accountable, and let themproduce.andP;  Given leadership and motivation, they will do the job.&quot;andM;That sounds to me like a prescription for success.andP;  The sooner we getstarted, the better.andP;  We may be able to breathe life back into the pay raiseafter all.andP;  Congress, are you listening?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
