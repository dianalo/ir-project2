South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold, supplying34 percent of the total. Export sales of an estimated 600 tons ayear provide half the country's annual foreign exchange earnings.   This week's price plunge to $365 an ounce comes just as theannual wage negotiations have begun between the major miningcompanies and the black National Union of Mineworkers.   A year ago gold was around $450 an ounce. Analysts attribute thefall to a strengthening dollar and an increase in the world's goldsupply.   Rand Mines Ltd. on Friday suspended listings on theJohannesburg, Paris and London stock exchanges for two of itsoldest gold mines.   The company said that at prevailing prices, the mines areincurring substantial losses, and it appealed for more governmentfinancial assistance to keep them operating.   The two mines are Durban Roodeport Deep, which employs 8,177blacks and 496 whites; and East Rand Proprietary Mines, where10,289 blacks and 1,155 whites work.   East Rand has received government assistance for some time, saidRand Mines spokesman Greg Kukard, because production costs exceededrevenue last year by about $12 per ton of milled gold.   The National Union of Mineworkers, which represents nearly halfof the country's 600,000 black miners, believes companies shoulduse some profits from viable mines to keep marginal mines runningand support employment.   The union opened annual wage negotiations Wednesday demanding auniform minimum wage of $222 a month for underground miners and$210 for surface workers.   Such a policy would mean pay increases of up to 100 percent forsome workers.   Officials at the Chamber of Mines, which represents the majormining houses, have warned that drastic increases in wages wouldplace 15 marginal mines in jeopardy, in an industry where anestimated 17,000 jobs have been lost in the past 17 months.   The Star, the country's largest newspaper, reported Friday thatthe government has been cushioning the immediate effects of thelower gold price on the industry by allowing the currency to fallto 2.70 rands per dollar Friday afternoon.   The gold price has fallen $9 in the past week, and $35 since thebeginning of the year, ``which could cost South Africa almost $700million in a year, The Star estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
