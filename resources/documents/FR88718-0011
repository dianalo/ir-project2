Ficaretta, Wine and BeerBranch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Ariel Rios Federal Building,1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20226 (202-566-7626).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 5 (e) and (f) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act),27 U.S.C. 205 (e) and (f), provides, in general terms, that wine labelingand advertising shall not contain any statement which is false, deceptive,misleading, or is likely to mislead the consumer regarding the product.In addition, section 5 (e) and (f) authorizes the Secretary to prescribesuch regulations as will provide the consumer with adequate informationas to the identity and quality of the product except that, as specifiedin section 5(e), statements of alcoholic content on labels of wine arerequired only for products containing more than 14 percent of alcohol byvolume. Section 5(f) <T3>prohibits</T3> statements of, or statements likely to be consideredas statements of, alcoholic content of wines in advertising.Regulations which implement the provisions of section 5 (e) and (f), asthey relate to wine, are set forth in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations(CFR), Part 4. Requirements for statements of alcoholic content on winelabels are prescribed in andSection; 4.36(b). In essence, if a specific alcoholiccontent is to be disclosed, it shall appear as ``Alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% by volume.'' If a range is to be utilized, the alcoholic contentstatement shall read as ``Alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% to <T2>XX</T2>% by volume.''The size of type requirements for the alcoholic content statements mentionedabove are prescribed in andSection; 4.38(b). Specifically, andSection; 4.38(b)(3)reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Alcoholic content statements shall not appear in script, type, orprinting larger or more conspicuous than 2 millimeters nor smaller than1 millimeter on labels of containers having a capacity of 5 liters or lessand shall not be set off with a border or otherwise accentuated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Petition</ITAG>ATF received a petition, dated January 29, 1988, filed by the Wine Institute,requesting that andSection; 4.36(b) and 4.38(b) be amended. The Wine Instituteis an industry association of California wineries representing 538 Californiawinery members.Specifically, the petitioners requested that andSection; 4.36(b)(1) be amendedto permit the alcoholic content statement to appear in an abbreviated formas ``Alc. <T2>XX</T2>% vol,'' as an alternative to ``Alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% by volume.'' Similarly, they requested that andSection; 4.36(b)(2)be amended to permit the alcoholic content statement, when given as a range,to appear as ``Alc. <T2>XX</T2>% to <T2>XX</T2>% vol,'' as an alternative to ``Alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% to <T2>XX</T2>% by volume.''The Wine Institute also requested that andSection; 4.38(b)(3) be amended,increasing the maximum allowable type size for alcoholic content statementsfrom two millimeters to three millimeters.According to the petitioners, the European Economic Community (EEC), whichpresently includes 12 Member States, has established regulations that makethe disclosure of alcoholic content on wine labels mandatory as of May1, 1988, and that prescribe the form, and type size in which the alcoholiccontent statements may be made on wine labels.Under the new EEC regulations, the alcoholic content figure must be followedby ``% vol'' and may be preceded by, among other alternatives, the abbreviation``alc.'' The petitioners noted that ``[T]his requirement renders wine containerslabeled in compliance with BATF regulations unacceptable for shipment tothe EEC without relabeling. The necessity of relabeling would be obviatedby amending the regulation [andSection; 4.36(b)] to accommodate EEC language.''Regarding the type size of alcoholic content statements, the EEC now requiressuch statements to appear in printing no smaller than three millimeters.Current U.S. regulations (andSection; 4.38(b)) require that the alcoholiccontent statement appear in printing <T3>not larger</T3> than two millimeters. Again, wine containers labeledin compliance with U.S. regulations would be unacceptable for shipmentto the EEC, and would have to be relabeled.The petitioners stated that adoption of their proposed amendments wouldresult in cost savings to U.S. wineries, since wines for export would nothave to be relabeled in order to comply with EEC requirements. Further,wineries would not have to design new labels solely for products intendedfor sale in the EEC.Subsequent to the filing of the Wine Institute petition, the Bureau receiveda letter (dated February 23, 1988) on behalf of the National Associationof Beverage Importers, Inc. (NABI), supporting the Wine Institute petition.NABI is an industry association representing more than 100 member companiesthat import over 90% of all alcoholic beverages brought into the U.S.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice No. 656</ITAG>Consequently, ATF published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (Notice No. 656, March 25, 1988; 53 FR 9775),proposing to amend andSection; 4.36(b) by providing that the alcoholic contentstatement may appear in an abbreviated form. However, the words ``alcohol''and/or ``volume,'' if abbreviated, shall be shown as ``alc.'' (alc) and/or``vol.'' (vol), respectively. ATF believes that consumers can easily recognizethe words that these abbreviations represent.The Bureau also proposed to amend andSection; 4.36(b) to provide for thealcoholic content to be disclosed on the label in a form other than thatcurrently prescribed. Examples of such statements included, ``<T2>XX</T2>% alcohol by volume,'' ``<T2>XX</T2>% alcohol/volume,'' ``alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% volume,'' and ``alcohol <T2>XX</T2>% to ``<T2>XX</T2>% volume.'' Again, if the words ``alcohol'' and/or ``volume''are to be abbreviated, they shall be shown as ``alc.'' (alc) and/or ``vol.''(vol), respectively.Finally, the Bureau proposed to amend andSection; 4.38(b)(3), by raisingthe maximum allowable type size for statements of alcoholic content fromtwo millimeters to three millimeters. The comment period for Notice No.656 closed on April 25, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments</ITAG>In response to Notice No. 656, the Bureau received five comments. Fourof the five comments supported the proposals made in the notice, and weresubmitted by_the French Federation des Exportateurs de Vins et de Spiritueux(FEVS), a private organization of more than 500 members representing allaspects of the French wine and spirits industry; the Federation Internationaledes Industries et du Commerce en Gros des Vins Spiritueux, Eaux-de-vieet Liquers (FIVS), on behalf of its members (56 associations in 24 countries);the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, on behalf of the Republic,and; Heublein, Inc.The opposing comment was submitted by the Center for Science in the PublicInterest (CSPI). Of the three proposals made in Notice No. 656, CSPI objectedto the one which would permit the alcoholic content statement to appearin a abbreviated form. Specifically, CSPI opposed the Bureau's proposalto permit the abbreviation of the word ``alcohol'' as ``alc.'' (alc). Inessence, CSPI contended that this proposal ``makes the [alcoholic content]disclosure inherently smaller, less conspicuous, and more likely to beoverlooked altogether'' by consumers. Furthermore, CSPI stated that consumersmay not be able to recognize the abbreviated form, and may be confusedby it.In regard to CSPI's first concern, the Bureau does not believe that permittingthe statement of alcoholic content to appear in an abbreviated form wouldresult in its being ``overlooked'' by consumers. Under the labeling regulations(andSection; 4.32), statements of alcoholic content, including the use ofthe designation ``table'' (light) wine, are considered to be mandatoryinformation and, as such, must comply with the requirements of andSection;4.38 as to legibility, size of type, etc. In addition, the regulationsin andSection; 4.32(a)(3) specify that statements of alcoholic content mustappear on the brand (front) label. Thus, whether the word ``alcohol'' inthe alcoholic content statement is spelled out, or abbreviated, the regulationsrequire it to appear on the front label, legibly and conspicuously.As to CSPI's second concern, the Bureau is aware of the possibility thatconsumers might not be able to easily recognize the abbreviated form ofthe word ``alcohol'' depending, however, on how the word is abbreviated.For example, although ``al.'' is recognized as an acceptable abbreviationfor the word ``alcohol,'' the Bureau believes that consumers may be confusedby it. Thus, as indicated in Notice No. 656, when the Bureau has permittedthe alcoholic content of the wine to be disclosed on the label in an abbreviatedform, only the abbreviations ``alc.'' (alc) and ``vol.'' (vol) were acceptable.This qualification was also included in the Bureau's notice of proposedrulemaking.Therefore, based on the above, the Bureau is adopting the regulations asproposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>In compliance with Executive Order 12291, 46 FR 13193 (1981), ATF has determinedthat this regulation is not a major rule since it will not result in:(a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(b) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(c) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatoryflexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rulebecause it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.
