Frank E. Young and Henry I. Miller (editorial page, Jan. 13) addressing what is biotechnology and what is not offers a solution that promises a problem. Their quarrel is that either biotechnology is too broadly defined or the term too frequently used when more precise nomenclature would convey more accurate meaning.    Breeding selected strains to produce a high-yield, disease-resistant plant is genetic engineering to be sure. And so is the use of recombinant DNA technology to transfer the genes directly to plant cells to get the same result, perhaps years sooner and with more certainty. Both fit under the umbrella definition of biotechnology. Where's the harm?    Their article says a questionnaire seeking to document biotechnology regulation in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development produced unduly varied and ultimately useless results, because not all respondents adhered to the broad definition of biotechnology supplied. Could the fault have been with the question? Surely any bureaucrat worth his salt could have concocted a multiple query asking, &quot;Do you regulate the following separately -- recombinant DNA techniques, monoclonal antibodies, cell culture, selective breeding, etc.&quot;    Biotechnology is a very useful term to describe the multiple disciplines being employed to bring about commercial application of biology. It includes the technique of &quot;gene splicing&quot; to make health-related products like natural insulin, growth hormone and interferon as well as hybridoma technology to make pregnancy kits, and tests to detect the AIDS virus in blood.    These same techniques and others are being used to perfect changes in agriculture and the environment, the net result of which will be of enormous benefit.    Biotechnology is a good, convenient collective term that facilitates discussion of scientific advances in biochemistry, microbiology, ecology and related fields in connection with their reduction to commercial application. It is a handy category for grouping the exciting breakthroughs that are taking place in our industry. And, to paraphrase Prof. Higgins, &quot;We've grown accustomed to the name.&quot;    Richard D.
