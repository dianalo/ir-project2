After recovering from the liability-insurance woes of the mid-1980s, in which many day-care operators and others were forced to pay higher premiums or forgo coverage altogether, operators could find themselves in the same predicament.    Under a provision of the 1986 tax-reform law that was phased-in last year, insurers lost a major tax incentive for insuring day-care operations and other industries with a high potential for long-term liability claims. That change -- the impact of which wasn't apparent until recently -- coupled with the sensitivity of insurers toward liability issues surrounding the child-care industry, has raised new concerns about the cost and availability of coverage.    Indeed, the announcement last week by La Petite Academy Inc., the nation's second-largest chain of day-care facilities, that it was dropped by its liability insurer, American International Group Inc., may be the first of many such instances, some child-care industry specialists say.    &quot;What we see is an impending disaster of insurance availability,&quot; says James Strickland, executive director of Child Inc., an Austin, Texas, organization that provides research and training for child-care operators. &quot;Within a few years, we're either going to see parents paying significantly higher tuition rates for good-quality care, or there's going to be no coverage at all and child care is going to evaporate.&quot;    The biggest factor in the latest flare-up of the liability-insurance issue is the change in the tax law. Previously, insurers set aside reserves based on estimates of their future liability claims. These reserves are treated as losses and not subject to tax. The tax-law change, however, effectively forces insurers to declare smaller reserve amounts, and hence pay higher taxes. This reduces the tax appeal for insuring any industry with the potential for large future liability claims, including the day-care, health-care and waste-disposal industries.    Because of the new law, the overall liability-insurance market is likely to tighten, but the impact &quot;may be even more drastic for day-care centers,&quot; says Charles Ruoff, senior vice president, strategic planning and industry relations, for Fred S. James andamp; Co., the large insurance broker.    The day-care industry is especially vulnerable because of underwriters' longstanding worries about the riskiness of insuring day-care operators. For instance, there's no way for insurers to predict when and where child-molestation cases might crop up. And lawsuits involving the treatment of children are emotionally charged, capable of producing big jury awards.    Liability claims filed long after a child attends a day-care facility are rare; nevertheless, child-care providers and insurers say the threat of such litigation is a constant worry. &quot;Right now, we're in a battle with the parents of a three-year-old because we won't let her have a bottle in class,&quot; says Cheri L. Sheridan, a child-care consultant who also runs four centers in the Washington, D.C., area. &quot;We wonder if they will come back years from now and say the kid is psychologically messed up because we wouldn't let her have a bottle when she was in preschool.&quot;    Mr. Strickland believes that AIG may have seen the taxman's handwriting on the wall when it dropped La Petite, based in Kansas City, Mo. Although AIG won't comment on its reasons for dropping La Petite, the day-care operator acknowledges that it had experienced rising claims, mostly for minor accidents. La Petite also says that it settled a child-molestation claim during the summer involving a former teacher at a company-run center in the Denver area. La Petite now insures itself against liability claims, assuming all risks and costs.    Whatever the reason for AIG's action, &quot;it casts a pall over the entire child-care industry,&quot; Ms. Sheridan says. La Petite is &quot;a major chain, not the Raggedy Ann center down the street,&quot; she says, adding that AIG's decision to drop La Petite &quot;will have a definite ripple effect.&quot;    One immediate effect of AIG's move will be to rekindle the fears of companies that want to contract with child-care providers for on-site day care for their employees' children, Ms. Sheridan says. &quot;Those companies are already scared to death of the liability issue,&quot; she says. &quot;This was the last thing we needed.&quot;    Not everyone is convinced, however, that an insurance-liability crisis is at hand. &quot;I haven't seen any indication of another hardening of the market,&quot; says Gary Tiepelman, director of casualty insurance underwriting for Scottsdale Insurance Co. in Scottsdale, Ariz., a major provider of child-care liability coverage. &quot;The competition is tremendous.&quot;    La Petite's competitors, as well as investors in day-care providers, say they believe the La Petite situation is an isolated one. &quot;We haven't had any difficulty, nor do we anticipate any,&quot; says Richard J. Grassgreen, president of Kinder-Care Inc., which has 1,172 day-care centers.    Nevertheless, child-care industry specialists familiar with the liability-insurance issues stress that some insurers, especially smaller ones, may withdraw from the market, especially if a major sexual or physical abuse case were to grab national attention. Even though no child-molestation cases have resulted in big settlements yet, &quot;there's still obviously a concern,&quot; says Mr. Tiepelman of Scottsdale Insurance.    John Giraudo, who as special assistant to the Reagan administration's labor secretary chairs an interagency working group on child-care issues, adds: &quot;All it takes are a few terrible stories of child abuse before you have a major stampede&quot; by insurers heading for the exits. </TEXT></DOC>
