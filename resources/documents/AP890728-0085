Draped in a vintage British military coat and posed in a trenchmock-up, the skull and left leg bones formed the centerpiece of theSomme Museum. The private collection of war memorabilia is devotedto the 1916 battle by the same name that killed more than 1 millionBritish, French and German soldiers.   John Bluming, who served in the Dutch contingent in the KoreanWar, said in a telephone interview Friday that he walked into themuseum Tuesday, wrapped the remains in a Union Jack and spiritedthem away for eventual burial with military honors.   ``It isn't right for some imbecile to charge money just so youcan see the remains of a dead soldier,'' said Bluming, who added hehad handed the bones over to a former British commando for transferto the British authorities. He refused to identify the commando.   The episode has pitted the French-born owner of the Somme Museumagainst the British Embassy, the British Commonwealth War GravesCommission and others who thought the exhibit was in just plain badtaste.   Museum owner Sembeau Lecocq said he found the skull and bones ina trench near the village of Thiepval in the Somme district about25 years ago and decided to take them home for use in the exhibithoused in a castle in this northern Dutch town.   Lecocq said he dubbed the bones ``Soldier John'' because he hadfound some British uniform buttons nearby and assumed the remainsto be those of a British soldier.   Surrounded by stuffed rats, rusty rifles and dented helmets,``Soldier John'' became part of a trench exhibit meant to underlinethe hardships endured by soldiers in World War I.   Earlier this month, the newspaper De Telegraaf published anarticle about the museum, including a picture of the bones of``Soldier John.''   Bluming said that spurred him to action because the bones ``justdidn't belong'' in the museum.   Bluming said he had taken the law into his own hands as agesture of gratitude to the British for their part in theliberation of the Netherlands from Nazi occupation in 1945.   But he added, ``I'd have done the same thing for a German.''   British Embassy spokesman Brian Bennett said the CommonwealthWar Graves Commission had been negotiating for permission to burythe remains since 1985 but added an initial deal with Lecocq hadfallen through.   The commission, based in the Belgian city of Ypres, looks afterthe graves of British, Australian, Canadian and other commonwealthsoldiers buried in Europe after both world wars.   ``It's most unfortunate,'' Bennett said. ``We would like to takepossession of the remains and give them an honorable burial'' nearthe northern French site where they were found.   He added such a funeral would require permission from the Dutchgovernment and that the remains had not been handed over to theembassy.   The Netherlands was neutral in World War I, but there are dozensof exhibits like the Somme Museum in Belgium and France. Thoseinclude the Verdun Ossuary near that northeastern French city,where hundreds of thousands of bones are on display.</TEXT></DOC>
