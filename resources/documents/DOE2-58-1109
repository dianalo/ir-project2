<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1109 </DOCNO><TEXT>A spectrophotometric technique is described for determining the spectraladsorption coefficients of solar pond samples. Spectral transmittancemeasurements made on pure water are found to be in good agreement withpublished data, validating the technique and providing an indicationof its accuracy. A radiation transmission profile deduced from measurementsmade on slightly turbid, unchlorinated water from an outdoor swimmingpool is compared with direct broadband transmittance measurements madein the pool using a specially-adapted, submersible pyranometer. Discrepanciesbetween the two sets of results are discussed. A simple numerical modelof the absorption of beam radiation in a solar pond is used to deducea radiation transmission profile from spectral transmittance measurementsmade on samples obtained at various depths in a solar pond in Portugal.</TEXT></DOC>
