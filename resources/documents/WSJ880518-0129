But the stakes were hardly as high as those he wagered earlier that night over Hongkong Land Co.    A group of raiders led by Mr. Li had built up a minority holding in Hongkong Land, which owns prime property in the British territory valued at 26 billion Hong Kong dollars ($3.33 billion). Hongkong Land is controlled by the Jardine Matheson group, whose origins coincide with Britain's arrival in Hong Kong in the 1840s.    In a showdown, Mr. Li demanded that Jardine Chairman Simon Keswick buy back the stake or risk a takeover fight. Such a battle was the last thing the raiders wanted and, luckily for them, Mr. Keswick decided not to call their bluff. That let Mr. Li exit relatively unscathed from an ambitious takeover plan gone awry.    &quot;Everyone was scared to death it might turn into the real thing,&quot; says a participant in the May 4 meeting. &quot;Given the firepower on both sides, who knows where it might lead if either side got pushed too hard?&quot;    The struggle over Hong Kong's premier property company is a landmark in the corporate rivalry between British and Chinese interests in this colony, which is scheduled to revert to China in 1997.    Mr. Li, seemingly invincible in past conquests, for once was stopped by a rare case of bad timing. Troubled by Hongkong Land's once-heavy debts and by the approach of Chinese sovereignty nine years hence, Mr. Keswick had considered selling out. But Mr. Li didn't warm to the idea until October, when Mr. Keswick was already backing away. Mr. Li then turned his thoughts to a hostile bid, only to be blindsided by the Oct. 19 equities crash. Only by bluffing Mr. Keswick did he manage to save himself and fellow raiders from taking a major loss on their minority Hongkong Land holding.    Brian Powers, managing director of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., the group holding company, says he is satisfied with the outcome. &quot;I hope this will convince people that we aren't sellers of Hongkong Land,&quot; he says.    Mr. Li, too, seems unruffled. &quot;What's done is done,&quot; he says.    Mr. Li, 59 years old, is a self-made man and a folk hero among Hong Kong Chinese. His Cheung Kong group began gobbling up Hong Kong blue-chip companies in 1978 when they were still considered a British preserve. Cheung Kong has displaced Jardine as the biggest family-held business empire in Hong Kong, and despite this latest episode, Mr. Li doesn't appear to have lost his touch.    Under Hong Kong's loose regulatory environment, few details of takeover contests are disclosed. But operating on rumor, many investors had bet on Mr. Li, buying Hongkong Land stock in the expectation the takeover battle would provide a windfall. The stock's 15% plunge since May 4, the day before his retreat became public, gives a measure of their disillusionment.    The only official disclosure about the affair came May 5 from Jardine. All it said was that a Jardine unit would buy from Cheung Kong and three other concerns an 8% stake, or 205 million shares, in Hongkong Land at 8.95 Hong Kong dollars ($1.15) a share, a slight 0.56% premium to the market price then. The purchase brings Jardine's holding in Hongkong Land to 33%.    The only other significant detail in the statement is that Jardine extracted from Mr. Li and two other sellers agreement not to acquire a substantial stake in any Jardine company for seven years.    Even more intriguing is the role played by the fourth member of the raiders' consortium, China International Trust andamp; Investment Corp., or Citic, a powerful investment agency under Beijing's control. Jardine didn't bind Citic to the seven-year agreement, those involved in the talks say. &quot;It just isn't something you get a Chinese government agency to sign,&quot; says one.    As owner of Exchange Square -- home of the colony's stock exchange -- and many other office complexes in the business district, Hongkong Land is the territory's most prestigious landlord. In unsettled times, its assets can make the company a high-risk investment. With 1997 on his mind, Mr. Keswick hasn't always been sure the prestige was worth the risk. As a result, he was widely believed to be a willing seller given the right price.    But when Hong Kong shares went wild last year, others were willing to take the risk. Mr. Li was drawn into the fray when another Hong Kong entrepreneur, Joseph Lau, made a bid for Hongkong Land.    With other major Chinese property developers keen to take part, Mr. Li chose to join forces rather than compete. &quot;I think some of these developers were driven mostly by fear that if they didn't do it, someone else would,&quot; a banker says.    Mr. Lau backed out. Mr. Li's group escalated its offer until it approached 17 dollars. But Mr. Keswick remained obstinate, forcing the group to consider a hostile bid. &quot;The developers' feeling then was why pay the Keswicks all that money when the same stock could be bought cheaper in the market,&quot; says an associate.    But all became confusion when the market crashed on Oct. 19, by which time the developers had amassed 12%, or about 307 million, of Hongkong Land's shares at an estimated average price of 9.50 dollars apiece, or 2.91 billion Hong Kong dollars ($370 million). A sale would have meant substantial losses. As options, including an all-out hostile bid, kept being debated, the matter dragged on.    But fear that Hongkong Land might issue shares to dilute the Li group's holdings -- and that such a move would stiffen Jardine's resolve against buying back the Li group's minority interest at greenmail prices -- finally moved Mr. Li to seek a confrontation with Mr. Keswick.    So, five days after the new share placement, Mr. Li and his partners met with Mr. Keswick, who for a final time turned down their offer to buy Jardine's entire stake in Hongkong Land. He also rejected a proposal that Jardine buy the raiders' minority holding but relented after Mr. Li outlined his options -- including a hostile bid -- if Mr. Keswick held firm.    &quot;It was clear that they were more interested in getting out than in,&quot; an associate of Mr. Keswick says of the raiders. &quot;But you don't force someone like K.S. Li into a corner without expecting some dramatic consequences.&quot;    Apparently keen to see the matter concluded, the Li group retired to an adjacent room and played poker as lawyers from both sides worked through the night to prepare the agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
