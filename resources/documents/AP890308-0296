Eastern, in a desperate attempt to lure back customers to itsailing Northeast shuttle service, said it will reduce one-way faresto $12 on weekends, from $69-$99, and $49 weekdays, down from $99.   Pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safetyrules, but for a second day there was little evidence of a backup onrunways.   Houston-based Continental announced it would begin daily nonstopflights from New York City's LaGuardia Airport to Miami on Thursday.Continental said it will run four daily round trips.   ``This is not a direct result of the Eastern strike,''Continental spokesman Ned Walker said of the new routes. ``What thisis, is a response to market demand of what we've seen in the pastfew days.''   In Philadelphia, USAir announced it had closed a $70 million dealwith Eastern, after months of talks, to acquire all eight of theairline's gates at Philadelphia International Airport, third-largestof the airline's four hubs.   USAir said it will use the counter space, along with baggage andrelated services, for operations of Piedmont Airlines, which willmerge with USAir this year.   Eastern picked up $15 million more in a separate deal, sellingUSAir its Philadelphia-Tornonto and Philadelphia-Montreal routes for$15 million.   USAir said both deals would require court approval if Easterndeclares bankruptcy.   The labor dispute rested Wednesday with courts in New York,Philadelphia and Atlanta, where Eastern went to court to appeal ajudge's refusal to order union pilots back to the cockpits.   Eastern contends it is near collapse, losing at least $2 milliona day. Its lawyer said in court Tuesday the nation's seventh-largestcarrier cannot survive the week if its pilots maintain their supportfor the Machinists.   The airline is running just 4 percent of its flights and says itwill consider bankruptcy court, though as a last resort. It sent9,500 workers home this week and has just a skeleton staff of 1,500remaining.   The 8,500-member Machinists union walked out Saturday, and withthe support of pilots and flight attendants soon nearly shut downEastern. Eastern is seeking $125 million in concessions; the unionwants $50 million in raises.   The Machinists also threatened to disrupt commuter rail trafficwith secondary boycotts, which it contends are legal under the 1926Railway Labor Act. But the union held off when a federal judge inNew York over the weekend temporarily barred rail workers fromhonoring Machinists picket lines.   Among developments:   _ The Machinists have asked Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C.Icahn to seek control of the carrier, and he said he is willing totalk with them.   ``I would be willing to speak to the unions only if Easternpermits me to, because I do not want to be accused by Eastern ofinterfering with the collective bargaining process,'' Icahn said ina statement.   Icahn had mulled a bid for Eastern a few months ago, when itsboss, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, was consideringselling. But Icahn and the unions couldn't agree on terms for aworker stake in a merger of TWA and Eastern, and talks broke off.   Eastern had no comment. Charles E. Bryan, president of MachinistsDistrict 100, would not comment on Icahn's statement but said inMiami: ``If there is willingness (by Eastern) to sell, there arecertainly interested parties. ... It would be a tremendousopportunity to see the phoenix rise from the ashes.''   _ In Miami, Eastern marketing vice president, George Brennandenied that reduced shuttle fares were a move to protect the pending$365 million sale of the shuttle service to New York developerDonald Trump. Competitor Pan Am Corp. said it would not match thefares.   _ In New York City, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refusedto allow commuter rail workers in the New York area to honor anyMachinists picket lines. But the judges said they expect the disputeto go to the U.S. Supreme Court.   _ U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson, who issued the initialruling, heard arguments Wednesday evening on whether to makepermanent his ban, covering Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road,Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit. The railroadscarry hundreds of thousands of commuters.   Patterson, after 7{ hours testimony, recessed the hearing until10 a.m. Thursday. He was not expected to rule immediately; hisorders barring strikes at Amtrak and the other railroads expire atmidnight Friday.   _ Eastern lawyers filed notice with a federal appeals court inAtlanta on plans to continue efforts to force pilots to work. ``Idon't expect our brief to be filed until tomorrow morning,'' saidEastern attorney David Ross.   _ In Philadelphia, a federal judge Wednesday issued a preliminaryinjunction, extending a temporary restraining order that prohibitedrail unions from honoring pickets set up by Machinists atSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority facilities, whichcarry 100,000 passengers daily.   _ The Air Lines Pilots Association, whose contract with Easternexpired in June, said the airline has asked to set up talks. Unionspokesman J.B. Stokes said a meeting was set for Thursday.   _ President Bush has resisted calls from organized labor and somemembers of Congress that he appoint an emergency panel to mediate.But he has also said he will not tolerate disruptions throughout thetransportation industry.   ``The president believes that in a free enterprise system workersin business should work out their differences without congressionalor governmental interference,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel K.Skinner said Wednesday on CBS' ``This Morning.''   If Bush intercedes, an emergency panel could impose a 60-daycooling-off period.   Some union officials have said throughout the 17-month disputethat Eastern and Lorenzo want to dismantle the airline.   ``Our people have recognized from the very earliest days of thisdispute that that kind of a result (bankruptcy) could beforthcoming,'' said Machinists union President William Winpisinger.   ``They are so fed up with the way they have been treated, so fedup with the environment on the job, that they're willing to walkaway and if that is the result they'll accept it,'' he said on theCBS program.   Airports reported no problems on the second day of a work-to-ruleaction by union pilots around the country.   ``We're operating close to normal,'' said Mort Edelstein,spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. ``There have beensporadic requests for special handling by flight crews,'' such ashaving instructions repeated.   ``There are no problems,'' John Braden, spokesman at HartsfieldAtlanta International Airport. ``We've got so much air space we'relooking for new carriers.''</TEXT></DOC>
