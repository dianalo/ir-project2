Wheelon, 59-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Hughes Aircraft Co., unexpectedly retired, citing unexplained &quot;personal reasons&quot; for leaving just 13 months after assuming the top posts at the General Motors Corp. unit.    Hughes Aircraft's board named Malcolm R. Currie, 61, to succeed Mr. Wheelon, who retired six years short of the normal retirement age under the provisions of the company's early retirement plan.    Mr. Currie was formerly executive vice president of Hughes Aircraft and president of Delco Electronics Corp. Both are the two operating units of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the GM subsidiary represented by the GM Class H stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange.    The company didn't immediately name a successor to Mr. Currie at Delco Electronics.    Mr. Wheelon's abrupt retirement comes just a month after another Hughes executive, Richard Alden, 63, vice chairman and general counsel of Hughes Aircraft, unexpectedly retired. Company officials said the departures are unrelated.    Officials of Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr. Wheelon's retirement. They also wouldn't say whether it was related to a reported internal investigation of Hughes Aircraft's communications satellite business.    The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that Hughes Aircraft was looking into whether its executives made improper payments to officials of Washington-based Intelstat, an international telecommunications consortium, in connection with contracts issued to Hughes over many years. Hughes Aircraft officials wouldn't confirm whether such an investigation exists. Mr. Wheelon was in charge of of Hughes's satellite business, which controls half the world-wide commercial communications satellite market, from 1971 to 1986. Hughes Aircraft also makes missiles and other electronic hardware.    Hughes is attempting to revitalize its satellite business in the wake of the space shuttle Challenger disaster and the subsequent halt of the space shuttle program. Hughes, which has launched just one satellite a year since the 1986 catastrophe, has 12 launches scheduled for next year.    Mr. Wheelon had served on the president's commission investigating the Challenger disaster and the president's foreign intelligence advisory board. He couldn't be reached to elaborate on the reasons for his early retirement. Mr. Currie, his successor, is a Hughes veteran, and a former assistant secretary of defense.    Donald White, president of Hughes Aircraft, said yesterday he was &quot;surprised&quot; at Mr. Wheelon's retirement. But Mr. White, a member of Hughes Aircraft's board, also said he believed Mr. Wheelon's decision to retire was &quot;voluntary,&quot; and hadn't been forced by the board.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, GM's Class H stock closed unchanged at $29.625. </TEXT></DOC>
