Second-half consolidated operating profit showed thestrongest performance, rising 28% to S$23.5 million fromS$18.4 million in the second half of fiscal 1990. Rothmanssaid a 32% jump in full-year investment income to S$12.5million from S$9.4 million also bolstered profit.   It warned that a &quot;shrinking domestic market&quot; caused by&quot;increasingly stringent legislation and regular anti-smokingcampaigns directed at the tobacco industry in Singapore&quot;could affect its performance.   Analysts said, however, that Rothmans &quot;have been sayingthis for a long time&quot; and that its exports continue to makeup for any drop in domestic sales. Forecasts generally callfor the group's net after-tax profit to rise 10% to 15% inthe current fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
