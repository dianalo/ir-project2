The transaction, involving stations WCZY AM/FM, is subject to Federal Communications Commission approval, the newspaper and communications concern said. Gannett said the FCC's multiple-ownership rules prohibit a company from owning both a broadcasting station and a daily general-interest newspaper in the same city. Gannett acquired the Detroit News last year. </TEXT></DOC>
