Boesky plan to ask afederal judge to reduce his three-year jail term on grounds thatthe convicted inside trader's cooperation led to the indictment ofjunk bond financier Michael Milken, sources say.   Boesky became eligible for parole last month after one year in aminimum security prison, but probably will seek early release fromthe judge in Manhattan who sentenced him, not from prisonofficials, an attorney involved in the case said Thursday.   Attorneys will have to prove that Boesky should be rewarded forproviding information that led the government to Milken, the formerDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier charged last week with 98counts of racketeering and securities fraud.   Boesky's lawyers decided to wait to seek his release until afterthe Milken indictment because they felt the judge and the prisonwould not otherwise be sympathetic to freeing the man widelyconsidered the embodiment of Wall Street corruption in themid-1980s.   ``A very big piece of his contribution which could not berevealed now has been revealed,'' said the attorney, who asked notto be named. ``That's the principal reason for the earlier delay.''   Boesky was eligible for parole March 21, two days before hisone-year anniversary inside the Lompoc, Calif., prison camp wherethe one-time stock speculator is working on a cleanup crew.   In a plea for leniency, Boesky's attorneys in April 1988 filed arequest for U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker to reduce thesentence on grounds that information Boesky gave prosecutorsunearthed other fraud cases, including the charges against Milkenand charges that led to a separate $650 million criminal plea dealwith Drexel.   ``As these pending investigations mature into criminal and civilcharges, the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky'scooperation will become even more evident than it was atsentencing,'' the attorneys wrote at the time.   They asked Lasker to wait until last October to hear the motion,then requested another delay.   ``It's likely that will be reactivated soon,'' the attorneysaid, but did not specify when the request would be made.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the ManhattanU.S. attorney's office securities fraud division, declined tocomment on Boesky.   Boesky, 52, paid $100 million in December 1986 to settle chargesby the Securities and Exchange Commission that he illegally usedinside information to profit from securities deals.   He then cooperated in the government's wide-ranging probe ofwhite-collar Wall Street crime, supplying information used towardcivil or criminal charges in more than a dozen case in the UnitedStates and Britain.   In exchange, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count ofconspiracy to lie to the SEC. Lasker in December 1987 sentenced himto three years in jail. His earliest possible non-parole releasedate based on good behavior is April 4, 1990.   The next parole hearing at the 689-inmate Lompoc facility _known as ``Club Fed'' because of recreational facilities includingtennis and boccie ball courts _ is set for May, prison spokesmanGavin O'Connor said. Boesky's lawyers have not asked for his caseto be placed on the docket.   Even if he remains a prisoner, Boesky still could be summoned totestify as the main witness against Milken if that case goes totrial. Milken has denied any wrongdoing and said he would fight thecharges against him.   Many of the charges against Milken, who was placed on leave ashead of Drexel's high-yield bond division after the indictment,center on deals allegedly made with Boesky involving takeovers,stock manipulation and ``parking'' schemes to conceal securitiesownership.   As part of his plea deal, Boesky agreed to cooperate with thegovernment. Sources said the government has not contacted hisattorneys yet about testifying at a Milken trial.</TEXT></DOC>
