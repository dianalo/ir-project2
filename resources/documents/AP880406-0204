(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan informed CongressWednesday that he has stripped Japan of certain fishing rightsbecause of that country's alleged violation of an internationalwhale conservation program.   Reagan said the Commerce Department had certified the violationsbased on permits Japan has issued for the killing of SouthernHemisphere minke whales for research purposes.   ``The sanctions are the strongest possible'' under legislationauthorizing presidential action, Reagan said in a letter to HouseSpeaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.   The administration maintains that Japan has run afoul of anInternational Whaling Commission whale conservation program byissuing permits for research that has never been approved by theIWC.   The issuance of the permits by Japan to its citizens camedespite a 1987 whaling commission resolution recommending that nosuch licenses be granted until questions about the research programwere resolved, Reagan's letter said.   It noted that shortly after the certification of the violationsby Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, the whaling commissionadopted a second resolution recommending that Japan not go aheadwith its research program.   ``Japan has continued its whaling activities notwithstandingthis second resolution,'' the letter said.   Under provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation andManagement Act and the Fishermen's Protective Act, Reagan directedthe State Department to withhold 100 percent of the fishingprivileges ``that would otherwise be available to Japan'' in watersunder U.S. authority.   The current Japanese fishing quota in the 200-mile offshore U.S.economic zone is zero.   Reagan said he was denying Japan's request to fish for 3,000metric tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting.   ``In addition, Japan will be barred from any future allocationsof fishing privileges for any other species, including Pacific cod,until the secretary of commerce determines that the situation hasbeen corrected,'' he said.   Ken Cook, spokesman for the U.S. affiliate of the World WildlifeFund, said the announced fishing sanctions ``would hurt some,'' butcame too late to save any of the 300 minke whales Japan plans totake in this year's research program.   Reagan's letter to Wright said that ``the immediate andprospective effects of a 100 percent reduction of fishingallocations, coupled with presidential review in the near future,is the most effective means of encouraging Japan to embrace the IWCconservation program.''   ``Therefore, I will not impose at this time'' any sanctionsagainst Japanese fish products imported into the United States, itsaid.   Reagan ordered Verity and Secretary of State George Shultz toreport by Dec. 1 on Japan's willingness to comply with the whalingconservation program.   He also said he was directing Verity and Shultz to continuetalks with whaling commission member countries ``to ensure that webring to a halt all whaling that diminishes the effectiveness ofthe IWC's conservation program.''   ``Our actions taken today and in the future should encourage allnations to adhere to the conservation programs of the IWC,'' thepresident's letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
