But the Democratic policy house looks more like acharnel house these days.   The session that concluded yesterday was a meeting of theDemocratic Leadership Council, the party's self-proclaimedmoderates. In Des Moines, Iowa, last weekend, a rival factionof liberals tried to stir its own forces. The resultingtugging and hauling has made it clear that the party remainsdeeply divided over whether to proceed on its liberal road oradopt a more &quot;mainstream&quot; -- the DLC buzzword of choice --path.</LP><TEXT>   The divisions are everywhere. Many DLC mainstays sidedwith President Bush on the Persian Gulf war, and inresolutions here they trumpeted such un-Democratic-soundingproposals as limiting the growth of government spending and-- in opposition to the party's traditional labor allies --promoting free trade.   &quot;A stubborn defense of old programs will please existingconstituencies, but it will not help us build new ones,&quot; saysSen. Charles Robb of Virginia. The DLC delegates alsoadvocated parental choice in public schools and opposed&quot;backdoor quotas on business&quot; -- political initiatives onwhich the Republicans now have first claim.   All of this maneuvering and intraparty bickering takesplace with President Bush still commanding overwhelmingsupport among American voters, including many of those towhom these centrist Democrats are trying to appeal.   &quot;We've got some good ideas, but we don't have anybody with80% popularity,&quot; says Rep. Mike Espy of Mississippi, aninfluential DLC member. &quot;The problem is we're not perceivedas being able to produce a commander-in-chief.&quot;   Nine months before the first 1992 political tests in Iowaand New Hampshire, only one Democrat, former Sen. PaulTsongas of Massachusetts, has formally announced hiscandidacy for president. Other potential contenders, though,worked the crowd of activists here, and one of them, Sen. JayRockefeller of West Virginia, said he has changed his mindabout not running in 1992. &quot;The door's open, and I'mlooking,&quot; says Mr. Rockefeller, whose special concern ishealth care.   &quot;Bush may be unbeatable in 1991,&quot; says Sen. John Breaux ofLouisiana, &quot;but 1992 may be completely different.&quot;   Kevin Phillips, a maverick Republican theoretician, saysthe moderate Democrats are in a quandary. &quot;The problem isthat the Democrats aren't going to get anywhere unless theyhave a cutting edge, and you don't get a cutting edge bybecoming a `me-too' party,&quot; he says. &quot;The DLC's problem isthat they're supported by lobbyists and businessmen, andthat's not where the cutting edge is going to come from.&quot;While these party rebels say they oppose &quot;the organizedinterests,&quot; the hosts for their convention here includedPhilip Morris Cos., RJR Nabisco Inc., Atlantic Richfield Co.,American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and TRW Inc.   Some Democratic leaders, meanwhile, worry that the DLC isseeking to take over the party itself. &quot;When they set upchapters to compete with state party organizations, that'sdisturbing,&quot; says former Democratic National Chairman PaulKirk. &quot;You can't have two Democratic parties.&quot;   The DLC was organized six years ago, chiefly bySoutherners, to push the party back to the political centerafter former Vice President Walter Mondale, thepersonification of the old Democratic Party, lost 49 statesin the 1984 presidential election. The DLC and the nationalparty have coexisted uneasily since then. Party ChairmanRonald Brown made his first speech to the DLC and went out ofhis way to endorse its notion of a national-service program.But below the surface, the two groups still spar, and therelationship has deteriorated recently.   The moderates say their goal is to dispose now of thepolicy problems that customarily divide Democrats, before theselection of the candidate actually begins. &quot;We have a chanceto put the policy debates out in front of the candidate,&quot;says Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, one of the founders of theDLC. &quot;It's better to begin with the policy debate.&quot;   Some Democrats, such as Mr. Nunn, say the national partyshouldn't even be involved in the policy debate. And thoughMr. Brown felt the need to remind Democrats that they shouldnot &quot;forget that our real differences are with George Bushand his Republican philosophy,&quot; some of the policy ideasfloated here are jarring to liberal Democrats.   On foreign policy, for example, these Democrats &quot;reaffirmour support for a robust program of research into newmilitary technologies, conventional and strategic.&quot; They evensalute President Bush and his team for &quot;the well-conceivedand superbly executed strategy&quot; in the war with Iraq.   As the delegates moved through their agenda, members ofthe United Auto Workers milled around outside with signsproclaiming: &quot;One Republican Party is enough.&quot; Mr. Tsongasalso warned of moving too far in the Republican direction.&quot;If we turn our back on . . . core Democratic traditions, welose our mission,&quot; he said. &quot;Tread lightly here. . . . Theseare our family jewels.&quot;   Nothing symbolized Democratic divisions more than the roleof the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who pointedly wasn't invited todeliver a major speech here but still found an opportunity ata local high school to disparage the DLC as a &quot;privatizedpolitical movement&quot; representing &quot;a kind of suburbanization&quot;of the party.   Alvin From, the DLC's executive director, says Mr. Jacksonwasn't asked for a major speech because the Clevelandconvention was designed to &quot;promote a new agenda and a newpolitics, and we want to hear from people who are the newpolitics.&quot; Mr. Jackson says the Democrats should strengthenthe party by building a new foundation with minorities andthe poor and by espousing its traditional policies of socialwelfare and reform.   &quot;I don't understand denying Jesse Jackson an opportunityto speak,&quot; says Democratic consultant John Sasso, a keyfigure in Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign. &quot;Ifyou take him on, there are plenty of substantive grounds todo so. But why do it on procedural grounds?&quot;   The DLC chose instead to spotlight Gov. Douglas Wilder ofVirginia, the first black governor. Mr. Wilder, who isinching toward a presidential campaign himself, speaks of&quot;fiscal realism&quot; and a &quot;new mainstream.&quot; He told delegateshere that the biggest threat to the U.S. is &quot;those Washingtoninsiders who have mismanaged the American people's taxdollars for far too many years.&quot;   He is urging Democrats to take the lead in cutting aminimum of $25 billion a year in &quot;wasteful and unnecessaryspending&quot; in the next two years, adding that in 1992 &quot;weDemocrats must offer the American people a candidate who canrestore fiscal discipline and common sense to this nation.&quot;   Delegates to the conference here knew that Mr. Wilder'stargets weren't only in the Bush administration. ButDemocrats also know that they must repair some of thesedivisions before next year and that the party must regain thetrust of middle-class voters. &quot;We've got to turn theseperceptions around,&quot; says Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas,chairman of the DLC, &quot;or we can't continue as a nationalparty.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
