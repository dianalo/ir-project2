The controversy surrounds the documentary's claim that oneof the Canadian patients featured on the program, AlbertMueller, was still waiting for coronary artery bypass surgeryfive months after his angiogram in February 1990. Accordingto Ms. Cohen, &quot;Mr. Mueller was offered immediate surgerywithin a week of his diagnosis.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   After learning about the so-called misrepresentation, Ispoke with Mr. Mueller, who emphatically denied telling Dr.Rachlis that he was offered surgery within a week of theangiogram performed by his cardiologist, Dr. Victor Huckell.   Dr. Rachlis insists Mr. Mueller's reluctance to undergosurgery was the sole reason for the delay. It is just asplausible that the delays contributed to Mr. Mueller'sambivalence about surgery and prompted him to seekalternative treatments, including chelation therapy. Dr.Rachlis also says half of all non-emergency bypass surgerywas being performed at Vancouver General Hospital within oneweek of its being booked. Such misleading data conceal thefact that patients frequently wait months, sometimes morethan a year, on their surgeon's waiting list before they canbe booked for surgery.   Mr. Mueller's case was not an isolated incident. In fact,the patient whose case was contrasted with Mr. Mueller's in&quot;Borderline Medicine&quot; was a patient from Windsor, Ontario,who waited five months for an angiogram in Canada and came toDetroit in order to avoid further delays. During ourinvestigation, we spoke with dozens of Canadian patients whorecounted their experiences of waiting excessive periods,often more than a year, for bypass surgery. At the time ofour report, the backlog of patients waiting for open-heartsurgery in Vancouver was so severe that the provincialgovernment was negotiating with hospitals in Seattle tooperate on Canadian patients. Since our report, about 200patients from Vancouver have traveled to Seattle for theirsurgery, and an additional open-heart surgery unit has beenopened in Vancouver to reduce the delays.   Ms. Cohen suggests in her article that &quot;BorderlineMedicine&quot; reflects &quot;the way the press blindly accepts andrepeats tales of diminished care that would come withuniversal, uniform health insurance in America.&quot; Ironically,Ms. Cohen's article manages to prove her assertion that thepress &quot;blindly accepts and repeats tales.&quot;   Roger Weisberg   Producer   Thirteen-WNET   New York   ---   Ms. Cohen's article was provocative. However, I challengethe accuracy of &quot;the $12 billion lost in fraudulent workmen's{sic} compensation claims.&quot; Incurred medical in 1991 wasabout $26 billion (40% of the total $65 billion for workers'compensation coverage, which includes medical benefits,indemnity benefits and administrative expense). Paid medicalwas lower. To suggest 46% of the medical benefits renderedare associated with fraudulent claims is inaccurate and aninsult to the thousands of adjusters whose responsibility itis to work with payer, provider and patient in establishingthe causal relationship and compensability.   Stryker Warren Jr.   Chief Executive Officer   Focus Healthcare Management Inc.   Brentwood, Tenn.   ---   Ms. Cohen has faithfully reported on what both Dr.Huckell, a Vancouver cardiologist, and his patient Mr.Mueller told me in April and May of 1991 and what I reportedto the House Government Operations Committee in June. Dr.Huckell told me several times that Mr. Mueller could have hadhis surgery within one or two weeks except for his refusal tohave the procedure. He told me Mr. Mueller had seen a surgeonwithin one or two weeks of his diagnosis and had declined theprocedure.   In the hospital's reconstruction of the written record ofevents for Mr. Mueller's case, it was found that Mr. Muellerdid not in fact see a surgeon until August 1990, six monthsafter the initial angiogram. However, the records indicateMr. Mueller was extremely reluctant to have surgery and hisconsultation was delayed solely for this reason. In fact, therecord indicated that when Mr. Mueller first allowed Dr.Huckell to refer him to Dr. Fradet (the surgeon) on May 18,1990, he was offered surgery twice within the next month. Mr.Mueller refused surgery on both of these occasions.   Data on the waiting periods for surgery at the VancouverGeneral Hospital show that emergency surgery was being donewithin hours or days and that nearly half of non-emergencysurgery was done within one week of its being booked.   Patients, like Mr. Mueller, with left main coronary arteryobstruction make up less than 15% of bypass-surgery patientsand are at considerable risk if the procedure is delayed.This risk is well-recognized and these patients typicallywould wait very little time for their surgery in either theU.S. or Canada.   Indeed, on April 17, 1991, Dr. Huckell agreed with me thatMr. Mueller was high risk and was at pains to explain that hehad done his best to get him to surgery quickly but had beenthwarted by the patient's reluctance. Dr. Huckell agreed withme that the program misinterpreted Mr. Mueller's case.   I believe Roger Weisberg's otherwise excellent documentaryhas inadvertently misled Americans about the true state ofcare for heart patients in Canada. Most Canadian heartpatients do not wait unduly for surgery, and patients withhigh-risk conditions are usually given priority.Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the data on waitingperiods, a small number of surgeons are very popular and theymay develop lengthy waiting lists for elective procedures.   In Canada's system, clinical decisions have beenhistorically left to physicians. At least some surgeons withlong lists are reluctant to share their work with colleaguesin the same institution. This may lead to some patientswaiting inordinate periods of time. However, this problem hasnothing to do with Canada's public-health-insurance system ora lack of resources for heart surgery.
