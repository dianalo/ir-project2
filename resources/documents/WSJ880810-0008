The comptroller also cleared Chase's hedging of interest-rate exposure with stock-indexed futures, the bank-holding company said.    A mutual-fund-industry group has been seeking to ban Chase's Market Index Investment accounts. A federal court hearing the case had asked the comptroller for a ruling on the case, as had Chase. The bank-holding company said the ruling will figure in a hearing today in federal court in Washington on the group's lawsuit.    The group, the Investment Company Institute, contends in a suit filed last year that Chase's accounts violate the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates the banking and securities industries. The amount of interest paid on the Chase accounts is linked to moves in the Standard andamp; Poor's index of 500 stocks.    In Washington, Matthew Fink, senior vice president and general counsel of the institute, said the group wasn't surprised by the comptroller's ruling and hasn't decided whether to appeal it. He said the institute, in any case, will continue to press its court case. &quot;We think the comptroller has blessed an illegal activity,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
