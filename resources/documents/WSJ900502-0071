The $1 million bounty will be used to supplement the StateDepartment's offer of as much as $2 million for suchinformation in cases of airline terrorism overseas. Unlikethe State Department's program, the ATA's offer will apply toinformation related to domestic cases as well.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It was the unanimous judgment that the combined reward of$3 million . . . is a meaningful amount in terms of providinga deterrent, a disincentive or an encouragement to someone tocome forward with the information,&quot; said Robert Aaronson,ATA's president. Twenty-three airlines will contribute moneyto the reward pool.   William Baker, assistant director of thecriminal-investigation division of the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, said nearly 800 people have been murdered byterrorist bombs on airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
