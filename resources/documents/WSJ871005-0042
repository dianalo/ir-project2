Eventually, though, the dollar must fall further, they say.    At the recently concluded annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker suggested that the Group of Seven major industrial nations use a basket of commodities, including gold, as a tool in economic policy planning. The Group of Seven comprises the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Also in Washington, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson advocated formalizing the process of setting and defending currency ranges that the Group of Seven has practiced since February. Mr. Lawson also suggested tying exchange rates to growth in the industrial world and inflation, with a special role for commodity prices.    Unless there is more to both officials' comments than they revealed, economists weren't overly impressed. Almost all governments, they note, already use commodity prices as inflation guides.    &quot;So as a formal indicator, it doesn't make a significant difference,&quot; says David A. Osman, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    In addition, commodity prices are just one indicator of inflation, noted Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. Other indicators include changes in the price of services and wages.    Meanwhile, &quot;Lawson essentially confirmed what most people in the market had assumed: That they were working with a managed float based on target ranges for major currencies,&quot; said Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    &quot;This kind of thing can work; it has worked in Europe for several years and has worked in terms of the dollar this last year,&quot; says Ms. Mills, referring to the European Monetary System's eight-currency joint-float and the efforts to stabilize the dollar's trading range against the Japanese and West German currencies.    &quot;The trouble is it doesn't work on exhortation but on intervention and changes in domestic policy,&quot; she says.    &quot;We've gotten exchange rate stability,&quot; Ms. Mills says, &quot;but the cost has been a substantial rise in U.S. interest rates and a somewhat lower level of interest rates in Germany and Japan than they probably would like to see -- certainly more money growth.&quot;    For instance, when Germany intervenes to support the U.S. currency by selling marks and buying dollars, it may boost the German money supply, putting downward pressure on German interest rates and leading to a rise in inflationary pressures.    A problem with joint currency agreements is that countries with low inflation import inflation from nations with higher costs of living.    &quot;There is no way of anchoring a system,&quot; says Tim O'Dell, a London-based economist at Phillips andamp; Drew, a unit of Union Bank of Switzerland. &quot;While you may have stability of exchange rates and a convergence of policy, it may be at too high an inflation rate.&quot;    Many economsts note German and Japanese reluctance to embrace wholeheartedly a program to coordinate economic policies or stabilize exchange rates.    Mr. Osman of James Capel points to &quot;the German intransigence to adopt a more reflationary or expansive fiscal policy,&quot; despite West Germany's very weak economic growth -- at a projected annual rate of 1.6% -- high unemloyment and 0.6% rate of inflation.    Mr. Kaufman of Salomon Brothers also thinks the dollar will come down further, although &quot;it will take a little time for the currency alignment to change significantly.&quot;    For the dollar to fall further, he says, the market will have to believe the U.S. economy is &quot;weaker than it is,&quot; that &quot;German and Japanese inflation will stay quite low&quot; while the U.S. rate increases and that the U.S. trade deficit &quot;isn't going away.&quot;    The key, analysts say, isn't so much whether the dollar falls but how far and how fast.    A senior international monetary official puts the Group of Seven's chances of success at stabilizing currencies at two-to-one.    &quot;The G-7 put up a good front and reaffirmed the Louvre accords,&quot; he says. &quot;But if the market moves against them, they haven't got a chance.&quot;    The biggest threat to the dollar's stability, he says, would occur if Japanese financial institutions have to liquidate their foreign -- mostly dollar-denominated -- investments to rescue one of their own from failing.    &quot;The only loose cannon on the deck of world currency markets is Japanese financial markets,&quot; he says.    Gold was quoted at $456 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar edged up Friday in very quiet trading, which was attributed in part to the celebration of the Yom Kippur Jewish holy day.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 146.85 yen and 1.8450 West German marks, compared with 146.45 yen and 1.8405 marks late Thursday. The British pound receded to $1.6190 from $1.6225.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $454.50 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated volume was moderate at three million ounces.    ---                Late New York Trading                 Friday, Oct. 2, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
