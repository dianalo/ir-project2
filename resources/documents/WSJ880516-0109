Perry and Joe Davidson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> DALY CITY, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Michael Dukakis is trying hard to break free as the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson won't let him. Not yet.    &quot;Governor,&quot; a reporter cries out at an abbreviated news conference, &quot;Jesse Jackson says you're just like George Bush. You have no concrete plans about anything.&quot;    A student here at Jefferson High School asks, &quot;Are you going to choose Jesse Jackson as your running mate?&quot;    Everywhere Mr. Dukakis goes, Mr. Jackson, in person or in spirit, is never far away. They rarely meet, but they are boxing in the dark all the time.    Mr. Jackson no longer carries a big punch, but he can still hurt. Tomorrow, in the Oregon primary, he may stage a small demonstration, just as a reminder. &quot;Oregon,&quot; says a key Dukakis staff member, &quot;is Vermont west.&quot; Mr. Jackson appears to be running very well with white voters in Oregon, just as he did earlier in Vermont, and the Dukakis people are worried about it.    They don't worry that Mr. Jackson is a threat to the nomination -- Mr. Dukakis has 1,600 delegates now and expects to wrap things up in the California primary June 7. But they do worry that Mr. Jackson continues to be something of an embarrassment to their candidate, drawing bigger crowds, and hammering away at Mr. Dukakis's cautious nature and his sometimes poorly defined positions on major issues. They worry, more importantly, that Mr. Jackson could be a threat to party unity and ultimately to the ticket's chances in the fall.    And so they are saying nothing unkind about their final rival, while putting off the day of reckoning when they will be forced to deal with the proud, strong-willed Mr. Jackson. Both sides insist no serious talks have been held, and none are scheduled.    &quot;Down the road,&quot; says Paul Brountas, the campaign chairman, &quot;we will begin thinking about Jesse Jackson and all these other things. But, for the next three weeks, we aren't going to think about anything but winning the nomination.&quot;    Mr. Jackson, for his part, hits Mr. Dukakis hard one day, and then seems to back away the next. &quot;The challenges (to Mr. Dukakis) have not been personal attacks,&quot; Mr. Jackson says. &quot;Just distinctions based on commitment and priorities. That's fair game.&quot;    In Oregon, the Jackson campaign is distributing a leaflet that draws distinctions between the two men on almost all the issues. On corporate America and labor, for example, it says that Mr. Dukakis &quot;wants to bring small fish and barracudas together in the same pool,&quot; while Mr. Jackson &quot;stands with the small fish.&quot; And on civil rights, it says that Mr. Dukakis &quot;affirms them&quot; while Mr. Jackson &quot;helped create them.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis takes the high road. &quot;I think it is very important,&quot; he says, &quot;that we keep the campaign strong and positive. While Jesse Jackson and I occasionally have differences of opinion, we share lots of the same goals and values.&quot;    Mr. Brountas says he thinks whatever differences there are between the two candidates eventually will be worked out. &quot;Like the governor,&quot; he says, &quot;I am an optimist.&quot; The choice by Mr. Jackson of Washington lawyer Ronald Brown, former deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, as his convention chairman is widely seen as a signal Mr. Jackson wants to be cooperative.    But it remains unclear on what specific issues Mr. Jackson will take his stand. He may not be sure himself. For now, he is laying down his challenge on policies for dealing with southern Africa, drugs and the budget.    Calling Mr. Dukakis's South Africa positions &quot;incoherent&quot; and &quot;inconsistent,&quot; Mr. Jackson charges that the Massachusetts governor &quot;does not have a good plan to end apartheid.&quot; Jean Sindbad, one of Mr. Jackson's advisers, says her boss wants the platform to say that a Democratic secretary of state will declare South Africa a terrorist state. The Dukakis advisers say that is a largely meaningless gesture but that Mr. Dukakis does support legislation now before the House that could have the same effect.    According to the Dukakis staff, the only real difference the governor has with Mr. Jackson on policy in southern Africa is over giving military assistance to Mozambique to repel attacks by South Africa-backed rebels. Mr. Jackson is for it; Mr. Dukakis opposes it.    On drugs, Mr. Dukakis won't promise, as Mr. Jackson does, to spend billions of dollars more. But he's trying as best he can to dramatize the issue. Here at Jefferson High, he talked to students about drugs, but the response from those who showed up (160 out of a student population of 1,250) was modest. Mr. Jackson almost always draws standing-room-only crowds at high schools in events that are extraordinarily emotional.    While the two men have differences on the southern Africa and drug issues, Mr. Dukakis probably can make concessions, both substantive and symbolic, in the platform and the fall campaign. But the Jackson argument on the budget is broader. Mr. Dukakis may have a harder time satisfying his opponent on that issue.    Mr. Jackson calls on Mr. Dukakis to be more specific about his spending plans, arguing the governor &quot;is not vigorously challenging Reaganomics.&quot; Mr. Dukakis, a cautious man, is not going to be drawn into that trap. &quot;We won't promise billions for this and billions for that,&quot; says a Dukakis aide. &quot;It's not realistic when we're facing a $170 billion budget deficit.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis responds to Mr. Jackson in lots of ways, big and small. Sometimes now he even tries to talk like Mr. Jackson. &quot;Some people want Star Wars,&quot; he says. &quot;I want star schools.&quot;    More relaxed than he used to be as an also-ran, Mr. Dukakis occasionally floats a little joke over the crowds that turn out to see him. Playing off recent White House revelations, he says he's never really known the difference between a horoscope and a telescope. It's a start.    He makes the point, again and again, that he and Mr. Jackson both have made long journeys. &quot;Here I am,&quot; he says, in a phrase straight out of the Jackson speech book, a son of Greek immigrants seeking the highest office in the land. And isn't it &quot;terrific,&quot; he adds, that his sole remaining rival is &quot;a black man who grew up poor in South Carolina.&quot;    The contrast remains startling -- Mr. Jackson, a big, powerful man in high-style suits and polished boots; Mr. Dukakis, short and narrow-shouldered in bargain-basement suits and black wing-tipped shoes that curl up at the toes.    But appearances can be deceiving. Mr. Dukakis is stubborn, and there is no sign he is prepared to cave in to Mr. Jackson. His appearance with gay and lesbian leaders in Los Angeles last week was instructive. He gave no ground as he defended Massachusetts policy on foster children, which gives preference to placing children in households with heterosexual parents. Some of the gay and lesbian leaders hissed.    &quot;You're anti-gay,&quot; one of them shouted. &quot;Why don't you say it?&quot;    Sometimes, Mr. Dukakis said, &quot;we are going to disagree.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
