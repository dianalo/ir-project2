Stoddard, executive director of the gay-rights Lambda Legal Defenseand Education Fund in New York City, said Tuesday. &quot;A self-insured employercould decide leukemia is too expensive, or for that matter any type of canceror any other illness.&quot;;   Stoddard represented John McGann in the lawsuitagainst the Houston music store that employed him when he was diagnosed withAIDS in 1987. McGann died in June.;   In 1987, Handamp;H Music Co. had an outsidegroup insurance policy providing for $1 million in medical benefits for eachof its several hundred employees.;   Months after McGann began filingAIDS-related claims, Handamp;H switched to a self-insured plan. The plan eliminatedcoverage for drug and alcohol abuse and put a $5,000 cap on AIDS-relatedclaims but kept the $1 million limit for other diseases.;   Accused ofdiscrimination;   Handamp;H said it cut costly AIDS benefits so it could affordother coverage for the rest of its workers.;   But McGann argued that thechange amounted to discrimination and retaliation against him because he wasthe only employee with AIDS. He sued under the 1974 federal EmploymentRetirement Income Security Act, which governs self-insurance plans.;   Theappeals court ruled that while discrimination is illegal under the 1974 lawonly if it is &quot;motivated by desire to retaliate against or to deprive employeeof an existing right,&quot; the music's store motive &quot;was to ensure the futureexistence of the plan and not specifically to retaliate against McGann.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New Orleans  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  373  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 27, 199100332015,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
