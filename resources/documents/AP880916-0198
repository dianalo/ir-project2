Gorbachev said Friday that Sovietforces will abandon a strategic naval base in Vietnam if the UnitedStates pulls its armed forces from bases in the Philippines.   In a key foreign policy speech, the Soviet leader announced thatthe Kremlin has frozen its nuclear weapon stocks in Soviet Asia. Healso responded to U.S. allegations that a Siberian radar violates asuperpower arms treaty by suggesting the station be used to studyspace.   Gorbachev made the 1{-hour speech during a meeting withCommunist Party and local government workers in the city ofKrasnoyarsk, 2,000 miles east of Moscow and the site of thecontroversial radar. The official Tass news agency carried asummary.   A seven-point plan ``aimed at strengthening security in theAsia-Pacific region,'' highlighted the speech, the first majoraddress by Gorbachev since he returned Monday from a six-weekvacation.   It was the first time Gorbachev focused on relations with Asiasince a July 28, 1986 speech at the Pacific port of Vladivostok.   In that speech, Gorbachev called for a summit with China andpeace in the region. Friday's speech reiterated the call for asummit with Beijing and urged Japan not to increase its militarystrength.   ``Aware of the Asian and Pacific countries' concern, the SovietUnion will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in theregion _ it has already been practicing this for some time _ and iscalling on the United States and other nuclear powers not to deploythem additionally in the region,'' Gorbachev said, according to theTass summary.   ``If the United States agrees to the elimination of militarybases in the Philippines, the Soviet Union will be ready ... togive up the fleet's material and technical supply station in CamRanh Bay.''   The Pentagon describes Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam as the Soviets'largest naval deployment base abroad, threatening U.S. militarypresence in the Philippines. U.S. officials in Bangkok said about7,000 Soviet personnel are stationed there.   The United States maintains six bases in the Philippines. Thetwo major bases _ Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base _ are thelargest U.S. military installations outside the United States, butAmerican-Filipino talks on an agreement to review the final twoyears of the leases, which expire in 1991, have stalled.   In Washington, President Reagan commented on Gorbachev'sproposal regarding the bases.   ``I haven't had an opportunity to go into it in detail in whatit is he's proposing, but I look forward to doing that becausecertainly we want to do anything we can to help bring about abetter relationship between our two countries,'' Reagan toldreporters.   On Thursday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said talks inManila on compensation for the bases and other issues ``basicallyaren't going well.''   Gorbachev proposed ``that a center for international cooperationin the utilization of space for peaceful purposes be set up on thebasis of the Krasnoyarsk radar station,'' Tass said.   Although his wording was vague, Gorbachev appeared to beoffering to dismantle or convert the 30-story radar. The U.S.government says the installation violates the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty and is a major obstacle to talks in Geneva towardhalving long-range missile arsenals.   ``Speculation about the Krasnoyarsk radar station continues,''the Soviet leader said in remarks carried by Soviet television.``It's turning out to have a slowing effect on the Genevanegotiations.''   The move would also put more pressure on the Reaganadministration to act on Soviet complaints the United States isviolating the ABM treaty, particularly by its Star Wars program fora space-based missile defense.   ``Our concern over the construction of the U.S. radar stationsin Greenland and Britain remains. Experts say that they are adownright violation of the ABM treaty. We expect that Washingtonwill take appropriate measures in response to our initiative,'' hesaid.   The Soviet Union offered last month to dismantle the radarequipment if the United States agreed to commit itself to the ABMtreaty for nine or 10 years.   Asked about Gorbachev's proposal on the Krasnoyarsk radar, WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the U.S. position thatthe facility must be dismantled because it violates ABM treaty.   The United States has maintained the radar violates the treatybecause it is not at the edge of the country, pointed outward, asthe pact stipulates such a radar must be.   The Soviets maintain the radar is designed for the tracking ofsatellites and spacecraft and not for the detection of any incomingmissiles.   Tass implied that Gorbachev agreed to U.S. demands that theKrasnoyarsk base be scrapped.   ``This is our reply to the West's concerns over the Krasnoyarskstation,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.   On China, Gorbachev said Soviets ``stand for the fullnormalization of relations'' and noted ``goodwill and trust'' havebeen increasing with the Chinese.   The Kremlin's ties with Beijing have been strained since the twoCommunist giants split over ideological and strategic differencesin the early 1960s.   Friday's speech came at the end of a five-day visit to theKrasnoyarsk region during which Gorbachev heard numerous complaintsfrom residents about poor living conditions.   The 57-year-old Communist Party chief referred to thosecomplaints in Friday's address and said social problems are apriority, especially food shortages.</TEXT></DOC>
