Fox Reviews Press' Treatment of his Wedding</HEAD><DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Michael J. Fox has taken his revengeon the tabloid SWAT team that descended on his July 16, 1988,wedding at an inn here.   ``Michael J. Fox's Nuptials in Hell,'' in the June issue ofEsquire magazine, is Fox's first-person, tongue-in-cheek version ofhow he and his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, kept at bay helicopters,zoom lenses and an army of 40 reporters from The National Enquirer,Star, Globe, People magazine and other publications.   ``Even I, who have called a fishbowl home for most of the lastsix years, was astounded by the lengths to which the tabloids wouldgo in order to satisfy inquiring minds,'' wrote Fox, star of thefilm ``Back to the Future'' and the television show ``Family Ties.''   The magazine story, due out next week, details the apparentdesperation of tabloid journalists, who according to Fox resortedto bribery, lies and more in an unsuccessful effort to get a photoof the wedding couple in full regalia at the West Mountain Inn.   Fox's publicist, Nanci Ryder, went undercover as a temporaryoffice worker at the National Enquirer's headquarters in aManchester luxury hotel, the article said. She reported thetabloid's strategy to Fox and to a Los Angeles security experthired to keep the wedding private.   After the wedding party succeeded in avoiding photographers, Foxcharged, sore losers among the press took out their frustration byportraying the couple as paranoid, and their wedding as a securitycircus.   ``The reporters couldn't very well write about their colossalwaste of money and effort, so they projected their own fiasco ontothe wedding,'' wrote Fox, who shared a byline for the story withbrother-in-law Michael Pollan, executive editor of Harper'smagazine.</TEXT></DOC>
