<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-1060 </DOCNO><TEXT>Magnetic Resonance (MR) is a completely noninvasive modality, which employshigh-strength static magnetic fields, low-strength changing magneticfields, and radio-frequency (RF) pulses to generate tomographic imageswith high soft-tissue contrast. Because of the abundance of hydrogenin biologic tissues and its efficiency (maximum number of nuclei peratom number) for MR, hydrogen (proton) resonance has, in general beenused for imaging various regions of the body, including the cardiovascularsystem. This paper discusses the use of magnetic resonance imaging fordiagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction.</TEXT></DOC>
