Speakers on the House floor for their part denounced themajority for adding to the cost of the bailout, arguing thatthe RTC needed the money to close down some more insolventSandamp;Ls. They said that every day's delay in closing downinsolvent thrifts adds another $8 million to the governmentlosses.</LP><TEXT>   Both of these statements are all but universally accepted,and neither is true. The House was more than a littleconfused in dealing with the issue, but its actions were nomore irresponsible than those of a Treasury Departmentdemanding unlimited borrowing power to build what may becomethe most ineffective and most political bureaucracyWashington has ever seen. Anthony Downs of the BrookingsInstitution asked a conference in Washington a couple ofweeks ago, &quot;How many RTC bureaucrats does it take to put in alight bulb?&quot; The answer: &quot;Two. One to say that everything isgoing well, and a second to screw it in the faucet.&quot;   No insured deposit in a thrift or bank is affected in theslightest by congressional failure to fund the RTC. If youwant your money out, you can get your money out at any time,and if an Sandamp;L needs replacement funds it can go to WallStreet and pay a commission. The RTC as conservator ofinsolvent Sandamp;Ls is already by far the biggest customer and thebiggest source of commissions the Wall Street houses have.   The RTC does not use the money Congress gives it to payback depositors. It uses the money to purchase the bad assetsof busted Sandamp;Ls. Acquirers of these institutions are willingto assume their deposit liabilities only if they are paidcash for the junk in the portfolio. If the RTC does not havethe cash for that purpose, it keeps the Sandamp;Ls inconservatorship -- which means the RTC appoints the officersof the Sandamp;Ls and calls the tunes.   The argument that delay means prohibitive cost to thetaxpayer is also fallacious. Its defenders point to thedifference between what the Treasury pays in interest onTreasury bills and what an Sandamp;L in conservatorship has to payin interest to hold consumer deposits. But that difference isprobably two or three percentage points. Apply thatpercentage to the $78 billion that would have flowed into theRTC's pockets if the House had gone along with the Senate,and you get, roughly, the advertised $8 million per workingday.   The number involves a wrong assumption. It assumes the RTCwill be intelligent in managing and selling the assets of thefailed thrifts. This is a leap of faith. Wearing the hat ofthe chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., L.William Seidman says that an asset loses 20% of its value theminute the government takes possession of it. That issupposed to be the reason the FDIC subsidizes the acquirer ofa failed bank that maintains bad assets, rather than turningthem over to the government.   When he puts on the hat of the chairman of the RTC,though, Mr. Seidman makes a U-turn and insists that thegovernment will lose money unless it takes rapid possession.Suddenly the only thing to worry about is the cost of thefunds required to hold the asset. Nobody pays attention tothe question of whether this asset will deteriorate ingovernment hands.   Promoters of a tax credit bill to be introduced by Rep.Robert Matsui, (D., Calif.), estimate the RTC's holding costson property add up to as high as 3% of value every month, anumber that dwarfs the 2%-3% a year saved by changing thesource of funds. Experience at places like Sunbelt Savings inDallas argues that well-chosen Sandamp;L conservators can maintainproperty much better and much more cheaply than the agentsthe RTC hires.   It is by no means clear, indeed, that the government gainswhen an undercapitalized thrift is rushed intoconservatorship. The real reason Mr. Seidman wants to leavethe assets in the banks when the agency at hand is the FDICand buy them for the government when the agency is the RTC isthat he doesn't want to ask Congress for money for the FDIC,and he's sure he can force Congress to pony up when it's theRTC.   The problem here is not the $30 billion of appropriationto cover losses, which is needed, but the abuse of a draftingerror in the original legislation for the bailout, whichpermits the RTC to borrow &quot;working capital&quot; totaling morethan one-and-a-half times its appropriations. Thanks in partto that error, the original $50 billion appropriation in thesummer of 1989 has produced holdings in the RTC receivershipstotaling about $62 billion, with another $80 billion-plus inthe conservatorships.   The more assets the RTC has under management, the morefees the bureaucracy gets to allocate. And this perverseincentive to hold rather than sell is multiplied in theborrowing arrangements, because every time the RTC sellssomething the sale reduces the amount of working capital theagency can borrow. Moreover, the fee arrangements RTC makeswith the contractors often block possible sales. Some of thebest evidence for the trouble is the fact that the RTC hassold only a minor fraction of its junk bonds.   What is the solution? Whatever new funding the RTC getsmust come with a cap on the total quantity of assets it canhave in receivership or conservatorship, and probably with acap on its total employment too. A basically sympatheticreport on the RTC by the General Accounting Office noted areluctance to let the private sector do its part -- &quot;amindset which essentially undervalues the significance ofcontracting.&quot;   The main point here, though, is this: Losses from givingthe RTC all the money it wants would be much greater thancosts resulting from a little delay.   ---   Mr. Mayer writes frequently on finance.</TEXT></DOC>
