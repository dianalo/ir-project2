(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This historic city has survived theravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all inHurricane Hugo.   The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into CharlestonThursday night.   ``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which fewpeople who have lived all their lives in Charleston haveexperienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.   Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston sinceHurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.   The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, bothnatural and man-made.   The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado torethrough the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causingan estimated $2 million in property damage.   Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures liningquaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.   The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and anynumber of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestoniansof refinement as ``September gales.''   But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on thehot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what somefolks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.   The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicagoand New York City.   Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, theearthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildingsand tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.   In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitorsannually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby finesand beaches.   Charleston has received international acclaim as home to SpoletoFestival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti. Organizerslike to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive artsfestival.</TEXT></DOC>
