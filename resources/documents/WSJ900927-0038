Some of Donald Trump's bankers, holding $245 million insenior Shuttle debt, suggested that Mr. Trump sell theairline rather than lose money operating it, according topeople who attended a meeting of Shuttle lenders yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   While the banks do not expect the Shuttle to sell foranything close to what Mr. Trump paid for it, some of them --including lead lender Citibank -- said in the meeting that itwould be better to cut the banks' losses and sell the airlineanyway.   Mr. Trump borrowed $380 million to pay for what was theEastern Shuttle last year. Under last month's $65 millionbank bailout, interest on $135 million of Mr. Trump's Shuttledebt was suspended. Last week, Mr. Trump told his bankersthat soaring fuel costs and a declining northeast economywould cause him to miss interest payments on the senior $245million loan, as well.</TEXT></DOC>
