 The lack of solid, easy, off-theshelf programs with natural language interfaces is a prime manifestation ofthe problem.andM;The ability to converse with a computer has been one of the most widelyaccepted goals within the collective unconscious of computer users andprogrammers.andP;  Science fiction for years has presumed this capability.andP;  Evennon-scienctific TV shows have presented unrealistic conversations betweencomputer screens and keyboard operators.andM;But only a few organizations really have the computers listening andanswering.andM;Voice recognition and synthesis are not the point, although these processeswill have some part in natural language interfaces and artificialintelligence.andP;  The ability of the computer to understand an idiomatic,human-language sentence, phrased by a non-expert, then return something nearthe desired response, is the elusive goal I'm talking about.andM;Some packages have tried to achieve some measure of this.andP;  Few have done iteven remotely satisfactorily.andM;With the level of sophistication of high-end microcomputers now, the naturallanguage and artificial intelligence situations on this level of computer arefailures of software, not hardware.andM;The best artificial intelligence work anywhere is on intelligence and defenseagency computers.andP;  The National Security Agency, for one, has to havehyperintelligent programs just to sift through all the information itscomputers absorb and then find something useful to do with the selected data.andM;Artificial intelligence systems that actually learn from experience andchange their operations based on what they've seen are some of the smartestprograms ever written.andP;  They're still too few and far between.andP;  Though someobservers regard rule-based expert systems that don't learn as not real AI,given what most computers do, I'd say they're AI in relative terms.andM;The FBI's Big Floyd system for ferreting out intricate criminal relationshipshas been one of the big expert-system success stories.andP;  The elaborate rulesystems some credit card companies use to decide whether a transaction getsapproved often have been heralded as great leaps forward.andM;Although such agencies as the Agriculture Department and the National ScienceFoundation have made big steps in natural language querying systems, theseare the exception.andM;The problem is I can't buy an inexpensive, sophisticated natural languagequerying system that doesn't need too much training.andM;The technology and know-how exist.andP;  If it were packaged right, the pent-updemand would swamp anyone selling a broadly flexible English-speaking dataextraction program.andM;So why aren't they on the shelves?andP;  Stagnation.andP;  Risk aversion.andP;  Lack ofimagination.andM;Users writing their own are blazing the trail through the Appalachians forsoftware companies.andP;  But the companies aren't following with their wagontrains in any big hurry.andM;A short while ago I wrote here about visual computing being The Big NewThing.andP;  Hypertext querying on the Macintosh is part of this.andP;  So are programsfor defense that render satellite photos in three dimensions or programs thatfind oil from heat photography.andM;But the ability to communicate with the computer almost completely in one'snative language will be a more influential plateau in the sale of computers.andM;The hardware companies have a lot to gain here.andP;  New computers and upgradeswill not seem so expensive if any worker, with little or no training orexperience, can get intricate reports or concise answers from the computer.andM;Current hardware should be able to do it, but current hardware is an elusiveterm.andP;  In the government and big business, most existing computers have16-bit Intel 286 chips.andP;  In smaller businesses and homes, the majorityprobably are 8088/8086 level.andP;  The 386 might be able to handle true naturallanguage work or expert systems that non-experts can run.andP;  The 486 is a morelikely candidate, and there aren't many of those in people's hands.andM;The idea that the first and second generations of spreadsheets sold a lot ofApple IIs and IBM PCs is not a myth.andP;  Software that speaks human, eventhrough the keyboard and screen, also will sell a lot of computers.andM;Rick Vizachero is GCN's assistant managing editor for technical coverage.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
