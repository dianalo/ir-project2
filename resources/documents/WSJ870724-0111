Under the agreement, Clini-Therm said it would drop its suit seeking to bar Victor A. Vaguine, its former chief scientist, from his position as BSD's president and chief executive officer. The accord prevents Dr. Vaguine from working on technical aspects of hyperthermia, the heat treatment of cancer, for one year beginning last March 16, when Dr. Vaguine resigned.    BSD, based in Salt Lake City, said it would drop its 1986 patent-infringement suit against Clini-Therm. BSD also agreed to grant Clini-Therm a license for its microwave interstitial patent, and Clini-Therm agreed to grant BSD a license for its fiber-optic thermometry technology. </TEXT></DOC>
