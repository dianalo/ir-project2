Special Agent Richard James Elroy said agents investigatingbribery can often prove that money has changed hands betweencontractors and tribal leaders, but are unable to demonstrate therewas the kind of quid pro quo agreement that a prosecutor can use toshow that money was in exchange for a favor.   He also said state officials would be treated differently thanIndian leaders are if corruption in their governments was suspected.``For some reason tribal governments are not included in the codefor treatment like state governments would be,'' he said.   Elroy acknowledged that the Bureau of Indian Affairs isresponsible for oversight in Indian reservation business. But hesaid tribal leaders have had local BIA directors removed bycomplaining to Washington.   Another FBI agent, Anthony Daniels, said there has beeninfiltration of legal Indian gambling operations by organized crime.   ``Most of the available examples of La Cosa Nostra influence inIndian bingo games have been isolated,'' Daniels said, and he doesnot view the problem as a substantial and consistent threat yet.   However, he said, ``any form of high-stakes gambling seems to bea magnet to the LCN. Whenever, or wherever, there are situationswhich generate large volumes of cash, the LCN will most assuredlyattempt an approach.''   He called for outside regulation of Indian gaming operations bythe federal government.   In Tuesday's hearing, secretly taped conversations were playedindicating the chairman of the Navajo nation devised a scheme tocover up thousands of dollars in kickbacks from the sale of a491,000-acre ranch to his tribe.   The voice of tribal chairman Peter MacDonald Sr. was heard in arecording made by real estate broker Byron T. ``Bud'' Brown incooperation with a special investigative unit of the Senate SelectCommittee on Indian Affairs.   Brown, who testified before the panel under a grant of immunity,said he paid MacDonald $25,000 to pay a bank loan and gave him$50,000 in cash and an expensively equipped BMW automobile as hisshare of profits from the sale of the 491,000-acre Big Boquillasranch in western Arizona.   In the tape recording of a conversation Nov. 22, 1988, MacDonaldtells Brown to say that the $25,000 and car were for his son, PeterMacDonald Jr.   They discuss point by point what Brown should tell investigators.   ``It's Rocky that asked you for this 25,000,'' the seniorMacDonald says in reference to his son, nicknamed Rocky. And later,the older MacDonald is heard saying that his son ``wanted the car,since he doesn't have a vehicle.''   The senior MacDonald wanted to cover up the payments after thelocal U.S. attorney began an investigation of the sale, Brown toldthe committee.   The sale raised questions because of a $7.2 million profit madeby the men who brokered it. Brown had arranged for businessman TomTracy to buy the ranch from Tenneco West Inc. for $26.2 million,then immediately sell it to the Navajos for $33 million. Under thedeal, Tracy and Brown shared the profit, with Brown then payingMacDonald.   ``I felt and still feel that the ranch, at $68 an acre is a goodvalue,'' Brown said, noting that the Navajos most recently have paid$100 or more per acre for property.   ``What bothers me is that what I did with Chairman MacDonald wasimproper,'' he said.   Besides giving MacDonald $25,000 and a car, Brown said he paidthe tribal chairman several $5,000 increments in $100 bills.   The payments were arranged by MacDonald's son, who called Brownwhen his father needed money and used the word ``golf balls'' as acode for money.   In another taped conversation played for the committee, Brown isheard talking to the junior MacDonald on Dec. 14, 1988.   ``We're all three of us Three Musketeers shoulder to shoulder,''MacDonald says in reference to Brown's question as to whether hewould stick by the story with his father and Brown.   On Monday, the junior MacDonald, who is an attorney, told thecommittee under immunity that he went along with the scheme,``because I love my father.''   Representatives of a Navajo task force appeared at the committeehearing and distributed a statement in which they demanded to beheard by the committee.   ``Various individuals have implicated and leveled charges againstthe Navajo Nation without substantiating their allegations withfacts,'' the group said.   ``Such malicious allegations are attempts to discredit theintegrity of the Navajo Nation, its people, government andsovereignty.''   ``While corruption may exist in any government or at any levelwithin the Navajo Nation, as it may in Washington D.C., thecommittee's nearly exclusive focus on selected abuses is creatingthe public impression that corruption at Navajo is universal,'' thestatement said.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the specialinvestigative unit, said arrangements to have members of the Navajotask force testify in the latter part of the month would be made.</TEXT></DOC>
