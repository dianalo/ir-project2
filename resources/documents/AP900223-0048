Cheers broke out Thursday when the 51-foot granite statue waslifted from its pedestal onto a truck and carted away. Some peopleapplauded its removal; some even kicked it.   ``The whole people wanted this,'' said Hortsbar, 36, anelectrician who passed the statue every day on his way to work.   It had stood in front of the national library in the city centersince 1951. Workers said they did not know where the statue wastaken or what would happen to it.   Last month, the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Partybowed to public pressure and removed a smaller statue of Stalinfrom in front of an army club.   It was one of its few concessions to a new, vocal oppositionmovement that has staged repeated rallies for democratic reform.The movement organized itself this week as the Mongolian DemocraticParty.   The larger statue's removal under cover of darkness may havebeen to avoid confrontations in this nation where officials saymore than 38,000 people were purged or killed during aStalin-inspired era of terror in the 1930s and 1940s.   At the Revolutionary Museum, just across the city's centralsquare from the library, the nation's first exhibit about that eraopened Wednesday. It was organized jointly by the museum and theMinistry of State Security.   Titled ``History Will Not Forget Them,'' the exhibit containspictures of purge victims and documents from the once-secretministry archives. Its aim is to ``tell the truth of history,''museum officials said Thursday.   Stalin came under criticism in the Soviet Union more than 30years ago, but until 1984 Mongolia remained in the grip of Stalinprotege Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who now lives in Moscow.   The purges began under Tsedenbal's predecessor, HorloogiynChoybalsan, when a northern minority group on the Soviet-Mongolianborder was accused of spying for the Japanese.   One chart in the exhibit said 19,895 people were executed from1937 to 1939 alone. Most were ordinary workers and herdsmen, butBuddhist monks, called lamas, were key targets and even somehigh-ranking officials were accused of being enemies of therevolution.   The exhibit included a mock torture room, with a 4-foot-highstool that prisoners were forced to sit on. The room was said to besoundproof.   The exhibit dedicated one section to attacks on religion,showing scorched and scarred Buddhist scriptures. It said all ofMongolia's 761 monasteries were destroyed during the purges. Onlythree or four have been reopened.   Although they had no figures, museum officials said attendancewas high. At noon Thursday, about 75 people were slowly movingthrough the small room, studying each display.   ``It's the wish of the people to get the truth about what reallyhappened during Stalin's time,'' said Oilzibaatar, a historian atthe State Security Ministry who was a consultant for the exhibit.   Outside, in temperatures of about 4 degrees below zeroFahrenheit, small crowds watched as workers with hammers and drillsdismantled Stalin's pedestal.   ``From childhood, I believed that (Stalin) was a good man whodid many great things,'' said Lchawgsuren, a 45-year-old member ofthe ruling party. ``Because of the new policy of restructuring, itenabled us to see also the shadows of this man and his policies.''</TEXT></DOC>
