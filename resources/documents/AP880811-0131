The increase brings the closely watched prime rate to itshighest level since June 18, 1985, when it was lowered to 9.5percent from 10 percent.   Chase Manhattan Bank started today's move, with Citibank,Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, FirstNational Bank of Chicago and Continental Illinois National Bank andMorgan Guaranty quickly matching the rise.   Major banks on the West Coast, such as Wells Fargo Bank andSecurity Pacific National Bank, also followed suit.   Stock and bond prices were mixed and the dollar moved slightlyhigher after the announcment.   It was the third time this year that banks have raised theprime, which is used in setting a range of fixed- andadjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.   ``With interest rates moving higher you're going to seeincreases in fixed- and adjustable rate mortgages (and) floatinglines of credit,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.   ``If you want to go out and get a car loan or an unsecured lineof credit to buy furniture that's going to cost you more.''   Economists had expected the move after the Fed signaled itsdesire to tighten credit by raising its discount rate to 6.5percent from 6 percent on Tuesday, largely as a means of holdingdown inflationary pressures.   The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges on loans tomember banks.   Interest rates have been rising steadily in recent months inreaction to the strength of the economy.   Mrs. Reiners said banks decided to raise the prime after thefederal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,suged above 8 percent.   ``Usually there's a pretty good correlation between the spreadof fed funds and the prime rate,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
