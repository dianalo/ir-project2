American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s research anddevelopment arm said a team led by physicist Linn Mollenauerused so-called &quot;soliton&quot; light pulses to transmitcommunications signals error-free at the rate of fivegigabits -- or five billion bits -- of data per second over9,300 miles and at 10 gigabits per second over 6,800 miles.</LP><TEXT>   The distances and error rates are important because theyshow that the light signals can be fired at very high speedsacross the Atlantic or Pacific through undersea systems andcome out the other end relatively unchanged. This wouldimprove telecommunications service and lower the cost ofproviding it, ATandamp;T scientists said.   Solitons are light pulses that maintain their shape overlong distances. Such powerful waves were first noted by JohnRussell, a 19th-century Scottish shipbuilder and engineer. Hefollowed on horseback a wave's progress through the UnionCanal outside Edinburgh and noted that the wave rolled onwithout losing its shape.   ATandamp;T said Dr. Mollenauer's team used time-divisionmultiplexing -- in which bits of information from one streamof data are electronically placed into the spaces of another-- to double the previous transmission record of 2.5 gigabitsof data per second. Wavelength-division multiplexing, whichtransmits data on two wavelengths, was used to quadruple thecapacity to 10 gigabits, ATandamp;T said.   While ATandamp;T plans to use Mr. Mollenauer's designs in itsundersea systems, &quot;a number of technical issues need to beresolved before we'll know when this technology might bedeployed,&quot; said Peter Runge, head of Bell Labs' UnderseaLightwave System Implementation Department.   Dr. Mollenauer presented his findings last week at aconference on optical-fiber communications in San Jose,Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
