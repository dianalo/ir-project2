it'scodenamed Harmony, but if the speculation is accurate, Discord would be moreappropriate; targeted as a replacement for the 3090-120 up to the 400J, it'snot going to provide much comfort for 4381 users looking to upgrade fromtheir 15 MIPS machines, and it does raise questions over the residual valuesof existing equipment; other sources say that it will be expensive, somewherebetween #55,000 and #75,000 per MIPS, and also suggest that new three-cabinetsystem will be water-cooled with an unattractive footprint; as regardsSummit, it's unlikely to offer many surprises with a disappointing 40 MIPS,and 8nS cycle time; some analysts say that the J kicker will have 9Mbytes persecond channels, plus optical channels - as will Summit; on disk control, itis likely that a 3990 Model 4 will be needed to support the faster channelsin IBM's plan.andM;- o -andM;IBM claims that over 650 applications from 350 companies will be availablefor the RS/6000 by the end of September: in a rather restrained - worried? -andO;statement, IBM says that &quot;initial market response continues to be verypositive from both technical and commercial users&quot;, adding that it hasshipped 2,000 systems to customers in addition to the 4,500 to softwaredevelopers and internal IBM locations; the low-end models 320, 520 and 530are shipping now in both workstation and server versions, the high-end 540and 930 servers will ship this month and next, and the high-end graphicsmodel, the 730, will be available in November; IBM's Essones base in Franceis making the RISC chips for Europe and Santa Palomba, Italy makes themachines.andM;- o -andM;Thorn EMI Plc's Thorn EMI Computer Sofftware is cutting 50 jobs in the UK,but is hiring additional people in France, West Germany and Italy.andM;- o -andM;Sun Microsystems Inc says that its SunCD CD-ROM storage device will now be astandard feature on many of its Sparcservers and Sparcstations at no extracost: the Mountain View company says it is committed to distributing itssoftware exclusively on compact disk by 1991.andM;- o -andM;In the wake of the Audit Commission's report highlighting the need forimproved management and maintenance of British roads, Bull HN InformationSystems Ltd and Oracle UK Ltd have jointly developed a geographic informationsystem for road management: the system is an amalgamation of Oracle's routinemaintenance management system and Bull's geographic tools; it is aimed atlocal authorities, it runs under Unix and supports up to 150 users - turnkeyprices begin at some #100,000 for eight users and go to #750,000 for a fullsystem.andM;- o -andM;Thomson Telecommunications disappeared into what became Alcatel NV in 1983,but state-controlled Thomson-CSF SA has a hankering to return to the wideopen spaces of the telecommunications world: France's posts andtelecommunications minister told Les Echos it's OK by him.andM;- o -andM;The 2,840 mile cable linking Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, in which Cableandamp; Wireless Plc's Hong Kong Telecom International Ltd is an investor withKokusai Denshin Denwa Co and Korea Telecommunication Authority and 26 othercarriers, went into service yesterday: the fibre optic link cost $175m tolay.andM;- o -andM;Fortsmann, Little andamp; Co doesn't have the field to itself in its proposedacquisition of General Instrument Corp: another, unidentified &quot;financialentity&quot; has asked for information on the company with a view to perhapsmaking a counterbid for it.andM;- o -andM;Rochester Telephone Corp has completed acquisition of Southland Telephone Cofor Telecom*USA Inc for $37.1m: it has about 9,000 local lines in Alabama,3,000 in Florida.andM;- o -andM;Oki Electric Industrial Co agreed in principle to pay #25m through its OkiEurope subsidiary for the data business of Technitron Plc, the Ascat,Berkshire company that is its biggest European distributor, and sold 140,000of Oki's printers last year: the British company was born in 1986 as a #20mmanagement buyout from its US parent.andM;- o -andM;Hitachi Ltd and China Great Wall Computer Group Corp have signed an agreementfor development of software that will enable Chinese terminals to be usedwith Hitachi's general purpose computers: Intercom Inc of Japan will helpwith software development for the partners.andM;- o -andM;No it's not planning to donate the empty cardboard boxes that it's left withafter it has delivered its computers: IBM has announced a $1.85m initiativeto aid homeless families through grants to community-based organisationsacross the US and says the IBM Homeless Initiative is designed to help thehomeless become self-sufficient as well as addressing the special needs ofchildren facing the prospect of growing up without benefit of a secure,stable learning environment;

- she invites two members onto the audience on stage tomassage her frontage, exhorting the rest of the audience to join in a chantof &quot;Nipples&quot;...andP;  Not altogether reassuring to learn the once strait-laced MaBell is now so broad-minded.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
