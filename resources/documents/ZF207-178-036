 Consistently employed, even these limited resources can sparkdeep biological insights.andP;  Much of the progress made by modern biology isattributable to improvements in both the scientific instruments biologistsuse to observe and measure phenomena, and methods for visualizing the datacollected.andM;The success of this technological evolution is evidenced by the degree towhich objective tools for studying nature are in line with scientists'subjective faculties for comprehending what they observe.andP;  The purpose hereis to show how recent developments in computer graphics have been adapted tothe particular scientific visualization needs of today's biologist in orderto optimize the interaction between objective tools and scientific intuition.andM;The scanning electron microscope and the medical computed tomography (CT)scanner are two familiar examples of instruments that have extended the scopeof the biologist's senses.andP;  In particular, such instruments offer scientiststhe potential for gaining more elegant and powerful insights into the complexthree-dimensional structure of biological and medical specimens.andP;  Increasingthe ability to acquire such information, however, requires the concurrentdevelopment of scientific visualization techniques of comparable elegance andpower.andM;It is becoming increasingly obvious that to make full use of the informationprovided by a 3D data-acquisition device, one must also have 3D visualizationtools.andP;  The visualization needs created by these new observation instrumentsare a natural area for the application of advanced computer graphicstechniques, which have become available with the advent of high-performance3D graphics workstations.andP;  In particular, the class of computer graphicsmethods known as volume rendering is proving to be an intuitivelystraightforward and computationally elegant solution to the visualizationneeds of biology and medicine.andM;&quot;Rendering&quot; is a term that refers to processes, such as rotation, projection,coloring, and shading, that are required to display an object on a computerscreen.andP;  Two general rendering approaches have been developed--namely,geometric rendering and volume rendering.andP;  Volume rendering stands incontrast to geometric reconstruction methods familiar to us in the form ofwireframe and solids models, such as those used in engineering design.andP;  Ingeometric rendering, primitive two-dimensional shapes (triangles or otherpolygons) are joined together in a meshwork to approximate the surfaces ofthree-dimensional objects.andM;Typically, either the user, or some type of surface-detection andsegmentation algorithm acting for the user, must first decide how thedifferent surfaces composing an object are to be distinguished from oneanother and how they are to be constructed from geometric primitives.andO;Three-dimensional projections are then created by processing each polygon asa unit, performing coordinate transformations, and computing color andshading characteristics over the entire polygon.andM;The conceptually simpler approach called volume rendering, on the other hand,assumes that three-dimensional objects are composed of volumetric buildingblocks called voxels.andP;  (&quot;Voxel&quot; stands for &quot;volume element&quot;, in the same waythat &quot;pixel&quot; stands for &quot;picture element&quot;.)andP;  Consider a volume that containsan object or phenomenon of interest.andP;  Now imagine dividing this large volumeinto small cubes, each of which contains some piece of the original object.andO;This continuous volume representation can then be transformed into discreteelements by assigning to each cube a value (either scalar or vector) thatcharacterizes some quality of the object as contained in that particularcube.andM;The object is now summarized by a set of point samples.andP;  Such an approach isthe simplest way of dealing with the digitized form in which most data ishandled.andP;  The result is that a single voxel is associated with each digitizedpoint in the data set.andP;  This direct mapping makes volume-rendering methodseasy to grasp and the results easy to interpret.andP;  The process of graphicallyreconstructing the original object and projecting it onto a computer screensimply requires stacking the voxels together in order, so that theyaccurately represent the original volume.andM;Volume-rendering algorithms are responsible for organizing this stackingprocedure based on the changing viewpoint of the observer--by performingcoordinate transforamtions--and for determining how to display theinformation represented by each voxel by performing coloring, transparency,and shading calculations.andP;  This approach to rendering volume data has theadvantage that no decisions need be made a priori regarding the propergeometric interpretation of the data.andM;For example, although the geometric components needed to build a model of thesmooth surface of an airplane wing may be relatively simple, it is not sointuitively obvious what geometric primitives need to be used in constructingthe highly irregular surface of a nerve cell or the complex shape of thebrain.andP;  Because they circumvent the need to make advance judgments regardingwhich geometry best fits the data structure, volume rendering methods areflexible enough to handle a wide variety of data sources, each with its ownunique features.andP;  Volume data from medical and industrial CT scans, magneticresonance scans, computational fluid dynamics, theoretical chemistry,seismological surveys, and astrophysics has been successfully andinformatively treated with volume rendering techniques.andM;In many of these instances, the human eye has never seen the objects orprocesses being visualized, making any geometric rendering approach highlysusceptible to artifacts and misinterpretation.andP;  The nature of volumerendering techniques, consistently applied, is to let the data speak to thescientist instead of the other way around.andM;Over the last several years, the Laboratory for Advanced Biological CellImaging at Maharishi International University (MIU) has developed techniquesfor microscopic observation and computer graphics tools based on this volumevisualization strategy, for exploring the dynamic structure of living nervecells.andP;  In the paragraphs that follow, we will describe the implementation ofthis strategy in the particular field of 3D light microscopy, and describethe graphical methods tfhat have been employed to make real-time, interactivevolume rendering of biological structures a reality.andM;The importance of this work lies in the fact that the developmental growthpatterns of nerve cells, as well as their ability to receive and transmitinformation, depend upon their shape.andP;  Since growing nerve cells areconstantly changing in shape, one of the goals of this research has been todesign visualization tools capable of recreating the complete 3D structure ofmotile cells in real time.andP;  This design criterion is essential because manyexperiments are cost or impossible to recreate.andP;  Therefore, we wanted the newvisualization tools to give useful results while an experiment was still inprogress, not a day or a week later.andM;Recently the lab has undertaken a project devoted to the study of 3D forms ofcells and tissues, using data supplied by recently commercialized scanningconfocial microscopes--specifically, in our case, the Sarastro Phoibos1000and the Bio-Rad MRC-500.andP;  The confocal microscope is one of a new generationof instruments capable of acquiring volumetric data sets.andP;  These instrumentsachieve on a microscopic level what CT scans achieve for doctors studying thewhole body.andM;Prior to the development of confocal optics, accurate 3D information wasdifficult or impossible to obtain from microscopic specimens.andP;  The mostcommon reconstruction procedures involved either complex mathematicaldeconvolutions of ordinary light-microscope images or painstaking andtime-consuming work to cut the tissue into fine slices, photograph ordigitize each individual 2D slice, construct surface contours by hand-tracingor by edge-detection image-processing techniques, and then employ geometricsurface-reconstruction algorithms to produce a 3D image.andM;With the confocal microscope, it is now possible to get high-contrast,high-resolution &quot;optical slices&quot; of biological samples without having todisturb the samples physically.andP;  This is accomplished by a unique opticaldesign that effectively eliminates nearly all contributions to the microscopeimage from objects that don't lie in the exact plane of focus--what remains,then, is a thin optical slice.andP;  By stepping the focus plane through a thickspecimen and acquiring a succession of digitized 2D images, it is possible tobuild up a 3D point-sampled array representing the microscopic volume.andM;To reassemble these optical sections, we have written a volume-renderingprogram called VoxelView that runs on Silicon Graphics Iris 4D/GT graphicsworkstations.andP;  With the visualization tools built into VoxelView, we havebeen able to reach rendering speeds as high as 500,000 voxels per second,allowing us to reconstruct living cells graphically in real time and observethem from any arbitrary viewing angle while an experiment is still inprogress.andM;Volume reconstructions that once took weeks or months of manual labor or manyCPU hours to accomplish using other methods now can often be completed injust a few seconds--and with a degree of 3D detail and a wealth of visualinformation never before available.andM;To understand the computational prerequisites necessary before the goal ofreal-time, interactive volume rendering of biological data can be achieved,three performance-limiting factors need to be taken into account: memoryrequirements, data-traversal speed, and 3D graphical processing.andP;  The firstthing one recognizes when dealing with these kinds of volume data sets isthat extensive amounts of memory are required.andP;  For example, volume databasesfrom confocal microscopes contain from 5 to 40 MB of voxel data (150 slices,each with 512 x 512 voxels, equals 40 MB).andP;  The impact on both archiving anddata handling during program execution is obvious.andP;  At runtime, the largememory requirement directly affects data-traversal speed.andP;  In order to renderthe volume at maximum rates, users must be able to traverse the databaserapidly.andM;One method for achieving this is to load the entire database and therendering program at runtime, in order to avoid costly disk accesses.andP;  Thedata-traversal and rendering speed in VoxelView has been further improvedthrough the use of a special data-encoding algorithm that minimizes the CPUload and data-handling requirements.andM;The third performance consideration is the speed with which 3D coordinatetransformations and shading calculations can be performed.andP;  While SiliconGraphics' Iris workstations are known for their high polygon-renderingperformance, the logically symmetric design of their graphics hardware makesthem good voxel processors as well.andP;  This design symmetry treats therendering of polygons and the rendering of points in a consistent manner,such that the high performance available to geometric rendering is directlytranslatable to voxel-rendering rates.andM;Therefore, for rendering volume images of average complexity containing oneor several nerve cells, refresh rates of one fully rendered image in lessthan one second can be achieved when the data-traversal optimizationsavailable in VoxelView are employed and the full 3D graphics capability ofthe Iris architecture is engaged.andM;An additional requirement for effective implementation of volumevisualization in research and diagnostic environments is that renderingalgorithms be designed to combine real-time performance with maximuminteractive control over the visualization process.andP;  Having complete freedomto alter rendering parameters--including pseudocolor, transparency,illumination models, and gradient threshold--makes it possible to explore thetrue 3D geometry of all the objects in a given volume, even when such objectsoverlap or are contained within one another.andM;In the images in Figures 1 and 3, for example, pseudocolor has been used (asit commonly is) to make small, signal-level changes in the original data moreapparent to the human eye.andP;  Thresholding utilities within the program alsomake it possible to eliminate individual gray-scale values (or colors) fromthe rendering process selectively so that the final image contains onlyvalues of interest.andM;Variable transparency is one of the most valuable interactive renderingfeatures.andP;  The ability to make surfaces and volumes transparent makes itpossible to veal the internal structure of a volume-filling object.andP;  Involume rendering, transparency refers to the way in which successive voxelsare super-imposed over one another as the volume image is beingreconstructed.andP;  By decreasing the degree to which oen voxel covers orobscures an underlying voxel, users can, for instance, adjust the visibilityof internal, sub-cellular structures as viewed from outside a nerve cell.andP;  InFigure 1, variable transparency has been used to render livingconnective-tissue cells as hollow objects covered by a thin transparentmembrane.andM;Various computer-graphics illumination techniques can be used to highlightstructural features, as shown in Figure 2.andP;  These techniques are based onphysical models of the way light is reflected by surfaces within the volume,and are a standard feature of the SGI graphics pipeline.andP;  As the figurereveals, the surface contours of this cell are extremely irregular and wouldbe quite difficult to model accurately without the aid of volume-renderingtechniques.andM;Another rendering option available in VoxelView, gradient thresholding, canbe used to enhance image quality further.andP;  The gradient is computed as thefirst spatial derivative of the original voxel value and can be appliedadvantageously in at least two ways.andP;  For example, the gradient magnitude canbe coupled with the voxel value and used as an additional quantity forsegmenting voxel data before rendering.andP;  In the simplest case, this meansthat if the gradient magnitude corresponding to some voxel does not reach acertain threshold, then that voxel is not rendered.andM;Another application of gradient information is pseudocoloring volume imagesas a direct function of gradient magnitudes.andP;  Because gradient magnitudes aregenerally greatest at object boundaries, the use of this rendering mode inconjunction with variable transparency is a very efficient way to displaynested surfaces within a volume.andP;  This scheme has been used in Figure 3; inthis image, both internal and external cell surfaces can be clearlydistinguished.andM;Taken together, these interactive rendering facilities provide a set ofvisualization tools capable of distilling latent information from volume datain a way that allows biologists to apply and refine their scientificintuition and make immediate use of the feedback they receive from thesetools.andP;  They have given us glimpses into the microscopic world that were notpreviously available.andM;Work with 3D biological visualization has clearly shown that volume-renderingtechniques are compatible with many newly developed 3D measurementtechnologies, and that this rendering approach can enrich the interactionbetween scientists and their data significantly.andM;Volume rendering is an important stage in the evolution of scientificvisualization as applied to biological structures, and is poised to changethe way many kinds of biological research are conducted.andP;  It allowsresearchers to exploit the full potential of their measuring instruments andto explore subtle relationships between structure and function.andP;  As bilogicalimaging technology continues to develop, however, the pressure to deviseappropriate visualization strategies will also grow.andM;Even now, new confocal microscopes and other tools capable of extremely rapidvolume data acquisition are becoming available.andP;  These advances ininstrumentation make it possible to design experiments that encompassbiological time as well as biological space.andP;  The extension of current 3Dvolume visualization schemes to include time as a fourth dimension is nowunder way.andP;  Such developments will place even greater demands for speed onrendering algorithms.andP;  Performance enhancements to VoxelView that could makereal-time &quot;volume animation&quot; a reality are currently being developed.andO;Success in this effort would boost the transition from 3D to 4D techniquesand open yet another window on the study of the processes of life.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
