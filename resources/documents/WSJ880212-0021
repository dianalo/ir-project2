His son, Michael, is here now as the man to beat in Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary.    He's ahead by as much as 18 points in the early public-opinion polls. His lead is so comfortable that his two keenest rivals, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, virtually concede victory to him.    Mr. Dukakis, asked if he can afford to lose this primary, answers frankly: &quot;No.&quot;    So, barring the kind of surprise New Hampshire is famous for, the race is for second place, and a rough and tumble one it is suddenly turning out to be. The Democrats finally, in their own fashion, are getting mad. Somebody -- Mr. Simon or Mr. Gephardt -- is going to be in deep trouble when the votes are counted Tuesday night.    Both of them put everything they had into Iowa -- with Rep. Gephardt coming in first and Sen. Simon finishing second. Now they're broke. Both of them desperately need to finish second here to convince backers they deserve more cash to continue the race. Money is now crucial.    Mr. Dukakis, the governor of neighboring Massachusetts, easily survived his third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses. In this, the first-in-the-nation primary that has become a legend in its own time, he is sitting on top of the public-opinion polls and on top of about $2 million in cash, of which he will spend as much here as he needs to spend.    Mr. Dukakis, according to present indications, may well emerge from New Hampshire as the main challenger to Sen. Albert Gore of Tennesee, this year's Democratic enigma, in the 20 Super Tuesday contests on March 8.    Mr. Gore is also sitting on top of a cash pile of about $2 million. He hardly spent anything in Iowa, where he finished last, and he won't spend very much here in New Hampshire. Arlie Schardt, the campaign's press spokesman, says Sen. Gore is making &quot;a limited effort&quot; in New Hampshire involving &quot;a modest buy&quot; of television time.    He and the rest of the field -- former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the increasingly quixotic figure of former Sen. Gary Hart -- will participate in the one big event preceding the primary, a League of Women Voters debate Saturday.    Voters are also asked to spend Valentine's Day with Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, at her reception in Concord. The fliers for the event show the couple in a warm embrace. The whole idea of making a limited effort here, the Gore people say, is to come in fourth ahead of Mr. Jackson, a Super Tuesday contender in the South.    But for both Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Simon, New Hampshire is Super Tuesday.    Mr. Simon borrowed $110,000 on Wednesday to buy TV commercials to attack Mr. Gephardt on his so-called &quot;flip-flops&quot; on various issues. Two days earlier, Mr. Gephardt borrowed $40,000 to keep his TV ads on the air.    Mr. Simon began his attack in the shadow of the controversial Seabrook nuclear-power plant, charging that Mr. Gephardt has voted several times with the nuclear-power industry though he now professes to be &quot;a champion of nuclear safety.&quot; Mr. Gephardt, told of Mr. Simon's attack, replied, &quot;He knows better than that.&quot;    The Gephardt message is that Americans need to regain control of their own destiny. He would start by taking firm measures with U.S. trading partners that discriminate against American goods. That message found a sympathetic audience in Iowa, a state troubled by farm and factory closings.    But New Hampshire, by and large, is a prosperous state, much of its success a spillover from Gov. Dukakis's Massachusetts. All Mr. Gephardt can do in the face of that kind of progress is challenge people in New Hampshire to worry about the problems in other, less-fortunate places.    &quot;I don't think everyone in New Hampshire is a yuppie who doesn't care about anybody else,&quot; he told a pushing, shoving brigade of reporters in front of the old Carpenter Hotel, scene of the opening of John Kennedy's presidential campaign 28 years ago.    Before Iowa, Rep. Gephardt was running about 2% or 3% in the polls in New Hampshire. Yesterday, the Boston Globe reported he had jumped to 18% in its tracking polls, 18 points behind Gov. Dukakis and six points ahead of Sen. Simon.    More than any of the other leaders in the race here, Mr. Gephardt is an unknown quantity. Thus, he is compelled to run a biographical TV ad to tell New Hampshirites who he is. Beyond that, his strategy is to once again target his appeal to older people and those who aren't benefiting from this state's economic good times.    Sen. Simon, who runs as a traditional New Deal Democrat, is a more familiar figure here. He has opened 14 headquarters around this state and expects to have as many as 1,000 college students canvassing for him this weekend.    But, to come in second he has to cut Mr. Gephardt down to size, for the Missouri congressman is surging on the famous &quot;bump&quot; from Iowa. And that is a conumdrum, for Mr. Simon risks damaging his own nice-guy reputation by launching attacks that are seen to be personal in nature.    As the front-runner, Mr. Dukakis is afforded the luxury of taking almost gratuitous swipes at both these rivals. In a speech at Saint Anselm College, he attacked those who seek to penalize nations that discriminate against U.S. goods, a barely disguised reference to the Gephardt proposal. &quot;That's a 19th-century debate,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got to prepare for the 21st century.&quot; He said Mr. Gephardt's get-tough trade policy is &quot;bureaucratic and unwieldy&quot; and would be a threat &quot;to set off a trade war.&quot;    He sought to cast Sen. Simon on the political dump heap, too, for daring to suggest that the governor is simply a &quot;technocrat.&quot; &quot;I always have the feeling with Paul that sometimes he's talking about the 40s and the 50s.&quot;    That may not be the kind of hardball insults polished and perfected this year by the Republican presidential candidates. But it's a start.    (See related story: &quot;Campaign '88: Bush, After Defeat in Iowa, Now Faces Possibility of Loss in New Hampshire...&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 12, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
