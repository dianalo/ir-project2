Thus, technically, Wright's use of agovernment word processor, for example, to prepare a book fromwhich he derived personal income was a violation of 31 U.S.C.1301(a) which provides that government appropriations are to beused solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated.   It is not so clear, however, whether Wright's use of hiscongressional staff to produce and market his book is a violationof 31 U.S.C. 1301(a). No attempt was made to keep work on the bookseparate from work on official business. No records were kept ofhours worked on the book as compared to the hours spent on officialbusiness. Matthew Cossolotto, who spent far more time than anyother staff employee working on the book, testified that he workedon the book about 200 hours over eight to eleven months. Otherstaff members also testified that during that period, there wereweeks in which staff worked substantially more than 40 hour weeks.Thus it is entirely possible, and in some instances even probable,that although some work on the book was certainly done during thenormal 9 to 5 work day, staff employees worked on the book inaddition to completing all the work ordinarily done as part oftheir official duties.   Such use of staff time is specifically permitted under Houseethics guidelines. ...   Moreover, members are given wide discretion to determine theconditions and the duties of employment. The enormous breadth andambiguity of these ``guidelines'' makes it virtually impossible toprevent members from using staff employees paid by government fundsfrom working on projects providing personal income to the member.   Thus as discussed in full in Section III.D. of this Report,because it is impossible to determine with the required certaintythat Wright had his staff working on the book during time thatshould have been devoted to his official business, we do notconclude that Wright violated any law or standard of conduct.</TEXT><HEAD>E. Wright's Use of a Condominium in Fort Worth, Texas</HEAD><TEXT>   In 1979, Jim and Betty Wright and their good friends George andMarlene Mallick formed and became equal shareholders in Mallightco,Inc. Mallightco invested in commercial paper, securities, realestate and oil and gas ventures for the general purpose of makingmoney for its shareholders. Mallightco was funded in February 1980with $58,127 in cash from the Mallicks and roughly the equivalentin marketable securities from the Wrights.   Throughout Wright's investment in Mallightco, it was used as aconduit for cash flowing from the Mallicks to the Wrights. Forexample, Mallightco began lending money to the Mallicks and theWrights in August 1980. The first loan, on August 15, 1980 was for$4,375 each. The second loan on September 3, 1980 was for $5,536.09each. The Mallicks paid off their loans in December 1980 by sellingMallightco a 1979 Cadillac Seville valued at $10,575 and creditedagainst the loans. The Wrights made no payments on these loansduring 1980.   In September 1980, Marlene Mallick obtained a $150,000 loan fromthe Ridglea Bank which she immediately loaned to Mallightco. Theinterest rate on the loan from Ridglea Bank apparently fluctuatedabove the prime lending rate. On September 12, 1980, the Mallicksand the Wrights then each borrowed $75,000 from Malme ratereached 20.5 percent in May 1981 and again in July 1981), theinterest rate on the loan from Mallightco to the Wrights remainedat 13.5 percent.   The net effect of these loans from Mallightco to the Wrights isthat during the first year of business, the Wrights had recoveredtheir entire investment from Mallightco plus an additional $25,000.The Mallicks had added $65,000 in cash and a $10,575 car to theirinitial investment. The Wrights received a gift worth over $100from the Mallicks in the form of reduced interest payments during1981, 1982, and 1984 when market rates exceeded 13.5 percent. Theyalso received a gift from the Mallicks in the form of MarleneMallick's creditworthiness and her ability to obtain financing fromthe Ridglea Bank for the Wrights. Although the gift is difficult tovalue, we believe it is worth more than $100. Wright's failure todisclose these gifts are also violations of House Rule XLIV.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
