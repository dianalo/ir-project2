Bush and his wife, Barbara, arrived from Warsaw where thepresident unveiled a modest aid program for Poland on Monday, thefirst day of a 10-day European tour that will include an economicsummit of seven industrial democracies in Paris later this week.   Bush may come under pressure from Walesa for a $10 billionpackage of Western credits and investment guarantees for thebeleaguered country.   Bush has ruled out anything that large, and Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III said Monday no one really expected the president``to show up here with a big wheelbarrow full of dollars.''   After a day of talks Monday largely with government leaders inWarsaw, Bush was meeting Walesa in the Baltic Sea city of Gdansk.From there, Bush was traveling to Budapest, Hungary, for anothertwo-day stay.   Bush has been a longtime backer of Solidarity, and if he was toattract big crowds anywhere in Poland, Gdansk was the place.   After a luncheon at the house Walesa shares with his wife Danutaand their eight children at 54 Polanki Street, Bush was accompanyingthe union leader to the towering Solidarity Workers Monument outsidethe Lenin Shipyards.   Walesa, in an interview Monday, said Poland is making progresswith its political freedoms faster than it is tackling its economicproblems.   He said he wants Bush ``to help us make this correction'' so thatfinancial matters are addressed with the same emphasis as politicalaffairs.   Crowned by three crosses topped with anchors, the Solidaritymonument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed bygovernment security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices thatleft 45 dead and 2,000 injured.   To drum up a big audience, Solidarity workers distributedleaflets about Bush's visit and his speech at the monument.   In Warsaw, Bush drew crowds that were relatively small, numberingno more than 3,000 people at any site.   Even so, Baker said Bush was not disappointed. ``It's not someelection campaign where we've gone out here and tried to turn outcrowds,'' he said.   The president spent more than two hours in talks Monday withCommunist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski and then met with himagain over lunch and again at a state dinner.   Solidarity representatives also attended the luncheon, and one ofthem, Bronislaw Geremek, the union leader in the House, got the seatof honor at the head table next to Bush. Jaruzelski sat at aseparate table with the president's wife, Barbara.   As the president's motorcade arrived at Radziwill Palace for thedinner, demonstrators among 1,000 people outside could be heardshouting ``down with communism'' and ``Jaruzelski must go.''   There was no indication whether Bush could hear the protests,which appeared to have been staged by splinter opposition groups.   In a toast to Bush, Jaruzelski said, ``May our relations alwaysfeature mutual respect, confidence and friendly feelings.''   Interviewed later on ABC News, Jaruzelski said he spoke withSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev about the meeting and added thatBush's visit was positive for future relations.   ``I really am heartened that the leaders of the two big powersare guided by the same intentions and I feel that this bodes wellfor the future,'' Jaruzelski said.   The general, who imposed martial law in 1981 to crush Solidarityand imprison its leaders, said union representatives now shareresponsibility with the government for Poland's ``destiny, itswell-being, its position in Europe and in the world.''   Solidarity representatives won nearly half the seats in recentparliamentary elections, and Walesa has not ruled out thepossibility of running for the new, powerful post of president.   In his toast, Bush repeated the theme of encouraging politicaland economic reforms, while cautioning that Poles face a period ofeconomic belt-tightening.   ``Reform is a difficult process, as you well know,'' Bush said atthe dinner. ``There are neither easy answers nor cost-freesolutions. But there is a sound basis for hope.   ``And today, you have the goodwill of an expectant and hopefulworld,'' he said.   In an address to Parliament, Bush said he would ask Congress tocreate a $100 million fund to help encourage development of theprivate sector in Poland. He also said he would ask for $15 millionto fight pollution in the city of Krakow.   Bush said he will ask leaders of six other industrialized nationsattending a summit with him in Paris late this week to supportrescheduling up to $5 billion of Poland's $39 billion internationaldebt.</TEXT></DOC>
