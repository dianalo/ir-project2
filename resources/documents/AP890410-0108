Prime Minister Armando Villanueva said the fighting Sundaymarked the start of a drive against Maoist guerrillas in thecocaine-producing jungle.   The state news agency Andina said army soldiers battled a columnof Maoist Shining Path guerrillas for six hours near Uchiza, 245miles northeast of Lima.   The fighting left 20 rebels dead and three soldiers wounded,according to a military communique transmitted by Andina.   The violence came two weeks after a column of rebels and drugtraffickers overran the town's police post, killing 10 policemenand three civilians.   Uchiza is in the Upper Huallaga river valley, a region known asPeru's cocaine cradle. It has become a virtual no-man's landoverrun by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas who protect themin exchange for money to purchase arms.   Fourteen more rebels were slain when navy marines patrolling theUcayali River, 180 miles south of Uchiza, battled a guerrillacolumn for several hours, Andina said.   The government did not indicate any troop casualties in thatclash.   The center-left government of President Alan Garcia has comeunder intense criticism since the Uchiza attack for failing toadequately defend the post and to send reinforcements.   Critics have renewed charges that the government has mismanagedthe anti-insurgency effort, allowing rebel violence to spread.   The Shining Path insurgency has claimed more than 14,000 lives,including guerrillas, soldiers, police and innocent peasants.   The fighting began in 1980 in the central Andes Mountains andhas branched out to coastal urban centers and the eastern jungle.</TEXT></DOC>
