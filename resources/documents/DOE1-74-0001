Pre-industrialpolar precipitation is chemically similar in central areas of the twoice sheets, with a weak primary aerosol component relatively free ofthe gas-derived acids (mainly H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ and HNO/sub 3/) characteristicof later deposits. Large volcanic eruptions have contaminated polar snows,particularly by H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ fall-out. Records of major volcanicevents of the last 200 years are dissimilar in the two ice sheets: onlythe 1815 eruption of Tambora appears to be strongly and equally recorded.Anthropogenic pollution has not yet affected south polar regions: thecase of heavy metals is very difficult to assess due to their extremelylow concentrations in snow. Much more particulate matter reached polarregions during the last glacial age than at present; however, currentlyavailable glaciobiochemical data indicate that the effect was differentboth qualitatively and quantitatively for Greenland and Antarctica.</TEXT></DOC>
