Spokesmen of the banned Solidarity trade union in Warsaw saiddrivers at three bus depots struck from 4:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. Thedepots employ nearly 4,000 workers. A brief report by PAP said thedisruption ended at 7 a.m.   Ryszard Anczykowski, director of the transport company for thecity of 390,000, refused comment.   The drivers demanded reinstatement of Jozef Ignor, chairman ofthe workers' council and co-chairman of the strike committee formedwhen the drivers went on strike for one day May 5, and RomualdZiolowski, also co-chairman of the strike committee and a workers'council member, the spokesmen said.   Ignor and Ziolowski were fired May 18 and Wednesday's strike wascalled after the dismissals were upheld by a labor court Monday,said Henryk Wujec, a Solidarity leader in Warsaw.   Management signed an agreement at 7:30 a.m. restoring their jobsand promising no further punishment for the strike, and driverswent back to work soon afterward, said Solidarity nationalspokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.   ``What is interesting is the fact that it wasn't a strikedemanding higher pay, but a typical Solidarity strike,'' saidOnyszkiewicz.   The stoppage was the second reported among bus drivers since awave of strikes between April 25 and May 10 in Poland, the worstlabor unrest since the 1981 imposition of martial law.   Drivers in Lomza in northeast Poland struck briefly June 15 in apay dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
