<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-34-0224 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors group at Boston University is involved both in field theorysimulations and in the design and construction of a special purpose arithmeticprocessor (the Space Time Array Computer - STAC) for such applications.They have found the LISP programming language as well as the LISP Machineenvironment productive tools for developing scientific software and fordesign and software development of the STAC processor. The LISP Machineenvironment is integrated and interactive (allowing incremental softwaredevelopment) and it offers many powerful tools for abstraction and symbolicmanipulation. They describe some of the issues involved in the high levelformulation of algorithms in LISP as compared with FORTRAN and with themapping from such a formulation to low level code. They also describesome of the difficulties encountered by the physicist-programmer in makingthe transition between traditional languages and LISP. 2 references.</TEXT></DOC>
