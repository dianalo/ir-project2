Bob'sserves up a sandwich of thinly sliced steak which has been cooked on a hotgrill with the appropriate sizzle and scraping of the metal spatula as themeat is moved around so it doesn't burn. A healthy serving of onions and anadmittedly messy dollop of melted cheese is scooped on to the bun.Monday-Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday 4-9 p.m. (star)(star)(star);   TheCountry Way Restaurant,  5325 Mowry Ave., Fremont, (415) 797-3188, is a placethat specializes in its ordinaryness.

The food is excellent while the service is well-intentioned, but a littlescattered. An order of shrimp and walnuts ($9.95) presented us with a plate ofhot, just-cooked shrimp, their delicate taste perfectly enhanced with a gentletopping of a slightly tangy dressing.
