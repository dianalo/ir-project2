To test the equations, he applied them to adecades-old puzzle about why the planet Mercury annuallychanges its orbit about the sun.   When the equations predicted those changes exactly, the36-year-old physicist immediately realized that he had made astartling discovery.   &quot;I was beside myself with ecstasy for days,&quot; he wrote afriend a few months later. But it would be four years beforethe rest of the scientific world would grasp his enormousachievement: He had ensured that his new general theory ofrelativity would supersede Isaac Newton's laws of motion andgravity, which had dominated science for more than twocenturies.   So far, Einstein's work has stood up better than KarlMarx's or Sigmund Freud's. It has turned back repeatedchallenges and remains, even now, the very basis of modernphysics. His general theory is widely regarded, saysphysicist-author Jeremy Bernstein, as &quot;the most perfect andaesthetically beautiful creation in the history of physics,perhaps in all of science.&quot;   In addition, the theory has spawned surprisingly practicalapplications: It enables engineers to guide spacecraftthrough the solar system. It has helped astronomers findblack holes, pulsars, quasars and other mysterious celestialobjects. It plays a central role in cosmologists' debatesover the origins of the universe.   In a recent article in Science magazine, Clifford M. Will,a Washington University physicist, ticks off half a dozenspace-age tests of general relativity now in progress. Forinstance, astronomers periodically fire streams of rapidlaser pulses at reflectors left on the moon by the Apolloastronauts. The time the light takes to make the round tripback to Earth measures, within one inch, the distance to themoon.   The laser measurements test some calculations made byKenneth Nordtvedt, a physicist at Montana State University.His calculations showed that if Einstein's general theory istrue, the Earth and moon would be affected equally by thesun's gravity. But if various other theories are true, solargravity would affect the Earth differently than the lessmassive moon.   So far, the ultra-precise laser measurements show noperturbations in the Earth-to-moon distance that could stemfrom the so-called Nordtvedt effect. General relativityremains unscathed.   Yet, like all scientific theories, Einstein's generaltheory is fragile. With its predictions fixed, Dr. Willwrites, &quot;Every test . . . is potentially deadly. A verifieddiscrepancy between observation and prediction would kill thetheory.&quot;   And cause huge reverberations. General relativity spawnedthe third great revolution in the prevailing view of theuniverse. Copernicus launched the first by removing the Earthfrom its center.   Newton launched the second. In the 17th century, heformulated his three laws of motion -- the first holding, forexample, that a body continues at rest or in uniform motionunless some force acts on it -- and his law of gravity, whichholds that the pull of gravity depends on the masses of twobodies and the square of the distance between them. Theselaws implied that if all natural forces could be identifiedand measured, the state of the universe at any given momentcould be predicted.   Then came Einstein's theory, which sparked a publicresponse that Paul Johnson, in his book &quot;Modern Times,&quot; callsone of the &quot;principal formative influences on . . .twentieth-century history.&quot; Although most people didn'tunderstand the abstruse theory, they grasped that &quot;absolutetime and absolute length had been dethroned,&quot; the Britishhistorian says.   &quot;All at once, nothing seemed certain in the movement ofthe spheres,&quot; Mr. Johnson declares. &quot;At the beginning of the1920s, the belief began to circulate {that} there were nolonger any absolutes: of time and space, of good and evil, ofknowledge, above all of value.&quot;   General relativity became the first scientific subjectthat the newly emerging mass media tried to popularize. Buteven the simplest explanations of the theory are difficult tofollow, so the media instead focused on Einstein -- andcreated a lasting image of the modern scientist. Einstein was&quot;a very `mediagenic' fellow,&quot; Dr. Will notes in his book,&quot;Was Einstein Right?&quot; Dr. Will adds: &quot;His absentmindedness,his playful wit, his willingness to expound upon politics,religion and philosophy in addition to science, his violinplaying -- all these characteristics sparked an intensecuriosity on the part of the public.&quot;   Descended from a long line of German Jewish merchants,Einstein grew up in Munich, where his father and uncle ran anot-very-successful electrical-equipment business. Even whenhe was only four or five, Einstein later recalled, a simplemagnetic compass interested him in the workings of invisiblenatural forces. At 12, he discovered that the proofs oftheorems in a geometry book seemed as obvious and real as thephysical world around him. Graduated from the Swiss FederalPolytechnic School in Zurich in 1902 with a degree in physicsbut unable to find a teaching job, he went to work as apatent-office clerk in Bern.   It was during his seven years as a patent clerk thatEinstein first astonished the scientific world. Althoughisolated from the mainstream of theoretical physics andlimited to research after working hours, Einstein tackledsome of the most formidable problems then facing physicists.The crucial issue: whether Newton's laws reflectedfundamental laws of nature.   In the late 1800s, a number of discoveries were makingscientists doubt the universality of Newton's laws of motion.Newton had assumed, for instance, that all motion wasrelative to a mysterious absolute &quot;stillness&quot; and that anabsolute time was being ticked off by an unseen universalclock.   Spurring the doubts was an 1881 experiment by twophysicists in Cleveland. At the time, physicists assumed thatspace must be filled with an invisible and stationary medium,the so-called ether. One could always determine whether theplanets, or anyone on them, were moving by relating theirmotion to the stationary ether. So the ether was Newton'sabsolute &quot;stillness.&quot;   One way to test for the existence of the ether was to seewhether it affected the speed of light. The Clevelanders,Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, reasoned that a beam oflight flashed &quot;forward&quot; as the Earth moved through the etherwould travel at a different velocity than a light beam shinedperpendicular to the Earth's movement. Yet when the menflashed two beams perpendicular to each other, they found nodifference in their velocities -- as though the ether didn'texist. For years, physicists struggled to explain that.   Einstein later said that in 1905 he wasn't particularlythinking about the Michelson-Morley experiment. In that year,however, one of the five scientific papers he publishedprovided an answer. To start with, Einstein explained that ifa physical law reflected a fundamental law of nature, it musthold true whether one is moving or stationary -- that is, inall &quot;frames of reference.&quot; This requirement, he said, is the&quot;principle of relativity.&quot;   The 26-year-old patent clerk proceeded to cite situations-- frames of reference -- where Newtonian physics led toparadoxes, where motion seemed to be absolute in one frame ofreference but not in another. The paradoxes showed thatNewton's laws of motion violated the principle of relativity.The paradoxes vanish, Einstein suggested, if one sets asideNewton's laws and looks for a universal constant, somethingthat is the same in all frames of reference.   Einstein then noted that James Clerk Maxwell's theories onelectromagnetic waves held that the speed of light in avacuum is constant. If the velocity of light was the samewhether one was moving or at rest, one would have a newtheory of motion that conformed to the principle ofrelativity, a new &quot;theory of relativity.&quot;   One of the examples Einstein later used to illustrate howhis new theory resolves the Newtonian paradoxes deals withsimultaneous events. In Newton's universe, two events couldbe said to occur simultaneously in all frames of referencebecause an absolute time was being ticked off by theuniversal clock. A person in motion could say an eventhappened at exactly 7:10 a.m. Universal Clock Time and astationary person could say another event also happened at7:10 a.m. UCT. Thus, even though they are in different framesof reference, the two observers would agree that the eventswere simultaneous.   But, Einstein said, this notion of absolute time andsimultaneous events produces a paradox. Noting that lighttakes time to travel from point to point, he cited a case oftwo bolts of lightning striking near a railroad track. Aperson standing beside the track midway between the strikesmight see both flashes at the same time. To him, they aresimultaneous. But someone on a fast train would see the flashup ahead -- the stroke he was rushing toward -- before theflash of the stroke he was rushing away from. To him, the twobolts struck at different times.   So, the two events are simultaneous in one frame ofreference but not another. Notions of absolute time andabsolute motion violate the principle of relativity.   On the other hand, Einstein said, if the velocity of lightis the same whether one is moving or stationary, passengerson a moving train can measure the time a flash of light takesto travel from one end of the train to the other andcalculate the velocity of light. A stationary observerstanding by the tracks could see the same flash of light --or even a different flash -- and come up with the same figurefor its velocity.   With the new theory, Newton's concepts of absolute timeand motion evaporated -- and so did the ether. Michelson andMorley couldn't find any difference in the velocities oflight beams flashed perpendicular to each other becauselight's velocity isn't changed by the motion of its source.   The new theory applied only to a special state of matter,that of uniform motion; that is, motion in a straight line ata constant velocity. Hence, the theory was known as thespecial theory of relativity.   Later in 1905, Einstein published what was essentially afootnote to the special theory. It linked the mass of a bodyand its energy content: The energy of matter was equal to itsmass times the velocity of light squared, or E=mc(2). (Yearslater, the formula enabled physicists to calculate the energyreleased when uranium atoms split. Other than writing hisfamous 1939 letter urging President Roosevelt to pursuedevelopment of an atomic bomb, Einstein played no role in it,however.)   In 1909, Einstein left the patent office for a low-payinguniversity position in Zurich. There, and later in Berlin, hetried to expand his theory of relativity to encompass matterin non-uniform motion, or acceleration, in which an externalforce causes a moving body to change speed or direction.Acceleration posed a contradiction that Einstein laterillustrated with the analogy of a train passenger looking outthe window. As long as the train was moving in a straightline at a steady speed, the passenger couldn't tell whetherhe was moving relative to the landscape or the landscape wasmoving relative to him. Motion was relative.   &quot;If the motion of the {railroad} carriage is now changedinto a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerfulapplication of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriageexperiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards,&quot;Einstein explained. This acceleration is sensed by thepassenger even if he can't see out the window. Accelerationseemed to be absolute.   If acceleration is absolute but uniform motion isrelative, the &quot;laws of nature&quot; would appear to be differentfor different states of matter. &quot;No person whose mode ofthought is logical can rest satisfied with this condition ofthings,&quot; Einstein wrote later. What was needed, he explained,was &quot;a physics which is conformable to the general principleof relativity . . . whatever may be a body's state ofmotion.&quot;   Gluing together the general theory of relativity tookEinstein almost a decade. But it is an intellectual tour deforce that still astonishes theoretical physicists.   First, Einstein discarded the notion that acceleration isabsolute by pointing out a principle that scientists had usedfor two centuries without realizing it. He recalled thatGalileo had disproved the ancients' assumption that a heavyobject falls faster than a lighter one. Galileo showed that,if there isn't any atmosphere, two objects of differentmasses -- say, a feather and a lead ball -- dropped off theTower of Pisa will accelerate at the same rate and hit theground at the same time.   Newtonians had explained that although gravity may tug atthe more massive object with greater force, that object'sresistance to acceleration -- its inertia -- is also greaterand offsets the stronger tug. So, all falling objects onEarth, regardless of their mass, accelerate at the same rate.Einstein found the equivalence of gravitational mass andinertial mass intriguing, and he said he &quot;guessed that in itmust lie the key to a deeper understanding of inertia andgravitation.&quot;   With this realization, Einstein reached his most momentousconclusion, his &quot;principle of equivalence.&quot; This principlesays, in essence, that if two phenomena produce equivalenteffects, they must be manifestations of the same fundamentallaw.   Einstein then applied the principle of equivalence toacceleration. If people floating freely about inside aspaceship suddenly plunge to the floor, they can't tellwhether their craft has been accelerated by its rockets orhad been falling and stopped. For the travelers, the effectsof acceleration and gravitation are the same. They can tellwhether they have accelerated or stopped falling only inrelation to something else, such as a planet. Acceleration isrelative, not absolute.   The implications of acceleration and gravity beingequivalent were far-reaching. If a spaceship is acceleratingand a beam of light is coming in through a window on oneside, the beam, as it crosses the ship's interior, won't hita spot on the wall precisely opposite the window. To itsastronauts, the beam would be curved. And if accelerationmakes light curve, the principle of equivalence indicatesthat gravity also makes light curve.   In 1911, to test the concept that gravity and accelerationare equivalent, Einstein stuck his neck out: He predictedthat starlight grazing the sun's surface would be curved by0.83 seconds of arc by solar gravity. (&quot;It should have been0.87, but arithmetic was never one of Einstein's strongpoints,&quot; writes Banesh Hoffman, a scientific collaborator ofEinstein's, in his 1972 biography of him.) Einstein, however,still thought in Newtonian terms of gravity being a force,and his calculations, if astronomers had been able to checkthem by observation, would have been found wrong, even asidefrom his arithmetical mistake. It would be four years beforehe developed his general theory of relativity and discoveredwhy his 1911 calculations were wrong.   But Einstein first had to grapple with a far differentproblem. Newtonians said the influence of gravity wasinstantaneous everywhere; if a star suddenly disappeared, thedisappearance of its gravity would be felt instantlythroughout the universe.   However, Einstein's special theory said nothing, evengravity, could travel faster than light. At first, theinconsistency frustrated him. In 1912, however, amathematician friend, Marcel Grossman, introduced him totensor calculus. After the two men sweated through thiscomplex mathematics, Einstein found the right equations in1915, and the general theory of relativity fell into place.Gravity, he concluded, wasn't a force of nature but ageometrical distortion in the fabric of space-time.   Although most people perceive the universe in threedimensions -- height, width and depth -- the mathematics thatEinstein used described a four-dimension universe, with timethe fourth dimension. In a four-dimension universe, any masscaused the fabric of the universe, of space-time, to curve.The curves bent into space-time affected the trajectories ofmoving matter.   Matter moving through the universe always follows theshortest distance between two points. In a flat universe,this is a straight line, but in a universe of curves, theshortest distance between two points is a curved line. Hence,the Earth and other planets circle the sun, not because thesun holds them on strings of gravity but because the sun'smass pulls a dimple into space-time and the planets followthe curved walls of the dimple.   Right off the bat, Einstein noted a phenomenon where thephysics of general relativity worked better than Newton'sdid. Ever since the mid-19th century, physicists andastronomers had been puzzled by Mercury's movement around thesun. Newtonian physics predicted that the point of Mercury'sclosest approach to the sun, its perihelion, would changeevery Mercurial year. Observations found that thegravitational pull from other planets was moving Mercury'sperihelion -- but a little bit more than Newtonian physicspredicted.   On that momentous day in Berlin in 1915, Einstein used hisnew general theory to calculate how much Mercury's perihelionwould change if space-time were curved. The answer exactlymatched the observations.   However, the real test of the general theory, as itemerged in 1915, came four years later. Einstein's theorypredicted that starlight grazing the sun would be bent by thesun's gravity more than Newtonian physics forecast. During a1919 eclipse, British astronomers found that the degree ofbending was exactly what Einstein predicted, a discovery thatmade headlines world-wide.   Since 1960, a dozen experiments have tested relativity.Radio transmissions from spacecraft sent to Mars, Venus andMercury have refined measurements of the bending of light bythe sun to within 0.1% from a possible 20% error in 1919.   Relativity got major support in 1974, Dr. Will says in hisbook. Astronomers discovered what appears to be two extremelydense stars rotating rapidly around each other and pulsingout a radio signal every 59 thousandths of a second. Thisrapidly rotating &quot;pulsar&quot; has the equivalent of a rapidlychanging perihelion. In less than three months, the pulsargave a far more accurate measure than Mercury does of howmuch this point of closest approach differed from thatforeseen in Newton's &quot;flat&quot; universe. And the difference waswhat Einstein's theory predicted.   Moreover, using the pulsar as a celestial clock,scientists confirmed the warping of time, predicted by thespecial theory of relativity, and the gravitationalstretching of light waves towards the color red, predicted bythe general theory.   Now, the pulsars are suggesting one more confirmation ofgeneral relativity. In 1916, Einstein described gravitationalwaves comparable to light waves and predicted that any objectthat emits gravitational waves would lose energy. In 1979, acentury after Einstein's birth, Joseph Taylor, the Universityof Massachusetts astronomer who, with a student, RussellHulse, discovered the pulsar, announced that the pulsar wasindeed slowing down at exactly the rate predicted byEinstein.   This report's hint that the pulsar was emitting gravitywaves set off a continuing search to detect such wavesrippling past the Earth from vibrations in distant space.Other experiments, Dr. Will says, also are in the wings. Oneis Stanford University's plan to put four super-precisegyroscopes into polar orbit in 1996. If general relativity iscorrect, the gyroscopes should change their angle relative todistant stars by a tiny fraction of a degree every year.   And more work remains to be done, of course. The generaltheory of relativity describes one force of nature -- gravity-- but doesn't incorporate the other natural forces such aselectromagnetism and the forces that hold atoms together.From the 1920s until his death in Princeton, N.J., in 1955,Einstein worked on theories that would incorporate the othernatural forces into his concept of gravity as a geometricalwarping of space-time. He never succeeded -- and no one elsehas, so far.   But that hardly detracts from Einstein's enormousachievements. &quot;What I find to be truly amazing,&quot; Dr. Willwrites, &quot;is that this theory of general relativity, inventedalmost out of pure thought, guided only by the principle ofequivalence and by Einstein's imagination . . ., turned outin the end to be so right.&quot;   ---                Pathfinder of the Universe                                                                                                          Albert Einstein, the physicist whose theories of time,motion and gravity changed humans' perception of theuniverse.
