L. 99-570).This legislation amended the FOIA to provide broader exemption protectionfor law enforcement information and modified the Act's fee and fee waiverprovisions. On June 24, 1987, GSA published a proposed rule revising itsFOIA regulations accordingly. The fee provisions conform to the uniformFOIA fee schedule and guidelines promulgated by OMB, 52 FR 10011-20 (March27, 1987). Fee waiver criteria are derived from the policy guidance issuedby the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987. Public comment was invited,with the comment period extending to July 24, 1987. A total of four commentswere received concerning the proposed regulations. Three comments camefrom organizations or individuals representing the media, and one camefrom an organization that monitors FOIA matters. A discussion of the commentsfollows.All of the commenters objected to certain definitions contained in andSection;105-60.305-1, especially the definitions for ``representative of the newsmedia'', including ``freelance journalist'' and ``news''; ``commercial-userequest'', and ``educational institution.'' These definitions were takenfrom the OMB fee guidelines which were made final only after a period ofpublic comment during which concerns such as those raised by these commenterswere considered. The statute specifically mandates that agencies followOMB guidelines in promulgating their own regulations. GSA believes thatthese definitions properly implement the statutory terms of the amendedAct.All four commenters objected to the fee waiver standards and language underandSection; 105-60.305-5. GSA's fee waiver regulations are derived from thepolicy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987. Specificconcerns raised are addressed by Justice in its notice of final rulemaking52 FR 33230-31 (September 2, 1987). GSA has reviewed the Department ofJustice's criteria independently and has determined that they are in compliancewith the statute and its requirements. Therefore, GSA does not believeit is necessary to revise this section.In connection with the above, GSA received a comment suggesting that agenciesestablish automatic fee waivers for certain categories of requesters_publicinterest organizations, scholars, and journalists. The agency declinesto do this, as GSA feels that each case must be decided on its merits underthe new law.In addition, one commenter criticized GSA for suspending time limits untilthe fee waiver issue is resolved. GSA has modified andSection; 105-60.305-5(b)so that it will begin processing a request if the requester guaranteespayment pending the outcome of the fee waiver decision.Several commenters objected to GSA requiring prepayment of fees of morethan $250. The amendments to the Act allow agencies to charge and collectadvance payments when ``the agency has determined that the fee will exceed$250.'' Thus, the agency firmly believes that its regulations are fullywithin the scope of the law. Moreover, the requirement that fees of morethan $250 be prepaid is intended to protect the Government from loss ofrevenue, as has occurred in the past. The agency has revised andSection;105-60.305-8, however, to offer the requester an opportunity to modifyhis or her request so as to lower the fee. Another commenter objected tocharging twice for the same search if prepayment is not received within30 days. GSA has deleted this provision. Another commenter questioned GSA'sauthority to modify or suspend FOIA time limits and recommended deletingthe third sentence of this section. GSA's requirement is taken directlyfrom OMB's guidelines and has not been changed.One commenter objected to GSA charging for review time where FOIA exemptionswould preclude releasing the material and urged that the agency deletethe last two sentences of andSection; 105-60.305-7(c). The amendments tothe Act allow agencies to charge for the time required to review a documentto determine if exemptions apply and whether it is releasable. Furthermore,this language is identical to that in OMB's guidelines; therefore, GSAdeclines to make these changes.One commenter objected to GSA's method of calculating the first two hoursof free computer search time. GSA's regulations are consistent with OMB'sguidelines on this matter.With regard to andSection; 105-60.305-12(e) on aggregating requests, onecommenter suggested that GSA incorporate OMB's wording concerning the prohibitionof aggregating requests on unrelated subjects. GSA has revised this sectionaccordingly.One commenter urged that a provision allowing the requester ``to conferwith agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meethis or her needs at a lower cost'' be included under the section on chargingfor unsuccessful searches. GSA has already taken this into considerationunder andSection; 105-60.305-12(d) and andSection; 105-60.305-8.One commenter objected to the agency taking time extensions for the purposesof consulting with submitters of information. These extensions are consistentwith court decisions and the intent of EO 12600, Predisclosure NotificationProcedures for Confidential Commercial Information, of June 25, 1987. Hence,GSA does not feel that it is appropriate or proper to delete paragraph(4) from the list of circumstances under which a time extension may begranted (see andSection; 105-60.404(a)).It has always been GSA's policy to refer records which are the primaryresponsibility for another agency to that agency for releasability. Onecommenter objected to this procedure stating that records held from otheragencies could probably be released. GSA believes that this is a falseassumption and does not intend to change this procedure.The regulations are revised to:(a) Update organizational references and eliminate those sections whichare the responsibility of the National Archives and Records Administration;(b) Add various definitions which are to be applied when setting the feesfor records requested under the FOIA;(c) Establish four categories of requesters and specific levels of feesfor each of these categories;(d) Allow GSA to charge a commercial-use requester for the time spent inreviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from disclosure;(e) Increase the fees for manual searches based on the class and averagegrade of the employee(s) performing the search;(f) Provide that requesters subject to search fees, with the exceptionof commercial-use requesters, not be charged for the first 2 hours of searchtime;(g) Raise the dollar amount for which there will be no charge from $5 to$10 and, with certain exceptions, the prepayment threshold from $10 to$250;(h) Eliminate search fees for educational and noncommercial scientificinstitutions;(i) Revise and clarify the general fee waiver standard; (j) Add several administrative actions which GSA may take to improve theassessment and collection of fees; and(k) Revise exemption 7 in accordance with the new statutory language concerningprotection of law enforcement records and activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 105-60</ITAG>Freedom of information. 41 CFR Part 105-60 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 105-60 PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF AGENCY RECORDS AND INFORMATIONALMATERIALS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.000  Scope of part.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 105-60.1_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.101 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.102 Application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.103 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.103-1 Availability of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.103-2 Applying exemptions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.104 Records of other agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.105 Inconsistent directives of GSA superseded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart 105-60.2_Publication of General Agency Information and Rulesin the Federal Register</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.201 Published information and rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.202 Published materials available for sale to the public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart 105-60.3_Availability of Opinions, Orders, Policies, Interpretations,Manuals, and Instructions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.301 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.302 Available materials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.303 Rules for public inspection and copying.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.304 Index.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305 Fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-2 Scope of section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-3 Record material available without charge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-4 Copy of GSA records available at a fee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-5 Waiver of fee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-6 Searches.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-7 Reviews.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-8 Prepayment of fees over $250.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-9 Form of payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-10 Fee schedule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-11 Fees for authenticated and attested copies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.305-12 Administrative actions to improve assessment and collectionof fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 105-60.4_Described Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.401 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.402 Procedures for making records available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.402-1 Submission of requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.402-2 Response to initial requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.403 Appeal within GSA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.404 Extension of time limits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 105-60.5_Exemptions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.501 Categories or records exempt from disclosure under theFOIA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 105-60.6_Subpoenas or Other Legal Demands for Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">105-60.601 Service of subpoena or other legal demand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 205(c) of the Federal Property and AdministrativeServices Act of 1949, as amended, 63 Stat. 390, 40 U.S.C. 486(c); and 5U.S.C. 552 (Pub.

Direct costsinclude, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (thebasic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to coverbenefits), and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not includedin direct cost are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heatingor lighting the facility where the records are stored.(c) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request, including line-by-line identification of materialwithin documents. Searches will be performed in the most efficient andleast expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency andthe requester. Line-by-line searches will not be undertaken when it wouldbe more efficient to duplicate the entire document. Such activity willbe distinguished from ``review'' of material in determining whether thematerial is exempt from disclosure (see subparagraph e, below). Searchesmay be done manually or by computer using existing programming.(d) The term ``duplication'' refers to the process of making a copy ofa document in response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the formof paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation.GSA will provide a copy of the material in a form that is usable by therequester unless it is administratively burdensome to do so.(e) The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining documents locatedin response to request that is for commercial use (see paragraph (f) ofthis section) to determine if any portion of that document is permittedto be withheld and processing any documents for disclosure. See andSection;105-60.305-7.(f) The term ``commercial-use request'' refers to a request from or onbehalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthersthe commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person onwhose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properlybelongs in this category, GSA will look first at how the requester willuse the documents.(g) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate highereducation, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, and an institution of vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.(h) The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (f) of this section and which is operated solely for the purposeof conducting scientific research the results of which are not intendedto promote any particular product or industry.(i) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means informationthat is about current events or that would be of current interest to thepublic. Examples of news media include television or radio stations broadcastingto the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in thoseinstances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who maketheir products available for purchase or subscription by the general public.In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they may be regarded as workingfor a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expectingpublication through that organization, even though not actually employedby it.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope of section.</ITAG>This section sets forth policies and procedures to be followed in the assessmentand collection of fees from a requester for the search, review, and reproductionof GSA records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Record material available without charge.</ITAG>GSA records available to the public are displayed in the business servicecenter for that region.

In responding to a request GSA will consider the followingfactors:(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the operationsor activities of the Government.'' The subject matter of the requestedrecords must specifically concern identifiable operations or activitiesof the Federal Government_with a connection between them that is directand clear, not remote or attenuated.(2) Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understandingof Government operations or activities. In this connection, GSA shouldconsider whether the requested information is already in the public domain,either in a duplicative or a substantially identical form. If it is, thendisclosure of the information would not be likely to contribute to an understandingof Government operations or activities, as nothing new would be added tothe public record.(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to``public understanding.'' The focus here must be on the contribution topublic understanding, rather than personal benefit to be derived by therequester. For purposes of this analysis, the identity and qualificationsof the requester should be considered, to determine whether the requesteris in a position to contribute to public understanding through the requesteddisclosure.(4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furtheredby the requested disclosure; and if so(5) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of therequester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interestin disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interestof the requester.''(b) If the initial request provides insufficient information for the agencyto evaluate the request, GSA may ask the requester to furnish additionalinformation. GSA will not start processing a request until the fee waiverissue has been resolved, unless the requester has provided written assuranceof payment in full if the fee waiver is denied by the agency.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Searches.</ITAG>(a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in determining``search time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in andSection; 105-60.305-10:(1) Time spent in trying to locate GSA records which come within the scopeof the request;(2) Time spent in either transporting a necessary agency searcher to aplace of record storage, or in transporting records to the locations ofa necessary agency searcher; and(3) Direct costs involving the use of computer time to locate and extractrequested records.(b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in monitoring a requester'sinspection of disclosed agency records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reviews.</ITAG>(a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in determining``review time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in andSection; 105-60.305-10:(1) Time spent in examining a requested record to determine whether therecord is permitted to be withheld in whole or in part; and (2) Time spent in deleting exempt matter being withheld from records otherwisemade available.(b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in resolving issues of law orpolicy regarding the application of exemptions.(c) GSA may not charge for review at the administrative appeal level ofan exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheldin full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to applymay be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptionsnot previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review wouldbe properly assessable.

When the anticipated total fee exceeds$250, the requester will receive notice to prepay and at the same timewill be given an opportunity to modify his or her request to reduce thefee. GSA will also inform the requester that fees for search time willbe charged even if the search proves unsuccessful.

There are four categories of requesters:Commercial-use; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions;news media; and all other. The fees listed above apply with the followingexceptions:(1) GSA will not charge the requester if the fee is $10 or less as thecost of collection would be greater than the fee.(2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and the newsmedia will be charged for the cost of reproduction alone. These requestersare entitled to the first 100 pages (paper copies) of duplication at nocost. The following are examples of how these fees are calculated.(i) A request that results in 150 pages of material. No fee would be assessedfor duplication of 150 pages. The reason is that these requesters are entitledto the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge for the remaining 50 pageswould be $5. This amount would not be billed under the preceding section.(ii) A request that results in 250 pages of material. The requester inthis case would be charged $15.(3) Noncommercial requesters who are not included under (2), above, willbe entitled to the first 100 pages (paper copies) of duplication at nocost and 2 hours of search without charge. The term ``search time'' inthis context has as its basis, manual search. To apply this term to searchesmade by computer, GSA will determine the hourly cost of operating the centralprocessing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. Whenthe cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operatingthe computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amountof two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., theoperator, GSA will begin assessing charges for computer search.(4) GSA will charge commercial-use requesters fees which recover the fulldirect costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating therecords sought. Commercial-use requesters are not entitled to 2 hours offree search time.(e) Determining category of requester. GSA may ask the requester to provideadditional information at any time to determine what fee category he orshe falls under. This applies to all requesters.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees for authenticated and attested copies.</ITAG>The fees set forth in andSection; 105-60.305-10 apply to requests for authenticatedand attested copies of GSA records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.305-12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administrative actions to improve assessment and collection of fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Charging interest.</T3> GSA may charge requesters who fail to pay feesinterest on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following the dayon which the billing was sent.

L. 97-365),including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, use of collectionagencies, and assessment of penalties and administrative costs, where appropriate,to encourage payment.(c) <T3>Charges for unsuccessful search.</T3> The agency may assess chargesfor time spent searching for the records even if the agency fails to locatethe records or if the records located are exempt from disclosure.(d) <T3>Notifying requester of charges over $25.</T3> If charges are likelyto exceed $25, GSA will notify the requester and obtain, in writing, assuranceof the requester's willingness to pay the estimated fee. The requestershall also be offered an opportunity to modify his or her request to reducethe fee. GSA will not start processing the request until assurance of paymentis received.(e) <T3>Aggregating requests.</T3> When the agency reasonably believes thata requester, or group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting tobreak a request down into a series of requests related to the same subjectfor the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, GSA will combine anysuch requests and charge accordingly, including fees for previous requestswhere charges were not assessed. GSA will presume that multiple requestsof this type made within a 30-day period are made to avoid fees.(f) <T3>Advance payments.</T3> (1) See andSection; 105-60.305-8 regarding prepaymentof fees for FOIA requests.(2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timelyfashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), GSA will requirethe requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interestpenalties and administrative costs as provided above, or demonstrate thathe or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment ofthe full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to processa new request or a pending request from that requester.(3) If GSA acts under paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section, the administrativetime limits in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days fromreceipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appealsform initial denial plus permissible time extensions) will begin only afterit has received the fee payments described above.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 105-60.4_Described Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 105-60.401 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>(a) Except for records made available in accordance with Subparts 105-60.2and 105-60.3, GSA will make records available to a requester promptly whenthe request reasonably describes the records unless GSA invokes an exemptionin accordance with Subpart 105-60.5.
