Iran and the kingdom are engaged in a war of words over theIranian quota for the annual Hajj in July, when Moslems from aroundthe world converge on Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage to Islam'sholiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran wasangry because Saudi Arabia was adhering to a quota system initiatedlast year. They said Iran might boycott the pilgrimage, as it didlast year.   The Iranian daily Jomhuri reported Monday that differences hadalmost been resolved when ``the Saudis rejected all previousagreements and started everything anew,'' Iran's official IslamicRepublic News Agency said.   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the paper as blaming the Saudiroyal family. One group within the family was adamant that Iraniannumbers be limited, the report said.   In April 1988, Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic ties with Iran. Itcited demonstrations by Iranian pilgrims during the Hajj season of1987 in which clashes with Saudi police left 402 people dead. Italso noted Iran's repeated attacks on Persian Gulf shipping lanesduring the Iran-Iraq war.   Saudi Arabia last year started limiting each country to 1,000pilgrims per million of population.   The invitation to Iran for the fourth conference of Islamicministers of endowments and religious affairs was issued after Irantook part in an Islamic foreign ministers' conference in SaudiArabia in March.   Relations at that conference of the 46-member Organization ofIslamic Conference were cordial.   A major item on the agenda of the coming four-day conferencewill be coordination and cooperation among Islamic states in``confronting atheistic destructive trends and distortion campaignsby enemies of the Islamic faith.''   All majority Sunni and minority Shiite sects among the world's 1billion Moslems participate in Islamic meetings.   But Iran, the only nation with an overwhelming Shiite majority,stayed away from such meetings after the war with Iraq started inSeptember 1980. Hostilities ended with a cease-fire last summer.</TEXT></DOC>
