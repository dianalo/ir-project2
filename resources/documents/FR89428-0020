The disease is caused by afungus which reduces the quality and yield of wheat, oats, barley, andrye crops by robbing host plants of food and water. The fungus lives ona variety of host plants that are species of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia, </T3>and can spread from host-to-host by way of wind-bornespores. In the northern small grain producing states, the black stem rust organismoverwinters on wild grasses, grain stubble, and in straw piles. The organismcannot attack small grains in this stage, but will infect <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants in the spring. The spores that are subsequentlyproduced on the plants' leaves can spread the disease to nearby grain fields.The cooperative federal-state black stem rust program was initiated in1918. The program's long range strategy has been to reduce the incidenceof black stem rust disease by: (1) Eradicating <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants growing in small grain producing areas; (2) Developing varieties of small grains that will not be seriously damagedif infected with black stem rust disease; and  (3) Regulating the interstate movement of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants and plant parts.Two of these goals have been accomplished. Approximately 98 percent ofthe wild growing <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants had been eliminated from small grain producingareas when the eradication phase of the cooperative program officiallyended in 1981. Research efforts have also been successful_virtually allof the small grain varieties grown in the United States today are completely,or almost completely, impervious to damage from existing races of blackstem rust. These advances have minimized crop damage from black stem rustdisease.<ITAG tagnum="84">Resistance, Susceptibility, and Hybridization</ITAG>Plant species of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>are categorized as being either rust-resistant or rust-susceptible.1. <T3>Rust-resistant. </T3>For reasons as yet unknown, the black stem rustorganism cannot develop a sexual stage when living on rust-resistant plantspecies. In these circumstances, the black stem rust organism is ``deadended,''since it cannot spread to other hosts. More than 90 species and varietiesof the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>have been tested and found resistant to black stem rust.2. <T3>Rust-susceptible. </T3>Black stem rust organism living on rust susceptibleplants of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>will reach the sexual stage, reproduce, and spread. Currentlysmall grain varieties are resistant to existing races of black stem rust.However, during the sexual stage, spores from different black stem rustorganisms may combine to produce entirely new, hybird races of black stemrust. For example, 43 different races of black stem rust were isolatedfrom a single spread of rust from barberry, a plant of the <T3>Berberis </T3>genus, to nearby wheat fields.  The primary threat to the continued success of the cooperative federal-stateblack stem rust program comes from the black stem rust organism's abilityto hybridize on rust-susceptible plant hosts. Hybrid black stem rust racesare genetically unpredictable. A hybird could be produced with the abilityto successfully attack grain varieties that are not harmed by the ``parenting''black stem rust races.The cooperative federal-state black stem rust program's successful eradicationphase eliminated wild-growing plants of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>as a possible source of hybridization in northern grain-producingareas. However, commercial nurseries continue to propagate and extensivelydistribute rust-resistant varieties of barberry and other host speciesof <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>throughout the northern states, where they are extremelypopular for landscape and hedge use.<ITAG tagnum="84">Current Regulations</ITAG>The current regulations restrict the interstate movement of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants and plant parts in order to prevent dispersionof rust-susceptible plants. These provisions were written during the pre-1981eradication phase of the program, however, and do not reflect current conditionsand programs needs. The current regulations quarantine all states within the conterminous UnitedStates and the District of Columbia. Those states, or portions of states,that have adopted and are enforcing procedures to eradicate rust-susceptible<T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plants are designated ``eradication areas.'' All plants,seeds, fruits, and other parts of plants, capable of propagation, and whichbelong in the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>except <T3>Mahonia </T3>cuttings for decorative purposes, are designated as regulatedarticles. Certain interstate movement of rust-resistant plant and plantparts of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>is allowed under the conditions set forth in the regulations.Certification or issuance of a permit is usually a prerequisite. Interstatemovement of rust-susceptible plants and plant parts of these genera isprohibited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Organizational Changes</ITAG>The following tables represent an overview of the organizational changescontained in our proposal. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s20,xs56</C><T4>Distribution Table</T4><H1>Current</H1><H1>Proposed</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38(a) <D>301.38 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38(b) <D>301.38-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-1 <D>301.38-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 1 <D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 2 <D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-2 <D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-2a <D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38.3 <D>301.38-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 3 <D>301.38-5(b)(2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-4 <D>301.38-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-5 <D>301.38-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-6 <D>301.38-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-7 <D>301.38-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-8 <D>Footnote 1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-9 <D>Footnote 2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-10 <D>301.38-8</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s20,xs72</C><T4>Derivation Table</T4><H1>Proposed</H1><H1>Currentd</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38 <D>301.38(a), (b)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 1 <D>301.38-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-2 <D>301.38-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-2 <D>301.38(b)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 2 <D>301.38-9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-3 [new] <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 3 [new] <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-4 <D>301.38-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-5 <D>301.38-4; 301.38-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 4 [new] <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-6 <D>301.38-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Footnote 5 <D>301.38-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-7 <D>301.38-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">301.38-8 <D>301.38-10</D></ITAG></ITAG> The following paragraphs describe the substantive ways in which the currentregulations would be revised under our proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of ``Eradication Areas.''</ITAG>We propose to delete the eradication area provisions (current andSection;andSection;301.38-2 and 301.38-2a) from the regulations. The term ``eradication area''is no longer applicable since all federal eradication operations were discontinuedin 1981, when the eradication areas assumed responsibility for nurseryinspections.<ITAG tagnum="84">Addition of ``Protected Areas.''</ITAG> We propose to add new provisions to the regulations authorizing the Administratorto designate as a ``protected area'' any state or county using the followingcriteria:1. The state has eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera <T3>Berberis, </T3><T3>Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia</T3> under the cooperative Federal-State eradication programand maintains and enforces an inspection program under which all plantnurseries within the state are inspected at least one every year to ensurethat plant nurseries are free of rust-susceptible plants.2. The county is in a state which has eradicated rust-susceptible plantsof the genera <T3>Berberis, </T3><T3>Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia</T3> from specific areas under the cooperative federal-stateeradication program and intrastate movements are restricted in a mannerequivalent to those we are proposing to impose on interstate movements.In addition, the state must maintain and enforce an inspection programunder which all plant nurseries within the proposed area are inspectedat least once every year to ensure that they are free of rust-susceptibleplants.These areas would be those presently designated as ``eradication areas''under the current regulations that maintain the necessary inspection programsand intrastate movement regulations. In addition, a county located in astate containing eradication areas under the current regulations wouldalso be eligible for designation as a protected area if the proposed criteriaare satisfied. 3. For a state to qualify as a protected area, or for any county withina state to so qualify, the state must employ personnel having responsibilityfor the issuance of the certificates required for interstate movement ofregulated articles, in accordance with proposed andSection; 301.38-5, inaddition to conducting the required nursery inspections. The state mustannually submit a written statement to the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS), signed by an inspector, starting that the inspectionshave been conducted in accordance with the regulations. This statementwould be required before January 1st of each year so that APHIS has thenecessary assurances before the shipping season, which usually begins inMarch. We would require in the statement a list of the nurseries inspectedand found free of rust-susceptible plants. Those nurseries would be theonly ones eligible to ship rust-resistant <T3>Berberis, </T3><T3>Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia.</T3>During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock would be examinedby an inspector. Any variety or species of plant or plant part of the genera<T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mohonia </T3>that is not a rust-resistant variety and true to typewould be destroyed. The inspector would also have to verify, by visualinspection, that no wild or domesticated rust-susceptible plants are growingwithin one-half mile of any nursery growing any rust-resistant plants of<T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>from seed, since hybridization could occur and may resultin germination of new rust-susceptible varieties near the nursery. It isknown that the wind can carry seeds of regulated plants up to one-quartermile. One-half mile is being proposed to add a margin of safety.The visual inspection would be performed by inspectors, working side byside, 10 to 20 feet apart, who would walk the half mile distance measuredfrom the edge of the nursery so that they could observe all plant growthin the half-mile band. The distance between the inspectors would dependupon the ease and range of visibility of plant growth. In areas with lowbrush and flat terrain, the inspectors could be the maximum distance of20 feet apart because they could observe plants growing within 10 feetof them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrian the inspectorswould have to be closer together since their range of visibility wouldbe shorter. This procedure must be repeated so that the entire half mileband, measured from the border of the nursery to the circumference of animaginary circle having the nursery as its mid-point, is visually inspected.The proposed protected area classification would serve two purposes. First,it would augment existing state efforts to prevent the introduction orre-introduction of black stem rust by prohibiting the movement of rust-susceptibleplants into the state. Second, it would be self-policing, in effect, byrequiring yearly inspection of nurseries and surrounding areas in orderfor states and counties to retain their protected status under the regulations.A list of those states and counties that the Administrator proposes todesignate as protected areas are listed in proposed andSection; 301.38-3(c).Under our proposal, the following states would meet the criteria to bedesignated as protected areas based upon their current status as eradicationareas under andSection; 301.38-2a and participation in cooperative federal-stateblack stem rust eradication efforts:<ITAG tagnum="21">Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, West Virginia,and Wisconsin.</ITAG>We are proposing to include the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in its entiretybecause we believe that Philadelphia and Delaware Counties in that statealso meet the crietia to be designated as protected areas although theyare not eradication areas under the current regulations.The following counties in the State of Washington would meet the criteriato be designated as protected areas:<ITAG tagnum="21">Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin,Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille,Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Protected Area Status</ITAG>Under our proposal, the Administrator could determine that a state or county's``protected area'' designation should be removed if he or she finds thatit no longer meets the criteria. A hearing would be held to resolve anyconflict as to any material fact in accordance with rules of practice adoptedby the Administrator for the proceeding. If, after opportunity for a hearing,the Administrator finds that removal of protected status is appropriate,we would publish a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Agency's final action on the matter wouldbe published in a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> after notice and an opportunity for public comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions For Interstate Movement of Regulated Articles</ITAG>We propose to revise the conditions governing interstate movement of regulatedarticles (currently contained in andSection;301.38-3) as follows:1. The quarantine of the conterminous 48 states and the District of Columbiawould continue in effect, however, all current requirements relating tointerstate movement to, from, or between eradication areas would be deleted.2. Interstate movement of all <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia</T3> plants and plant parts would be allowed without restrictioninto or through any state or county not designated as a protected area.This is because movement restrictions are effective only in those areaswhere a nursery inspection program exists to protect against interestate,as well as intrastate, dispersal of rust-susceptible host plants throughthe commercial nursery trade. Rust-susceptible host plants were eradicatedduring the eradication phase of the cooperative program, however, nurseriescontinue to grow new varieties of barberry from seed, which, due to hybridization,may not be rust-resistant. We believe that nurseries alone grow new varietiesof barberry from seed. Therefore, the inspection program would assure thatany rust-susceptible varieties that may be developed are detected and destroyed.3. Interstate movement of rust-suseceptible <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia</T3> plants and plant parts, into or through protected areas,would be prohibited (except under the narrow circumstances where a limitedpermit has been issued). Interstate movement of <T3>all Berberis</T3> seedlings and plants of less than 2 years' growthinto or through protected areas would also be prohibited because it isnot possible to identify whether their species is rust-resistant or rust-susceptibleuntil it has 2 years' growth. This would prevent contamination or re-infestationof nursery stock by rust-susceptible varieties from outside the protectedarea.4. Interstate movement of rust-resistant <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia</T3> plants and plant parts, into or through protected areas,would be allowed if accompanied by a certificate issued and attached inaccordance with the regulations. The certificate would verify to protectedareas that the plants are rust resistant and do not present any risk ofspreading black stem rust.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Rust-Resistant Plants</ITAG>We propose to include in the regulations a list of all of the species andhorticultural varieties of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia</T3> that have been tested and determined resistant to blackstem rust. The test is conducted by the Agricultural Research Service ofthe United States Department of Agriculture at its Cereal Rust Laboratoryin St. Paul, Minnesota. The test is performed in the following manner:In a greenhouse, the suspect plant or test subject is placed under a screenwith a control plant_a known rust-susceptible variety of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> or <T3>Mahonia.</T3> Infected wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust,are placed on top of the screen. The plants are moistened and maintainedin 100% humidity. This causes the spores to swell and fall on the plantslying under the screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at 20-80%relative humidity. If the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infectionafter 7 days and the test plants do not, the test results indicate thatthe test plants are rust-resistant. This test must be performed 12 timesand all 12 tests must yield the same result, before USDA can make a determinationas to whether the test plant variety is rust-resistant. The test may beconducted on 12 individual plants, or it may be performed multiple timeson fewer plants, <T3>e.g.,</T3> 6 plants tested twice or 3 plants tested 4 times. Basedupon 30 years of experience with this test, we believe that 12 is the reliabletest sample size on which USDA can make its determination. We do not knowof any plant which was subsequently discovered to be rust-susceptible afterundergoing this procedure 12 times and determined by USDA to be rust-resistant.The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves are unfolding.Therefore, the tests are usually conducted in the spring or fall, duringthe growing season. All 12 tests generally cannot be conducted on the sameday because of the plants' different growth stage.Any person seeking to move plants or plant parts of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and <T3>Mahonia,</T3> except <T3>Mahonia</T3> cuttings used for decorative purposes, into or througha protected area must know whether they are rust-resistant or rust-susceptible.<T3>Mahonia</T3> cuttings used for decorative purposes do not produce anypropagative material and therefore would not be included as regulated articlesunder this subpart.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Certain Permit Provisions</ITAG>We propose to remove the definitions of ``restricted destination permit''and ``scientific permit'' from current andSection;308-1, and all referenceto them in the regulations, as revised, because there is no need for them.Currently, andSection;301.38-4 provides for the issuance, by an inspector,or permits authorizing restricted interstate movement of regulated articlesnot eligible for movement under the Black Stem Rust regulations or otherFederal domestic plant quarantines because of possible pest risk. It alsoprovides for issuance of scientific permits authorizing interstate movementof regulated articles under prescribed conditions.We would continue to authorize issuance of ``limited permits'' to allowregulated articles to move into or through protected areas to a destinationoutside the protected area, without a certificate, under conditions thatensure against contamination by or re-introduction of host plants. Witha limited permit, regulated articles that are ineligible for certificationunder the regulations could move into or through a protected area if theyare placed in a closed sealed container that prevents the unauthorizedremoval of the regulated articles and that is kept sealed until the regulatedarticles reach the final destination stated in the permit. At the finaldestination, the sealed container must be opened either in the presenceof an inspector or with an inspector's authorization obtained expresslyfor that shipment.The Department of Agriculture no longer issues scientific permits. Instead,Departmental permits are available for movement of a regulated articlefor scientific or experimental purposes under the conditions specifiedon the permit. We are proposing to add a definition of ``Departmental permit.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Certificates and Compliance Agreements</ITAG>The current regulations contain provisions for issuance and withdrawalof the certificates required for interstate movement of regulated articles,and for entry into and withdrawal of a compliance agreement between APHISand a person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulatedarticles.Under our proposal, protected areas would be responsible for issuance ofthe certificates necessary for interstate movement of regulated articles.A person who seeks to move interstate a regulated article would obtainthe required certificate from an inspector. A state that is designateda protected area or which encompasses a protected area may enter into acompliance agreement with a person who seeks to move regulated articlesinterstate to facilitate inspections and issuance of certificates. Thestate would be responsible for enforcement of compliance agreements andthe proper use of certificates. In non-protected areas, persons seekingto move regulated articles interstate would obtain certificates from aninspector and may enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS, as underthe current regulations.A person who enters into a compliance agreement with APHIS or with a statewould, by entering into the agreement, agree to comply with the provisionsof this subpart, to provide inspectors and state or county plant regulatoryofficials with information concerning the source of any regulated articlesacquired each year, and to prevent the unauthorized use of certificatesissued for future use under the compliance agreement.Additionally, any state that enters into a compliance agreement or thathas issued a certificate for movement of regulated articles must providea hearing as a means of resolving conflicts as to any material fact betweenthe protected area and the person with whom it has entered into a complianceagreement or to whom it has issued a certificate, in connection with thecancellation of the compliance agreement or the withdrawal of the certificate.We are proposing conforming changes and nonsubstantive changes for purposesof clarity. In addition, the following time limitations would apply tothe withdrawal of any certificate issued by an inspector and to the cancellationof a compliance agreement: Receipt of a written confirmation and explanationof an oral withdrawal (20 days), an appeal by the holder of a withdrawncertificate or cancelled compliance agreement (10 days), followed by ahearing on an appeal if there is a conflict as to any material fact. Inprotected areas, the appeal must be granted or denied, in writing, as promptlyas circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision must be stated.In non-protected areas, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal,in writing, stating the reasons for the decision, as promptly as circumstancesallow.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assembly and Inspection of Regulated Articles</ITAG>Under the current regulations, persons who must obtain a certificate tomove regulated articles interstate must request that an inspector examinethe regulated articles ``as far in advance as possible.'' We believe itis reasonable to require that requests be made to state or county plantregulatory officials and inspectors no less than 48 hours before the desiredinterstate movement, in order to permit them to arrange their schedulesaccordingly.In the proposed rule, these requirements would be included with the provisionsfor issuance and cancellation of certificates, because they are a prerequisiteto issuance.The proposed rule would provide that to assist a person requesting a certificate,an inspector may direct that the regulated articles be assembled in a certainmanner by that person in order to facilitate the inspection. Allowing aninspector to determine how he or she may best complete inspection of theregulated articles would assist the person who is requesting a certificatesince it could be issued faster. If that person does not wish to arrangethe regulated articles in the manner suggested by the inspector he or sheneed not do so, however, this may result in the inspector requiring a longertime to examine the regulated articles proposed for interstate movement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Costs and Charges</ITAG>The current regulations contain a disclaimer by the Department for costsother than for the services of an inspector. We propose to clarify thisprovision by specifying that the services of an inspector ``during normalbusiness hours'' will be furnished without cost to persons requiring theservices. Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30p.m.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>We propose to add definitions for the terms ``Administrator,'' ``Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service,'' ``Departmental permit,'' ``Protectedarea,'' and ``Rust-susceptible plants'' in order to clarify the use ofthese terms in the regulations. In addition to removing the terms ``Eradicatioarea,'' ``Restricted destination permit,'' and ``Scientific permit,'' asexplained above, we propose to delete the following terms and definitions:1. ``Deputy Administrator''_Due to organizational and policy changes, theterm ``Administrator'' is used in place of ``Deputy Administrator'' whereverit appears;2. ``One year's growth''_The origins of this phrase are unknown. The phraseis neither used in the current regulations nor included in our proposedrevision; and3. ``Treatment manual''_Chemical agents were used to eliminate wild growingplant hosts of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>during the eradication phase of the black stem rust program,but have not been applied since 1981.Due to organizational and policy changes, we would remove reference to``Plant Protection and Quarantine'' wherever it appears, and refer insteadto ``Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.'' The definition of ``Inspector''would also be modified to conform with organizational and policy changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>For purposes of clarity, we propose to make certain nonsubstantive changesin the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Existing Regulations</ITAG>This proposed rule is part of the scheduled review of Subpart-Black StemRust, to meet regulatory review requirements. Executive Order 12291 andDepartment Regulation 1512-1 require that agencies initiate reviews ofcurrently effective rules to bring about the goal of reduction of regulatoryburdens and to minimize impacts on small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The primary impact of our proposed regulatory changes will be on nurserygrowers of plants of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia. </T3>Under our proposal, federal restrictions on interstatemovements of these plants and plant parts would be limited to a protectedarea that includes only 15 states and part of a sixteenth. The substantiveinterstate movement restrictions applicable to growers within this protectedarea would not change, in effect, from those of the current regulations,therefore, they will not be affected by the proposed revision of the regulations.Potential benefits from the revision may accrue, however, to nursery growersin the non-protected areas. Under our proposal, these growers would beable to sell and transport interstate all varieties of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>within the non-protected area without certification orinspection requirements. Under the current regulations, sales of rust-susceptiblevarieties in non-eradication areas are limited to intrastate transactions.Secondly, under our proposal, persons growing new varieties of <T3>Berberis </T3>in the non-protected area would no longer have to waitfor the two-year period necessary to determine rust-susceptibility, aslong as the new varieties are moved only in the non-protected area. Thiswould relieve certain growers from the monetary losses resulting from developingnew hybrids which are subsequently found to be rust-susceptible, and thereforemay only be sold intrastate in non-eradication areas under the existingregulations.Based upon Small Business Administration (SBA) statistics and the 1982Census of Agriculture statistics, the most recent statistics availableto us, we estimate that 71 percent of the 13,217 growers of nursery productsin the United States (9,384), would be in the non-protected areas, andthat 29 percent (3,833) would be in the protected areas. Our projectionsindicate that of this total, 96 percent are small businesses, as classifiedby the SBA in its Standards (those with $500,000-or-less in annual receipts).The number of small nursery growers dealing in plants of the restrictedgenera and the proportion of their revenues derived from such plants areunkown, however, due to the absence of specific data. Nevertheless, webelieve that because of current restrictions on the interstate movementof rust-susceptible varieties, most growers of nursery products grow rust-resistantvarieties primarily, so that they can sell them to a broader market andship interstate.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>Dr. James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that this rulemaking proceeding should be expeditedby allowing a 15-day comment period on this proposal. This comment periodwould allow the Agency to promulgate and implement a final rule on an expeditedbasis. Earlier implementation of a final rule would allow nursery growersto move interstate, in non-protected areas, rust-susceptible plant varietiesduring the spring 1989 shipping season without presenting a plant healthrisk. As explained in the preceding Supplementary Information, we believethe current restriction on this interstate movement is no longer necessaryand can be removed from the regulations. Accordingly, good cause existsto expedite this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
