Provisions of the EndangeredSpecies Act Amendments of 1982 required that such petitions pending onthe date of enactment of the Amendments be treated as having been filedon that date, i.e. October 13, 1982. Section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act requiresthat any petition for which a 12-month finding of ``warranted but precluded''is made should be treated as having been resubmitted on the date of sucha finding, with substantial scientific or commercial information that thepetitioned action may be warranted, thereby requiring an additional findingto be made within 12 months. This notice reports findings made on or beforeOctober 14, 1987, in respect to pending petitions for which such additionalfindings were due, and describes the Service's progress in revising theLists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants during the fifthyear following the enactment of the 1982 Amendments.All but one of the plant species involved in these petition findings werelisted individually in a comprehensive notice of review for plants firstpublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), and mostrecently updated as a notice of review published September 27, 1985 (50FR 39526). The animal species mentioned below, but not named individually,were identified individually in the first announcement of 12-month petitionfindings published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485), and again inthe second annual announcement published on May 10, 1985 (50 FR 19761).<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings</ITAG>Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the Service make one of thefollowing 12-month findings on each petition presenting substantial information:(i) The petitioned action is not warranted; (ii) the petitioned actionis warranted and will be proposed promptly; or (iii) the petitioned actionis warranted but precluded by other efforts to revise the lists, and expeditiousprogress is being made in listing and delisting species. Petitioned actionsfound to be warranted are the subjects of proposals that will be publishedpromptly or have already been published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Therefore only findings of ``not warranted''and ``warranted but precluded'' for pending petitions are reported here.``Not warranted'' and ``warranted but precluded'' findings for pendingplant petitions repeat the findings made in October 1986 and announcedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for June 30, 1987 (52 FR 24312), except for theremoval of 24 plant species proposed for listing as threatened or endangeredduring fiscal 1987. Findings on the plants are made by notice of reviewcategories; application of these to individual taxa is published in a noticeof review for plants published September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Tfhe plantnotice category number opposite the name of each taxon that is the subjectof a pending petition indicates the Service's finding on that taxon. Findingsof ``not warranted'' on the petitioned action are reported by the designationof subcategories 3A, 3B, or 3C for such taxa. Findings of ``warranted butprecluded'' are reported by the designation of category 1,1*,1**,2, 2*,or 2** for subject taxa. The complete definitions of these category numbersare described on pages 39526 and 39527 in the 1985 general plant noticeof review (50 FR 39526). A finding of ``warranted but precluded'' was alsomade for a petition to list the plant <T3>Talinum humile </T3>(the Pinos Altos fame flower) received October15, 1985, from Mr. Paul R. Neal. This plant is being treated as a category2 candidate species.The Service's 12-month findings of ``not warranted'' and ``warranted butprecluded'' on pending animal petitions are presented in Table 1. Eachpetition mentioned in Table 1 has had one or more previous findings of``warranted but precluded'' reported in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The initial (90-day) findings for petitionslisted in Table 1 were announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), January 16,1984 (49 FR 1919), December 18, 1984 (49 FR 49118), April 2, 1985 (50 FR13054), July 5, 1985 (50 FR 27637), August 30, 1985 (50 FR 35272), or May2, 1986 (51 FR 16363). The word ``Yes'' in the ``Warranted?'' colum of Table 1 indicates petitionsto list, delist, or reclassify species for which the principal findingsare ``warranted but precluded'' from immediate proposal by other effortsto revise the lists. Note in the ``Description'' column that at least somespecies mentioned in the original petitions have been individually foundto be warranted. The species so noted were named in previous notices ofpetition findings. Three of the species (noted by the word ``No'' in the``Warranted'' column) have new 1987 findings of ``not warranted'' announcedhere.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Twelve-Month Findings on Pending Animal Petitions</T4><H1>Description</H1><H1>Petitioner</H1><H1>Date received</H1><H1>Warranted? \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">5 species of sponges (2 others not warranted)<D>Mr. Ronald M.

TheService was requested by the Governor of Guam to list the Guam rufous-frontedfantail, <T3>Rhipidura rufifrons uraniae, </T3> in a petition received by the ServiceDecember 23, 1981. Repeated efforts to locate the species subsequentlyhave been unsuccessful, and the accumulated evidence has reached the pointat which the Service considers this bird to be extinct. It will be treatedin future notices of animal review as a category 3A species, believed tobe extinct. The appropriate petition finding is ``not warranted'' in respectto its addition to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.A second finding of ``not warranted'' was made for a petition to list theSamoan fruit bat (flying fox), <T3>Pteropus samoensis samoensis.</T3> This petition came from Mr. PaulAllen Cox and was received by the Service on November 27, 1984. An earlierfinding of ``warranted but precluded'' was announced on May 2, 1986 (51FR 16363), but discrepanices between the population levels indicated bythe petitioner and those found in subsequent (1985) surveys were mentionedat that time. Continued study has led to the conclusion that although thespecies is rare enough for some concern, there is not sufficient evidencethat it is threatened to warrant its listing. It is a solitary speciesnot as easily decimated by hunting as are some of its colonial relatives,and populations on several of the islands of Samoa appear to be stableat or near the carrying capacity of the environment. Remaining habitatis estimated to constitute 74 percent of Western and American Samoa. Accordingto the best scientific and commercial information available, includingthe Service's own positive field survey data, the action requested by thepetitioner is not warranted. It should be noted, however, that this specieswas recently included with other western Pacific <T3>Pteropus</T3> species on Appendix II of CITES (Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), to regulate trade.The Service therefore expects to continue monitoring of its welfare atsome level, and to be able to respond to any evidence of further decline.That commitment will be reflected in retention of category 2 status forthis species in the next notice of animal review.The other ``not warranted'' finding in Table 1 concerns Lora Aborn's moth,<T3>Lorita abornana.</T3> One of two subjects of a petition received fromMr. Bruce S. Mannheim, Jr., on May 21, 1985, it belongs to a group thatwas the subject of dissertation research study by Dr. Michael G. Pogue.His research into the genus led to the scientific conclusion that <T3>Lorita abornana</T3> Busck is a synonym of <T3>Lorita scarificata</T3> (Meyrick), a widely distributed species ofthe New World tropics and Hawaii. Therefore, the population of <T3>Lorita</T3> at the El Segundo dunes of Los Angeles, California, doesnot appear to represent an entity qualified for listing under the EndangeredSpecies Act. Separate findings are now indicated for the two subjects ofMr. Mannheim's petition on the basis of the best scientific and commercialinformation available, a finding of not warranted for Lora Aborn's moth,<T3>Lorita abornana,</T3> and a continued finding of warranted but precludedfor Henne's eucosman moth, <T3>Eucosma hennei. Lorita abornana</T3> will be included in category 3Bof the next notice of animal review, signifying that it lacks taxonomicvalidity.The information in previous 12-month finding notices is current for thespecies indicated by ``Yes'' in the ``Warranted'' column of Table 1. Inthe case of the desert tortoise the Service has some information to addto the finding announced on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24485). A name recognizedby many authorities for the desert tortoise is <T3>Xerobates agassizii.</T3> Three major genetic groups of the deserttortoise exist, separated by the Colorado and Yaqui Rivers, apparentlyas genetically distinct from one another as is the Texas tortoise, <T3>X. berlanderi,</T3> from the desert tortoise. The Service believesthat for certain area's of the species' range in Arizona and Mexico additionalstudy is needed to determine the species' status. However, substantialinformation suggests that the degree of threat facing the species in Californiaand Nevada is increasing. The Service retains the option to list thosepopulations that currently face the highest degree of threat while studiesproceed to resolve existing questions regarding remaining portions of thespecies' range.The following petitions are not included in Table 1 and have first one-yearfindings announced here: Dr. Thomas O. Lemke of Thomson Falls, Montana, in a petition dated February24, 1986, and received March 4, 1986, requested the Service to determineendangered status for populations of the Marianus fruit bat,<T3> Pteropus mariannus mariannus</T3> and <T3>Pteropus mariannus paganensis</T3>, in the Commonwealth of the NorthernMariana Islands. The population of this species on Guam was listed as endangeredon August 27, 1984 (49 FR 33885). The entire species, including the populationsidentified in this petition, was already the subject of a status reviewinitiated May 18, 1979 (44 FR 29128). In respect to Dr. Lemke's petition,the Service made a 90-day administrative finding that substantial informationwas presented that the action requested may be warranted; the 90-day findingwas reported in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on January 21, 1987 (52 FR 2239). After subsequent review of all the scientific and commercial informationavailable, the Service has determined that the action requested in respectto populations of this species on the islands of Agiguan, Tinian and Siapanis warranted but precluded by other pending proposals of higher priority.The finding is based on low population and decline in the fruit bat populationson these islands owing to their vulnerability to human disturbance, hunting,and inadequate legal protection. On Rota, Asuncion, Guguan, and other northernislands of the Commonwealth that may be inhabited by this species, theService has determined that existing legal protection and inaccessabilityto hunting are adequate to protect the populations, and that the actionrequested by the petitioner is not presently warranted. In a separate petition dated February 24, 1986, and received March 4, 1986,Dr. Thomas O. Lemke also requested the Service to determine endangeredstatus for the Sheath-tailed bat (<T3>Emballonura semicaudata</T3>) in the Commonwealth of the Northern MarianaIslands. This species in Guam was the subject of a status review initiatedDecember 30, 1982 (47 FR 58454), and the distribution corrected to includethe Northern Mariana Islands on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37958). The Servicemade a 90-day administrative finding for this petition that substantialinformation was presented that the action requested may be warranted, andreported that finding in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on January 21, 1987 (52 FR 2239). After review of the best scientific and commercial information available,the Service has determined that the action requested by this petitioneris not warranted. The basis for the finding was that there is only sketchyevidence of any decline in the petitioned population, and that it may bean ``outlier'' of a widespread species in the western Pacific.In a petition dated March 10, 1986, and received March 19, 1986, the Servicewas requested by Mr. Tom R. Johnson, representing the Missouri Departmentof Conservation, to list the Oklahoma salamander (<T3>Eurycea tynerensis</T3>) as threatened. A status report of this speciesin Missouri was submitted with the petition. An administrative findingthat the action requested may be warranted was made on June 20, 1986. Thespecies was already the subject of a status review initiated September18, 1985 (50 FR 37958). A<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice announced the 90-day petition findingon January 21, 1987 (52 FR 2240). The Oklahoma salamander is a neotenic (retaining larval gills throughoutits life) member of the family Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders). Itis restricted to stream systems and springs in the mountainous areas ofnorthwestern Oklahoma, southwestern Missouri, and northwestern Arkansas.Oklahoma, southwestern Missouri, and northwestern Arkansas. Oklahoma hasthe largest known distribution (several sites along two river systems);Missouri has 40 recorded localities, and Arkansas has five. Surveys supportedby the Missouri Department of Conservation and information furnished bythe Arkansas Natural Heritage Program and by Bill Resperman of OklahomaState University all indicated widespread deterioration of habitat throughoutthis species' range. Grazing and pollution have reduced the habitat qualityat a number of sites, especially in Missouri and Oklahoma. Recent surveysof the Arkansas Heritage Program failed to find Oklahoma salamanders inat least two sites where they formerly occurred. Although general populationdata is still unavailable, former sites of occurrence that are either pollutedor heavily grazed appear to have reduced or no Oklahoma salamander populations.The action requested by this petition for the Oklahoma salamander was judgedto be warranted according to the best information available, but precludedby other pending proposals of higher priority. The Service will continueto evaluate the status of the Oklahoma salamander. Additional data areneeded on populations of this species in Oklahoma and Arkansas; the specieswill therefore be retained in Category 2 of the next comprehensive noticeof animal review. In a petition dated July 20, 1986, and received July 25, 1986, the Servicewas requested by Alexander R. Brash of the Rutgers University GraduateSchool, New Brunswick, New Jersey, to list the white-necked crow,<T3> Corvus leucognaphalus</T3> as an endangered species. This bird isin the somewhat unique position of being extirpated, as far as known, fromthe United States (Puerto Rico), but still extant in the Dominican Republicon the island of Hispaniola. It is, therefore, a foreign species at present,but one that could conceivably be used in domestic restoration attempts.The petition was accepted as an action that may be warranted in a 90-dayfinding made in October 1986 and reported in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> for July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24485). The information needed to determine the actual status of the white-neckedcrow in Hispaniola is not yet available. As a foreign species the priorityfor seeking the necessary data is somewhat lower than that accorded domesticspecies, while at the same time costs to obtain the data are expected tobe higher. The evidence presented by this petitioner is not adequate aloneto justify a decision to list the species. At this time, however, the bestscientific and commercial information available support a finding thatthe action requested is warranted, but precluded by work on other speciesjudged to be in greater need of protection. A petition submitted by Mr. Rodney Bartgis and Mr. D. Daniel Boone of theMaryland Natural Heritage Program was dated July 22, 1986, and receivedby the Service on August 13, 1986. It requested the Service to list theAppalachian Bewick's wren,<T3> Thryomanes bewicki altus</T3>, as endangered. The petition acknowledgedthat not all authorities agree on the exact geographic limits of the varioussubspecies of this wren, but included extensive documentation that a definableAppalachian population is nearly extirpated from the few remaining Statesin which it has been reported since 1980. This petition was accepted asan action that may be warranted in a 90-day finding made in November 1986and reported in the<T4> Federal Register </T4>for July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24485). Subsequent review of the data on Bewick's wren in the eastern United Statesindicates that the action requested by this petitioner is warranted. Animmediate rule to propose this species for listing is precluded by workon other species judged to be in greater need of protection. It has, however,been accorded a high priority within the Service's priority ranking system.<ITAG tagnum="84">Progress in Revision of the Lists </ITAG>Section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act states that petitioned actions may befound to be warranted but precluded by other listing actions when it isalso found that the Service is making expeditious progress in revisingthe lists. The Service's progress in revising the lists in the year followingOctober 1, 1986, the cutoff date of the previous report, is described below.For simplification in reporting, the 12-month period described actuallycoincides with the 1987 fiscal year; activity during the last 12 days precedingthe anniversary of the Amendments will be described in a subsequent notice.The described activities prevented immediate action on the ``warrantedbut precluded'' petitioned actions.The Service's progress in revising the lists during fiscal year 1987 isrepresented by the publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of final listing actions on 52 species, and proposedlisting actions on 46 species.
