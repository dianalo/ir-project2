Since 1985, the United States Department of Energy (DOE)has been actively involved in research, in cooperation with the U.S.nuclear industry, to resolve the technical and procedural issues affectingnuclear power plant life extension. Extended lifetime operations andrenewal of the operating license will be accomplished in the U.S. throughan industry-wide effort involving the Electric Power Research Institute(EPRI), utilities, the Atomic Industrial Forum, code and standard committees,the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the DOE. Thecollective industry effort is being coordinated by the Nuclear UtilityPlant Life Extension (NUPLEX) Steering Committee. As an important firststep in plant life extension research, the DOE, EPRI and plant ownersare supporting two pilot plant studies. These studies thus far indicateno major obstacles to operating considerably longer than 40 years. Additionalanalysis and R and D are needed, however, to resolve generic uncertaintiesof degradation processes and to develop the technology for improved inspection,repair and replacement of aged components and preventive alternatives.Besides pilot studies preparatory to a lead license renewal application,the DOE is currently supporting more broadly based variance studies todevelop the technical basis for the extended life of specific criticalcomponents. Economic studies are also in progress to facilitate decision-makingfor life extension on a national and regional basis. Further R and Dis underway on the predictive performance of key components affectingplant safety and availability. The DOE is also investigating the longer-termdeterioration of critical cables.</TEXT></DOC>
