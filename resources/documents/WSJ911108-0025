The House staffers, who work for the Subcommittee onOversight and Investigations, said they believe Congress wasintentionally misled by the Army about the accident.</LP><TEXT>   The episode occurred in the early morning of Feb. 17, whenLt. Col. Ralph Hayles fired Hellfire missiles at what hemistakenly believed to be two Iraqi armored vehicles.Instead, Cpl. Jeffery Middleton, 23, and Pvt. Robert D.Talley, 18, were killed. The Army has blamed &quot;human error&quot; byLt. Col. Hayles, and he is the only American to have beendisciplined for a friendly fire incident during the war.   But questions are now being raised about whether faultyequipment on Lt. Col. Hayles's Apache helicopter may havecontributed to the tragedy.   Last July, Col. Jim Mowery, the brigade commander who wasLt. Col. Hayles's supervisor in the war, told the GeneralAccounting Office that &quot;the Apache was not at fault in thisincident,&quot; according to the GAO's notes of the conversation.   Col. Mowery further informed the GAO, Congress'sinvestigative arm, that a 30mm cannon Lt. Col. Hayles triedto fire had jammed after the Hellfires had already done theirdamage. Col. Mowery added that at the time the Hellfires wereshot, however, &quot;all of the equipment was functioning,&quot;according to the GAO notes.   But videotapes recorded internally by the Apaches,disclosed in a front-page story yesterday in this newspaper,show that Lt. Col. Hayles also tried to fire the cannonbefore he engaged the Hellfires -- and it jammed then, too.Other Apache pilots say the timing is crucial because had Lt.Col. Hayles been able to use his cannon before shooting themissiles, the armored vehicles might have had time toidentify themselves as American. &quot;The whole thing might neverhave happened,&quot; one of the House aides asserted.   According to the GAO notes, Col. Mowery said that althoughLt. Col. Hayles's helicopter was in order, the navigationequipment in another of the Apaches &quot;was not workingproperly.&quot; Lt. Col. Hayles relied on the co-pilot of thathelicopter for confirmation of the targets' locations.   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the oversightcommittee, was prepared to question Pentagon officials aboutthe cannon failure during a hearing last month, stafferssaid. &quot;But we were steered off this thing by what the Armytold the GAO,&quot; one aide said. He added that the performanceof the Apache has long been a concern to the GAO and to somemilitary officials.   The subcommittee said it is planning to hold additionalhearings, and it has asked the GAO's Office of SpecialInvestigations to conduct a probe into the matter. Aspokesman for GAO investigators couldn't be reached.   Officials at McDonnell Douglas Corp., the maker of theApache, declined to comment. An Army spokesman said theApache &quot;performed superbly&quot; in the war with Iraq. He addedthat Lt. Col. Hayles was disciplined largely because heviolated an unusual guideline in his unit that officers ofhis rank should be managing, not shooting.</TEXT></DOC>
