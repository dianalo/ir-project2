The banks -- Red River National Bank in Clarksville, Clarksville, Texas; Sweeney Bank, Sweeney, Texas; and Clarks Fork National Bank, Fromberg, Mont. -- will reopen today as parts of other institutions.    The two offices of Red River National, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, are to reopen as branches of State Bank of DeKalb, DeKalb, Texas. The failed bank had assets of $22.6 million and held $22.5 million in 4,700 deposit accounts.    Sweeney, closed by state banking officials, is to become a branch of First State Bank of Louise, Louise, Texas. Sweeney had assets of $17.7 million and held deposits of $17.6 million in 4,800 accounts.    Seventeen banks have closed in Texas so far this year.    Clarks Fork National, also closed by the Comptroller, was bought by Yellowstone Bank, Laurel, Mont. Customers of Clarks Fork National will automatically become customers of Yellowstone and will be able to conduct business at the failed bank's office briefly. But that office will eventually close because Montana law doesn't allow banks to operate branches.    Clarks Fork National had assets of $8.2 million and held deposits of $7.8 million in 1,500 accounts. It was the first Montana bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
