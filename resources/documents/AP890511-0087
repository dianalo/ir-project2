The daily Borba quoted Josip Vrhovec, Croatia's representativeon the collective nine-man state presidency, as cautioning thatholding citizens without charge is legal only ``in certaindifficult situations.''   Kosovo is a province in Serbia that has been plagued by violenceinvolving the ethnic Albanian majority and the Slav minority. Theprovince has been under a state of emergency since March riots thatkilled at least 25 people.   Vrhovec's statement, to parliamentary deputies in Croatia,criticized the police action. However, as a member of thepresidency, he has played a role in the crackdown.   ``The isolation in Kosovo represents the most flagrant, the mostradical form of limiting human rights,'' Vrhovec said, according toBorba. The newspaper is considered among the most liberal ofYugoslavia's state-controlled media.   Police reports say 60,000 ethnic Albanians rioted to protestconstitutional changes giving Serbia more control to police Kosovo,where 85 percent of the 1.8 million inhabitants are ethnicAlbanians. Previously, the province enjoyed virtual self-rulewithin the federation.   Serbian authorities claim the amendments were needed to preventalleged harassment of Slavs by ethnic Albanians.   Opponents of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic accuse him ofdistorting the ethnic situation to exert control over Kosovo andelevate himself among Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group.   About 800 protesters have been jailed following the Marchviolence, most receiving 60-day prison sentences.   Among those awaiting trial are Albanian politicians, businessmenand other community leaders accused of instigating the troubles.   A commentary in the current issue of Danas, the country'slargest-selling news magazine, said detainees are not allowed toreceive visits by lawyers or family members and are denied booksand newspapers.   Meanwhile, Kosovo authorities have demanded an unspecifiednumber of ethnic Albanian regional deputies be ousted for opposingthe constitutional changes and voting against officialSerbian-backed candidates for the regional presidency.   ``It is unacceptable to have in Kosovo's assembly a certainnumber of deputies whose behavior and statements are contrary tothe policies of the Communist Party,'' the magazine quoting DautJasanica, a high-ranking provincial official, as saying.   In the liberal northern republic of Slovenia, meanwhile,thousands of students boycotted classes today to protest thejailing of a journalist accused of revealing military secrets.   About half of Ljubljana University's 17,000 students protested,student union member Sereja Sorli said in a telephone interview.   Janez Jansa, editor of the liberal Mladina youth weekly, twoother journalists and an army soldier were sentenced by a Ljubljanamilitary court to prison terms of 10 months to four years for theftand possession of a classified army document.</TEXT></DOC>
