RAWSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials already are making plans for the 1990census, getting a six-month jump on most of the rest of the country,because the U.S. Census Bureau chose it as the ``model city.''   Phoenix will share the results of its extensive planning withcities throughout the country, said Norris Nordvold, the city'sliaison with the Census Bureau.   ``We have about 140 people serving on 11 subcommittees puttingtogether plans to make sure everyone is counted,'' Nordvold said.That includes detailed plans to count homeless people.   Although most cities won't start planning for the census untilabout November, the Phoenix effort has been under way since March,Nordvold said. He said a ``cookbook'' of recommendations will beprepared to help other cities.   The Census Bureau chose Phoenix ``because of Mayor TerryGoddard's enthusiasm for the project, the city's mixture ofminorities and its growth rate over the last decade,'' according toa newsletter published by the bureau's regional office in Lakewood,Colo.   An accurate count is important to local governments because stateand federal funds are distributed on the basis of population,Nordvold said.   ``That comes to about $175 per person in Phoenix,'' he said. ``Ifyou're not counted, we miss that much.''   In addition, Nordvold said Arizona possibly could gain twocongressional seats ``if we do a good job and count everyone.''   Ellen Dumm, spokeswoman for the Lakewood Census Bureau office,said special efforts would be made to count minorities and thehomeless.   Minorities were undercounted by an estimated 5 percent to 7percent in 1980, but the 1987 Immigration Reform and Control Act,which granted amnesty to many aliens who had been in the countryillegally, should make the count somewhat easier this time, Nordvoldsaid.   ``We're getting a lot more cooperation from Hispanic groupsbecause there isn't the fear this year of someone wearing a badgeand coming around saying he's representing the federal government,''he said.   Ms. Dumm said census takers would spend the night of March 20counting homeless people, the first time that there has been anorganized effort to count the homeless.   From 6 p.m. to midnight, they will visit shelters, soup kitchensand other places frequented by homeless people, she said. Frommidnight to 4 a.m., they will count homeless people on the streets.And from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m., they will count people leaving buildingswhere homeless people are known to sleep, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
