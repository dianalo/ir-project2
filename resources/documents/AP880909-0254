But it won't support military needs in anational emergency,'' said Donald K. Brush, general manager at theBarden Corp. in Danbury, Conn.   Brush joined Sens. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., and AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y., in a call for administration protection of theindustry.   ``The health of the domestic industry has declined to the pointthat it now endangers our national security,'' Weicker said at aSenate Small Business Committee hearing he called to look at theimpact of foreign competitors.   ``Without a secure domestic supply of bearings, our nationaldefense could become gridlocked,'' said Weicker, who represents astate with 16 bearing plants. ``When it comes to the question ofbearings, I don't want to have to depend on any foreign nation.''   Bearings are critical to a variety of weapons systems, includingnuclear missiles, jet engines, tanks and atomic submarines.   The Pentagon recently installed a new policy to buy onlyAmerican-made bearings for at least three years. Industryexecutives said that would help, but the problem would largelyremain because Pentagon purchases make up only 15 to 20 percent ofthe market.   ``How does U.S. business compete with the low wages and othercosts of Singapore and Thailand? No amount of modernization couldreduce costs to compete with labor rates one-19th ours,'' Brushsaid.   Last month, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said PresidentReagan would delay a decision on a 1987 industry petition urginggovernment restrictions on the amount of bearings imported. Veritysaid the president first wants to see the impact of the Pentagon'sbuy-American policy.   Under the Omnibus Trade Bill, the president must make a decisionby Nov. 21.   Weicker said domestic bearing production has dropped by morethan 30 percent since 1978. D'Amato said nearly 15,000 jobs and $11billion in sales have been lost since 1979, and 31 bearing andparts plants have closed down.   In addition to cheaper labor costs enjoyed by foreign companiesand in some cases subsidies from their own governments, U.S. agentsare investigating charges that some foreign bearing makers areviolating customs and trade laws, dumping their products in theU.S. market and in some cases avoiding U.S. tariffs byunder-reporting.</TEXT></DOC>
