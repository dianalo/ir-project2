Most pulmonary angiogramsare performed to establish the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonaryangiography remains the most specific test for the diagnosis of pulmonaryembolism when performed at an appropriate clinical time. The use of geometricmagnification, segmental injection techniques, and multiple projections,has served to enhance the specificity of pulmonary angiography in thediagnosis of thromboembolism. In select instances, pulmonary angiographyin combination with selective bronchial angiography has been used toevaluate patients with chronic pulmonary embolism for embolectomy. Thischapter discusses the techniques of pulmonary angiography with particularattention to its role in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.</TEXT></DOC>
