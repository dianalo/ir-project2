The chairman replied dryly that therecord speaks for itself.   And so it does.</LP><TEXT>   For 1989, the bank's U.S. and Australian subsidiariesrequired huge loan-loss provisions, as did Britain's MidlandBank PLC, in which Hongkong Bank has a 14.9% stake. HongkongBank has fared only slightly better in its internationalsecurities-trading operations: James Capel andamp; Co., its100%-owned London-based brokerage firm, and Carroll McEntee andamp;McGinley Inc., a dealer in U.S. government securities thebank bought in 1986, haven't been as successful as expected.Further, Hongkong Bank recently disclosed that it carries asizable loan exposure to the failed finance company British andamp;Commonwealth Holdings PLC.   Hongkong Bank's dismal record overseas overshadows animpressive record closer to home: Group profit, which doesn'tinclude results of many of the bank's troubled foreignsubsidiaries, advanced 11% in 1989 from the previous year,while assets in the Asian-Pacific region jumped 25%.Competitors in Asia consider Hongkong Bank to be thebest-managed bank in the region, and it is highly regarded inthe Middle East and Canada.   Still, troubles elsewhere have raised questions about thebank's ability to succeed in its ambition to become a trulyglobal financial institution. At the same time, abandoningthat goal would also mean abandoning its much-publicizedcombination with Midland, a bank with problems enough of itsown.   &quot;The Midland Bank merger, which was seen as positive for{Hongkong Bank's} stock, is now an unmitigated disaster,&quot; ananalyst wrote in a recent review of the Hong Kong stockmarket. &quot;The best thing Mr. Purves can do is cut the losses,but he will not.&quot;   Investors apparently agree. Many who bought Hongkong Bankstock earlier this year in anticipation of a merger havesince been dumping their shares. The share price has droppedmore than 20% from its highs earlier this year.   Most analysts agree that the two banks are too far alongin their plan to turn back. Still, if Midland'swell-publicized troubles diminish its luster, Hongkong Bank'sproblems with its 100%-owned Marine Midland Banks Inc. of theU.S. and other overseas operations could do the same to it.   Just several months ago, the two banks appeared to beheaded for a fairly simple combination as early as December,when Hongkong Bank is freed from an accord that freezes itsstake in the British bank. The merger would create theworld's ninth-largest bank; its nearly $240 billion in assetswould make it slightly bigger than Citicorp.   Analysts have speculated that Hongkong Bank wouldestablish a holding company in Britain to oversee thecombined operations. Such a setup would both satisfy Bank ofEngland concerns about local ownership of Britain's fourclearing banks and give Hongkong Bank a domicile outside thecolony before 1997, when Hong Kong is to revert to Chineserule. (In the eight years following the Communist takeover ofChina in 1949, Hongkong Bank lost all but one of its 33branches on the mainland.)   But the problems at both banks have raised doubts abouthow quickly the transaction will be completed. With orwithout the merger, Hongkong Bank will have to learn fast theintricacies of managing a global bank -- something few havebeen able to do well in recent years.   Hongkong Bank didn't create all its problems; saggingeconomies hurt several of its overseas operations. Nor is italone. Dozens of banks have been stung after venturing intonew and unknown markets, and even by misjudging their homemarkets.   However, Hongkong Bank also must confront a uniqueproblem: The home market it dominates is a tiny Britishcolony with a population of roughly six million, and themarket is already saturated. Hongkong Bank is the largestnon-Japanese Asian-based bank and the 30th-largest in theworld, making even all of Asia seem slightly confining. Therational response to these factors, and to the reversion ofHong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, would seem to be globalexpansion.   That is what Hongkong Bank was thinking three years agowhen it bought its Midland stake. The purchase was anextension of Sir Michael Sandberg's grand design to transformthe bank into a global player. Under Sir Michael, who servedas chairman from 1977 to 1986, the bank expanded rapidly intothe U.S., Australia, Canada and China, and entered thesecurities business world-wide.   In these efforts, the bank encountered aggressivecompetitors with similar ambitions. Its local operationsfared well when the local economy was expanding, but oftentook a hit when the economy flagged. &quot;If you look at a lot ofproblems the bank has been having, they are throwbacks to theSandberg era,&quot; says Steven Thompson, investment analyst forCounty NatWest Securities Asia Ltd.   Enter Mr. Purves, a nuts-and-bolts banker who has beentrying since taking up his post in 1986 to bring order to thebank he inherited from Sir Michael. The job has been tough.&quot;I don't think it's possible to brilliantly manage a bankonce it gets to a global size,&quot; says Chris Munden, a researchanalyst with Elders Roach Asia Ltd., a subsidiary of theElders Finance Group Ltd. of Australia.   In Australia, Mr. Purves's team has reduced the bank'sexposure to struggling entrepreneur Alan Bond, estimated tohave been as much as $1 billion at one time.   In the U.S., Hongkong Bank's original intention was to buya major money-center bank, but it eventually bought MarineMidland, whose operations are concentrated in upstate NewYork, with a presence in New York City.   &quot;The great thing about Hongkong Bank was that it had noexposure to less-developed-country debt,&quot; says an analyst ata U.S. investment bank in Hong Kong. However, buying MarineMidland gave the bank its first taste of Third World debtmanagement.   In 1989, Marine Midland added $414 million to provisionsagainst losses on developing-country loans, an 84% increase.The bank's nonperforming loans totaled $1.2 billion at theend of the year.   The parent bank also took big losses when the propertymarket in the U.S. Northeast, Marine Midland's prime market,soured last year.   Disappointment has also accompanied Hongkong Bank's pushinto international securities trading. The James Capelbrokerage operation recovered last year from a loss in 1988,only to post a loss for the first quarter of this year. AndCarroll McEntee andamp; McGinley, the U.S. government securitiesdealer, last year had its second consecutive annual loss.   Asia remains Hongkong Bank's area of special strength.Profits increased for nearly all of its operations in 25countries across Asia and the Middle East last year. Anddespite the bank's push into new, more distant markets, itsassets in the Asian-Pacific region rose to 48% of totalassets last year from 40% in 1986.   Though worries about Hong Kong after 1997 have figuredlargely in the bank's global expansion, it is committed toretaining a strong presence in the colony, which analystsestimate now accounts for about 20% of business. IBCA Ltd., aLondon-based credit-rating agency, estimates that more than40% of the bank group's deposits derive from Hong Kong.   Given that, and the concentration of assets in Asia, someanalysts say Hongkong Bank would do best to drop its globalexpansion plans altogether to concentrate on its successfulregional businesses and its more-distant successes in theMiddle East and Canada.   Deputy chairman John Gray won't hear of such talk, butacknowledges that &quot;if you look out from Asia-Pacific, it'svery difficult to find areas which offer the same rewards.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
