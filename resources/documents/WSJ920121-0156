In March, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. will unveil a fatterversion of its Camel filter cigarettes as part of an effortto lure macho smokers.</LP><TEXT>   The unorthodox innovation, called Camel Wides, marks thefirst attempt by an American cigarette maker to sell U.S.consumers on a thicker smoke. It's part of a broader effortby the nation's No. 2 tobacco merchant to prop up its waningfull-priced cigarette brands with novel product permutations.Last year, for example, the company concocted new packagingfor its flagging Winston brand designed to keep the smokesfresh longer. It has since repackaged its Salem cigarettesusing the same technology.   The tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc. hopes thatCamel Wides, which are aimed primarily at young men, willsteal puffers from Marlboro, made by archrival Philip MorrisCos. RJ Reynolds has already had some success luring youthfulsmokers from Marlboro country with its Camel filters.   The new Camel Wides, which are about two millimetersthicker than standard cigarettes but slightly shorter, willcontain a few more puffs. In addition, the smoke contains anew blend of tobacco, intended to give a smoother, milderflavor than the standard Camel blend. But the new Camels areexpected to register on the high end of the tar and nicotinescale.   &quot;We were looking for a point of differentiation to extendthe appeal of the brand,&quot; says David N. Iauco, senior vicepresident of marketing at RJ Reynolds. &quot;Camel Wide feelsdifferent in your hand and in your mouth.&quot;   But some industry executives and distributors question thestrategy. They note that while wider or oval-shapedcigarettes have long been popular in France and Belgium,fatter versions offered by brands such as Gauloises andGitanes have never caught on in the U.S.   And while Camel Wides will be priced the same as regularCamels, experts also wonder if today's value-oriented smokerswill be interested in a modestly thicker cigarette, or evenunderstand exactly how they differ.   &quot;They've come out in a box very similar to regular Camels,and I think this might be confusing to consumers,&quot; said amarketing executive at a rival company.   Some tobacco wholesalers are already calling the newformat unwieldy. Regional distributors, who are responsiblefor applying state tax stamps to the bottom of cigarettepacks, complain Camel Wides don't fit through their automatedstamping machines and will require hand-stamping.Nonetheless, most wholesalers contacted indicate they willcarry the line.   But RJ Reynolds is counting on Camel Wides to help haltthe slide of its fourthlargest brand. Camel filter cigaretteshave increased in popularity since 1988, when the companybegan using the Old Joe Camel mascot in its advertising.Nontheless, Camel's total share of the U.S. cigarette marketfell to 4% for the first nine months of 1991, down from 4.5%in 1990, says John C. Maxwell, a tobacco analyst with WheatFirst Securities.   Although Old Joe has drawn increasing fire from smokingfoes who contend the cartoon character appeals mainly tochildren, RJ Reynolds is planning to expand the campaign forthe Camel Wides launch. Billboards for the smokes, created bythe New York agency Mezzina/Brown Inc., feature not one, buttwo of the beasts, both slightly pudgier than the originalJoe. One pitches full-strength Camel Wides; the other hawks alower-tar, lower-nicotine version of Camel Wides.   So confident is RJ Reynolds of its risky concept thatrather than test-marketing it, the new cigarette will berolled out as early as March 1. Company officials said thespeedy introduction was meant to keep competitors off guard.&quot;We didn't want to give our competition time to react,&quot; saidRJ Reynolds's Mr. Iauco. &quot;We're also pretty confident aboutthe product.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
