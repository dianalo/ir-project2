Perched at one end of the biblical road, the merchantpoints to where the street dips and twists before losingitself in the spice souk. &quot;From here it looks crooked,&quot; hesays. &quot;But move over a few feet and hold your head just so,&quot;he adds, squinting, &quot;and it looks perfectly straight.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   With that, Mr. Achkar ducks into the shade, eludingfurther queries about politics.   Labyrinthine logic comes naturally in this city of crampedalleys and whispered thoughts. But rarely have Syria'scontortionist skills been tested so severely. By lining upagainst arch-rival Saddam Hussein, President Hafez Assad hasput Syria in the same tent as old and bitter foes, the U.S.and its moderate Arab allies. He has pitted Damascus againsta neighbor that espouses three pillars of Syrian ideology:Arab unity, shared Arab wealth and the Palestinian cause. Andhe has sent troops to the front of a potential war in whichmost Syrians would rather be in the opposing trench.   &quot;For years, Assad has been the odd man out in the Arabworld,&quot; says a European ambassador in Damascus. &quot;Now, he'sthe odd man in.&quot;   Syrians sympathetic to Iraq remain, for now, a very silentmajority. One reason is that Mr. Assad's iron-fisted regimetolerates little dissent, and has put it down brutally in thepast.   Another reason is that Mr. Assad still is hard-line on theone issue that really counts to most Syrians. Asked about the&quot;current Mideast crisis,&quot; a restaurant cook named KasimHasoun instinctively responds by talking about theIsraeli-occupied Golan Heights, not the Persian Gulf. &quot;If theZionists don't leave our land, we will have another war, forsure,&quot; he shouts, angrily mashing chick peas.   Reminded that war soon may break out on Syria's otherflank, Mr. Hasoun shrugs. The Gulf conflict &quot;is a side show,&quot;he says.   Syrians' tunnel vision, and their broad support for Iraq,bode poorly for Mr. Assad's flirtation with the U.S. andmoderate Arab states. If Syrian troops join battle againstIraq, the now-muted anger with Mr. Assad could flare intoviolence. If Israel is drawn into the Gulf conflict, Syriaalmost certainly will switch sides. And if the U.S. shows nosigns of pressuring Israel to negotiate over the occupiedlands, Syrians' demonized image of America will quicklyre-emerge.   At his home in a shady quarter of Damascus, DefenseMinister Mustafa Tlas serves up hot tea and frosty views ofSyria's odd bedfellowship with the U.S. in the Gulf.&quot;American troops don't know why they are in the desert,&quot; hesays. The only reason he sees is that &quot;the U.S. seekssupremacy in the world.&quot; Syrian troops, by contrast, are&quot;doing a holy job&quot; by defending Saudi Arabia.   To Gen. Tlas, as to many Syrians, the U.S. is &quot;the greatengineer,&quot; set to tighten the screws on Israel as soon as theGulf conflict ends. If Israeli-held territory isn't liberatedthrough diplomacy, &quot;we will take it,&quot; he says.   Nor have Syrians softened their views on terrorism, themain obstacle to closer ties with the U.S. The mere mentionof Ahmed Jebril, the Syria-based Palestinian who is thoughtto have bombed Pan Am flight 103, enrages officials. &quot;We knowthe bombing was a Mossad operation,&quot; Gen. Tlas says,referring to Israel's secret service. As proof he offers the&quot;fact&quot; that 30 rabbis canceled their seats on the plane justbefore takeoff, along with the foreign minister of SouthAfrica.   Western investigators say that's ridiculous, but suchconspiratorial notions are rife in a capital that regardsitself as the only true champion of the Palestinian cause.Damascus is headquarters to the &quot;rejection front&quot; ofPalestinian groups opposed to any negotiation with Israel.Media criticism of Saddam Hussein pales beside the vitriolaimed at Israeli leaders, who are referred to as &quot;the Zionistenemy&quot; and often labeled in cartoons with swastikas.   The wellspring of Syrian bile toward Israel is the GolanHeights, a strategic highland that Israel has occupied sincethe Six-Day War in 1967. The hilltops now bristle with radarand eavesdropping equipment, underscoring the Syrian sense ofvulnerability; on a clear day, Israeli patrols can seeDamascus across about 40 miles of arid plains.   Just as Israelis fear Damascus's old dream of a &quot;GreaterSyria,&quot; encompassing Israel, Syrians believe that Tel Avivcraves an &quot;Eretz Israel&quot; stretching from the Nile to theEuphrates.   The border town of Kuneitra, destroyed by Israeli troops,has been left by Syria as a pile of twisted metal andconcrete, a monument to the Israeli occupation. &quot;Destroyed bythe Zionists,&quot; says a sign on a gutted hospital, wherebusloads of Iranian tourists visited on a recent day. Nearbyis a statue commemorating Suleiman Khater, a crazed Egyptianwho gunned down seven Israeli tourists in the Sinai in 1985and later died in prison.   &quot;Even a madman can be a martyr and folk hero if he killsIsraelis,&quot; says Mamdou Adwan, a poet and playwright who haspublished verse about the Egyptian.   Mr. Adwan is the rare Syrian who criticizes Mr. Assad'sauthoritarian rule. Last year he even signed a manifestopraising the vilified British author Salman Rushdie. Butasked if he or any other dissident has ever questionedSyria's stance toward Israel, or its spending 55% of itsbudget on arms to achieve &quot;strategic parity&quot; with the Jewishstate, Mr. Adwan laughs. &quot;On this issue,&quot; he says, &quot;I doubtany Syrian has ever had a dissenting thought.&quot;   As with so much in Syria, though, contradictions abound.Fanatically anti-Zionist, Damascus also is home to 3,000Jews, many of them prospering. The traditional Jewish quarternow is heavily populated by Palestinian refugees, who, in1948, moved into homes vacated by Jews fleeing to Israel.   &quot;The only thing we don't do together with our Arabneighbors is pray,&quot; says Nassim Hasbani, celebrating theJewish New Year at one of the city's 18 synagogues last week.While it remains hard for Jewish families to emigrate, visarestrictions are easing, particularly on unmarried women.   Syria's 280,000 Palestinians, for whom Mr. Assad is aself-styled liberator, are kept on an even tighter leash.Distrusted for their support of Yasser Arafat, anotherlongtime foe of Mr. Assad's, they are denied Syrian passportsand cannot vote for, or serve in, Parliament. A visit to theclosely watched United Nations refugee camps -- fairly easyin Jordan and Israeli-occupied lands -- requires 10 days'advance notice in Syria so officials can approve.   Split vision extends to America. Despite two decades asthe Soviets' main client in the region, Damascus is the mostWestern of Arab capitals. Young women in sleeveless blousesand short skirts, an outfit that would be judged indecent inCairo or Riyadh, shop at stores called &quot;Hallo Baby&quot; or eatice cream at a parlor called &quot;Alaska.&quot; Nightclubs abound, asdo cinemas showing Western movies. Each day at dawn, the lineof Syrians applying for visas to the U.S. stretches aroundthe block.   &quot;While Syrians understand the strength of our relationshipwith Israel,&quot; says U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian, &quot;theyalso look at the U.S. as the city on the hill, theavant-garde nation which is equated with what is new.&quot;   As evidence of warming relations, he points to the releaseof some Western hostages held in Lebanon, the toning down ofanti-American propaganda and the ready access U.S. diplomatshave to Mr. Assad, most recently during a visit to Syria bySecretary of State James Baker.   &quot;But nothing is swept under the rug, including the issueof terrorism and human rights,&quot; the ambassador says of thenew dialogue. &quot;We're not playing softball here.&quot;   Nor are the Syrians. As part of a growing culturalexchange between the two countries, the managing editor ofthe state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, Fayez alSayegh,recently spent a month touring the U.S. Back in his office incongested downtown Damascus, he puffs on a Marlboro and putsthe finishing touches on a piece about Montana.   &quot;The plains are a green dress, embroidered with flowers,&quot;he reads aloud. Gazing dreamily out at the traffic, he waxeseloquent about American hospitality (so sincere]), Americanairports (so modern]) and American submarine sandwiches (sobig]). &quot;It is a great country,&quot; he concludes, &quot;except thateverything in America is subject to the will of the Zionistlobby.&quot;   It is this abiding anger at U.S. support for Israel thatkindles Syrian support for Iraq, which foreign diplomats andSyrians say appears to be strong among three-quarters of the12 million population.   While many Syrians regard Saddam Hussein as a reckless andbrutal man -- there is little of the adoration for the Iraqileader obvious in Jordan -- they respect the guts and powerhe has displayed in confronting the U.S. The anti-sheikstrain of Iraqi invective also strikes a chord in Syria, apoor country often visited by rich Gulf Arabs in search ofdrink and sex.   &quot;Saddam's only mistake,&quot; says one student at DamascusUniversity, &quot;is that he didn't take the whole Gulf while hehad the chance. No Syrian wants to die defending harem sheiksand Western oil supplies.&quot; The pro-Iraq reports on JordanianTV picked up in Syria have further fueled Iraqi support,especially by Palestinians.   Many Syrians also support Saddam Hussein simply because heis the foe of their own leader. While Damascus is filled withstickers and signs proclaiming &quot;We Love Assad&quot; (with a heartin place of the word &quot;love&quot;), few Syrians express anyaffection for their president. An austere figure with a tastefor documentary films and vegetarian food, Mr. Assad hasbrought stability to a land that experienced 12 coups in thetwo decades before he consolidated power in 1970.   But his regime runs first and foremost on fear. Among Arabstates, Syria's secret police network is second only toIraq's. The Assad regime's brutality became obvious in 1982,when the crushing of Moslem fundamentalists led to thedestruction of the city of Hama and the massacre of 10,000 ormore of its inhabitants.   &quot;Since Hama,&quot; says a Syrian academic, &quot;public opinion hasstayed very private.&quot; While there has been some pro-Iraqgraffiti in recent weeks, no one has yet found evidence tosupport reports of riots in eastern Syria.   Nonetheless, there are signs of insecurity in Damascus. ABBC correspondent who reported the rumored riots was kickedout of Syria the same day. Palestinian groups sympathetic toIraq have been barred from distributing their literature. Theregime also has launched a rare public-relations campaign,dispatching party officials to the provinces to defendSyria's stance.   While Mr. Assad argues convincingly that Iraq's annexationof Kuwait undercuts Arab opposition to Israeli occupation,the essence of his position is a 20-year-old blood feud withSaddam Hussein over leadership of the Baath Party, and of theArab world.   In an apparent gesture to public opinion, the state-runSyrian media, which for years derided Saddam Hussein as a&quot;butcher&quot; and &quot;henchman,&quot; has treated the Iraqi presidentgingerly since the invasion of Kuwait. And in a major speechon the Gulf this month, Mr. Assad didn't mention SaddamHussein by name, referring only to the blunders of &quot;ourbrothers in Iraq,&quot; which he said had forced foreign forces toenter holy Arab soil &quot;to the benefit of the Arab nations'enemies and in the interests of Zionism, which continuallyhatches conspiracies.&quot;   For now, Syrians have no choice but to accept this figleaf for Mr. Assad's desire to finally extinguish SaddamHussein, which he failed to do by supporting Iran in theIran-Iraq war. Most Syrians regard the sending of troops tothe Gulf -- 4,000 so far, expected to grow to 20,000 -- as asymbolic gesture, though it could quickly become more thanthat if shooting breaks out.   Many Syrians also welcome the economic rewards they mayreap as a result of Mr. Assad's stance. At a time when Sovietsupport is slipping, the Gulf states are likely to come tothe rescue of Syria's troubled economy. The EuropeanCommunity also is planning new loans, and if Syria ever getsoff the State Department list of states supporting terrorism,it could receive U.S. aid as well. As a modest oil exporter,Syria already has profited from higher oil prices.   &quot;If the population has the view that economic paradise isaround the corner, that will go a long way to salving publicopinion,&quot; says a Western diplomat. Inflation is over 50% anddecrepitude is obvious throughout Damascus. Ancient buseslack hoods and belch black fumes; the phone system is acrackly tangle of crossed lines; even the presidential palacehas dim bulbs and broken elevators.   But hiking up the six flights of stairs to his office,presidential adviser Assad Elias warns against thinking thatSyria can be bought or easily influenced. &quot;If good comes toSyria materially from this, fine,&quot; he says. &quot;But the onlypayoff we are looking for is something concrete from the U.S.on the Arab-Israel conflict.&quot;   Mr. Elias and other Syrians want an internationalconference leading to Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedlands. But Mr. Adwan, the poet, doubts that even such anevent would soothe Syrians' wounded pride and frustrateddreams of greatness.   With typical Syrian indirection, he tells an ancient storyabout a knight named al-Muhalel who fights a bloody 40-yearwar to avenge the murder of his brother. Peacemakers come tohim and ask, &quot;What is it you want to end this war? Gold?Camels? Women?&quot; He tells them to ask the daughter of hismurdered brother.   Her answer: &quot;I want my father.&quot;   Mr. Adwan drains his glass of arrack and smiles wryly. &quot;Wewant what we can't have,&quot; he says. &quot;We want poetic justice.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
