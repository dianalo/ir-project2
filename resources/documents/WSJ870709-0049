The air freight company declined to provide specific figures.    Airborne said second-quarter revenue rose from the year-earlier $133.4 million, but not by enough to offset increased operating expenses related to an expansion of the company's express delivery capacity.    The company said results will be reported the last week of July. </TEXT></DOC>
