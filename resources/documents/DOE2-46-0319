<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>Computer simulations have been performed, aimed at achieving a betterunderstanding of the geological and physical processes involved in theformation of sedimentary basins in general and the Black Warrior basinof Alabama and Mississippi in particular. Microscopic-level computermodeling of sandstone porosity reduction has been done, elucidating thedetailed small-scale dynamics which lead to the geological phenomenonof pressure solution. A new technique has been developed for 1D burialand thermal modeling of sedimentary basins based on stratigraphic datafrom test wells. It is significantly faster than previous methods, andcan be used in interactive menu-oriented program requiring relativelylittle learning time or prior computer experience. This allows a geologistto rapidly determine the results of various different hypotheses aboutbasin formation, providing insight which may help determine which iscorrect. A program has also been written to simulate tectonic-plate collisionsand rifting processes using viscoelastic hydrodynamics.</TEXT></DOC>
