CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Labor unions, resented by totalitarian states andsometimes by corporate managers, are regarded by most historicchurches as buttressing the rights and dignity of ordinary workers.   Their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standardsalso have become protected by law in democratic countries.   That point was underlined in the 1989 Labor Day message of theU.S. Catholic Conference. It cited a particularly dramatic modernexample _ the union-spawned turn to democracy in Poland.   Similar union-backed thrusts for democracy were noted in otherlong-oppressive lands, sometimes meeting countermeasures. Someanti-union moves also were seen in this country.   Americans ``can now see how trade unions in Eastern Europe,Africa and Asia unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom andsolidarity of oppressed peoples,'' the message said.   Called ``Freedom, Justice and the Role of Unions,'' the statementpointed up the union-energized dawn of fuller rights in Poland, longunder communist oppression, and said:   ``All men and women of good will are heartened by the successfulstruggle of Poland's workers, whose free, democratic trade union,`Solidarnosc' (Solidarity) has become the instrument of progress,and we hope, liberation. ...   ``Working people in Hungary, in China, in South Africa and inSiberia and the Ukraine are asserting the same social values ofhuman dignity, freedom and solidarity ... as they work ... to createthe democratic trade unions. ...''   Christianity and Judaism have special grounds for concern withthe labor movement drawn from the Bible and its emphasis on mutualcommunity responsibility for all persons in it, including itslowliest workers.   ``We are members one of another,'' the apostle Paul wrote,stressing the duty of all to share the burdens and needs of fellowtoilers, and also to uphold and celebrate their well-being.   A tentmaker himself, as well as evangelist, he saw work ashonorable and essential, a part of God's unfolding creation. ``Weare coworkers with God.'' Sloth, termed by the church one of sevendeadly sins, also drew Paul's scorn, ``Let him who won't work noteat.''   Major churches in this century have voiced their support forunion organization and collective bargaining to set standards forworkers.   The ``important social contributions of the labor movement'' hasbeen recognized ``by almost every branch of the Christian church,''says the National Council of Churches, including most Protestant andEastern Orthodox denominations.   However, labor had a long and often difficult struggle in itsearly years, sometimes marked by violence on both sides, as inefforts of coal miners led by the late John L. Lewis to gaincontractual standards.   But the upheavals of the Depression in the l930's and ensuinggovernment reforms shored up legal rights of workers to organize andnegotiate with their companies for basic conditions and wages.   While strains and antagonism sometimes arise in the process, manycompany managements have come to appreciate the mutual stability andatmosphere of equity that labor agreements establish.   However, the Catholic Labor Day message, while citing theunion-backed gains for democracy abroad, says that ``in the UnitedStates, ironically workers are measurably worse off than they were10 years ago.   ``Structural changes in the economy, increased reliance onimports, union-breaking efforts, and a growing shift to lower-paid,part-time employment have left millions of Americans without theprotection of unions.   ``For many, this has meant lower living standards, no healthbenefits and less security for their families.''   The Catholic Labor Day message, issued by Auxiliary Bishop JosephM. Sullivan of Brooklyn, chairman of the U.S. Catholic Conferencecommittee on domestic policy, said:   ``A strong trade union movement, with widespread collectivebargaining, can strengthen all of society. ... Union workers alsoare more likely to have a voice in workplace decisions and localaffairs.   ``Strong democratic unions can be a training ground for communityleaders. That is one reason unions have been resisted bytotalitarian regimes and why they should be fostered in democraticsocieties.''   Declaring that ``social solidarity and the bonds of community areweakened when the spirit of individualism triumphs overcommunitarian values,'' the statement said:   ``Workers ... have a duty to use their unions not only for theirown self-interest, but also for the good of the whole society. Thisflows from the fact that work is a vocation, a calling by God toparticipate in his creation. ...   ``Since unions can only fulfill their important functions fortheir members and for society when there is full participation, itis important for workers to take their social obligations seriouslyand to use well their opportunity for union membership.''
