The Healthy Start program presently reaches 60 percent ofHawaii's new parents, and the state hopes to be screening nearlyevery new parent by 1992. Those judged at risk are offered fiveyears of home visits and counseling on economic and emotionalproblems that can lead to child abuse.   ``What's nice about the program is they're trying to help thefamily in all aspects of family life,'' said Loretta Fuddy,supervisor of child services for the state Health Department'smaternal child health branch. The department supervises sevenprivate agencies that operate the program.   Twenty percent of those surveyed are found to be at risk and areoffered the services of a home worker who makes weekly visits, saidBetsy Uohara Pratt of Hawaii Family Stress Center, which began apilot program in 1985 from which Healthy Start was developed. Only5 percent of the parents decline the assistance, she said.   Roughly 1,500 to 1,600 households have received home visits thisyear. That number is expected to increase to 2,600 by 1992. Theprogram is expected to cost $6 million a year when fully operating.   There were 2,215 documented cases of child abuse in Hawaii in1988, according to the state Health Department.   Pratt said it is difficult to locate abused children before theyreach school age.   ``I've seen a lot of kindergarteners absolutely devastated bythe time they reach kindergarten,'' said Pratt, who supervises thetraining of counselors for Healthy Start. ``We can help these kidsget off to a safe and healthy start which would help them when theyget into the school system.''   Healthy Start begins at the hospital shortly after a baby isborn. Workers interview new parents or examine their medical chartsto spot warning signs that indicate a tendency to abuse or neglectchildren.   Workers try to determine whether the parent or parents havefinancial problems, housing problems, low self-esteem, were abusedas children, or have other traits considered warning signs forchild abuse.   About 75 percent of those helped by Healthy Start are mothers onwelfare, Pratt said.   The home worker counsels on basic parenting skills that help achild's development and alleviate stress on a parent. ``Manyfamilies have astoundingly little knowledge of infants,'' she said.   Workers also help the families attack economic and emotionalproblems by putting them in touch with social service agencies.   Most important, Pratt said, the workers help build the parents'self-esteem.   ``What we do for them is cheer them on,'' she said.   Visits are made once a week until a baby is 18 months and thenare gradually scaled back to quarterly visits until the child is 5years old.   Fuddy said the program costs the state $1,600 a year per family.In comparison, she said, it costs $6,000 to provide a year offoster care for a child.   She said she hasn't heard anyone objecting that Healthy Startmight be an invasion of privacy.   ``It's offered as a service to the families,'' she said. ``Theyask permission to interview the families and offer them homevisitor services.''   She said assessment workers have permission from hospitals toscreen patients' records. The patients' permission isn't required,she said.   Pratt said it's too early to say if Healthy Start has had animpact on Hawaii's rate of child abuse.   ``We can only guess that it's helping,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
