William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science atColorado State University and a hurricane forecastingspecialist, said he uncovered a strong association betweenseasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intensehurricanes.</LP><TEXT>   Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier thissummer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be aboveaverage, and so far he seems to be right. In July he saidthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of whichsix would be hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center saidthat as of yesterday there have been nine named storms thisyear, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.   Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricanepatterns more accurately as an early warning for coastalresidents of the U.S. and the Caribbean. A sharp decrease inhurricane activity over the past two decades spurred businessand residential development that would be vulnerable toincreased hurricane activity.   Mr. Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newestof five indicators he uses to predict global hurricaneactivity. Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strongtropical storms that are triggered by winds and other airdisturbances that sweep across Africa. Wind moving acrosswarm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing seawater that eventually turn into rainclouds. Mr. Gray said hebelieves that in the absence of moisture, these stormsquickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength withadditional moisture.   Mr. Gray said his research, published in the current issueof Science, suggests that &quot;intense Caribbean hurricanesGilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be theforerunners of this change.&quot;   Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel withthe number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Grayfound a striking correlation. From 1947 to 1969, forinstance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especiallyabundant, and during this time there were 13 severehurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1970 to1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, andhurricane activity was unusually low; only one severehurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.   Mr. Gray searched back in recent history and found thatthe Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Maliand Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry andwet weather. He found that the Sahel was especially wet from1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935. Hurricane activity wasmuch higher during this time than during intervals when theSahel was dry.   Mr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, theSahel is entering a wet period. He said the droughtconditions ended in 1988 and 1989. He based his 1990 stormforecast on the higher-than-normal rainfall in the Sahel inJuly. Mr. Gray said his research suggests that climatechanges in the Sahel don't result from global warmingproblems associated with environmental pollution but fromnatural weather cycles.</TEXT></DOC>
