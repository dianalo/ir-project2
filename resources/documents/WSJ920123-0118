The author -- a career foreign-service officerspecializing in the Middle East, director of long-rangeforecasting at the CIA in the mid-1980s and now a senioranalyst at RAND Corp. -- seems well-positioned to address thequestion of America's national purpose, now that communism isdead. But then again, Foggy Bottom and Langley aren't exactlyknown as fonts of prescience or wisdom.</LP><TEXT>   Of course, it's always easier to sell a book about&quot;perils&quot; than one about opportunities. Mr. Fuller'sostensible aim is to throw cold water on democracy'scheerleaders. The problem is that in support of his thesis,he constructs a straw man. Not even the most committedenthusiast believes the spread of democracy &quot;willspontaneously alleviate major social ills&quot; at home and usherin an era of peace abroad.   Though Mr. Fuller gives short shrift to the transcendentpower of the democratic idea, he does score some points whenhe sticks to foreign policy. The collapse of the Sovietempire, he argues, means that the Third World will be moreundisciplined, freeing the likes of Saddam Hussein to invadetheir neighbors and setting off a series of &quot;small wars.&quot;Democracy won't necessarily triumph in the former Sovietbloc, and even if it does it won't preclude the free electionof some odious characters, like Georgia's Zviad Gamsakhurdia.   As for the direction of American policy, Mr. Fuller notesthat the U.S. is now free from that Hobbesian choice: backingfriendly undemocratic regimes in the name of nationalsecurity, or undermining them in the name of freedom andrisking Soviet advance. This change, he thinks, should giveidealists the upper hand in the current foreign-policy debatewith realists. At the same time, he warns that an unqualifiedemphasis on national self-determination and human rights inU.S. policy may give unintended cover to neo-nationalist andradical religious movements. What will we say, for instance,if the Zulus in South Africa want their own nation?   A chapter on how U.S. elites tend to &quot;export blame&quot; forhome-grown maladies is also spot-on. The drug scourge, whichhas its origins in a 1960s &quot;feel-good cultural fetish,&quot; isfundamentally a function of domestic demand, not supply. Andthe flaying of the Japanese is mostly sour grapes for theirhaving beaten the U.S. in areas of traditional Americanknow-how.   Unfortunately, in order to amplify the pitfalls of thefuture, Mr. Fuller feels compelled to downgrade the Sovietthreat of the past. Thus the struggle against communism ischaracterized as a &quot;luxury&quot;an &quot;excuse&quot; for not tackling toughproblems at home. The national will is going to be &quot;moresorely tested now than in the Cold War,&quot; the author declares.Yet having faced down a menacing nuclear-armed mafia for fourdecades, it is difficult to imagine what graver challengeslie ahead.   Mr. Fuller, however, shows no such failure of imagination.He insists, in Marxlike fashion, that democracy's flaws andcontradictions are inherent and inexorable. This line ofanalysis takes him down a weird path.   The U.S. bombing Brazil, another democracy, in a war tosave the rain forests is just one image in the author'scrystal ball. A promising discussion of how racial quotas andbilingualism only have widened the chasm between the racesexpands into a prediction that a secessionist &quot;MexicanAutonomous Republic&quot; could arise in the American Southwest.And a section about the conflict between individual rightsand broader social-welfare concerns ends with the specter ofa Clint Eastwood-style &quot;restorative authoritarianism&quot; in theU.S.   Exaggeration is one major flaw in this book;self-contradiction and ambiguity are two others. On one pagethe author writes: &quot;The assumption of a broad range of socialresponsibilities by the state has posed one of the primarythreats to the family.&quot; A few pages later he is recommending&quot;FDR's old work programs&quot; and complaining that &quot;theindependent American pioneering spirit, the distaste for BigGovernment and its dictates, and the desire for personalfreedom and independence all have conspired to delaygovernment action to establish more programs. . . .&quot; Well,which is it?   Mr. Fuller is so unsure about the status of the Americanunderclass that he invents an oxymoron, deeming it&quot;semipermanent.&quot; When he writes &quot;to the extent that such asignificant overrepresentation {in the underclass} of blackAmericans exists, special programs are needed to restore someethnic balance,&quot; is he suggesting an affirmative-action planto admit more whites?   Like many people who have concerned themselves withforeign policy since World War II, Mr. Fuller experienced a&quot;great crisis&quot; in the wake of the sudden and dramatic changesin the international order. He frets that intellectuals whohave spent their careers &quot;galvanized against totalitarianism&quot;will now &quot;retreat into private visions, the lure of themarketplace, or just sheer personalized trivia.&quot;   Ironically, &quot;The Democracy Trap&quot; bears precisely thesemarkings. One can only hope that the reading public is notsubjected to a flurry of similarly unedifying efforts.   ---   Mr. Brock is writing a book on Congress and foreignpolicy.</TEXT></DOC>
