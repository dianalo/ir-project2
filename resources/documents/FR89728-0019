The revising regulation was issued bythe Department of the Interior as a proposed rulemaking and published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 8, 1988 (53 FR 49565) with a publiccomment period of 60 days ending on February 8, 1989. Nine comments werereceived and considered during the development of the final rulemaking.This final rulemaking revises andSection; 4110.4-2(a) to allow the authorizedofficer to determine on a case-by-case basis whether to cancel or suspenda grazing preference in whole or in part, or, where resource conditionswarrant, to permit livestock grazing preferences to continue unchangeddespite a reduction in the acreage available for livestock grazing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Inquiries or suggestions should be sent to: Director(140), Bureau of Land Management, Room 5555-MIB, 1800 C Street NW., Washington,DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Billy R. Templeton, (202) 653-9193.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This final rulemaking provides theauthorized officer the flexibility to make determinations on a case-by-casebasis to maintain, cancel or suspend a grazing preference where there isa reduction in the acreage available for livestock grazing.The existing regulations at andSection; 4110.4-2(a) require that where thereis a decrease in public land acreage available for livestock grazing usewithin an allotment, grazing permits or leases and grazing preferencesmust be canceled in whole or in part. However, in certain circumstances,the public land acreage lost to livestock grazing may be very small andthe remaining acreage in the allotment may produce sufficient forage forlivestock to support the grazing preference. In other situations, the landmay be committed to a mining operation and later again be available forlivestock grazing when the mining operation is completed and the land rehabilitated.For these reasons, and in recognition of range administrative purposes,the existing regulations are revised to deal more logically with the livestockgrazing permittees and lessees. Rather than be required to modify or cancela grazing lease/permit or preference, the authorized officer shall havethe authority to make a determination that takes into account the levelof available forage for livestock and the magnitude of the change in publicland acreage.The proposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 8, 1988 (53 FR 49565) with a 60 daypublic comment period ending on February 8, 1989. During the 60 day commentperiod, 9 comments were received: 5 from associations; 2 from state governments;and 2 from a Federal agency.Most of the public comments supported the proposed regulations, citingflexibility in decision making to reflect site specific conditions as apositive revision of the rules. Commenters opposing the proposed regulationsexpressed a spectrum of views concerning the agency's intent ranging fromthe proposed rules being another effort to eliminate livestock grazingon public lands to the proposed rulemaking having an objective of keepinggrazing preferences at maximum levels.By this final rulemaking the field level manager is given the latitudeand flexibility to make sound land use decisions based on existing resourceconditions and not be restricted by regulations which mandate cancellationof a grazing permit or lease, in whole or in part, when an allotment hasany loss of acreage.One comment expressed a concern that most of the decisions, pursuant tothese regulations, will be to reduce existing livestock use levels. TheBureau of Land Management does not anticipate that the final rule willresult in an increase in decisions that reduce livestock use levels. Thecurrent regulation provides that the authorized officer must cancel orsuspend a grazing preference when acreage is reduced, regardless of foragesufficiency. The revision would allow cancellation of the grazing preferenceon those allotments where there is a significant decrease in the publicland available. The preference may be suspended where forage availabilityis temporarily reduced or remain unchanged where there is sufficient forageavailable, as determined by the authorized officer. Therefore, the finalrule is unchanged.One comment points out that the proposed rulemaking does not discuss thepossibility of range improvements as a means to maintain grazing preference.Range improvements are addressed in a separate subsection (4120.3) whichpresently is not being revised. The final rule is unchanged.Another comment suggests that the entire grazing preference system needsrevision. This suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Therefore,the final rule is unchanged.One comment suggests that in order to cancel, suspend or modify a grazingpreference the Bureau of Land Management would be required to conduct newrange analysis and/or studies. This is not the intent of the rulemaking.The authorized officer generally has existing data from standard rangeanalysis and/or study methods on file at the District or Resource AreaOffice to determine if an adjustment of the grazing preference is needed.Thus, only in a small number of cases would a new range analysis and/orstudy have to be initiated. Therefore, the final rule remains unchanged.One comment recommends the first sentence in andSection; 4110.4-2(a)(2) bechanged to read as follows: ``Grazing preference may be cancelled, suspendedor modified in whole or in part through standard range analysis, studymethods and/or available data acceptable to the Authorized Officer to protectthe remaining public lands.'' It is the Bureau of Land Management's policythat any data used for decision making purposes must be gathered usingstandard methodologies consistent with standards established by the agency.Data from sources other than those which are standards of the agency arenot acceptable. Therefore, the final rule remains unchanged.One comment recommends changing the term ``equitably'' to ``proportionately''.The commenter proposed that the final rule at 4110.4-(a)(2) read: ``* ** Cancellations or suspensions will be apportioned as agreed upon amongauthorized users or, in the event of failure to reach agreement, will beproportionately apportioned by the authorized officer among authorizedusers in direct proportion to their respective grazing preference.'' Thissuggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking and would, if accepted,result in a substantive change that the public has not been able to commenton. Therefore, this part of the subsection has not been rewritten.The principal author of this final rulemaking is Bruce E. Dawson, Divisionof Rangeland Resources, Bureau of Land Management, assisted by DeborahLanzone of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management.It is hereby determined that this proposed rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Additionally, the final rule will not causea taking of private property under Executive Order 12630.This rule does not contain information collection requirements that requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 etseq.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 4100</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Grazing lands, Livestock, Penalties,Range management, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Under the authorities set forth below, andSection; 4110.4-2, Group 4100,Subchapter D, Chapter II of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 4100_GRAZING ADMINISTRATION_EXCLUSIVE OF ALASKA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 4110_Grazing Management</ITAG>1.
