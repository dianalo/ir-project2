 If there were, Pete Piascik would not have hadto learn about systems integration the hard way--on the job and through trialand error.andM;&quot;I have a few scars on my back that I could show you,&quot; says the MIS directorfor the specialty papers business of manufacturing giant James River Corp. inRichmond, Va.andM;What's given Piascik the imaginary scar tissue is a major project to installcommon, integrated office automation systems in each of his $1 billiondivision's 28 mills in the United States and Britain.andP;  James River made afundamental decision three years ago to use packaged software and outsideintegrators to carry off the ambitious automation plan.andP;  Like an increasingnumber of corporations opting for help from outside integrators on majorprojects, James River wanted quick results and an experienced partner withwhich to share the risk of using new and unfamiliar technologies.andM;It was Piascik's job to select the products and the outside integrators andto end up with a common approach that satisfied both his end users and JamesRiver's accounting department.andP;  He started out with a broad set of designgoals.andP;  For example, the systems had to use a common operating system and beable to communicate using the company's central network.andP;  The system chosenuses manufacturing software from ASK Computer Systems Inc., Digital's officeautomation software and a variety of DEC VAX systems, the largest being the6200 minicomputer.andM;Before the project was completed, however, Piascik and James River hadhammered out a 3-inch-thick contract with integrators Digital and ASK thatspelled out every detail of the project and each player's responsibilities.andO;Before it was over, Piascik also had plenty of hard won experience in how tostructure a project with an outside integrator to get what he wanted andprotect himself in case something went wrong.andM;Piascik, for example, insisted on writing his own contract, rather thanaccepting the integrator's standard language.andP;  And he demand specific systemperformance targets and upgrade commitments from the integrator.andM;&quot;We wanted a minimal number of shades of gray.andP;  So, we spent a lot of timedealing with all the issues up front, just in case there were problems.andO;There was a whole lot of give and take,&quot; says Piascik.andM;While using outside IS systems integrators has long been the norm in thefederal government, it is just now becoming common in the private sector andamong some state and local agencies.andP;  IS executives in the private sector arenow looking to outside integrators for help for a number of reasons.andP;  Often,they want help working with new technologies and new types of applications.andO;At the same time, IS departments are under increasing pressure to deliverstrategic applications quicker.andP;  But expert IS professionals are tough tofind, and many IS shops are seeing their internal development resourcesshrink, as departments are cut back in the interest of cost cutting anddecentralization.andP;  Vendors, from hardware purveyors DEC and IBM to erstwhileconsultants such as Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. are working hard to capitalize onthis trend by offering users various combinations of bundled, or packaged,services.andM;On the Job TrainingandM;For many corporate IS executives today, however, dealing with an outsideintegrator is a new experience.andP;  Like James River's Piascik, many are feelingtheir way along, getting on the job experience and, in some cases, learningfrom their mistakes.andP;  Often, as in the case of James River, the mistakes arefew and the results are positive.andP;  Sometimes, however, the mistakes can leadto disastrous results for user and integrator alike.andM;A recent case involving a young California oil exploration company and anintegration unit of Raytheon Co. shows how high the stakes can be whensomething goes wrong.andP;  In the early 1980s, Pasadena, Calif.-based GeophysicalSystems Corp. was looking for a way to process the data pouring out of itsnew invention, a 1,024-channel seismic data acquisition device it called theGeocor IV.andP;  GeoSystems planned to use the integrated system to sell oilexploration services to large customers such as Superior Oil and Texaco Inc.andO;GeoSystems considered building the data-processing portion of the systemitself using Data General Corp. systems.andP;  But, in the end, the companydecided to go with an integrator, Seismograph Service Corp., a unit ofRaytheon based in Tulsa, Okla., which promised to deliver a VAX-basedsolution within four months, less than half the time it would have taken todo the work in house.andM;The Raytheon unit, however, ran into problems.andP;  Its integrated hardware andsoftware system couldn't meet the performance criteria GeoSystems had writteninto the contract.andP;  And attempts to fix the system failed.andP;  Eventually,GeoSystems paid the price.andP;  Texaco canceled an $11 million contract, andSuperior Oil and Hunt Energy Corp. followed suit.andP;  Still without a workingsystem, GeoSystems was forced to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection andfiled suit against its integrator.andM;Late last year, a federal jury ruled that the Raytheon unit had breached itscontract with GeoSystems.andP;  The jury told Raytheon to pay GeoSystems the $15million value of the original contract.andP;  And, on top of that, Raytheon wastold to compensate GeoSystems for the revenue it lost because its systemnever worked properly.andP;  The total damages awarded to GeoSystems amounted to$48.3 million, enough to bring GeoSystems out of Chapter 11 and to send acold chill down the backs of integrators everywhere.andP;  The case was appealed,and in March the appeals court upheld the liability ruling, but ordered aretrial to reconsider the amount of the damage awarded.andM;GeoSystems chairman and founder Samuel Allen blames the fiasco in part on hiscompany's willingness to put its fate in the hands of a big-name integrator,along with its failure to actively manage the project.andP;  &quot;Here was a bigcompany promising to do something for us in just four months.andP;  I suppose wewere a little too trusting in that we didn't blow the whistle fast enough,&quot;says Allen.andM;Experts say a failure to monitor and manage integrators actively is a mistakecommonly made by first-time commercial integration customers.andP;  Many suchcompanies, they say, are looking for someone to come in and relieve them ofall the headaches and responsibilities of planning, developing, testing andimplementing new applications.andP;  Many first-time commercial integrationcustomers, says Los Angeles-based analyst and consultant Lee Gruenfeld ofTouche Ross andamp; Co., fail to perform the sort of detailed, up-frontrequirements planning they need to get the most out of a systems integrationproject.andM;&quot;Commercial customers are notorious for not protecting themselves,&quot; saysGruenfeld.andP;  It's not surprising that first-time systems integration customersoften fail to protect themselves adequately.andP;  Not only are they usuallyinexperienced when it comes to dealing with integrators but they frequentlylack the trained staff they need to do comprehensive requirements analysis.andO;In many cases, that's why they're bringing in a systems integrator in thefirst place.andP;  Piascik's team at James River, for example, consisted of threestaff members at the beginning of their office automation project.andM;It's also often difficult for commercial systems integration customers to getreliable case references to use in evaluating integrators.andP;  &quot;It's hard forChrysler to call GM and ask what they think of a certain integrator,&quot; saysanalyst Mark Hodges, a systems integration market researcher at G2 ResearchInc. of Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;And a lot of commercial users don't reallyhave much of an evaluation of RFP [request for proposal] process in place.&quot;andM;In fact, a recently completed survey of 38 Fortune 1,000 companies byCambridge, Mass.-based Forester Research Inc. found that, for most users,pilot evaluation of network solutions is not much more than a rubber stampprocess.andP;  Users said they reject proposed solutions only about 16% of thetime.andM;Compare that with the federal government's approach to systems integration.andO;The feds have years of experience dealing with integrators; lots of publiccase references to study; and big staffs to do detailed up-front requirementdevelopment, requests for information, requests for proposals, pilotimplementations and testing and project monitoring.andP;  In the earlyrequirements phase of a current stock point automation project withElectronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS) for example, the U.S.andP;  Navy used 12full-time analysts and several part-time analysts on loan from end-userorganizations.andP;  And, for the source selection phase of the project, the Navyhad between 40 and 50 full-time analysts.andM;&quot;If you're not willing to put the people and time into these projects upfront, you can't expect to get the kind of payoff you're looking for,&quot; saysRear Admiral Robert M. Moore, assistant commander for inventory and systemsintegration.andM;The federal government also usually insists on several other procedures toreduce its risks in large systems integration projects.andP;  A complex series ofRFIs (requests for information) and RFPs is required, followed by a weedingout of bids and a &quot;best and final&quot; phase, where contractors make their bestoffers.andP;  After the contract is awarded, one or more pilot test phases areusually required before the final project sign-off is made.andM;Failure to pay close attention to such details can be costly.andP;  In 1986,Orange County in California signed a $1.9 million systems integrationcontract with Big Eight consultancy Arthur Young andamp; Co. for an automatedproperty tax assessment and billing system.andP;  The system was to be implementedby early 1988.andP;  But Arthur Young ran into problems, and deadlines weremissed.andP;  Arthur Young said it would take an additional $3.8 million to dowhat the county wanted and asked for a down payment of $224,000 to continuethe work.andP;  The county, which estimated it could lose up to $5 million ininterest on uncollected taxes due to the delays, insisted that Arthur Youngwas obligated to complete the job for no extra money.andP;  Work on the project isnow about 85% done and continuing, but Arthur Young and the county stillhaven't agreed on who will be responsible for the additional costs.andM;&quot;Usually, you try to nail down a process in advance to determine additionalwork and price adjustments that might be required.andP;  But sometimes there aresituations where you can't do that,&quot; says Richard Van Kirk, director ofmanagement consulting for Arthur Young's western regional office.andM;Users obviously aren't the only ones at risk in the still-evolving world ofcommercial systems integration.andP;  Integrators jumping into the fast growthcommercial market are discovering that the risks they face could be at leastas great as their opportunities.andP;  Fixed pricing, high preliminary costs andincreasing competition mean margins are often thinner in commercial systemsintegration than vendors expect.andP;  G2 estimates that, on the average,integrators receive a 22% gross profit margin on commercial projects.andP;  That'sonly slightly above federal government integration margins.andM;&quot;If you have a big $100 million deal, and you miss your cost estiamtes byjust 5%, you're suddenly out $5 million,&quot; says Barry Hull, president of theSystems Integration Division at DMR Group Inc., a systems integrator inMontreal.andM;And always threatening commercial integrators is the issue of liabilityshould something go wrong.andP;  If integrators fail to live up to theircontracts, they can be forced to pay users not just the equivalent of thecontract's value but also compensation to the customer for lost revenue.andP;  Asthe GeoSystems-Raytheon case shows, that can add up fast.andM;Damage ControlandM;Within the federal government, most agencies have agreed to waive rights tosuch extensive damages--known as &quot;consequential damages&quot;--in return for lowerprices.andP;  In the commercial market, integrators are attempting to getcustomers to follow suit, insisting on language in most standard integrationcontracts that exempts them from paying consequential damages.andM;Some recent court cases, however, indicate that commercial integrators may beliable for consequential damages regardless of what their contracts may say.andO;In one case recently upheld by a federal appeals court, integrator MicroformData Systems Inc. had contracted to install an automated telephone directorysystem for the Hawaiian Telephone Co.andP;  Microform could never get the systemto meet several key performance criteria specified by the phone company,however, and the system was never delivered.andP;  The court ordered theintegrator to pay $296,000 in consequential damages, even though HawaiianTelephone had signed a waiver.andM;Some integrators say those cases may indicate that the risks of commercialsystems integration are higher than they thought.andP;  &quot;Many vendors getting intothe integration business are just realizing the enormity of the risk theyassume,&quot; says Helene Stewart, corporate counsel for Oracle Complex SystemsCorp., Oracle Corp.'s integration subsidiary in Arlington, Va.andM;Some integrators are taking another approach to minimizing their risk.andP;  Agrowing number are asking customers to agree to out-of-court arbitration ofdifferences.andP;  Arbitration cuts down on legal expenses and eliminatessurprises from sometimes unpredictable juries.andP;  &quot;Juries tend to feel verystrongly about holding vendors accountable,&quot; says Norman R. Cohen, presidentof Computer Consulting Systems Inc. of Atlanta, and a frequent expert witnessin integration court cases involving NCR.andP;  NCR, in the mid-and late-1980s,was the target of several fraud and breach-of-contract users suits.andP;  One ofthem, filed by the Madonna Construction Co. of San Luis Obispo, Calif.,andO;resulted in an out-of-court settlement estimated at $6 million.andP;  Since thelate 1970s, NCR has included an arbitration clause in its standardintegration and turnkey systems contracts.andM;Arbitration can be in the interest of users as well as integrators, saysTouche Ross' Gruenfeld.andP;  At the very least, an integration project cancontinue through the arbitration process rather than being held up waitingfor court dates.andM;While integrators try to limit their own risk and liability, experts saythere's a lot that commercial users can and should do to protect theirinterests.andP;  Asking the right questions early can ultimately make the questionof who's liable unnecessary.andM;First and foremost, commercial integration should focus on the requirementsphase of any project, experts say.andP;  &quot;It's the most important aspect andprobably the weakest link in the whole process,&quot; says G2 Research presidentGraham Kemp.andP;  According to those with experience, the key is to commitadequate time and resources to the upfront requirements phase and to involveend users in the process.andM;While most corporations are usually too short on time and talent to dodetailed requirements analysis, some users have recently shown it can bedone--and it does pay off.andP;  The San Antonio-based United Services AutoAssociation is currently near completion on a $10 million integration projectthat dates back to 1981.andP;  That's when the insurance provider did a majorlong-range systems plan, identifying image processing of its mountainouspaper workload as a strategic project priority.andP;  After an exhaustiverequirements analysis and pilot testing process involving vendors such asFileNet Corp. and 3M, by 1987, USAA knew as much about image processing--notto mention its own needs--as any vendor.andP;  USAA was able to tell vendors howfast it expected its system to scan a page, how fast it should turn page andhow fast it should be searching for documents through various levels ofhierarchical storage (see &quot;Digging out With Image Technology,&quot; April 15, p.andO;18).andM;One reason USAA was able to structure its IS project successfully, accordingto its IS president, Donald R. Lasher, was that the company has lots offormer military officers with federal systems integration experience.andP;  Lasheris a retired general.andM;Surprisingly, few user organizations testing the systems integration watersfor the first time are attempting to bring seasoned federal systemsintegration managers on board as sources of experience.andP;  &quot;It would makesense, but we don't see that happening right now,&quot; says G2's Kemp.andM;Eventually, Lasher was able to convince top IBM executives to bid on the job.andO;IBM has used the project both to get experience in commercial systemsintgration and to enter the image-processing business.andM;Consultant RecommendationsandM;Many experts also recommend bringing in an integrator or consultant to helpwith the requirements analysis phase.andP;  The same consultant is often laterawarded the actual integration project management contract.andP;  Such setups arenot permitted in federal systems integration projects, where objectivity andimpartiality are sought.andP;  But it's often the best approach for private-sectorintegration customers looking for dependable results.andP;  &quot;We recommend it,&quot;says G2's Kemp.andP;  &quot;Often there's so much lost between what goes into therequirements analysis in terms of what users wanted and what comes out in theRFP that it's important to have the same outside group involved in bothphases.&quot;andM;Whether users do it themselves or have integrators help with the upfrontwork, it still costs.andP;  DMR Group, for example, specializes in doing both therequirements and integration phases of projects.andP;  According to IntegrationDivision president Hull, the upfront requirements phase can easily end uprepresenting 20% of the total project bill.andP;  &quot;Usuaully the customer pays forthat,&quot; says Hull.andM;One user that elected to go with a single integrator for the requirements andtesting phases was Dean Witter Reynolds Canada Inc., which is currentlyinstalling a 300-unit broker workstation network based on IBM PS/2S.andP;  DeanWitter signed up Toronto integrator Systems House Ltd. for both phases of theproject.andP;  According to Dean Witter senior vice president of nationaloperations Frank Vree, the arrangement worked because it allowed a closerworking relationship among the integrator, Dean Witter management and its endusers.andM;Not that a close relationship between integrator and customer shouldsubstitute for a detailed contract.andP;  Users should insist that the contractaddress as many specifics as possible, including practical measures ofsystems performance, says Touche Ross' Gruenfeld.andP;  &quot;The contract should beused as an ongoing guide to performance, not just as a legal document,&quot; hesays.andP;  Many integrators will at first balk at promising specific responsetime or other measures of performance.andM;The more specifics there are in the contract, the more effectively it can beused to motivate the integrator when necessary, users say.andP;  &quot;the relationshipwith your integrator is the important thing, but often the people doing aproject change, and you always run into problems and delays,&quot; says JohnPetrush, manager of corporate MIS for Allegheny International Inc. inPittsburgh.andP;  Allegheny brought Digital and McDonnel Douglas Corp. in on aCAD/CAM integration project in 1986.andP;  Petrush describes the results as &quot;verysatisfactory.&quot;andP;  But still, he says, &quot;There were times we came close tothreatening to take action on commitments in the contract.andP;  It helps to havesomething solid to fall back on.&quot;andM;It seems there are few limits on what users can ask to be included in thecontract.andP;  G2's Kemp recommends users insist that specific qualifiedindividuals actually perform the work.andM;Users should also consider dealing with oither personnel matters and securityconcerns in the contract.andP;  Commercial integration customers increasingly areasking their integrators to promise not to recruit their technical talent, atleast for a given period of time.andP;  Integrators should also be asked not toreveal competitive information they might run across during an integrationproject, say users.andP;  &quot;It makes you nervous to have someone go waltzingthrough your systems,&quot; says Petrush.andM;The Risk of an Information LeakandM;When it comes to competitive information, integration customers should alsobe concerned with who actually owns the software that is produced during aproject.andP;  Generally, the law says the customer owns it if the software ispart of a larger project or if it's written by an employee as part of his orher job.andP;  Specifying ownership in the contract can't hurt, however, saysToche Ross' Gruenfeld.andM;And integration customers should be concerned not just with what's in thecontract but also with the relationships among the prime integrator andsecondary hardware and software providers.andP;  Users should ask if they'regetting the best price.andP;  And perhaps more important, users should knowwhether the prime contractor has access to the software source code of thesecondary supplier so that future system upgrades can be accomplished easily.andM;That latter issue can be critical.andP;  Several years ago, Beverly Hills,Calif.-based American Medical International Inc. joined with EDS to develop aset of microcomputer-based hospital patient care automation systems.andO;American Medical marketed and integrated the systems, but neglected to getsource code from software developer EDS.andP;  Later, the two companies couldn'tagree on how to upgrade the system to incorporate low-cost PCs, and userswere left to migrate on their own to new systems.andM;Canny users often insist on signing contracts with all integrators andsuppliers on a project, not just the primary contractor.andM;The size and health of the integrator should also be a user's concern, theexperts agree.andP;  When something goes wrong, they say, you want an integratorthat is big enough to twist the arm of secondary suppliers and get results,one that cares enough to protect its name and reputation.andP;  When USAA pickedIBM, one consideration was, as IS president Lasher puts it: &quot;We're a big IBMcustomer, and we knew IBM couldn't afford to fail on this project.&quot;andM;Finally, commercial integration customers should take an active role inmonitoring and managing the integrator's progress.andP;  It's not enough, userssay, to sit back and assume everything is under control.andM;&quot;It's just basic project control, no different from any other type ofproject,&quot; says Dean Witter's Vree.andP;  &quot;You have to manage the consultant andstay on top of him.&quot;andP;  When he took on responsibility for the brokerworkstation project.andP;  Vree says, he set up a formal weekly review schedule.andO;But he soon learned that it wasn't enough.andP;  &quot;It turns out, you're on thephone every day.andP;  It's a full-time job.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
