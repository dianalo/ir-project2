A research scientist had just established the first strong link between smoking and cancer in an experiment on mice.    Concerned, Liggett Group Inc. quietly decided to duplicate the experiment using its own brands, Chesterfields and Landamp;Ms. Researchers smeared the shaven backs of mice with tars from the cigarettes' condensed smoke. The results: Cancerous tumors sprouted like mushrooms on the mice's backs.    After the experiment, however, Liggett continued to reassure the public that it believed smoking wasn't harmful. So what was the point of the tests? Jurors at a tobacco-liability trial in federal court in Newark, N.J., recently heard one explanation from Kinsley V. Dey, Jr., Liggett's current president.    Lawyer: What was the purpose of this?    Mr. Dey: To try to reduce tumors on the backs of mice.    Lawyer: It had nothing to do with the health and welfare of human beings? Is that correct?    Mr. Dey: That's correct.    Lawyer: How much did that study cost?    Mr. Dey: A lot. . . Probably between $15 million and more.    Lawyer: And this was to save rats, right? Or mice? You spent all this money to save mice the problem of developing tumors, is that correct?    Mr. Dey: I have stated what we did.    For three decades, smokers and their relatives have been suing cigarette makers -- and for three decades the plaintiffs have been losing. The Newark case -- brought by Antonio Cipollone, whose wife Rose, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer in 1984 -- probably won't break the companies' winning record.    But the case, which asks for unspecified damages, has nonetheless attracted widespread attention. In earlier cases, plaintiffs have found little evidence to support their claims that tobacco companies were negligent in not warning smokers before the government made them do so. The Cipollone case is significant, plaintiffs' attorneys say, because of the huge volume of internal documents the companies have been forced to disclose and because of what those documents reveal.    In fact, anti-smoking activists, lawyers, legislators and other potential plaintiffs are jubilant. They see the documents as ammunition that can be used against the tobacco industry for years to come. They believe the documents are the first to suggest that the tobacco companies long ago privately acknowledged what they continued to publicly deny -- that is, that smoking is linked to cancer. And they say the documents undermine the tobacco companies' claim that smoking is the result of free choice, and not an addiction.    Tobacco critics hope that the documents will arouse the public's ire. In turn, they predict, that will lead to more stringent anti-smoking legislation and more judges willing to probe deeper into the tobacco companies' internal files.    &quot;There's damaging discovery now available to every lawyer considering taking on a smokers' case,&quot; says Richard Daynard, head of a group that advocates smokers' lawsuits. Adds John Banzhaf, director of a powerful anti-smoking advocacy group, Action on Smoking and Health: &quot;These are exactly the kinds of documents we can use in legislative hearings with devastating effect.&quot;    Some legal experts see parallels to asbestos litigation. Asbestosis victims also lost a series of cases early on. But trial by trial, their lawyers amassed a body of evidence of foul play by the asbestos industry that later yielded a victory at trial. The most damaging pieces of evidence came from the companies' own files, and detailed their efforts to suppress early studies of the dangers of asbestos.    The defendants in the Newark case -- Liggett, Philip Morris Inc. and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Inc. unit -- are livid. They complain that tobacco foes are taking snippets of evidence out of context. The companies will present their defense in the trial in mid-April.    &quot;This case isn't about Rose Cipollone anymore,&quot; Peter Bleakley, a lawyer for Philip Morris, says in an interview. &quot;This whole thing is being orchestrated by publicity-seeking zealots to make the tobacco industry look bad.&quot;    Perhaps, but the documents do appear to contain some damaging revelations. For instance:   --A 1946 letter from a Lorillard scientist to one of the company's top executives acknowledged &quot;certain scientists and medical authorities have claimed for many years that the use of tobacco contributes to cancer.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;just enough evidence has been presented to justify the possibility of such a presumption.&quot;    A Lorillard lawyer responds that &quot;in the 1940s, the major issues for the companies was irritation and harshness of smoke, rather than the cancer scare. That's the perspective in which you have to read this memo.&quot;    --A 1961 memo written by Arthur D. Little andamp; Co., a consulting firm retained by Liggett, stated: &quot;There are biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco that are (a) cancer causing (b) cancer promoting (c) poisonous (d) stimulating, pleasurable, and flavorful.&quot;    A Liggett lawyer won't comment on the memo, other than to say: &quot;There's no evidence that this (memo) was ever shipped to Liggett.&quot;    --A former research scientist for Liggett testified that the company developed a less carcinogenic cigarette in the 1970s, but didn't market the cigarette because it feared the new cigarette would &quot;seriously indict the company&quot; for selling its other brands, and leave the company vulnerable to smokers' lawsuits.    A Liggett spokesman says the company decided not to market the cigarette partly because leading health organizations were concerned about the additives that made the cigarette less carcinogenic.    --A confidential 1981 Philip Morris memo proposed a national advertising campaign to &quot;reinforce the smoker&quot; by &quot;attacking bad research, (and) attacking researchers themselves, where vulnerable.&quot;    A Philip Morris lawyer says the 1981 proposal was never adopted.    --A 1972 Philip Morris internal memo from Willian Dunn, a company research scientist, described the reasons people smoke, using what he termed a &quot;drug-like conceptualization of the cigarette.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine. . . Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine. . . Think of a puff of smoke as the vehicle of nicotine.&quot;    A Philip Morris lawyer says &quot;this was just one guy in a very very low-level position in a little corner of a very big research department. What he said is about as far from what the company thought as you can get.&quot; The company, the lawyer says, &quot;certainly did not regard its consumers as junkies.&quot;    --A 1971 Philip Morris internal memo from F. J. Ryan Jr., an associate research scientist, noted the problems smokers encounter in trying to quit. &quot;This is not the happy picture painted by the Cancer Society's anti-smoking commercial which shows an exuberant couple. . . kicking their heels with joy. . . A more appropriate commercial would show a restless, nervous, constipated husband bickering viciously with his bitchy wife, who is nagging him about his slothful behavior and growing waistline.&quot;    A Philip Morris lawyer says: &quot;I'm not going to interpret that. We'll have to see what the jury says.&quot;    Tobacco foes are wasting no time in spreading the documents. The Tobacco Products Litigation Project in Boston, which promotes smokers' lawsuits, is rushing to distribute copies of the material to lawyers, stock analysts, anti-smoking activists, legislators and the media in the U.S., Canada and Europe.    In response to the new documents, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, announced late last week that his panel will launch an investigation to determine whether the tobacco industry deceived Congress about its knowledge of the health risks of tobacco in the 1960s and 1970s. Hearings are tentatively set for May.    Meanwhile, Liggett won't discuss its defense strategy in the Cipollone trial. But Philip Morris and Lorillard say they plan to use a defense that has worked well for the industry in the three other cases that have been tried in recent years: That Rose Cipollone's lung cancer was unusual and wasn't caused by smoking and that she freely chose to smoke and, thus, her family can't blame the cigarette manufacturers for her death.    &quot;Even in 1988,&quot; a defense lawyer told the jury in his opening statement, &quot;cancer is very much a mystery to medical science.&quot; (During opening arguments, the tobacco companies also put on a slide show that featured, among other things, a picture of Indians offering a peace pipe to Columbus.)    Even the most ardent tobacco foes privately concede there's little chance the tobacco companies will lose this case. Mr. Cipollone's case was seriously weakened in a series of pre-trial rulings. In one, a federal appeals court ruled that the government-mandated warnings on cigarette packages, in effect since 1966, protect the industry from claims that they failed to warn consumers of the hazards of smoking.    Then, just before trial, the trial judge barred Mr. Cipollone from using a novel legal theory that cigarettes were unreasonably dangerous because the risks of smoking outweigh the benefits. The New Jersey Legislature had passed a law striking down that doctrine in mid-1987. In November, Judge Sarokin ruled that the new law was retroactive, affecting even those claims filed before the law was passed, such as Mr. Cipollone's.    As a result, Marc Edell, Mr. Cipollone's lawyer, was left with a complaint that the companies should have warned the public of whatever they knew about the risks of smoking before 1966, when the warnings went on the packages.    The Cipollone documents may not be enough to secure a plaintiff's victory; most of them do not date back to before 1966. But scores of other smokers' lawsuits are pending in state and federal courts around the U.S. Several of the lawyers pressing those cases say they hope to use the material as a wedge to gain more access to tobacco companies' files.    Miles Lord, a former federal judge and now a plaintiffs' lawyer in Minneapolis, says: &quot;The revelations of the Cipollone case may goad other judges&quot; into permitting plaintiffs' attorneys to more aggressively seek tobacco companies' internal documents. &quot;Some judge somewhere,&quot; Mr. Lord adds, is going to appoint a special master to dig into the tobacco companies' files and find out exactly what they knew (about smoking and cancer) and when.&quot; A special master is a court-appointed official who oversees discovery.    Tobacco-industry lawyers scoff at that suggestion.&quot;That statement is based on the faulty premise that the plaintiffs' lawyers haven't gotten all the &quot;bad stuff&quot; from the tobacco companies' files,&quot; Philip Morris' Mr. Bleakley said. &quot;I can't imagine a case being prosecuted any more aggressively than this.&quot; He says that he &quot;he has no reason to believe&quot; that there are additional relevant documents that haven't been made public. He adds: &quot;The plaintiffs' bar has taken its best shot with this case, and if they can't win with this, I think that's the end of tobacco litigation.&quot;    Tobacco-litigation proponents also contend that the Cipollone documents will make it less expensive for lawyers to press smokers' lawsuits. Many lawyers had shied away from these cases because of the exorbitant cost of digging into tobacco companies' files.    (In product-liability cases, lawyers typically pay all expenses, and collect one-third of the award or settlement, plus expenses, if the plaintiff wins.)    Mr. Edell spent nearly five years and reportedly $600,000 sifting through tobacco-company files for evidence. Now, other plaintiffs lawyers can use their resources to probe even deeper. &quot;The cost of handling a smokers' case just dropped way down,&quot; Tobacco Products Litigation Project's Mr. Daynard said.    The Cipollone documents are likely to haunt the tobacco industry outside the courtroom, too. Action on Smoking and Health is preparing packages of the documents -- all 400 pages -- for mailing to affiliates in the U.S., Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.    &quot;What little credibility the tobacco companies have left with the public will be destroyed,&quot; Mr. Banzhaf, executive director of ASH, says. &quot;These kinds of documents really inflame the public.&quot;    ---                 Lawyer's Views On Liability    A survey of lawyers found:    -- 19.3% think tobacco companies should be liable for    smokers' addictions and illnesses    -- 20.3% think companies should be liable even if there    is proof that smoking causes the illness    -- 29.1% think tobacco advertising should be admitted as    evidence against the companies in a liability suit    -- 16.9% favor establishment of a victim's compensation    fund paid by the tobacco companies   Source: ABA Journal</TEXT></DOC>
