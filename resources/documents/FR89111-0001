The marketing agreement and order areauthorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended[7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 andDepartmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major''rule under criteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small business will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 120 handlers of Colorado Area 2 potatoes subjectto regulation under the marketing order, and approximately 290 potato producersin the San Luis Valley (Area 2) of Colorado. The Small Business Administration[13 CFR 121.2] has defined small agricultural producers as those havingannual gross revenue for the last three years of less than $500,000, andsmall agricultural service firms are defined as those whose gross annualreceipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers and producersof Colorado potatoes may be classified as small entities. The San Luis Valley Potato Administrative Committee Area 2 estimated thatshipments during the 1987-88 season totaled 29,685 loads at about 480 hundredweight(cwt.) per load. Of the total, about 97 percent or 13,884,416 cwt., enteredthe fresh market and three percent (364,339 cwt.) was shipped to processors.The breakdown of shipments by variety was about 69.6 percent CentennialRussets, about 23.6 percent Russet Burbanks, about 6.7 percent reds, andabout 0.2 percent other varieties. One percent of the fresh movement was seed potatoes. The grade compositionof the remaining fresh shipments was 63 percent U.S. No. 1, 21 percentU.S. Commercial, 13 percent U.S. No. 2, and two percent U.S. No. 1/SizeB. The handling requirements for fresh market shipments of Colorado Area 2potatoes are specified in andSection; 948.386 [53 FR 8146, March 14, 1988]and, with the exception of the maturity requirements, are in effect allyear long. Currently, round variety potatoes must grade at least U.S. No.2 and be at least 2\1/8\ inches in diameter. Russet Burbank potatoes mustgrade at least U.S. No. 2 and be at least 1\7/8\ inches in diameter. Allother long varieties must be U.S. No. 2 or better grade and 2 inches minimumdiameter or 4 ounces minimum weight. All varieties of potatoes may be SizeB if they otherwise grade U.S. No. 1. Size B potatoes have a minimum diameterof 1\1/2\ inches and a maximum diameter of 2\1/4\ inches. All varietiesof potatoes being exported must be at least 1\1/2\ inches in diameter.Maturity requirements during the period August 25 through October 31 specifythat potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 cannot be more than ``moderately skinned,''and potatoes grading other than U.S. No. 2 cannot be more than ``slightlyskinned.'' This interim final rule reduces the minimum size requirement for long varietypotatoes, except for the Centennial Russet and Russet Burbank varieties,from 2 to 1\7/8\ inches in diameter. This change was unanimously recommendedby the San Luis Valley Potato Administrative Committee Area 2.Until recently, virtually all long type potatoes grown in the productionarea were either of the Russet Burbank or Centennial Russet variety. Becausethese two varieties have different physical characteristics, differentsize requirements were established for each. The Russet Burbank, whichis longer and thinner than the Centennial Russet, is required to be atleast 1\7/8\ inches in diameter. Other long varieties, including the CentennialRusset, are currently required to be at least 2 inches in diameter.This year, a number of new varieties of long potatoes were planted in theSan Luis Valley, including the Russet Norkotah, Russet Nugget, Nooksack,and Targhee. During harvest of the crop, it was found that these otherlong varieties are more similar in size and shape to the Russet Burbankthan the Centennial Russet. The committee therefore recommended that thesevarieties be subject to the 1\7/8\-inch minimum diameter size requirementestablished for Russet Burbanks rather than the 2-inch minimum set forother long varieties.The industry estimates that absent this change, about 15 to 18 percentof these new variety potatoes would be precluded from being shipped tofresh outlets. This action is therefore expected to increase the amountof marketable potatoes and improve returns to growers. This change is notexpected to adversely affect the market for larger potatoes.Section 8e of the Act requires that when certain domestically producedcommodities, including Irish potatoes, are regulated under a Federal marketingorder, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade,size, quality, or maturity requirements. Section 8e also provides thatwhenever two or more marketing orders regulating a commodity produced indifferent areas of the United States are concurrently in effect, the Secretaryshall determine which of the areas produces the commodity in most directcompetition with the imported commodity. Imports then must meet the qualitystandards set for that particular area.Because the current import regulation [andSection; 980.1], specifies thatimport requirements for long types be based on those in effect for potatoesgrown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon[7 CFR Part 945] during each month of the marketing year, this change inthe handling regulation for Colorado Area 2 potatoes will not affect potatoimport requirements.Based on the above, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the informationand recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information,it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuatethe declared policy of the act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 533, it is also found and determined upon good causethat it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interestto give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and thatgood cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this actionuntil 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for the following reasons: (1) Shipments of longvariety potatoes have begun, and this relaxation of requirements shouldapply to as many shipments as possible; (2) potato handlers are aware ofthis action which was unanimously recommended by the committee at a publicmeeting, and they will not need additional time to comply with the changedrequirements; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day commentperiod, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to thefinalization of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 948</ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Potatoes, Colorado.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 948 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 948_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN COLORADO</ITAG>1.
