 the computingcontagion, familiarly known as a virus, has become a particular plague to thepersonal computer population, among which an ounce of prevention is oftenworth more than a pound of processing power.andM;The threat posed by computer viruses is especially menacing to government andfinancial services institutions, which need an extra dose of security to helpprotect their highly sensitive systems and networks.andP;  But while the threatfrom viruses is very real, it doesn't pay to overreact or underreact to thisperil.andP;  Instead, whaths called for are some simple precautions that promotesafe computing practices.andM;In its most basic form, a computer virus is a piece of harmful code that ishidden in an otherwise normal program.andP;  Viruses generally have three commoncharacteristics.andP;  First, the code is designed to trigger some type ofpreprogrammed event--frequently malicious, disruptive or destructive innature.andP;  Second, that event is generally begun by a trigger mechanism, suchas the date or some operation of the host program.andP;  Third, like itsbiological counterpart, computer viruses can propagate themselves and spreadto other programs, making them particularly harmful because they can beacquired and transmitted unknowingly.andP;  To an unsuspecting user, an infectedprogram looks and acts like an ordinary program until some event triggers itsdamaging action.andM;Even when no destruction is intended, viruses generally compromise theintegrity and availability of the systems they infect.andP;  By replicating oftenenough, even so-called benign viruses have slowed network response times andcrashed systems.andP;  Nevertheless, you can usually minimize the damage from avirus by knowing what to look for and what to do.andM;Experience shows that infected systems often exhibit similar symptoms.andP;  So,watch for the following telltale warning signs:andM;* A decrease in available address space,andM;* A decline in processing speeds or response times,andM;* Unexplained errors that crop up for unexplained reasons,andM;* A massive system failure,andM;* Blank screens or invalid calculations,andM;* Similar problems that occur at multiple locations,andM;* Visual screen messages such as &quot;gotcha.&quot;andM;If you suspect a virus, you should first try to isolate and contain it.andO;Never take suspect programs, data or their backup to another machine to seeof they work there.andP;  Instead, examine the programs for virus code.andP;  Do thisexamination manually or use a virus filter program.andM;Keep in mind that recovery may be time consuming--particularly if your mostrecent backup is infected--and could involve either reformatting hard disks,reconstructing programs by using original copies or restoring data from acontrolled or older generation of backup.andM;Not only is the threat from viruses real, it promises to increase assoftware, data and systems continue to become more extensivelyinterconnected.andP;  While a virus can infect any type of system, micros andminis have been the hardest hit to date.andP;  That's because users of thesesystems frequently share computing resources, which makes these systemsespecially vulnerable to infection.andM;Control of resources and the way in which systems are shared are the keys toeffective risk management.andP;  While isolation provides the best form ofprotection, it sometimes isn't practical in today's world of cooperative anddistributed processing.andP;  So, to avoid infection, you should be very carefulabout whom you choose to share system resources with.andP;  This precaution canoffer some degree of insulation and reduce your risk of a virus attack.andM;To further reduce your risk, you should strive to promote safe computingpractices within your organization.andP;  To begin with, you should regularly backup your software and data.andP;  Avoid swapping or sharing your software ore usingpublic domain or bulleting board programs.andP;  Beware of freebie programs fromassociates, no matter how well meaning they may be.andM;It's a good idea to make sure your software comes in a sealed package fromreputable suppliers.andP;  You should also only load programs and data fromdiskettes that you know are good and have been kept in a secure place.andP;  Onthe hardware side, control physical and logical access to your PC.andP;  Alwaysknow who uses your machines.andP;  And Keep confidential and sensitive data ondiskettes, not on disks, that are stored away from your PC.andM;By following these preventive, proactive steps, you can protect yourself fromvirulent viruses that promise to be the plauge of the information-processingage.andP;  That plague could have the most devastating effects on the governmentand financial services community, which should begin today to be proactiveand become prepared for possible virus troubles tomorrow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
