Constitution: Thedevice according to the present invention is constituted by disposinga coil connected with a magnetic field power source to the outer circumferenceof an outer cathode vessel, so that axial magnetic fields are formedto the inside of the outer cathode vessel. With such a device, thermoelectronsreleased from the thermocathode downwardly collide against gaseous radioactivewastes at high probability while moving spirally by the magnetic fields.The thus formed gas ions are solidified by sputtering in the cathodein the vessel.
