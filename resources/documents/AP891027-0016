Gorbachev's offer to reduce nuclearweapons in the Baltic Sea carries little military risk for theSoviets and fits into their plans to reduce global tension andjustify needed defense cuts at home, say Bush administrationofficials.   Gorbachev faces huge economic problems and needs to reducemilitary spending to help solve them, Assistant Secretary of StateRaymond G. Seitz said Thursday.   And one Pentagon source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the Soviets can use nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, bombersor cruise missiles to hit the same European targets as the missilescarried aboard the submarines Gorbachev proposed eliminating.   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union had removed two Golf-classsubmarines from the Baltic and would destroy the remaining four bythe end of the year.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Gorbachev's proposalmade in Finland appeared well-intentioned but might require greatercuts by the Atlantic Alliance than by the Soviet bloc.   ``We do not believe nuclear-free zones contribute to security inEurope,'' he said.   Despite the brushoff to the proposed nuclear reduction in theBaltics, the Bush administration notified the Soviet Union it iswilling to discuss an offer by Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzeto curtail military bases in Europe.   ``We support that aim and are willing to work with them topreserve their security through political rather than militarymeans,'' the State Department said in a statement. The statementnoted that previous proposals have appeared aimed at theelimination of U.S. bases on foreign soil, which the departmentsaid ``we cannot accept.''   Seitz, addressing a conference organized by the WashingtonJournalism Center, withheld final judgment of Gorbachev's Balticsstatement. But he noted that in 1986 and 1987, the Soviet leadermade a number arms control proposals turned out to be ``sleights ofhand.''   ``There hasn't been much of this in the last six months or so,''Seitz said. ``In the year or two preceding that, there was almostan arms control initiative a week. And a lot of them were made forrather propagandist, political purposes rather than with theserious intention of dealing with the hard arms control issue.''   Serious arms control proposals made by Gorbachev, designed tocut conventional forces or move forward on a proposed StrategicArms Reduction Treaty, reflect his need to cut the Soviet defensebudget, said Seitz.   Gorbachev is ``driven by two considerations, the first being thesheer weight of military expenditure,'' said Seitz.   ``If you had to pick one single explanation for the huge budgetdeficit in the Soviet Union, and for the arthritic economic pace inthe Soviet Union, it would be the disproportionate amount ofmilitary expenditure, and that simply has got to be gotten undercontrol,'' Seitz said.   The Soviet military consumes up to 17 percent of gross nationalproduct, about twice the ratio spent by the Pentagon, according tothe Central Intelligence Agency. That means that because the U.S.economy is about twice the size of the Soviet, the superpowersspend about the same amount on defense.   Gorbachev's second consideration, said Seitz, has a broaderpolitical purpose: ``Attempting to go through with what is amassive effort to restructure not only the Soviet economy butSoviet psychology, requires non-threatening, relatively safe,stable, predictable external circumstances so that all the energyand attention can be devoted to attempting to change the SovietUnion.''   Gorbachev, addressing a group of Finnish politicians andbusinessmen, said Thursday ``we are prepared to come to agreementwith all the nuclear powers and the Baltic states on effectiveguarantees for the nuclear-free status of the Baltic Sea.''   According to the Pentagon, the Soviets had four of the agingdiesel-powered Golf-2 submarines in the Baltic. Each can deliverthree SS-N-5 ballistic missiles on targets in Europe, according thePentagon book, Soviet Military Power.   Pentagon officials declined to say whether the U.S. military hadany nuclear weapons in the Baltic Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
