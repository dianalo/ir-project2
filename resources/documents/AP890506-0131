But he avoided any mentionof his Iran-Contra conviction.   The event was sponsored by conservatives among Miami'sNicaraguan and Cuban immigrants, who are helping pay North's legalbill stemming from a 2{-year battle against charges that he misledCongress and illegally accepted money from arms merchants.   It was the former Marine lieutenant colonel's first scheduledpublic appearance since a federal jury in Washington convicted himThursday on three of the 12 counts he faced during the three-monthtrial.   North used most of his 20-minute speech to criticize Congress,suggesting it was giving Central America away to the communists andaccusing House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other members ofacting like secretaries of state.   ``They have too many people in it who decided to becomesecretaries of state ... and too many who would usurp the powers ofthe presidency that were granted to the president in (the)Constitution,'' North said.   ``We have a situation today where the Speaker of the House feelslike he has a role in negotiating with the adversaries of thiscountry,'' he said.   North contrasted Congress' support of the freedom fightersfighting a Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan with its refusalto do the same in Nicaragua.   ``As a consequence of that, thousands of young brave men andwomen of the Nicaraguan resistance were abandoned in the field ofbattle,'' he said.   ``When the revolution without frontiers that has been promisedin Central America by the Sandinistas succeeds, it won't be on mywatch. ... It will be on our children's.''   North's only reference to his legal situation was indirect,coming when he criticized the Congress and the special prosecutor'soffice for spending $40 million on investigating the Iran-Contraaffair. He said the money would better have been spent supportingthe Contras.   Sitting at the head table with North was indicted CIA agentJoseph Fernandez. North called for the audience to give financialsupport to Fernandez, who faces trial in Virginia on charges ofillegally aiding the Contras.   About 850 people cheered and applauded North, giving him astanding ovation and chanting ``Ollie, Ollie'' when he wasintroduced for his speech.   North was convicted of supplying Congress with a falsechronology of the Iran-Contra events, shredding documents to coverup the deceit and accepting a $13,800 home security system fromRichard Secord, who still faces trial for his part in shippingweapons to Iran.   The $100-per-person fund-raiser was sponsored by ConcernedCitizens for Democracy, led by Cuban-American importer CarlosPerez, and the Miami Medical Team. The groups hope to raise$500,000 for North.   Former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub _ whose fund-raising effortsfor \he Contras also surfaced during a congressional probe of theaffair _ is listed as a member of the first group's advisory board.Singlaub has long been active in raising money for anti-communistcauses around the world.   Miami, headquarters for the Contra fighters that the formerNational Security Council aide worked so hard to support, remains ahotbed of pro-North sentiment. But the area also helped lead to hisdownfall.   In early 1986, months before the crash of a C-130 cargo plane inNicaragua helped lead to the Iran-Contra plot's unraveling, the FBIand the U.S. attorney's office here were investigating illegal armssmuggling to the Contras.   Then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldman, in prosecuting aroutine weapons case, stumbled on connections among drug dealers,the Contras, now-jailed Cost Rican rancher John Hull and variousU.S. agencies, including the CIA and North's NSC.   Feldman eventually drew up a chart with North's name at the topof the illegal gun-running effort and tried to pursue a legal caseagainst those involved. That later led to charges thatthen-Attorney General Edwin Meese tried to halt the investigation.That case is still in the hands of the special prosecutors's officein Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
