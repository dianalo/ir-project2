<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-70-0974 </DOCNO><TEXT>It was shown that defects produced during low-alloy steel automatic submerged-arcwelding with an austenitic strip electrode and during annealing couldbe detected by acoustic emission. Using suitable acoustic emission equipmentand based on experience, the device parameters can be selected for thecladding process not to produce spurious background during measurement.Significant sources of acoustic emission signals are crack initiationin slags and scales. Acoustic signal transmission through a long hornwas successfully tested. Cold, annealing and larger hot cracks and othersimilar defects are assumed to be detected in welding using current acousticemission equipment. An 8-channel acoustic emission machine of Czechoslovakmake is expected to achieve a more exact analysis of welding and annealingeffect. The experimentally obtained results will fully be applied intesting the machine in technical practice. (author). 9 figs., 3 tabs.,12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
