Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC CNG JUS </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Donald Sturm, chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Can Co., with helping a friend trade on inside information about an impending takeover that Mr. Sturm learned of from a daughter then employed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    According to a complaint filed by the SEC with the federal court in New York, Mr. Sturm in November 1985 learned from his daughter at Drexel that Aviation Group Inc. was about to be acquired by Primark Corp. Drexel had been hired earlier in the year to help Aviation Group find a buyer.    Neither Mr. Sturm's friend nor Drexel was identified in the complaint. The SEC's court filing refers only to &quot;Aviation's Investment Banker,&quot; but a Drexel spokesman confirmed that Drexel is that firm. Mr. Sturm's daughter was identified only as &quot;a relative.&quot;    In the court papers, Mr. Sturm neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations. He agreed to pay a total of $282,000 in penalties and to pay an amount equal to his friend's profits, and also agreed not to violate securities laws in the future.    Mr. Sturm's secretary said he was traveling in Europe and couldn't be reached, but his office released a three-sentence statement in which he denied the SEC's charges.    &quot;I didn't pass on, nor did I ever possess, material non-public information, nor did I know that merger negotiations were under way,&quot; Mr. Sturm's statement said. &quot;After months of effort to convince the SEC that it has drawn the wrong conclusions, and knowing that I did nothing wrong, I have nonetheless chosen to settle the matter rather than dispute it any further. I am settling so that I, my family, and other innocent people can get on with life and be spared the hurt and publicity that protracted litigation would cost.&quot;    Continental Can, one of the nation's biggest packaging concerns, is a unit of Peter Kiewit Son's Inc., a closely held Omaha-based holding company of which Mr. Sturm is vice chairman.    Jerry Isenberg, an SEC attorney who worked on the case, expressed some surprise at Mr. Sturm's statement, saying, &quot;It does violate the spirit of the consent decree&quot; under which Mr. Sturm neither admitted nor denied guilt. Mr. Isenberg added: &quot;It is a matter of concern to us.&quot; He declined to discuss why neither Mr. Sturm's daughter nor his friend were charged, or why Drexel wasn't identified in the complaint.    The Drexel spokesman said, &quot;the former employee wasn't charged, and Drexel had no involvement whatsoever.&quot; He declined to make further comment.    According to the SEC's complaint, Mr. Sturm learned late in 1985 from his daughter that Aviation Group was about to be acquired. The complaint doesn't say whether the tip was intentional, and people familiar with the case declined to say.    On Nov. 6, 1985, having recommended that his friend purchase shares of Aviation Group, Mr. Sturm then helped the friend open an account at a brokerage firm, the SEC said. The suit doesn't name the firm, and Mr. Isenberg declined to identify it. Over the following week, Mr. Sturm's friend purchased 30,000 shares at prices of $17.25 to $18.50.    On Nov. 13, Aviation agreed to be acquired by Primark for $23 a share, or about $128.8 million. The friend sold all 30,000 shares on Nov. 18 for a profit of about $128,000, the complaint says.    Mr. Sturm also helped his friend finance the purchases, first by lending the friend $95,000, and then by having a bank he owned lend an additional $455,500, according to the SEC.    &quot;It was his recommendation, and he financed it,&quot; said the SEC's Mr. Isenberg. &quot;Essentially, it was a gift to a friend.&quot;    Separately, Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney in New York, told a congressional subcommittee that more resources should be devoted to fighting insider trading and other white-collar crime. Insider trading, he told the House Finance Subcommittee, is &quot;a problem that has at least some systemic dimension to it.&quot;    Mr. Giuliani also testified that if his office had more resources, it could pursue more instances of insider trading. &quot;What we have are allegations that we normally would follow up on,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot more (cases) that could be developed that (aren't) being developed because the resources aren't there.&quot;    Mr. Giuliani differed with SEC chairman David Ruder, who also appeared before the panel, over the value of offering bounty payments to people informing on inside traders, with the U.S. attorney endorsing the idea and the SEC chief expressing reservations.    In a related discussion, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the SEC, said he is concerned by recent congressional efforts to trim the agency's budget. Rep. Dingell said he is &quot;contemplating&quot; proposing legislation that would allow the SEC to finance its operations with the fees it charges to companies that make filings with it, rather than turn those fees over to the Treasury. </TEXT></DOC>
