 FIPS 157 is aimed at the governmentsector but can readily be applied to private-industry use,especially in gray scale reproduction and resolution.andP;  Testtargets can demonstrate reproduction conditions that are too darkor have too much contrast.andP;  The three FIPS 157 test targets arethe #2 AIIM Scanner Test Charts, which test scan-area size, pagealignment, font reproduction, vertical and horizontal lines, andhalftone reproductions; the IEEE Facsimile test Chart; and theRochester Institute of Technology Process Ink Gamut chart.andO;Organizations can use the FIPS 157 guideline to monitor theirscanners' condition.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ScanningImage processingImaging TechnologyGuidelinesHardware Selection.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Guide to Quality ScanningandM;In processing data for either document management or electronic publishingsystems, more and more organization are coming to rely on image scanners.andO;This increasing reliance has raised the crucial issue ofreliability--controlling the quality of scanned images that result from thispopular paper document input device.andP;  Addressing quality control, which iscritical to the cost effectiveness of document management systems, is arecently published Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS) guideline.andM;The guideline's goal is to help organizations maintain cost-effectiveproduction with document systems by maximizing scanning quality andthroughput.andP;  It fulfills that objective by providing managers with a methodof evaluating the visual density, tone reproduction and resolution of imagescanners typically used in an office environment.andM;FIPS Publication 157, &quot;Guideline for Quality Control of Image Scanners,&quot;assists users in setting up their own quality control program for calibratingand testing monochrome, digital 8.5 X 11-inch image scanners.andP;  The programcan also help users adjust scanner operating conditions on a daily basis.andM;FIPS 157 adopts a voluntary industry standards, formerly known as theAmerican National Standard for Information and Image Management &quot;RecommendedPractice for Quality Control of Image Scanners, ANSI/AIIM MS44-1988.&quot;andP;  Thisstandard, developed with the help of the Washington, D.C.-based NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology, contains test targets and proceduresthat users can apply to ensure acceptable image quality levels.andM;The guideline's image-scanning test procedures and targets are aimed at thefederal sector.andP;  Departments and agencies are therefore encouraged to use theevaluation methods when they acquire new scanning hardware and software; whenthey revise their existing scanning systems; or when they procure externalservices to convert printed documents into electronic images.andM;The guideline could be applied, for example, to gauge such scanner featuresas gray scale reproduction and resolution.andP;  In this case, the test targetscould be used to demonstrate the effect of tone and resolution by providingthe test elements necessary to isolate gray scale values and resolutiondifferences that are noticeable to the human eye.andM;FIPS 157 procedures can be used to assess the appearance of reproductions.andO;Using the test targets, a reproduction condition that is too dark or has toomuch contrast, for example, can be demonstrated and scanner parameters canthen be adjusted appropriately.andP;  When the test targets are scanned, thesystem will output a visual reproduction that can be used for purposes ofcomparison.andM;FIPS 157 consists of three test targets:andM;* The #2 Association for Image and Information Management (AIIM) Scanner TestCharts;andM;* The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 167A-1987Facsimile Test Chart;andM;* The Rochester institute of Technology (RIT) Process Ink Gamut (PIG) Chart.andM;All of these targets are printed on photo-and text-weight printing paper.andO;Ten copies of the AIIM target, one copy of the IEEE target and two copies ofthe RIT target are included in the guideline.andM;The new standard covers some of the concepts that are involved with producingcustom test targets that match image characteristics of documents input forproduction scanning.andP;  The guideline also identifies and describes theindividual elements of the test targets in terms of how they're used andevaluated in testing.andP;  It's important to note that reproductions of the FIPS157 targets will not provide meaningful results for comparison in a qualitycontrol program.andM;The guideline, which describes other procedures for establishing a qualityreference, also provides recommendations on record maintenance and testingfrequency, along with suggestions about how to set up a test scanning run.andO;Also covered are special techniques for scanning low-contrast material.andO;Methods for preparing continuous tone images for scanning are explained, andvarious issues concerning resolution and system thresholding/enhancementcharacteristics are detailed.andM;By using the guideline, organizations can monitor the conditions of theirscanners and keep an eye on how its features are functioning.andP;  Thismonitoring mechanism is particularly important when a scanner is integratedinto a complete publishing system that includes page-design and retrievalsoftware, mass storage and printing components.andP;  And organizations that gainexperience using the FIPS 157 targets and procedures will be able to providemore effective systems implementations because they will be in a much betterposition to appraise the advantages and disadvantages of new documentscanners and features that become available on the market.andM;Jean Baronas is a computer systems analyst in the Office Systems Group of theNational Computer Systems Laboratory, which is a part of the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
