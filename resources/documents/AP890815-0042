(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chief of the Abenaki Indians said ajudge's decision to grant the group fishing rights is one steptoward winning back land claimed by the tribe.   ``This victory is for fishing rights,'' said tribal chief HomerSt. Francis. ``Now we'll be fighting for our land.''   The ruling by Vermont District Judge Joseph Wolchik recognizedthe Abenaki's aboriginal fishing rights dating back 11,000 years.   It dismissed fish and game violations filed two years ago by thestate against several tribe members. The state contended thetribespeople had no right to fish without the state license requiredof other people.   The Abenakis number about 2,500 and live primarily innorthwestern Vermont.   Wolchik said the state failed to prove the tribe ``abandoned orceded their Missisquoi homeland or that their aborginal rights wereextinguished by either an express act or an act clearly andunambiguously implying any sovereign's intent to extinguish thoserights.   ``Accordingly, the Missisquoi's aborginal right to fish in theirMissisquoi homeland continues to exist today,'' he wrote.   Although the ruling dealt only with the issue of fishing rights,Gabor Rona, the tribe's lawyer said ``what makes this so monumentalfor the Abenakis is that the issues the court needed to address anddid address in this fishing case are precisely the same as would beaddressed in a land claim.''   But it was not clear whether the special status that Wolchikgranted the tribe would translate into anything more than the rightto fish.   The judge found the Abenakis do not meet the federal definitionof a dependent Indian community, a finding that could impact anyfuture land claims.   ``The available evidence leads this court to conclude thatneither the Missisquoi homeland or any part of it is Indiancountry,'' the judge said. ``The thrust of the evidence is that theMissiquoi community is thoroughly mixed if not blended into thenon-native American community.''   Andrew Eschen, an assistant attorney general, said that while theAbenakis had contested the state's criminal jurisdiction over thetribe, Wolchik found the state does have jurisdiction.   St. Francis said he would push, through the United Nations, fortotal autonomy for the tribe.   The Abenakis trace their tribe back to 9300 B.C. In recentdecades they have begun pushing to assert their right over land innorthern Vermont.   The fight has split the tribe itself, with one faction favoringmore militant stands such as tribal courts, schools and lawenforcement. That faction, led by St. Francis, is in power today.   The case originated in 1987, when Abenakis held a fish-in on thebanks of the Missisquoi River in Swanton. More than 30 people werecharged with fishing without a license or failure to display alicense.</TEXT></DOC>
