Officials said the total number of refugees on their way wouldbe around 7,000, far more than originally expected. There werereports the exodus sparked even more East Germans to try to fleevia Prague, Czechoslovakia.   An agreement between West Germany and Communist East Berlincleared the way for the exodus of thousands of East Germans who hadbeen holed up in Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw, the Polishcapital.   Hungary's decision last month to open the floodgates to EastGerman refugees already has brought more than 24,000 people to WestGermany via Austria.   Three trains arrived from Prague by 10:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. EDT),bringing the total from the first three trains to more than 3,000people. Three more trains were expected during the course of theday from Prague, carrying about 1,000 people each.   A train carrying more than 800 East German refugees from Warsawwas expected to reach West Germany at the Helmstedt border crossinglate Sunday afternoon.   Earlier reports said the number of refugees expected from Praguewas about 3,500, although officials in Hof said that figure did notinclude many of the children accompanying their parents.   In addition, Bavarian border police spokesman Klaus Papenfusssaid East Germans who had not even been at the embassies in eithercity reportedly went directly to the railroad stations to board thespecial trains.   West German officials in Prague said about 100 more East Germanssought refuge at the embassy after the compound was cleared earlySunday. Witnesses also said scores of East Germans were rushing toCzechoslovakia in cars after learning of the decision to allow theothers to leave.   Police ringed off the West German Embassy in Prague Sundaymorning to thwart any more would-be escapees.</TEXT></DOC>
