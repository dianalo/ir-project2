I was never &quot;instructed by the Israeli government not todiscuss the (Pollard) case.&quot; I said it served no one'sinterest to reopen old scars and I would not, therefore,discuss the affair. All that was left, as I saw it, was toright the wrong done Jonathan Jay Pollard by the vicioussentence given him.</LP><TEXT>   Your article reports that my apartment in Washington wasused for copying documents that Mr. Pollard supplied to hishandlers, and later links me to Rafael (Rafi) Eitan, so thatit appears I was a player. You do not report, however, that Ihad filed an affidavit in federal court in Washington inwhich I stated, under the pains and penalties of perjury,that if my apartment was used in this manner it was withoutmy knowledge or permission. That affidavit was made availableto you.   While I did act as trustee for the receipt of funds intoEuropean accounts that I was assured and believed were Dotanfamily funds, your report leaves the impression that I knewthe illicit source of those funds. I did not. There is noevidence or testimony that I was part of the activities thatgenerated the money directed to my conduit accounts. I can dono more to prove the negative. As you say, I createdcompanies at Rami Dotan's behest in 1984 or 1985. You do notmake it clear that I was not involved in the subsequentbusiness of those companies, illicit or otherwise, as indeedI was not. While by no means friendly to me in his debriefingby the police, Gen. Dotan still said that I neither knew of,nor was a part of, his General Electric Co.-relatedactivities.   I was never a director of ESA Inc., took no part in itsmanagement and, indeed, shortly after its inception was neverpresent in the U.S.; I know of no improprieties in theconduct of the company's affairs, have no reason to doubtthat the company produced and delivered all of the productsit was contractually obliged to do and that the paymentreceived for goods delivered was fair and reasonable.Finally, it was not a &quot;one-man shop,&quot; an incorrect andinvidious suggestion.   But perhaps the most grievous departure from soberintelligence is your suggesting a link among Gen. Dotan,myself and spying. It's nonsense. There are simple logicalholes in that hypothesis. Gen. Dotan was exposed by Israelipolice. If he was part of an officially orchestrated effort,why then has Israel imprisoned him for 13 years? All of themoney directed to my trustee accounts were deposited in twocorporations. Substantially all has been accounted for andrecovered. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) pursues his ownagenda. Joseph diGenova, wearing a prosecutor's hat, mayspeculate with impunity.   But only in fiction are loose ends neatly tied up in thelast chapter into a unified plot. Real life is otherwise.Coincidence abounds. My cameo appearance in the Pollardaffair and my lawyer's role in the Dotan affair do not marrythose two events.
