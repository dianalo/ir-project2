Michael Dukakis.Now, President Bush finally has put money in his budget toaddress the problem.   But the proposed $100 million to clean up the harbor,which Mr. Bush has tucked away in his spending request forthe Environmental Protection Agency, comes with a bitterpill. More than 340 pages earlier in the same budget, thepresident seeks cuts in fuel assistance for low-incomefamilies. Fuel assistance is a major priority for lawmakersfrom the Northeast.</LP><TEXT>   Such tradeoffs, often colored by political considerations,will define this year's budget debate. Because spendinglimits adopted in last fall's deficit-reduction law requirethat new initiatives be matched by cuts elsewhere, lawmakerswill have to pay closer attention than usual to the fineprint of appropriations bills.   Thus, lawmakers from the Pacific Northwest were pleased tofind $31.7 million in the president's budget to protect smallsalmon from hydroelectric turbines; but another part of thebudget would terminate a $10.2 million annual program forfish hatcheries on the Columbia River.   Similarly, in the transportation budget, Amtrak ispromised at least a modicum of funding, the first time inyears a Republican administration hasn't sought to cut offall federal funds to the national passenger railroad. Butalong with its largesse, the administration asks that localtransit systems, such as New Jersey commuter trains, doubletheir payments to help cover the cost of the rails they sharewith Amtrak in the Northeast corridor.   Similarly, in the budget for the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, the White House seeks a 65%increase in spending for research on global climate change.At a time of public concern over global warming, fewlawmakers would argue. But to find the money, theadministration proposes to terminate fire, agriculture and&quot;fruit frost&quot; weather-service operations that cost millionsof dollars but are greatly valued by farm and western states.   The administration also takes a page from the Democratswith intiatives to address infant mortality, lead-paintpoisoning, land acquisition for parks and child nutrition. A$223 million increase for the Women, Infants and Childrenprogram for pregnant women and infants will be hard forCongress to resist. Yet coming up with the money will meanless for special agricultural interests that derive fundsfrom the same spending bill.   Mr. Bush's newfound generosity for Boston harbor mayreflect the recent election of a Republican governor inMassachusetts, or a desire on the part of the president toimprove his environmental credentials going into next year'scampaign. Personal priorities of cabinet members, or ofBudget Director Richard Darman, also have had an effect onthe budget.   For instance, Commerce Secretary Robert Mossbacher, aformer Texas oil man, is seen as sensitive to that industry'simage. Last fall, Congress approved money to help assess thecleanup of Prince William Sound in Alaska. Now the CommerceDepartment proposes to double the sum to $4.5 million forfiscal 1992.   Mr. Darman is fond of high-tech, high-speed magneticlevitation trains. Between Energy and TransportationDepartment accounts, as much as $23.5 million would be setaside for &quot;maglev&quot; next year.   Lobbyists for the massive superconducting supercolliderproject hope to tap the same enthusiasm to build support fortheir much more costly project. In what could be amake-or-break year for the project, the president proposes todouble current appropriations levels. Mr. Darman's ownassessment of the project is described as mixed, butadvocates hope to bolster their case by arguing that lessonslearned from producing low-temperature magnets for thesupercollider could spill over to &quot;maglev.&quot;   Congress originally took the lead in pressing for thehigh-speed rail project. In that area and elsewhere, theadministration now finds itself catching up with prioritiesadvanced by lawmakers. For instance, highway research fundsfor futuristic traffic management projects, such as thosebeing developed in Europe and Japan, would be more thandoubled under the president's budget proposal. Last year,Congress increased the administration's request for suchfunds.   In addition, the budget includes an estimated $149million, 30% more than the current year, for high-performancecomputing systems and a national research network,longstanding favorites of Mr. Bush's potential rival in the'92 presidential race, Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.).   While most attention has focused on the new spendinglimits, last fall's budget agreement also has forced afar-reaching change in accounting for credit programs.Instead of simply authorizing loan guarantees, Congress isrequired under the new rules to allocate money to cover thecost of federal subsidies inherent in such guarantees. As aresult, credit programs for small businesses and ruralhousing, for example, must compete with conventionalspending.   The same changes will put Congress under considerablepressure to accept whatever cost-cutting reforms theadministration proposes in credit programs. The White Househas proposed increased fees and reduced guarantee levels tolimit the federal government's exposure. Lawmakers couldreject these changes, but Small Business Administrationanalysts estimate that maintaining the agency's currentloan-guarantee program in its present form would take $258million from competing domestic programs.</TEXT></DOC>
