Berry, vicepresident, Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   If not quite a day of infamy for Mr. Berry, thatparticular Dec. 7 certainly was not one of his better ones.Bank of New England rewarded his confidence by losing $1.1billion in the ensuing year because of rotten real-estateloans. Shawmut lost $128 million. The stocks of bothcompanies plunged.   About the only comfort the hapless forecaster could takewas in the knowledge that he had lots and lots of company:Few people foresaw the size and the extent of the real-estatebust. In terms of total losses for commercial and residentialdevelopers, and for their investors and lenders, the 1980swere the worst decade since the Great Depression.   But what about the 1990s?   Don't hold your breath waiting for a turnaround. Thereal-estate business isn't going to get much better -- atleast through the first half of the decade. Despite thelosses in the '80s, builders kept building and lenders keptlending. Now, both property values and construction activityare going to be depressed by two legacies of the decade -- awidespread credit crunch and a huge overhang of repossessedor troubled real estate.   The credit crunch will eventually promote recovery bylimiting new building. But in the meantime it will thin theranks of potential buyers, thus keeping prices depressed. Andthe overhang of distressed properties will continue to glutthe market for years, further keeping a lid on values. Boththe federal government and private lenders have already beguna race to the auction block, and sales of many of theirwhite-elephant properties are being made at discounts of from25% to 75% of their construction cost.   Looking at all this, a real-estate industry often notedfor unwarranted optimism now is glum. A May survey of 400real-estate executives by Ernst andamp; Young produced a consensusthat the depression in commercial real estate will continuefor five more years. And the National Association of HomeBuilders recently pared its estimate of 1990 housing startsto 1.28 million units, down from 1.81 million in 1986, thepeak year of the decade. The estimate rivals actualconstruction in 1982, when home building reached its postwarnadir.   In certain hard-hit parts of the country, home prices havefallen 25% or more in the past five years. Even Californiahas not been immune; the statewide median home price hasslipped 3% from a year ago, the first such year-to-yeardecline in five years.   &quot;It's extremely difficult to obtain financing for any kindof housing construction even if it's a gold-plated deal,&quot;says Houston builder Martin Perlman, president of theNational Association of Home Builders. He says the estimateof housing starts for 1990, already at an eight-year low,could be trimmed further.   There will, of course, be some profit opportunities in thecontinuing depression. Investors with iron guts and fullwallets will be able to pick up properties at fire-saleprices. Strong lenders will expand their market share ashard-hit rivals disintegrate or pull back. But there will bemany more losers than winners, and the biggest loser by anymeasure will be Uncle Sam -- which is to say, all taxpayers.   The taxpayer share of the total cost of the the savingsand loan bailout, prompted mainly by the collapse of thereal-estate market, will range from $340 billion to $440billion in the 1990s, according to the most comprehensiveanalysis to date, by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. inAustin, Texas. Read our lips: That is a liability of at least$1,400 for every man, woman and child in the U.S.   Though he's no Donald Trump, not long ago the big names ofNew England real-estate finance clamored to press money onHoward Fafard. &quot;They'd stand in line to offer me a lowerrate,&quot; recalls the Milford, Mass., developer. &quot;They werefighting for business.&quot;   This past April, however, one of his lenders decided togive him the business. Pressured by federal bank examiners toreduce the number of its real-estate loans, Bank of Bostonshut down his revolving credit line. When other previouslyeager lenders declined to come to his rescue, the 30-year-oldFafard Cos. landed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.   Which, more or less, is the fate of a growing number ofreal-estate developers these days. The gusher of cash thatwatered the industry -- and that led to gross overbuildingand the ensuing collapse of much of the Sandamp;L industry -- nowhas been largely shut off at the spigot by frightened lendersand their regulators. The decadelong lending binge forconstruction of homes, hotels, shopping centers, apartmentprojects and office buildings clearly is over.   Over the last six months, growth in construction loansheld by banks has come to a virtual halt, according toFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Among thrifts,meanwhile, construction loans plunged 22% in the firstquarter from the year-earlier period. A Federal Reservesurvey in May found that about 80% of the nation's banks hadtightened their real-estate lending standards.   The pullback by the banks is particularly important. Inthe gaudier days of the boom, they were only one financingsource; the Sandamp;Ls were pouring cash into the business, and asmall army of syndicators were doing the same, with moneyraised from investors in private and public offerings.Insurance companies stepped up their lending, too.   Now, much of the Sandamp;L industry is either defunct orfighting for survival, and the syndicators have either beenblown away by tax-law changes in 1986 or run into the groundby shabby performance. No new money there. Insurers, turnedon to real estate in the '80s, are now turning off. &quot;We don'tsee anything that would cause us to want to spend any moretime or energy&quot; in commercial property, says Gordon OakesJr., chairman and chief executive officer of Monarch CapitalCorp. in Springfield, Mass. The insurance firm recently setaside a $72 million reserve to cover losses from a plannedthree-year commercial-property sale.   So, in many regions, actual and prospective borrowers havebeen looking to the banks to fill the financing gap. Theyhave been disappointed, and they will continue to bedisappointed. The banks, suffering large exposures from bumreal-estate loans of their own, are a lot less interested inhelping the industry out of a hole than they are in savingtheir own skins. And even if they were so inclined, theirregulators might not let them.   The banks can hardly be blamed for slamming down thecredit window for a while. Between 1982 and 1989, they andtheir Sandamp;L brethren lost a combined $75 billion on badreal-estate loans. Among bank credit problems, real estate is&quot;public enemy No. 1,&quot; says one expert in bank securities.   Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, estimates that asmany as 15% of its commercial real-estate loans, which total$12.6 billion, could be in trouble by year end. The figurecould run even higher after a coming audit by Federal bankexaminers; in recent months they have been especiallymerciless in forcing banks to reclassify many of theirreal-estate loans as problem loans.   Which means, in effect, that it is hard to find anybodywilling to put up front money. &quot;Every previous boom-and-bustcycle in Arizona has ended because financing came in. What'sdifferent about this one is that the Sandamp;Ls have been blownout, and the banks are paralyzed,&quot; says Edward Carson,chairman and chief executive officer of First InterstateBancorp in Los Angeles, which has major real-estate loanliabilities in Arizona and several other states.   &quot;Liquidity available to the real-estate industry appearsto be at its lowest point since the end of World War II,&quot;says Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer of LomasFinancial Corp. in Dallas. He ought to know. Thefinancial-services and real-estate concern filed its ownbankruptcy-law petition last fall, and this past March took a$505 million special charge, indicating that, like many, itis still exploring the depth of its own real-estate problems.   Most of the biggest developers in the business say thatthey have been able to survive the credit crunch so far, buta continuing drought of cash would change that. The legion ofsmall builders, heavily dependent on up-front loans frombanks and Sandamp;Ls, are already in deep trouble, and some largerfirms are joining them. Projects are being abandoned orscaled back from coast to coast. &quot;Everybody today has beenhumbled,&quot; says Samuel Alpert, executive vice president ofOliver Group Inc. in Shawnee-Mission, Kan., a developer ofmultifamily housing that isn't doing much developing thesedays.   A growing minority of industry observers are now seriouslyconcerned that the credit crunch may nudge the whole nationaleconomy into recession. &quot;Liquidity was probably way too loosebefore, but now it is too tight,&quot; says Dennis Jacobe,research director for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions. &quot;I would argue that it will bring a recession.&quot;   Total returns on prime commercial space over the past yearwere less than the comparable rate on a U.S. Treasury bill,according to Frank Russell Co., a Tacoma, Wash., real-estateadviser to institutional investors. Says Blake Eagle,president of the Frank Russell real-estate-consulting group:&quot;Rhetorically, one has to ask, `Why would I invest in realestate when returns on T-bills are higher?' That is beingasked on a lot of different fronts.&quot;   Realizing this, a good part of the industry has simplygone to sleep. &quot;A lot of lenders, buyers and developers havecrawled in a hole and zipped up the cover,&quot; says JackHancock, executive vice president of the real-estateindustries group at Security Pacific National Bank in LosAngeles.   From a broader perspective, the bust is a correction thatwas long overdue; though the picture varies from region toregion, taken as a whole the current glut of commercialoffice space is so great that the nation would be adequatelyserved even if no new building took place for five or even 10years.   Making matters worse, if possible, is some $60 billion inforeclosed real estate and about $68 billion in delinquentreal estate held by banks, by thrifts and -- courtesy of theSandamp;L debacle -- by Uncle Sam, who now reluctantly runs thenation's largest real-estate operation. Each of theseentities wants to put its real-estate problems behind it, andfast. Each is afraid that the others -- particularly theResolution Trust Corp., the federal holding tank forproperties of failed institutions -- will throw so muchproperty on the market that prices will collapse.   And so all of them are rushing to the auction block, withpredictable results: Property is being dumped pell-mell onalready-depressed markets, and prices are indeed cut-rate.(Another complication: The lenders and their regulators areshooting themselves in the foot. Their tightened creditpolicies are reducing the number of eligible bidders, hurtingprices even more.)   The banks got in early. First Interstate's Texas bankingunit, for example, sold $450 million in foreclosed propertyand related assets last year. It hopes to sell at least $750million more this year, but it is fearful about theprospective impact of big RTC sales that have just begun.   &quot;Nobody knows the full impact of {the RTC sales}. There isalways a chance of a regional or national recession, andgiven that the portfolio was the size it was, we needed tomove it faster,&quot; says Allen Brown, executive vice presidentof the First Interstate unit. &quot;I think everybody will comearound to doing it this way. There is just too much propertyto be moved.&quot;   Yet another depressant for the market: Many relativelyhealthy thrifts are also being forced to sell real estate, aconsequence of the bailout law that Congress passed lastyear.   The law requires Sandamp;Ls to raise extra capital to back anydirect investments they might have in real estate; sincecapital is nearly impossible for most to raise these days,they are being forced to sell the property instead. At thesame time, the same law strictly limits the amount offinancing thrifts can offer on such sales -- which someexecutives say will greatly reduce the level of bidding.   Oak Tree Savings Bank, a New Orleans thrift, is having tosell properties with a book value of $1.08 billion. Itthought it had found a buyer for $517 million of the propertythis spring -- but the deal collapsed when the only partyinterested in financing the transaction was Oak Tree itself,which couldn't do it.   &quot;We have a fire-sale sign around our neck and a gun to ourhead. We have no chance of getting a fair price,&quot; says GeraldBarton, chairman and chief executive officer of Landmark LandCo. in Carmel, Calif., which owns Oak Tree Savings.   Some real-estate experts suspect that the insuranceindustry will be the next to get clobbered by defaults andforeclosures. David Shulman, a Salomon Brothers analyst, says1991 will be the testing time. That's when a huge amount offive-year commercial mortgages come due that were issued inthe record lending year of 1986.   &quot;Property values are declining, in many cases to levelsbelow their mortgage balance,&quot; he notes. This, he expects,will lead borrowers to exercise an option built into everynonrecourse mortgage loan -- the right to hand the buildingback to the lender in satisfaction of the current principalbalance of the loan. With this option becoming ever moreattractive as property values fall, Mr. Shulman expectsmortgage foreclosure rates for insurers to double by 1993 to2.4% from the current 1.1%.   Given all this, it's no wonder the real-estate industry isa little short on optimism. But it's an ill wind indeed thatdoesn't blow somebody some good, and amid all the worry overthe bust there are some happy faces to be seen. About 3,000of them belong to the members of the Happy Church of Denver,which in March found a new home for its evangelical ministryin the Beau Monde Shopping Center outside town. The BeauMonde cost about $30 million to build. Its developer and theSandamp;L that financed it both went belly up, and the churchwalked away with it for $7.8 million.   &quot;When we first heard about it, we thought it was much tooexpensive. But over a period of months, the price seemed tocome down to a more realistic realm for us,&quot; says KarenCutler, a church official. &quot;Certainly, the Lord blessed uswith a wonderful facility.&quot;   ---   Mr. Schmitt is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal'sSan Francisco bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
