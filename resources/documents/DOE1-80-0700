In such a cycle two components of a mixture areseparated by the supply of energy (heat or mechanical energy). The componentscan be stored at ambient temperature; consequently, there is no heatloss during storage. At the moment of heat demand, both components arerecombined to produce heat of absorption. This heat consists of the heatof mixing and the heat of condensation, provided that one of the componentsis gaseous. The required heat of evaporation is extracted from the environment.The energetic efficiency of such a cycle, related to the net heat productionand the supplied primary energy, can theoretically be over 100%. Theabsorption cycle was investigated for three different storage alternatives.In the first alternative the components are separated by heat supply.The heat of condensation of the gaseous component is transferred to theenvironment. The energetic efficiency of this cycle is less than 100%.In the second storage alternative, the heat of desorption is suppliedby a heat pump that uses the heat of condensation as a heat source. Inthe third alternative the heat of condensation is produced at such ahigh temperature that this heat can be used directly for desorption.To achieve this higher temperature, the gaseous component is condensedat a higher pressure. A compressor is applied for this purpose.</TEXT></DOC>
