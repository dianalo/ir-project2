Results of research on hydrargillitecrystallization under battery operating conditions at Alcoa Laboratories,Alcan Kingston Laboratories, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratoryare summarized and are applied to the design of an electrolyte managementsystem using lamella settlers for clarification of the electrolyte andproduct separation. The design principles were validated in a seriesof experiments that, for the first time in the aluminum-air program,demonstrated continuous operation of an integrated system consistingof cells, crystallizer, and a product-removal system. 42 refs., 88 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
