But it's not so unusual when one realizes that the drummer hasbeen playing with some of the giants in jazz since she was 10 yearsold, and her own life story already surpasses many twice her age.   She's on hiatus from ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' where she's beendrummer in the band since the late-night talk fest first aired.She's busy touring the country to promote ``Real Life Story,'' herdebut LP with a major label on Verve-Forecast Records. She composedall but two songs on the album, co-produced it with Robert IrvingIII and sings on three tracks.   It would seem to be a high point in an already illustriouscareer. But for Carrington, it's simply a turning point, part of agrand plan in which she moves from jazz prodigy to mainstream star.   ``When I was 11 or 12, one side of me wanted to be a greatdrummer and the other side wanted to be Diana Ross,'' she said. Now,it appears, both dreams may be realized.   A pretty, serene young woman, Carrington is modest, almost blase,about her impressive past. She grew up an only child in Medford,Mass., a working-class city outside Boston, where her father, SonnyCarrington, a saxophonist, introduced her to the sax when she was 5years old. ``I asked him if I could play,'' she said.   Her decision to switch to drums at age 7 was borne of necessity.   ``My teeth fell out,'' she explained during a recent interview inBoston.   By the age of 10, Carrington had begun to sit in with visitingmusicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Elvin Jonesand Oscar Peterson. That same year, Clark Terry, impressed with herability, took her to the Wichita Jazz Festival. She met drummerBuddy Rich there, who then accompanied her on the television show``To Tell the Truth.''   Two years later, she was awarded a special scholarship to theBerklee College of Music after the school's director heard her playwith Peterson. During her time at Berklee, she took courses inpiano, drums and vibes, along with harmony and composition.   In 1981 she recorded an album, ``TLC and Friends,'' with KennyBarron, Buster Williams and George Coleman. During this period,Carrington began to shape her career, shifting from a classicaltradition to one that would bring her eventual commercial success.   ``When I was 14, I had the potential; I strived to be one of thegreatest drummers, period,'' she said. ``But something happenedbetween the time I was 14 and 19. I decided I wanted to be an artist_ a singer, writer, producer.''   She graduated from high school at 16, and in 1983, moved to NewYork and played with a variety of musicians such as Stan Getz, JamesMoody, Woody Shaw and Cassandra Wilson.   Her career, she said, has always snowballed. ``In this business,you work whenever you can.''   While in New York, Carrington began to tire of acoustic jazz anddecided to move into more contemporary music. She started playingwith Wayne Shorter, co-founder of Weather Report, and last yeartoured with David Sanborn.   Carrington said she rarely got nervous playing with suchestablished musicians. Carlos Santana, Patrice Rushen and GroverWashington Jr. are among the musicians on her new album.   ``I usually put more pressure on myself than they did,'' shesaid. ``I remember Wayne would say, `It's only music, relax.' Thatchanged my outlook.''   After five years she began to dislike New York City, and recentlymoved to Los Angeles. She lives in the suburb of Glendale. Itreminds her more of the suburban neighborhood where she grew up.   In Los Angeles, the transformation from journeyman jazz musicianto budding star is in full swing. ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' broughther national celebrity. Her circle of friends include actressesDawnn Lewis of ``A Different World'' and Marsha Warfield of ``NightCourt.''   Her next album will be mostly vocals, and she plans to try someacting.   ``I'm one of those people who likes excitement, a certain kind ofedge,'' she said. ``I like that place in between being in controland being safe. I like to be daring and take chances.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, Aug. 22</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
