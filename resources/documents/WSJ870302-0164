Horton, chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Horton, in an interview, declined to make a specific earnings estimate. Profit from operations excluding unusual charges in 1986 was $499 million, or $2.13 a share, on revenue of $10.02 billion. The company had a net loss of $345 million, after extraordinary and special charges totaling $844 million after taxes.    The Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, which accounts for most of Standard's oil production, won't plateau until next year, Mr. Horton said. New studies taking into account the latest production methods continue to extend the expected life of that field, he said. Five years ago, output from Prudhoe Bay was expected to start dropping in 1986.    Standard is one of the few oil companies that expect to increase U.S. production this year and next, said Richard A. Bray, executive vice president. The company will get an additional 6,000 barrels a day this year from a new production platform in the Gulf of Mexico, he said. And before year-end, the company expects to be getting about 14,000 barrels a day from the Lisburne field, which lies beneath the Prudhoe Bay reserves, Mr. Bray said.    Late this year, the Endicott Field in Alaska will begin pumping oil, Mr. Bray said. Production quickly will build to more than 100,000 barrels a day, he said, 56% of which will belong to Standard. As a result, Standard's production of oil and natural gas liquids in 1988 will rise to about 775,000 barrels per day from 726,600 barrels per day in 1986, Mr. Bray said. Natural gas output also will rise, he said, and combined oil and gas production in 1988 will equal the equivalent of 810,000 barrels per day, up from 752,000 barrels per day last year.    Mr. Horton said that he thinks &quot;OPEC's troubles have been greatly exaggerated&quot; and that the oil cartel may succeed in defending its $18-a-barrel target price. &quot;People are overreacting,&quot; he said. &quot;We could well see a considerable bounceback (in oil prices) in the next month.&quot;    Standard's Mr. Horton said he is maintaining for planning purposes his estimate that oil prices will average about $15 a barrel for the rest of the decade. &quot;But conceivably I may be pleasurably surprised,&quot; he said.    Standard has almost completed its restructuring program, Mr. Horton said, and charges taken last year for expected restructuring &quot;came out remarkably close&quot; to actual costs.    Capital spending this year will be about the same as the $1.62 billion in 1986, Mr. Horton said, though the company will spend about $250 million less on oil and gas exploration and production. Instead, more will be spent on facilities for marketing and refining, metals mining, chemicals, engineered materials and titanium, but less on coal mining, he said.    One major 1987 capital investment will be about $260 million to modernize the Bingham Canyon copper mine in Utah. Standard spent about $70 million on Bingham Canyon last year. The cost of the project, scheduled to be completed in mid-1988, will be &quot;slightly under&quot; the budgeted $400 million, Mr. Horton said.    The mine will be the lowest-cost copper producer in North America, and also will be a major gold producer, he said. The mine is expected to produce 185,000 tons of copper annually, 260,000 ounces of gold, two million ounces of silver and eight million pounds of molybdenum annually, Standard said. Before agreeing to proceed with the modernization, Standard demanded a union contract providing lower wage rates and far less-restrictive work rules.    The company has no plans for a major stock buyback, Mr. Horton said. Rather, the company intends to increase its liquidity by retaining cash flow, to provide security during this period of unstable oil prices, he said.    He said the company will end 1987 with &quot;considerably more&quot; cash and marketable securities than the $413 million on the books Dec. 31, 1986, but he didn't specify an amount. Tax refunds and asset sales will produce more than $700 million in cash, Mr. Horton said.    Standard has been refinancing a major part of its long-term debt on the assumption that interest rates have &quot;bottomed out,&quot; Mr. Horton said. The company's net interest expense in 1987 will decline about one-third from the $242 million of 1986, officials said.    Standard cut its drilling program in half last year compared with 1985, but managed to maintain its increase in reserves, Mr. Bray said. The 1987 drilling level will be &quot;up slightly from 1986,&quot; he said.    The three most active programs are oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, gas drilling in the Anadarko basin and development of a gas field in Canada, Mr. Bray said. In addition, this year the company will drill its first well in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Qatar, he said. Standard has a 3.5 million-acre tract near Qatar on which it has already done extensive seismic study. </TEXT></DOC>
