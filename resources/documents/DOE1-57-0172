<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0172 </DOCNO><TEXT>The feasibility of using the combination of Particle Induced X-ray Emission(PIXE) and Rutherford Backscattrering (RBS) to measure uranium and thoriumin environmental and biological samples is presented. The microdistributionof uranium-bearing particles in biological tissues is also discussedbecause of its importance in evaluating local alpha radiation doses inthe lungs of former and present uranium miners and millers. These particleshave been localized in lungs using neutron induced uranium fission tracksregistered in SSNTD (solid state nuclear track detectors) in associationwith a microPIXE-RBS combination.
