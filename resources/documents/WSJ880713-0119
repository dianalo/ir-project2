The Nasdaq composite index of 4,639 stocks closed at 393.52, down 0.63. Volume was 132.9 million shares, well below the average trading volume in June of 141.6 million shares; 38.6 million shares rose and 48.2 million declined.    &quot;Portfolio managers seem to have backed away from the market, and trading is only on some kind of news or other,&quot; said Jerry Newman, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco.    Xidex, the day's most active stock, gained 1 3/8 to 9 on 4.3 million shares after announcing it had signed a letter of intent with Anacomp to be acquired for $10 a share, or a total of more than $400 million.    Westwood One, one of the day's biggest losers, fell 1 5/8 to 11 5/8 on 1.6 million shares after reporting a 75% decline in second-quarter earnings. Traders said there was heavy institutional selling in the stock, which dropped as low as 10 3/4 during the day. The Culver City, Calif., radio-network operator also fell because Hambrecht andamp; Quist, the company's underwriter, sharply lowered its earnings estimate for the third quarter, ending in August, and for the rest of the year.    &quot;Although a decline in earnings was expected, the severity wasn't,&quot; said Dennis McAlpine of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York. The weakness that began in the radio-network business in May has lasted longer than anticipated, Mr. McAlpine said, but &quot;initial orders for advertising for August seem to have picked up.&quot;    Westwood One is beginning a multicity presentation to institutional investors to discuss its problems.    Micron Technology, another of the day's most active issues, dropped 5/8 to 23 1/4 on 1.5 million shares after Prudential-Bache semiconductor analyst Richard Whittington reduced his investment rating. He cited recent sharp increases in the price of the stock and concern about management resignations. Late Monday, after trading ended for the day, the Boise, Idaho-based microchip maker announced that its president and chief operating officer, Juan A. Benitez, and its chief financial officer, Leslie A. Gill, had both resigned for personal reasons.    Intel was up 1 1/8 to 35 3/4 on 3.8 million shares after reporting record earnings. The reaction contrasted with the disappointed investor response to earnings reported earlier by National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices, two Big Board chip makers.    Among other big Nasdaq industrial stocks, Apple Computer fell 3/8 to 44 3/4; Sun Microsystems lost 1/8 to 37 3/8 and Microsoft dropped 1 1/8 to 65 5/8. MCI rose 1/8 to 15.    Cullum rose 1 1/4 to 21 3/4 after it received a $22-a-share buy-out offer from an investor group that includes a Morgan Stanley partnership and members of Cullum's senior management.    Sigma-Aldrich rose 3/4 to 47 1/2 on 93,500 shares -- more than twice its recent daily average of about 42,800. The stock rose a dollar Monday on volume of 42,900 shares. Traders couldn't explain the buying surge but said a number of analysts have been recommending the stock in recent weeks.    &quot;What you have is some buyers but not a lot of stock to buy,&quot; said Joe Kern of Milwaukee's Robert W. Baird andamp; Co., which makes a market in Sigma-Aldrich, a St. Louis-based maker of specialty chemicals. </TEXT></DOC>
