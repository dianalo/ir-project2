(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A plastics recycler and five companiesthat own McDonald's franchises have gone to court to challenge thecity of Portland's ban on polystyrene foam products used inrestaurants and other food vending operations.   Polystyrene, generally known under the brand name Styrofoam, iswidely used to package food and drinks in fast-food outlets.   Mark Cushing, the plaintiffs' attorney, said the lawsuitcontends the ban, scheduled to take effect Monday, violatesOregon's Solid Waste Control and Opportunity to Recycle Act as wellas the state and federal constitutions.   ``In a nutshell, we contend that the city has no legal authorityto ban a recyclable product,'' Cushing said.   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Multnomah County Circuit Court,seeks an injunction preventing any enforcement of the ban.   City Attorney Jeffrey Rogers declined to comment on the meritsof the lawsuit, but said the city was prepared to defend theordinance.   Although the ban takes effect on Monday, Rogers said theordinance won't be enforced until a judge rules on the request foran injunction sometime in mid-January.   Under terms of the ordinance, the city serves a written noticewhen it receives a complaint from a citizen or a report from ahealth inspector that a business is violating the ban. The citymust wait at least 20 days after the notice is received beforesending inspectors to the business to see if the foam ban still isbeing ignored.   If the ban is being violated, the business is subject to a $250fine on the first offense and a $500 fine on subsequent offenses.   The lawsuit was filed by Denton Plastics, a major plasticsrecycler based in Portland, and five companies that own most of the14 McDonald's franchises in the city. Also joining as plaintiffswere Gerald Herman, described by Rogers as a ``longtime recyclingactivist'' and two other companies _ Gage Industries, a Portlandplastics recycler, and Irwin Research and Development, a Yakima,Wash., company that manufactures recycling equipment.   ``I expect the number of plaintiffs to grow because alreadycalls are coming in from delicatessens and small restaurantswanting to be a part of the activity,'' Cushing said.   The City Council first passed the ordinance in November 1988 andadopted it officially last January. On Dec. 13, the council voted4-1 to table a proposal by Commissioner Bob Koch to requirerecycling of the material rather than banning it.   Barbara George, assistant to City Commissioner Earl Blumenauer,said the council felt that although the industry has quit usingchlorofluorocarbons in the manufacture of polystyrene, ``they stillare using gases to blow air into the product and some of those arestill destroying the ozone layer.''   Chlorofluorocarbons, which damage the earth's ozone layer, havenot been used in the manufacture of polystyrene for about threeyears, Cushing said.   The council also was concerned that the foam products weren'tbiodegradable and would be difficult to recycle because of howlight they are, George said. The ban does not apply to packingmaterial or to polystyrene used in schools, hospitals and othernonprofit institutions.   ``I'm just surprised and sort of disappointed that it happenedthree days before the implementation date,'' George said. ``Thecouncil approved this a long time ago so people have had fairwarning. I know a lot of restaurants either were complying alreadylast year or have since complied with the council policy.''   He also said the coated paper product that would replacepolystyrene is not recyclable and is two to three times asexpensive as polystyrene.   The ban would affect 2,200 businesses in Portland, including1,700 restaurants and 500 grocery stores with prepared foodoperations.   George said whether the replacement products are no lessbiodegradable than polystyrene is open to debate.</TEXT></DOC>
