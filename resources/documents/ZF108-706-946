(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>With more than 90 per cent of PCs still being used for word processing -atleast some of the time it's significant that even today there's just one wordprocessor for OS/2's Presentation Manager.andP;  And DeScribe, which produced thepackage in question and then named it after itself, must at times havewondered whether it had chosen the right market.andM;But despite all the furore surrounding Windows 3.0, which has caused evenWordPerfect to promise a Windows package before its long-delayed PM version,DeScribe is sticking to its OS/2 guns.andP;  The new DeScribe Word Publisher 1.1is an improved model of the original, and is still the only word processorfor OS/2 PM.andM;However, it's not just OS/2's lack of market penetration that has slowed thearrival of PM word processors from the major names in the DOS world.andP;  Itisn't easy to produce a graphics-based word processor from scratch, and it'seven harder to transfer a text-based DOS package to a new environment.andP;  Theelephantine gestation periods of WordPerfect and Word for PM have technicalexplanations as well as marketing ones, and there was an equal delay inproducing graphics-based word processors for Windows.andP;  Microsoft Word, NBI'sLegacy and Samna's Ami Professional are still the only three Windows packagesavailable, and even these had to wait for Windows 3.0 before they had theperformance and screen presentation quality users are used to on theMacintosh.andM;For DeScribe, with its founders' background in big newspaper publishingsystems, the technical problems didn't seem insurmountable; and the fact thatOS/2 sales were mainly limited to large corporations appeared a positiveadvantage.andP;  DeScribe Word Publisher, as its name suggests, is aimed at theboundary between high-end word processing and desktop publishing, wherecorporate users want to pour new text and graphics into standard documenttemplates.andP;  Of course, this is the same market that Microsoft has targetedwith Word For Windows, adding document templates and macros to the alreadyimpressive feature list of Word 4.0 on the Macintosh.andP;  How, then, hasDeScribe been using its PM lead?andM;From the features list alone, it's clear that DeScribe has included most ofthe things that DTP packages have.andP;  Graphics tools including Bezier curves,typographic controls like kerning and hyphenation, document layout by pouringtext and graphics into pre-prepared objects on each page, and text flowaround or beneath graphics are just a few of the features that DeScribe hasbuilt in on top of its basic editing functions.andP;  So it's a DTP package.andP;  Thenagain, when you consider the way it uses layouts and styles, DeScribe startsto look more like a high-end word processor.andM;Layouts and styles are crucial to the way DeScribe works, and they'reintimately linked.andP;  A layout is a blank document containing text and graphicobjects with an attached set of stylesheets - like a template in a DTPpackage like Ventura or PageMaker - that allows text and graphics files to beimported into a standard format.andM;Producing a layout involves placing a set of named objects on document pages,This can be done by using the Create object command on the Objects menu, orby holding down the Shift and Ctrl keys and dragging the mouse to draw anobject of the required size.andP;  In either case, a dialogue box appears showingthe object options available, including the object's type, size, position onthe page, surrounding box format, and how DeScribe should cope with text flowwhen objects overlap.andP;  This is important, since the default object is a textbox filling the whole of each page and new objects are placed on top of it.andM;The three text flow options are Ignore, which simply flows text beneath theobject; Skip, which flows text above and below the object but not around thesides; and full text flow around all four sides.andP;  The gutter setting in thedialogue box determines how much space should be left between the objectboundary and the flowed text around it.andP;  Objects can also be madetransparent, to make underlying text visible when the Ignore flow option isused.andM;There are two main types of object- text and picture - and either can be usedas a template.andP;  The difference between templates and objects is thattemplates automatically appear in the same position on every page in thedocumentandM;a text template is used for sequential page numbering, for example - while anobject is restricted to a single page.andP;  The First Page option in the CreateObject dialogue box determines which page an object will be on, or thestarting page for a repeating template.andM;Setting up style sheets is a similar process, using the Define Styles commandon the Styles menu.andP;  However, there are complications: in DeScribe, stylesheets can be hierarchical.andP;  What this means is that users can create a newdefault style for the document, then produce lower-level styles that inheritall or part of the higher-level characteristics.andM;In practice, this can be used to match the style sheet hierarchy to thedocument structure.andP;  For example, one master style sheet might fix theoverall justification and hyphenation rules for a document, while a secondlevel of sheets might specify more detailed styles for the introduction, themain body and the glossary pages.andP;  Then there would be more sheets for eachset of pages below this second level, covering things like sub-headingformats and positions.andM;Hierarchical style sheets make it easier to limit changes to particular areasof a document, since changes to a low-level style don't apply to higherlevels.andP;  So, changing a subheading style doesn't necessarily change everysub-heading in a document, and careful style sheet hierarchy design can givemuch fighter control over styles.andM;Setting up a hierarchy uses techniques familiar from the hierarchical diskdirectories in DOS and OS/2.andP;  The Define Styles command calls up a dialoguebox showing a fist of the currently-defined style sheets; to start with, thiscontains just the standard Default style.andP;  Clicking the Create button allowsa new style to be defined at the same level as Default; double-clicking onDefault, however, opens a new empty fist at the next level down.andP;  The style'path' is shown at the top of the dialogue box, so it's possible - but notalways easy - to keep track of which style is where in the hierarchy.andO;Double-clicking on style names steps down in the tree, while double-clickingthe usual DOS '..' symbol goes one level up.andM;Choosing a style from the hierarchy from the Styles menu isn't always easy,either.andP;  The Styles command has a pop-up sub-menu attached, containing thelist of styles available at the current level, and double-clicking on a stylename switch changes the pop-up to show the styles at the next level down.andO;However, the menu doesn't indicate which styles have lower levels associatedwith them, and the pop-up menu doesn't instantly change to show a newlower-lewel fist.andP;  Instead, users must select a style that they know has alower level, watch the pop-up disappear and then select the Styles commandall over again to see the new list.andM;After getting used to this, though, the DeScribe style sheet is a powerfulobject.andP;  The main dialogue box used to define a style has 12 radio buttons atthe top, and the rest of the box changes depending on which of these ischosen.andP;  The Fonts button, for example, displays scrolling lists of availablefonts and sizes at the bottom of the screen, with text box options for widthand leading, while the Borders button produces another set of buttons to setthe kind of border to apply and the clearance between border and text.andP;  othermain radio button choices allow styles to be created with multiple columns,special kerning and word spacing settings, custom hyphenation rules andcustom widow-and-orphan control, as well as with the usual text attributeslike bold, italic and superscript.andM;It isn't possible to format a piece of text on the screen and then convert itinto a named style, but the Style Status command does provide a quick meansof checking and altering the current style.andP;  This command produces a windowshowing all the style settings in text form, and choosing an item followed byclicking the Modify button brings up the standard Define Styles dialogue withthe right options displayed, ready for changing.andM;Styles only apply to text objects, but DeScribe also has a comprehensive setof tools for creating and modifying graphics objects.andP;  With the standardpreferences set, selecting a graphics object on the screen causes threepalettes to appear: one with a set of drawing tools, one with the fillpatterns available and one with the available colours.andM;The drawing tools palette offers the usual range of straight fine, rectangle,rounded-corner rectangle, ellipse and polygon tools, and there's also a toolto create boxes for imported graphics.andM;The first version of DeScribe could only import PM Metafile images, but thisversion can now handle Lotus PIC, PC Paintbrush PCX, GEM Artline, TIFF and awide variety of other formats including images from fax boards andHewlett-Packard PCL files.andP;  one unusual feature is that the polygon tool canalso be used to produce Bezier and fillet curves, using the points of thepolygon to determine the shape of the curve.andP;  After they've been drawn, thecurves can be edited by moving the 'handles' in the now-familiar manner,although in small images it's difficult to drag the right handle to producethe desired result.andM;All this emphasis on layouts, objects, styles and imported text and graphicsmakes DeScribe sound like a DTP package, and, indeed, it's very nearly up tothe standards of PageMaker and Ventura.andP;  Features like character kerningadjusting the spacing between characters to improve appearance), hyphenationand word-spacing adjustment to make text fit a set width used to be thehallmark of desktop publishers rather than word processors, and DeScribe hasaH these.andP;  it isn't quite up to the best, however; kerning can only beapplied to whole words rather than individual pairs of characters, forexample, although DeScribe does score by allowing the kerning to be changedin a dialogue box while the results are displayed on the screen nearby forchecking.andM;And the whole feel of the package is that it isn't really designed for fasttext entry and ordinary, everyday editing tasks.andP;  The most obvious sign ofthis is that the cursor position on screen isn't linked to text at aH, andclicking the mouse anywhere on the page places the cursor and the text entrypoint at that position.andP;  But, on the other hand, attempting to select textwith the mouse often produces warning beeps when the mouse is clicked outsidethe page margins accidentally, which seems a little inconsistent.andM;Like a desktop publishing package, DeScribe takes its WYSIWYG approach to alogical conclusion by omitting a print preview command.andP;  The display isalready a print preview in itself, and for an overview of the whole documentthe Zoom command on the Window menu simply shrinks the display as far asrequired.andP;  A scroll bar allows detailed control of the Zoom percentagebetween 10 and 500 per cent, while push-buttons provide the usual 50, 75, 150and 200 per cent options.andM;So, while text editing isn't necessarily DeScribe's main preoccupation, thepackage provides a good range of features nonetheless.andP;  Basic text editingfollows the Windows and PM standards, in that clicking selects a character,double-clicking selects a word and treble-clicking selects a fine, whilelarger areas are selected by dragging the mouse.andP;  Actions, which can beapplying a bold style, checking spelling or any other DeScribe function, arethen performed on the selected text.andM;On the review machine, a 25MHz 80486 system with 6.5Mb RAM running IBMOS/21.2, DeScribe's text editing and navigation around a document wascertainly fast enough - unless many documents were open at once.andP;  Then it waspossible to type ahead of the screen, particularly when a justified textstyle was set and the package had to work out the word spacing at the end ofeach line to produce true WYSIWYG.andM;Some of DeScribe's best features aren't often seen in any word processor,however.andP;  For example, there are Append (Cut) and Append (Copy) commands onthe Edit menu alongside the familiar Cut, Copy and Paste commands, and theseare used to add text or objects to the clipboard without destroying thecontents.andP;  This is similar to the Macintosh Scrapbook idea, but uses theordinary clipboard and is much more convenient.andP;  In DeScribe, it's possibleto move around a document or several documents, clipping text from variousplaces and then pasting the complete set into a different position.andM;And DeScribe commits the ultimate writers' heresy in advising users not tosave their work, instead, the package takes a 'snapshot' of the file after auser-defined time period or a set number of keystrokes, and if the machinecrashes, DeScribe can automatically load the last snapshot when the programis restarted.andP;  The advantage of the snapshot approach is that it saves everyediting step along with the text, graphics and formatting information, soeven after a crash users still have access to DeScribe's spectacular'unlimited Undo/Redo' feature.andM;Selecting Undo from the Edit menu produces a window containing a scrollbar,with one end labelled Undo and the other end labelled Redo; dragging thescrollbar slider towards Undo rolls back the editing session to any previousstate - right back to a blank sheet of paper if required.andP;  The spectacularpart is that the document displayed on-screen changes on-screen as the slideris moved, with all the editing changes going backwards as though the secondlaw of thermodynamics had been repealed.andM;The document is still  live' throughout this process, and a piece of textthat was rashly deleted several hours before can be cut or copied into theclipboard and rescued, before the slider is moved back to the present timeand all the intervening editing steps are performed again.andM;The find-and-replace functions are equally impressive, because DeScribe canuse OS/2's multithreading functions to run two find-and-replace operations atonce.andP;  just enter the right criteria in the Search 1 and Search 2 sections ofthe Define Search dialogue box and DeScribe will perform them both.andP;  Theusual ignore Case, whole word and Confirm options are provided, and thepackage has an unusual set of  pattern matching' characters; putting a set ofcharacters in square brackets, for example, would find any one of thosecharacters so that '[0-9]', say, would find any of the numbers from nought tonine.andM;However, DeScribe can't search for particular styles, but only for text andmarkup characters like paragraph marks.andM;The spell checker and thesaurus are also unusual in that they includedefinitions for the words in the dictionary, and can also provide synonyms,antonyms and homonyms to order.andP;  Dictionaries are available in a variety oflanguages, and add-on dictionaries of technical, medical, legal and otherspecialist terms are available at extra cost.andP;  UK distributor Bonsai willhave a range of anglicised specialist dictionaries available by the time youread this.andM;Like Word for Windows, a macro language is an important part of DeScribe.andO;The DeScribe macro language, DML, is more like a complete programminglanguage.andP;  According to the company, some of its major clients have developedcomplex applications that extract data from text and graphics files over anetwork and construct a custom document using standard layouts and styles.andO;There's even a built-in compiler that takes the DML macros and compiles themfor faster execution.andM;Macros can be created by typing DML commands directly into an editing window,with the usual DeScribe editing tools available, or by recording user actionsin a file.andP;  Each macro runs in the background as an OS/2 thread and has itsown private clipboard area This means that users can set off several macrosand then carry on editing and using the clipboard without needing to worryabout disrupting a macro's operation.andP;  And custom pull-down menus can easilybe set up, with macros attached to each item, to make it simple for untrainedoperators to get the job done.andP;  The standard DeScribe pull-down menus andtheir contents can also be removed or edited if required, to produce a customapplication that doesn't necessarily look like DeScribe at all.andM;Looking around DeScribe, it's easy to see several features that wordprocessors on other platforms can only envy, such as the slick Undo/Redoimplementation, the clipboard append commands, the powerful macro languageand the customisation possibilities.andP;  But there are also features that makeit very unlike a word processor, So what is it?andM;If you simply want to produce text and make use of the excellent layout andstyle sheet architecture to format documents, then DeScribe will do anexcellent job.andP;  However, you might then look at the graphics creation andimport tools, as well as the odd cursor behaviour, and wonder whetherproducing text in a desktop publishing package is ever a good idea.andP;  Word forWindows will do the same text production job, with less elegance but withoutso many frills.andM;Still, DeScribe is the only Presentation Manager game in town - at least fornow.andP;  And many things that were wrong or missing in DeScribe 1.0 have beenfixed or added in release 1.1.andM;For example, the first version could only import ASCII text, but the new onehas more file import and export filters than just about any other package,including support for various versions of 1-2-3, Excel, Enable and FrameworkIII, alongside every major PC word processor and most of the minor ones.andP;  Anda clever touch is that selecting a DeScribe file with the Import commandallows individual text or graphics objects to be imported rather than thewhole file.andP;  Version 1.0 couldn't handle superscripts and subscripts; 1.1 hasboth, and has added dropped capitals as well.andP;  Index and table of contentsgeneration features have been added, although footnotes win have to wait forthe next release.andP;  And overall speed has been improved, so that there are nolonger so many tedious delays in selecting a menu and waiting for it toappear.andP;  There's no doubt that with a fast machine and Presentation Manager1.2, DeScribe is a seductive package.andM;But what is it seducing users into? It looks like a word processor that canhandle long and complex documents, but turns out not to have footnotes or anytechnical typesetting aids.andP;  Then it looks like a desktop publishing package,but turns out not to have the detailed typographical controls of a packagelike Ventura.andP;  Indeed, DesScribe might wish that it could invent a newcategory for the package, and indeed it has tried to do that with its  WordPublisher' tag.andP;  Users, though, are happier to buy new products when they canat least see where they fit in the applications spectrum.andM;DeScribe might well be a 'Word Publisher', but nobody has yet gone into adealer and asked for one of those.andM;DeScribe and OS/2 PMandM;Many of the early OS/2 applications were simple ports of DOS programs, andtherefore didn't use any of OS/2's more powerful features.andP;  They usedmultitasking to run multiple copies of the program, but this was nothing morethan a LAN in a box, with aU the limitations that implies.andP;  DeScribe isdifferent.andP;  It was written from scratch as an OS/2 application, and it makesextensive use of multithreading - multitasking inside a single program - aswell as allowing normal multitasking under PM.andM;The most obvious example of this is the search and replace function, whichcan run two simultaneous searches.andP;  But there are more subtle uses too.andP;  Thecalculation of fine breaks in justified text, the continual repagination andthe spell checker routines aH run in the background inside DeScribe, forexample.andM;And most useful of all, each macro created by users has its own thread, somultiple macros can all be running simultaneously, if required, to producecomplex and powerful custom applications.andM;Like other PM programs, DeScribe allows multiple copies of itself to be run.andO;But, unlike others, it can also produce the illusion that multiple copies arerunning, by the use of multithreading.andP;  From the Window menu in DeScribe,choosing the New Editor Window command produces what looks and acts like acomplete new copy of DeScribe.andP;  And that's what it effectively is, since itcan be minimised to an icon on the PM desktop, can run independently of itscalling copy of DeScribe and can do anything a full copy can.andM;Under these circumstances, the fact that it's not strictly a new copy of theprogram is rather academic.andP;  There can, in fact, be rather a lot of DeScribeicons on the screen at one time.andP;  Each new copy or pseudo-copy of DeScribecan be minimised to a desktop icon and, within the DeScribe workspace, windowdocuments can also be reduced to identical icons to dear the workspace.andO;Double-clicking on one of these workspace icons zooms the document up to itsprevious window size; double-clicking on a desktop icon zooms the workspacewindow of that DeScribe copy up to its previous size.andM;This confusion between the workspace and the desktop, and the very similaricons and background patterns used for each, is one of the less attractivefeatures of Windows 3.0 and PM 1.2.andP;  DeScribe tries to get round it bycolouring its workspace in a violent and venomous green by default, but mostusers will be quick to change that to something more restful.andP;  And it's anarea where the Macintosh's single desktop metaphor really scores.andM;The competitionandM;Until recently, graphics-based word procesing was something that Macinthosesdid and PCs with Windows tried to do.andP;  Windows word processors were slow toarrive and very slow ti run, because the PC hardware wasn't powerful enoughand the programmers at Microsoft and third-party developers weren't cleverenough-to update the screen at fast typing speed.andM;That alone was enough to stall graphics-based word processor sales in the PCmarket.andP;  Ami and Ami Professional from Samma came with wonderful featurelists, including style sheets and graphics tools as good as DeScribe's, butthey both performed poorly under Windows, no matter how much processorhardware was thrown at them.andM;Word For Windows finally arrived, after an interminable gestation period, andwas again too slow for the volume text producer-it was fine for short memos,forms design and producing attractive mailshots or short documents instandard formats, but too slow for anything larger.andM;This is why Microsoft changed Word when it was transformed from the Macintoshversion 4.0 which is certainly fast enough into Word For Windows.andP;  Theaddition of templates and macros suit it for a low-volume corporate market,where documents are short but must be as attractively presented as possible.andO;And this is why both Microsoft and Samma include 'draft editing' modes, whichmake text entry and document navigation faster but trade this off against anypretence at WYSIWYG.andM;Windows 3.0 looks set to change all that.andP;  Even an old version of AmiProfessional runs under Windows 3.0 quickly enough for users not to have togo into draft mode, and Word For Windows run as though it was designed forthe new wnvironment-which of course it was.andP;  Speed is no longer the big issueit was.andM;So it looks as though the big graphics-based word processor battle will be inthe Windows 3.0 market.andP;  WordPerfect has swapped its development effortaround, so that the Windows 3.0 version of WordPerfect 5.1 will come beforethe Presentation Manager version, and every other major word processor vendoris jumping on the Windows bandwagon.andP;  All of this leaves DeScribe either outon a limb or-like autoDesk-playing the big fish in a rather small pool.andP;  Aslong as Windows 3.0 doesn't saw off the limb or dry up the pool altogether,DeScribe should have the PM word processing market all to itself for a littlewhile longer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
