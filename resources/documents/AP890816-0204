Jose Joel Martinez, freshly deported from the UnitedStates, stepped down and started walking the final, dusty mile tohis parents' concrete-walled house.   He didn't know how long it would be safe to stay.   Martinez, 20, returned to civilian life this spring after fouryears in El Salvador's army. But the civil war followed him home,and guerrillas warned him to leave or his life would be in danger.   ``I don't know whether it is safe for me to return,'' Martinezsaid, looking at the mountain range just to the north, where combatrecently had intensified between government troops and the leftistguerillas. ``I'll have to see how things are.''   The journey home is a familiar one lately in El Salvador.Deportations of Salvadorans from Texas, which increased dramaticallyafter a U.S. crackdown designed to plug off a flood of CentralAmericans, totaled more than 1,100 in the first half of the year.   On Feb. 21, the Immigration and Naturalization Service abruptlyended its policy of allowing Central Americans to travel beyondTexas to other U.S. destinations for temporary residence. ByJanuary, new asylum applicants were pouring into southern Texas at arate of 500 a day. The INS began ruling on applications the day theywere filed. Those denied were held in detention camps untildeportation.   Only six Salvadorans were granted asylum in Texas from Feb. 21 tothe end of July.   Martinez said he didn't even bother to apply; people told him itwould only mean longer detention before he was deported.   Martinez's homecoming prompted smiles from neighbors as he passedon a road lined with barbed wire and dotted with occasional piles ofcattle dung.   ``Todo tranquilo aqui (everything calm here),'' Maria EmilinaAnderson told Martinez when he asked about any local fighting.   Chickens scattered minutes later as he turned down a narrow path,stopped at a cinderblock house and shouted to a smiling woman whowas hanging laundry on a rope. ``Hello. Lito is back, too,''Martinez told Lito's mother. ``He will visit Sunday,'' after areunion with his wife and newborn baby in San Miguel, the provincialcapital.   Lito, his next-door neighbor and fellow ex-soldier, was deportedon the same TACA International Airlines flight that had carriedMartinez from Houston the day before. Out of work and threatened bythe guerrillas, Lito had left for ``El Norte'' a few weeks beforeMartinez made his trip in May.   He and Martinez found each other at the INS detention campnortheast of Brownsville, Texas.   ``The food and the bed were better there (in U.S. detention) thanI have at home, and it is air-conditioned,'' Martinez said. ``But Iwas a prisoner. It was my first time ever to be a prisoner.''   He left for the United States on May 3 and slipped across the RioGrande at Brownsville on May 14. Four days later, he was in INScustody, having made the mistake of presenting himself to the BorderPatrol to ask permission to stay and work in the United States.   He was held at the crowded INS detention camp six weeks, wearingthe standard orange jumpsuit and blue canvas slippers and playingsoccer and basketball with other detainees.   Many Salvadorans applying for asylum say they are fleeing ``lasituacion'' _ a combination of civil war and unemploymentexacerbated by war. The nine-year conflict has claimed 70,000 lives,mostly civilians, and displaced 500,000 to 1 million people.   Those able to prove they are fleeing persecution get asylum andpermission to work in the United States. But U.S. officials say mostCentral Americans come for economic reasons.   Among Salvadorans in the United States, it is not hard to findex-soldiers who say they were threatened by guerillas.   ``Immigration to the United States has increased much by soldierswho have completed military service,'' said the Rev. Segundo Montes,a Jesuit priest and director of the Human Rights Institute atCentral American University in San Salvador. ``They don't want toreturn to their houses or their towns because they are afraid.''   In conflict zones, guerillas might consider ex-soldiers, publicofficials and their families to be ``ears'' for the government andtell them to leave, Montes said.   ``If they do not leave, there comes a time when they, as theysay, `bring them to justice.' They kill them,'' Montes said.   That type of justice is still more typical of the army, he added,``but the guerrillas, I believe, have increased a little this typeof repression against the civilian population.''   Martinez spent a good part of the flight to El Salvador quiet andabsorbed in violent reports of the civil war in a Salvadorannewspaper left on the plane. He did not join in the idle clowning ofsome of the 59 Central American deportees taking up the rear half ofthe airliner, on seats for which the U.S. government paid $288 perone-way ticket.   When he arrived at his rural home near the town of Chapeltique,Martinez' mother, Maria Angela Sorto, was cooking over a wood firein the house's tiny, smoke-blackened kitchen. She stepped out togreet him with a grin of relief.   ``Thank God, you returned,'' she said. ``It worries me when youare so far away.''   He took off his shirt and ate the small plate of eggs, rice andthick corn tortillas his mother served with a plastic tumbler ofcool water from the well.   His father, Ernesto Martinez, was bathing in the river down ahill behind the house. Towel slung over his shoulder, he returned asJose Joel ate and warmly greeted his son.   The house has electricity but no running water. A tree trunk inthe middle of the floor holds up a red clay roof. A hammock is theprincipal piece of furniture.   On one concrete wall, Ernesto Martinez had written in chalk thedate his son left for the United States.   The father said things had been calm locally, but that the weekbefore, in a battle 25 miles to the north, four of Jose Joel's armybuddies had been killed. The younger Martinez, stunned, pulled froma shelf a pile of photographs showing him in battle fatigues withtwo of the dead, drinking hot pepper sauce as part of ``toughness''training.   An hour later, several soldiers, fingers-on-triggers, marched bythe house on patrol.   The next morning, Martinez said he would try to get work at thejute farm where his father earns 10 colones ($2) a day.   ``If I had been able to work in the United States,'' he said, ``Icould have lived in a place with a bed and a mattress.''   Later, he added, ``Maybe I will return to the United States.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 20</NOTE></DOC>
