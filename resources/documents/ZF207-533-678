(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OVER THE LAST ten or fifteen years, probably no vendor in the electronicpublishing industry has covered a broader market spectrum than Compugraphic.andO;It has supplied the newspaper, commercial and inplant markets with front-endsystems and typesetters with varying degrees of quality and speed.andP;  It is oneof the largest suppliers of type.andM;During this period, Compugraphic's traditional strength has been at the lowend of the market.andP;  Its bread-and-butter products were direct-entrytypesetters and their successors and inexpensive typesetters for newspapers.andO;Gradually, over the years, CG began to move up market into the multiterminalsystem business.andM;The advent of mass-market desktop publishing forced an increase in the paceat which CG (and its chief competitors) moved upward, with the company nearlyabandoning the bottom end of the market to desktop publishing products andrelying more heavily on its multiterminal systems.andP;  Here it pursued a policyof extending the life of its proprietary systems as long as it could, whiledeveloping new products that were essentially PC-based replacements for theproprietary gear.andM;Until several years ago, Compugraphic's annual revenues tended to growsteadily; they reached a peak three years ago of more than $400 millionannually, making CG the largest vendor at that time by a substantial margin.andM;But since that peak, questions have started to arise about the long-runviability of the company.andP;  As the pace of change escalated due to fourth-wavetechnology, people began to wonder whether Compugraphic's reliance onmanufacturing of proprietary hardware and development of systems to servemid-range markets would work over the long run.andP;  In any case, it appeared tobe taking a long time for this &quot;giant' to find the appropriate course tofollow in the changing times.andM;Ahead of its time.andP;  That isn't to say that CG was slow to recognize the newsituation or the new opportunities.andP;  In fact, to the contrary, it was wellahead of its competitors in this respect.andP;  It offered a desktop publishingsystem driving a highresolution typesetter before the term desktop publishingwas even coined and before PostScript had been invented.andP;  Unfortunately, thePersonal Composition System it developed ran on die iH-fated Apple Lisacomputer in the year before die Macintosh was born.andP;  And because it wasdeveloped to run on the Lisa, which had a multitasking operating system andsupported a lot of memory, when the single-tasking, 128K Mac came along,Compugraphic decided that porting die software to the newer, less expensivemachine would have been too difficult to be worthwhile.andP;  So Compugraphic'sLisa project was dropped.andM;The Lisa system had been intended to address a new &quot;office publishing&quot;market.andP;  After the failure of the Lisa, it rapidly became clear that this newmarket would be served by massmarket desktop products.andP;  Rather than competein this arena, CG decided to concentrate its attention on itsffaditional&quot;professional publishing&quot; customers.andM;For the next several years, it adamantly insisted (and believed) that aB thisdesktop stuff really would not meet the, needs of CG customers and reallywouldn't have an impact on CG's market.andP;  But while CG was denying thatdesktop publishing would be of interest to its customers, its low-endnewspaper and in-plant users began to migrate en masse to desktop systems andits commercial customers watched in dismay as their competitors with Linotypeequipment snagged aB the high-resolution PostScript output business.andO;Meanwhile, CG sales began to sag.andM;During this period, CG did add the PC-based Personal Typesetting System (PTS)to its product line.andP;  The PTS was based on the G.O.andP;  Graphics Horizonsoftware (the forerunner of G.O.'s current Deskset product).andP;  Not only didthis produce quality composition using standard hardware, but it even ran onthe same proprietary CG network as Compugraphic's MCS product line.andP;  Further,since the PTS was closely equivalent in both functionality and user interfaceto the MCS, it provided a logical evolution path for the MCS user.andM;However, CG's corporate antipathy to desktop systems meant that it neverreally made much of a marketing conmitment to the PTS, and the product didnot play a significant role in the company's product strategy.andM;Other considerations.andP;  Compugraphic's course, like those of many of itscompetitors, has been restricted somewhat by the company's detemination toprovide new solutions that retain compatibility with existing installedsystems.andP;  Over the years, new product lines have tended to provide userinterfaces and operating procedures that were consisistent with those oftheir predecessors, a necessity in view of the large number of customers whoupgrade their equipment by purchasing the next-generation product.andP;  Even moreimportant, the company has tried hard to retain data compatibility, althoughchanges in technology have required three different sizes of floppy disks.andM;These problems are unique to vendors with an investment in installed systems,which has made it easier for newcomers (Bestinfo, Aldus, Ventura) to startwith a clean slate.andM;Not surprisingly, as the desktop publishing market began to surge, CG beganto falter.andP;  Revenues dropped from a high of $401 million in 1985 to $341million in 1986 before the company was able to mount a moderate comeback to$3 million in 1987.andP;  Net income for those years was $21.8 million iii 1985,$3.4 million in 1986 and $10.1 million in 1987.andM;Because Compugraphic is now wholly owned by AgfaGevaert, financialinformation is no longer made public.andP;  But for the first quarter of the pastyear (before the acquisition), die company reported a loss of $4.7 million inthe face of a $5 million decline in quarterly revenues.andM;Agfa-Gevaert's role.andP;  After Compugraphic suffered a slump in 1981,Agfa-Gevaert gained a controlling interest in the company in 1982.andP;  Initiallyit took control of overseas distribution, but left CG largely alone.andP;  In1984, Agfa was instrumental in installing Dewey Manzer as executive vicepresident under the CG chairman, Carl Dantas, with Manzer given theassigmnent of organizing the company his way.andP;  In 1986, Manzer was ousted andthe company was reorganized, with John Duker assuming the post of senior vicepresident under Dantas.andP;  Agfa let Dantas run the company for another twoyears before deciding that it still was not satisfied with the results.andM;Last year, Agfa, which already owned 84% of CG, acquired the rest of thecompany.andP;  Its aim was a complete merger of the two companies and to use thecombined resources to forge a new position as the undisputed dominant forcein the prepress industry.andP;  This has meant a new corporate identityemphasizing the Agfa name, a complete reorganization of the companystructure, and top-level personnel changes.andM;Dantas-whose name had been nearly synonymous with Compugraphic for as long asmost people could rememberresigned for &quot;personal&quot; reasons.andP;  He was replacedby Ken Draeger, previously president of Autographix.andM;A short time later, when Senior Vice President John Duker also resigned,&quot;seeking early retirement,&quot; it was clear to everyone that a wholesalehouse-cleaning was under way.andP;  This is not to say that all key managementpersonnel changed.andP;  At the next lower level, several vice presidents wereretained, while some other people from within CG were promoted.andM;There have, of course, been some layoffs.andP;  Thus far, approximately 7% to 8%of the roughly 4,000 people who worked for CG when the reorganization startedhave had to find new jobs.andM;The result of all of this is that CG is a much different company from what itwas a year ago.andP;  We thought, therefore, that it was time to take a closerlook at the company, its products, and its plans for the future.andM;The new structureandM;The center of the operation is Agfa Corp., established for this purpose as awholly owned subsidiary of Bayer USA, which is a management holding companyfor Bayer AG, of West German the parent company of Agfa Gevaert.andM;Bayer AG, one of the world's largest and most diver international companies,had 1988 sales of approximately $23 billion.andP;  Bayer (pronounced as in&quot;buyer') is active in polymers, organic products, industrial products, healthcare, agrochemicals and imaging technologies.andP;  Bayees U.S.andP;  operatingcompanies together had net sales of $4.7 billion in 1988, an increase of12.4% over 1987.andM;Agfa Corp.andP;  operates the imaging technology portion of Bayer USA out of itsheadquarters in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey.andP;  Agfa Corp. was formed throughthe merger of Compugraphic Corp., Matrix Corp. and Agfa-Gevaert, Inc., of theU.S.andP;  The merger was made possible by Agfa-Gevaeres acquisition of MatrixCorp.andP;  in addition to the remaining shares of Compugraphic stock, both ofwhich occurred in 1988.andP;  Agfa Corp.andP;  has the responsibility for marketingelectronic publishing products (including film , processors, and so on)throughout the world.andM;Agfa Corp., headed by President and CEO Helge H.andP;  Wehmeier, a member of AgfaEurope's board of directors, has been organized into three operatingdivisions:andM;Agfa Compugraphic, which includes all of the former Compugraphic Corp.andO;operations and the former Graphic Systems Division of Agfa-Gevaert (whichhandled processors, cameras, reprographics and film-based supplies, etc.),andO;under President Ken Draeger.andP;  This is the largest of the three divisions.andO;Note, in particular, that the company's name is now Agfa Compugraphic.andP;  TheCompugraphic name has been removed from the face of the company'sheadquarters building in Wilmington, MA, and been replaced by the Agfa nameand logo.andP;  Most equipment now bears the Agfa name.andP;  Product literature goesunder the name Afga, with &quot;Afga ComandM;pugraphic Division&quot; in smaller print below.andM;* Agfa Matrix, which comprises the former Matrix Co.andP;  inandM;volved primarily in medical diagnostic imaging and presentation graphics,under President Michael Kochman, formerly vice president, who replacedFranklin Bishop after his resignation concurrent with the acquisition.andM;* Agfa Photo, which produces and markets photographic andandM;motion picture films, magnetic tape, paper, chemistry and photographicprocessing equipment for consumer and professional use, headed by JohnMcGlynn, former president of the Agfa-Gevacrt Rex Division.andM;These three units together had net sales of $818 million in 1988, up 1% from1987.andP;  For the year, the company suffered a net loss of $20 million, downfrom a profit of $16 million the previous year.andP;  Bayer attributed theearnings decline to &quot;significant losses in thc prepress business of theformer Compugraphic Corporation and to a modest downturn in the medicaldiagnostic imaging business of the former Matrix Corporation.&quot; Although Agfadoesn't break down the financial figures to reflect the performance of eachof the three units, we estimate that the CG operation alone was responsiblefor a loss of approximately $40 million In 1988.andP;  Agfa says that the currentyears for both Agfa Corp.andP;  and for Agfa Compugraphic will be profitable.andM;The Agfa Compugraphic organizationandM;Within thc Agfa Compugraphic division, the operation was initially organizedinto eight units (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  8, p.andP;  25), with a main system unit,called the Electronic Pre-Press Group (EPP), and separate entities for colorsystems and thc CAPS tech-doc system.andP;  Other units covered customer service,research and development, manufacturing, type and fonts, and graphiccommunications systems (cameras, photo materials, etc.).andM;Since then, however, the color and the CAPS units have been brought into theEPP Group.andP;  There also has been a change in the relationship between the TypeDivision and Font Technologies, which brought those two closer together.andM;To clarify, the current organization, we'll outline briefly the nature ofeach of the units.andM;Electronic Pre-Press.andP;  Headed by Bob Crevels, senior vice president, EPP isresponsible for product planning, marketing and sales of front-end systems(Integrator, Quadex, CAPS, Dawn), output devices (9400, 9600, 9700, 8000,plain-paper machines), scanners (Agfa's color and monochrome scanners andCG's 2000 , and so on.andM;Serving as vice president of the output systems group within EPP is DaveCosta, who earlier served as vicc president of marketing, vice president ofcorporate and product planning, and vice prcsident of thc Newspaper SystemsDivision in his 14 years with the company.andP;  He has worldwide responsibilityfor product planning, product management and marketing of both silver-basedand plain-paper systems.andM;Vice president of the CAPS operation is Brian Eastman, who had served asgeneral manager of the Quadex operation until he left the company severalycars ago and now has returned.andP;  Director of input systems marketing(Integrator, Quadex, Dawn and Mac) is Rick Mangold, formerly business areamanager for domestic input systems.andP;  He served earlier as eastern systemssales manager and as a district sales manager for CG.andP;  Bob Verrando serves asvice president of strategic marketing.andM;In key sales positions are jerry Rosenberg, vice prcsident of sales for NorthAmerica; Peter Straessle, general manager of sales for Agfa CG EPP Europe;and Peter Rothe, manager of sales for Latin America and the Pacific for AgfaCG EPP.andP;  Font Technologies and Typographic Systems.andP;  These two units wercmerged recently under Don Wyle, scnior vice president, who oversees aBactivities relating to the company's typographic, font and peripheralproducts.andP;  He has held positions with Agfa CG for morethan 20 years.andP;  Beforehis current position, he was vice president, international marketing, for theFont Division, and manager, human resources.andP;  Bob Givens, vice president,sales and marketing, Typographic Systems, joined CG in 1975 and has heldpositions in sales and marketing management.andP;  He had been vice prcsident ofFont Technologies, overseeing Randamp;D, manufacturing and sales of type productsand technologies.andP;  Denis Lamy, vice president, operations, TypographicSystems, earlier served as general manager for Compugraphic InternationalProducts in Shannon, Ireland, starting in 1982.andP;  Prior to that, he wasoperations manager for Quadex.andM;Font Technologics focuses on the Intellifont scaling system that is used by avariety, of vendors, including HewlettPackard in developments for itsLaserjet and Deskjet series of 300-dpi printers.andP;  Typographic Systemssupplies fonts worldwide, including several new series of fonts forPostScript use.andP;  Graphic Communications Systems.andP;  This unit combines the AgfaGraphic Systems Division (cameras, processors, supplies, etc.) with the CGAccessories and Supplies Division.andP;  It is headed by Juergen Stolt, vicepresident, who had been with Agfa-Gevaert.andM;Research and development.andP;  Randamp;D relating to all products comes under thisunit, headed by Michael Paige, a newcomer to the company as of thereorganization.andM;Manufacturing.andP;  Manufacturing facilities remain located as previously, underthe direction of Richard Renwick, senior vice president, operations, who hasbeen with Agfa CG for more than 25 years.andM;Customer Service.andP;  Service and support of all products has been combinedunder Russell Spencer, vice president, field service, who oversees allactivities relating to installation, customer training and maintenance.andP;  Hehas been with the company for 22  years.andM;Agfa's team and strategyandM;In moving to gain firmer control over its subsidiaries, Bayer has put newpeople in a lot of the key executive positions.andP;  In die case of AgfaCompugraphic, Ken Draeger has been instaffed as president, with Bob Crevelsnamed senior vice president.andM;Draeger had served as president and chief executive officer of Autographixthe presentation graphics firm in which AgfaGevaert has a 20% interest.andO;Prior to that, he had held a variety of positions with other firms, includingCEO and chairman of Computer Corporation of America, a database managementsystem software company; group vicc prcsident and corporate officer ofInformatics General Corp.; and president and corporate officer of AutomaticData Processing's Network Services Division.andP;  He also served earlier with LBMand Ford Motor Co.andP;  Draeger holds a master of business administration degreefrom Wayne State University and a bachelor of science degree in mathematicsfrom Western Michigan University.andM;Draeger has large shoes to fill.andP;  In 25 years with CG, Carl Dantas learnedthe industry well and used that knowledge and his background in engineeringto bring many succcssful products to the market.andP;  During these years,Compugraphic was known for providing the market with products of broadappeal, rather than serving narrow market segments, which accounted in partfor the company's growth.andP;  Dantas, though, was a quiet, private person whodidn't seem to enjoy public appearances and did little &quot;flag waving&quot; for thecompany.andP;  He let his assistants participate in public forums.andM;Draeger, on the other hand, is more extroverted and already has made publicappearances to promote the company's new view of the world.andP;  He also visitscustomers regularly.andP;  The strength he brings to Agfa CG is experience inrunning computer companies, including those involved with color, rather thana background in thc nitty-gritty, affairs of electronic publishing.andP;  Wepresume he will rely on his subordinates for guidance in some areas in whichDantas might have played a larger role.andM;Among his priorities are rapid movement in the color field and continuedefforts to sell and support Macintosh/PostScript systems.andM;Crevels, who earlier spent 10 years with Agfa-Gevaert in Europe, bringssubstantial graphic arts expericnce to the job, although it isn't preciselyalong the lines of the task in front of him now.andP;  He started in finance andthen moved into marketing with Agfa-Gevaert's Imaging Technology Group inBelgium.andP;  His last three years were spent as general manager of Agfa inSweden.andM;With a youthful exuberance that should providc a boost to the general morale,he should figure importantly in Agfa's tong-run plans, in whatever positionshe eventually may fill.andM;We recently spent an hour with Crevels, in which he outlined the company'sstrategy, and his view of how things are going six months after thereorganization started.andP;  He called his task a three-phase operation:consolidation, transition and growth.andM;Consolidation.andP;  During the consolidation phase, which is currently under way,the task is to bring the company in line with the market realities, Crevelssaid.andP;  This inevitably leads to reducing thc work force in some selectcdareas, which may continue to happen.andP;  It also means hiring new people inareas that need expansion, such as color.andM;Agfa CG didn't indicate the number of employees that had been let go already,but it did say that the current work force numbers about 3,700.andP;  We recallbeing told last winter by Agfa officials that the merger had resulted in atotal force of about 4,000 for the Agfa CG division, so we presume layoffs todate have bcen about 300, or 7-8 percent.andP;  Agfa officials indicated that thisis probably a fairly close estimate.andM;Crevels said there would be no massive layoffs in the future, but thatfurther adjustments would be made, &quot;probably for six months or a year&quot; beforethis situation stabilizes.andM;We don't have any way of knowing if these changes are bringing the company tothe appropriate employment level.andP;  But we would like to emphasize that thesechanges shouldn't be viewed as a sign of a doom.andP;  The nature of developmentsunder way in the industry requires taking a hard look at economics and makingadjustments to deal with the realities.andP;  Agfa isn't the only company facedwith this predicament; others need to follow-and are following-the same toughroad.andM;Another target during the consolidation phase, Crevels said, is bringingconfidence to the sales force.andP;  This has meant freezing sales territories for18 months, which enables salespeople to spend time with prospective customerswho may require long sales cycles, rather than going for the quick sale.andP;  Formanagement-level personnel, the company is emphasizing that managers areaccountable for their products.andM;Also under way in this phase is an attempt to broaden the company's outlookto acquire more of a world view, particularly by listening to the needs ofEurope.andM;Transition.andP;  In the second phase, expected to coincide approximately with1990, Agfa will attempt to broaden thc company's focus to include afl aspectsof the prepress area: text and graphics, process color, high-quality dotgeneration on its output devices, etc.andP;  Products are being developed now,with some of them scheduled for introduction at the Drupa expo starting nextApril.andP;  They will be based mostly on industry-standard hardware and software,Crevels said, but the company needs to have &quot;a competitive advantage in thcmarket,&quot; so if necessary he isn't afraid to vary from standards on occasion,He didn't elaborate.andP;  But he did say that Drupa &quot;will be the moment oftruth.&quot;andM;In commenting on this transition phase, Crevels emphasized that Agfa has ahuge stake in the graphic arts market that it isn't willing to lose.andP;  Thegraphic arts market accounts for a larger portion of Agfa's business than anyof its other divisions.andP;  More than $2 billion of its $4.5 billion annualsales come from the graphic arts, he said.andM;Growth.andP;  The final phase in the new strategy occurs when the transition to abroader company has been achieved and the new focus is on growth.andP;  Crevelsanticipates Agfa Compugraphic will be in position for its growth phase in1991.andM;Markets and salesandM;Long-time CG-watchers probably recall that Compugraphic traditionally hasdivided itself into a newspaper segment and a business segment, each with itsown managers and its own sales force.andP;  And, although some of the productsoverlapped (such as output devices and, occasionally, MCS systems), there wasa pretty firm division between the two operations.andM;One of the significant changes imposed by the new organization was to endthat division.andP;  Service to the newspaper market has been brought under thesame umbrella as the business or commcrcial market.andP;  This decision coincideswith anothcr decision, actually made by Dantas and Duker before theydeparted, that phased out the Intrepid newspaper system.andP;  We'll discuss thesetwo issues here.andM;The newspaper market.andP;  Although in recent years Compugraphic may have beenbest known for its systems for commercial and inplant markets (MCS,Editwriter, Quadex, etc.), it has also paid a lot of attention to serving itsoriginal market: small-to medium-sized newspapers.andP;  For years, it used theUnified Terminal System (developed for CG by Hendrix); then it acquired OneSystems as a replacemcnt for the UTS.andP;  When the One product was nearing theend of its service to the U.S.andP;  market, Compugraphic acquired a PC-basedsystem developed by Electric Knowledge and named it Intrepid.andP;  Althoughseveral dozen systems werc sold, the Intrepid never caught on as well asseveral other PC systems.andP;  A decision to phase it out was made late lastyear, at which point no new software enhancements were designed.andP;  Upgrades tothe latest software release continued well into this year, but nothing newhas bcen planned.andM;Agfa Compugraphic still sells newspapers its Dawn system for creating displayads and its output devices, but without a full system to sell, it is moredifficult for salespeople to get a foot in the door, to say nothing ofprojecting the image of a company that is committed to the market.andM;Agfa Compugraphic realizes this and isn't happy having such a big void in itsproduct line.andP;  The new management says that it wants to fill the void, butthat the system has to be better than Intrepid.andP;  What it will be or whensomething will be found-if it is found-remains unclear.andM;Crevels indicated that most of 1989 will be used to get other things inorder, after which efforts will turn to possibilities for the newspapermarket, including joint ventures or acquisitions.andM;The situation in the United Kingdom is different.andP;  There Compugraphic has itsown newspaper development group, which initially took the One Systemsproduct, Anglicized it and later totally rewrote it.andP;  Since that time, thisgroup has developed its own PC-based networked editorial system (differentfrom Intrepid).andP;  It has been installed in a few sites, thc largest of whichexceeds 50 terminals.andP;  The next development will be to add ahigh-specification classified system, to be launched at the UK Newstecexhibition this fall.andP;  These editorial and classified products eventuallywill replace existing systems based on the One Systems minicomputer or PCs.andO;The Dawn ad make-up terminal is sold as an element of these PC systems.andM;Two sales forces.andP;  Under the new structure, Agfa Compugraphic will have twosales forces: one for mainstream products and one for more speci-alizedsystems.andP;  In the former category are thc Integrator, the Macintosh and outputdevices.andP;  Among specialized systems are CAPS, Quadex and the 6000M graphicssystem.andP;  This means that one sales force will have to know how todifferentiate applications for Macintosh software from those best suited tothc Integrator, while the other force will have to separate Quadex bookpagination capabilities from CAPS documentation facilities.andP;  That sounds likea reasonable setup.andP;  What will happen if a newspaper system is added to thelineup we don't know.andP;  The Pacific region.andP;  Another question currently beingconsidered is how to address Asia.andP;  Agfa believes it has to increase itspresence there, in view of the region's role as &quot;the melting pot oftechnology.&quot; It hasn't decided what to do, but one possibility is to set upan operation there, including Randamp;D, 'in much the same way that Europe has beenused to develop scanners.andM;Input Systems: Moving Up Market  The major vendors in the small systembusiness over the last 15 years have been hit doubly by the technologicalrevolution now gripping thc industry,.andP;  Because these vendors havc relied onselling both front-end composition systems and output dcvices, they have beenforced to deal with challenges on both fronts.andP;  On the one hand, they havchad to adapt their output engines to PostScript, which generally meantdeveloping laser recorders and PostScript-compatible raster image processors.andO;This has been done by all of the major competitors.andM;The challenge for the front end has been much more complex and much moredifficult.andM;While the market has been crying for standard platforms, standard operatingsystems, standard networking protocols and standard user interfaces, thesecries have presumed that such standardization could be accomplished withoutmaking sacrifices in system productivity and, in many cases, withoutabandoning the customers who have made large investments inearlier-generation systems.andM;This has turned out to bc an extremely difficult task, leading vendors eitherto continue to use certain proprietary components or to abandon their oldproducts and start with a clean slate.andM;For example, Varityper's Epics system remains proprietary while its Comp/Edithas been phased out and its PC-based Maxx system has becn abandoned.andP;  ItekGraphix, now part of AE Dick, has opted to start ovcr with its Designitek andInPrint systems, leaving its Digitek/Quadritek and PTW lines to the ages.andM;Linotype has done likewise in starting over with its Series 2000, rather thanprolonging the life of the CRTronic.andP;  Alphatype has done a nice job ofporting its MultiSet software to the PC, but has found the networking aspectto be troublesome and hasn't attempted to modernize its user interface.andO;Penta, which, unlike the aforementioned vendors, hasn't to worry aboutproviding a PostScript typesetter, has finally made good-albeitbclated-progress in moving its software to the PC.andM;In that perspective, Compugraphic's performance doesn't look bad.andP;  CG added aSun workstation for graphics to its Quadex and MCS lines in 1985, butcontinued to use proprietary terminals on those systems.andP;  It moved itsPowerView software to a partially standard Unix PC in 1986 (and called it theIntegrator), but continued to usc a proprietary display controller.andM;It acquired the standard CAPS (Texet) system for technical documentation in1987 and has showcased it as a true fourth-wave system.andP;  An earlier project,the Intrepid newspaper systcm, used standard PCs but is no longer beingdeveloped.andM;The major areas in which Compugraphic has refrained from following standardsarc networks and keyboards, where productivity seems to favor the proprietarycomponents.andM;We are about to sec the next major development by Agfa CG in the front-endarena: the ncw-generation Quadex systcm, which has been built around standardSun platforms and thc traditional Quadex composition software.andP;  We'll say alittle more about it later, in anticipation of a formal debut at Graph Expoin October.andP;  Agfa CG directions.andP;  As Agfa looks to the future, it knows itmust continue its drive toward use of standard components.andP;  It says that, incontrast with the philosophy it has been following in recent times, namely,using industry-standard system controllers with modified operating systemsand proprietary keyboards, it has to move to completely standard hardware andsoftware, basing its products on Macintoshes, 80386 PCs and Sun platforms.andM;From a software standpoint, future directions will Include better support forcolor and graphics, with particular emphasis on halftones.andP;  Also targeted areimprovements in networking and continuing to provide a migration path forexisting users.andM;With that backdrop, we'll now take a look at thc currcnt Agfa Compugraphicsystcms and note some of tile changes expected in the future.andM;Quadex: just in time?andM;Over the last half dozen ycars, a frequent question around the industry hasbeen, &quot;Hasn't Quadex died yet?&quot; The answer has always been &quot;No,&quot; despite thefact that this commercial system has continued to look like a product of the1970s as we near thc end of die 1980s.andP;  Its composition sofware has remainedunchanged for the better part of a decade.andP;  Its only claim to modernity hasbeen thc Q6000 Sun workstation (later known as the 6000Q), which has beeninstalled in about 50 of the company's 900 existing customer sites.andP;  The6000, which was introduced at Print '85, initially offered minimal graphicscapabilities, but developments since then-both in graphics and in textprocessing have made it much more attractive.andP;  Beginning of change.andP;  Early in1987, Compugraphic demonstrated the ability to run the full Quadexcomposition program on the Sun 6000Q and said it was working to replace theproprietary Quadex terminals with standard ones for low-cost input andcomposition, estimating that we might see a development along those lineswithin a year or so.andP;  But the target date came and went, with no sign ofprogress.andP;  Compugraphic said it was having a difficult time implementing thcplan properly on a standard PC.andM;Meanwhile, Quadex systems continued to sell as 1987 passed and as 1988 cameand went.andP;  Finally, though, it appears that thc fountain of youth isabandoning this old warrior.andP;  Only a handful of ncw Quadex systems have beensold this year, we were told.andP;  In fact, there probably have been as many oldQuadex systems replaced by other vendors' products as there have been newQuadcx systems sold.andP;  And therein lies the problem: It is past time for ancxt-generation system if this product line is to survive.andM;The next generation.andP;  Fortunately, the next-generation Quadex systcm isnearly ready.andP;  Scheduled for release at Graph Expo in October, it has beenunder development for nearly two years.andP;  We have been asked not to give awaytoo many details about it in advance of the formal introduction, but we thinkit is important to discuss it here because it plays such an important role inthe company's strategy.andM;More than a year ago, when it started designing the new Quadex system (to becalled IQ), Compugraphic ruled out the possibility of merely porting thecomposition software to a PC on thc growths that the PCs of those daysweren't capable enough.andP;  Instead, it chose to run on the Sun MicrosystemsSun386i, with full multitasking and multiple windows.andP;  It chose the 386i touse the DOS window to be able to run DOS programs and import data.andM;The IQ is being designed on &quot;open architecture&quot; principles to supportwhatever standard modules may become availablc.andP;  For example, although itruns under Sun Windows employing a CG user interface, a standard one could besubstituted later.andP;  (Agfa says it didn't want to wait for something like OpenLook to be ready.)andM;In functionality, IQ will provide all of the features currently available ondie Q5000 system, including math, pagination, the Quadex programming languageand standard editing and composition.andP;  Also offered will be draw and paintprograms, developed by Island Graphics, plus support for the Focus scanner.andO;Editing will be done in a window displaying monospaced text, not on thcWYSIWYG screen.andP;  This was a conscious decision bascd on feedback from currentusers.andP;  Thus, IQ will be differentiated from products like DocuPro and Frame,which provide WYSIWYG editors.andP;  Agfa CG is betting on retaining a market forthis type of product well into thc future.andM;We expect to provide a detailed report after the product is released at GraphExpo.andM;Integrator: continuing the historic lineandM;If Quadex is an example of a product line that survived for a remarkably longtime without changing significantly, the Integrator is one that has gone withthc flow, adapting to new technology as it came along.andP;  The Integrator'sroots go back at least as far as the EditWriter, which was the firstafl-in-one, fully integrated editing/composition station (although even theEditWriter was derived from the Unified Composer front end and the UniSettertypesetter).andM;When the MCS (Modular Composition System) was introduced in 1981 to replacethe EditWriter, it uscd a new processor (an Intel 8086) and provided amodularity not yet seen in any competitive products.andP;  Although it wasn't on apar with the more expensive, more capable commercial systems such as thosefrom Quadex and Penta, it supported multiple intelligent terminals capable ofsharing a database and a typesetter.andM;Then along came the PowerView with its large screen and fast, nearlyinteractive preview.andP;  Also developed during this time were a coordinate-basedpagination program (PowerPage), a programming language, a math package andforeign language support (including Arabic and several Indian scripts).andM;The Integrator's contributions to upgrading the line have been a much morestandard platform (a Unix C), which supported much enhanced performance, andintegrated graphics.andP;  We say thc platform is &quot;much more standard&quot; because itstill uses a proprietary display card, a Compugraphic keyboard and anout-of-the-mainstream operating systcm (a version of Xenix that is availableoff the shelf, but is not widely used).andP;  The original Integrator was based onan 80286 CPU, but thc latest version uses a '386.andM;This progression is consistent with the steady upward migration of CGproducts we noted earlier.andM;Sales.andP;  This series of products has demonstrated a truly remarkable abilityto endure, as the following numbers indicate:andM;* EditWriter.andP;  We didn't get an exact number of EditWritersandM;sold between its introduction in 1977 and its demise in 1982, but it probablyincludes about 20,000 complete units with typesetters and perhaps 10,000offline terminals.andP;  If we figure that about 30,000 machines were sold in fivefull years, that is an average of 6,000 machines per year.andM;* MCS.andP;  Compugraphic says it installed approximatelyandM;21,000 MCS terminals from 1981 to 1986, when manufacturing of new machineswas terminated.andP;  This includes the MCS 10, MCS 5 and MCS 100.andP;  This amountsto an average of about 4,000 per year.andM;* PowerView.andP;  From its introduction late in 1984 until aboutandM;1988, when it started to be phased out, approximately 12,500 PowerViews weresold, including both large-screen and small-screen versions, for an averageof about 3,000 per year.andP;  * Integrator.andP;  The first Integrators, based on80286 CPUs,andM;were shipped in 1987.andP;  Compugraphic reports that it has sold more than 5,000Integrators so far, including 1,000 of the '386 machine since itsintroduction seven months ago, Agfa CG reports that 33% of its Integratorsales go to new customers-not thosc who previously owned CG equipment.andM;The bottom line.andP;  What do these results mean? It might appear that CG hasbeen facing declining success since the EditWriter days.andP;  But it is importantto note that each successive machine has been introduced at a higher pricethan the previous one, and that sales of front ends generate sales oftypesetters, which also have been edging upward in pricc.andP;  Thus, whereEditWriters outsold MCS systems, which in turn outsold PowerViews, which sofar have outsold Integrators, revenues from those sales have not decreasedaccordingly because of thc higher sales prices, not only for thc front ends,but for the typesetters, which have gone up in pricc also (EditWriter to 8400to 9400 .andM;Another interesting statistic that Compugraphic compiled by talking with itsusers is that thc Integrator provides significant productivity increases overearlicr CG products (e.g., a 51% increasc over the MCS and 100% over theEditWriter-a surprisingly low figure in view of the speed of the EditWriterprocessor).andP;  We also were told that owners of Integrators who earlicr had MCSand PowerView systems claim that one operator can produce between $150,000and $170,000 of work annually, compared to $80,000-$120,000 for an MCSoperator and $100,000-$130,000 for a PowerView operator.andM;The present.andP;  As most readers are undoubtedly aware, the Integrator providesa PowerView-like display (a text window and a preview window) in which thepreview is updated at most simultaneously with input in the text window.andO;Unlike thc PowerView, the screen can be divided horizontally or vertically.andO;It runs on thc same CG Network as MCS and PowerView workstations.andP;  It alsoprovides the option of displaying true fonts instead of representative ones.andM;Agfa Compugraphic currently employs 22 engineers working on Integratordevelopments.andM;Recent enhancements to the Integrator have focused on thc '386 version andgraphics support.andP;  Thc original version included a draw program, to which hasbeen added paint capabilities.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic recently began selling a&quot;graphics subsystem&quot; that includes the Agfa Focus scanner, scanner supportsoftware and the ability to merge graphics with text on the Integratorscreen.andP;  At the moment, graphics can't be sent over the network, but thatwill come in a release scheduled for about the time this article ispublished.andM;The Integrator supports assignment of spot colors to elements within a job,but it displays thc colors in monochrome mode only.andM;The future.andP;  Some features that currently aren't possiblebut we resume arebeing considered for future releases-include importing graphics files fromstandard PC and Macintosh programs and processing photographic images.andP;  Wedon't know what is in store for Drupa next spring, but we expect to see asignificant new release.andP;  Agfa has indicated that its target is a morc opensystem, particularly in supporting integration of off-the-shelf software.andM;What about a completely standard machine? If the software could bc modifiedto run on a 100%-standard platform, Agfa would find it much faster to switchto ncw platforms as thcy become available.andP;  It also would be possible forusers to run off-the-shelf software on the machine--a capability not nowavailable.andP;  We believe the Integrator will continue to use a keyboarddesigned for productivity in a typesetting environment, with its specialsingle-kcy functions, better grouping of functions, etc., rather than switchto a standard kcyboard, although it would be nice to offer both alternatives,as some othcr vendors have donc.andP;  (Remember, on a command-driven system likethis, the keyboard is the user interface.andP;  This is unlike a WYSIWYG systemwith pull-down and pop-up menus.)andM;Similarly, the user interface doesn't conform to any of the standardoperating environments, although additions to the program in recentycars-mostly in the area of graphics-were designed to be consistent withmainstream icon- and menuoriented programs.andP;  The Integrator doesn't supportmultiple windows for opening two jobs at the same time.andP;  (It has one windowfor text with codes, one for the preview and a pulldown dialog box forsetting up the preview, graphics importing, etc.) It has a goodcode-conversion program for importing files from word processors, but itdoesn't enable cutting and pasting from a second file into thc main one.andM;These are features that could be added to make the program conform to morestandard conventions, but this isn't the course Agfa is following.andP;  It viewsthe Integrator as a product for specific markets that are primarily concernedwith functionality, not with conforming to conventions found on off-theshelfproducts.andM;MCS 6000 Although the original MCS system has becn phased out in favor of thePowerView and the Integrator, the MCS name lives on as the identifier forseveral products, among which is the 6000M (for MCS) graphics system.andP;  Thisis basically an MCS version of the 6000Q that is sold with Quadex systems,but it runs thc MCS composition software on the CG Network that alsoaccommodates MCS terminals, PowerViews and Integrators.andM;The 6000M has been installed in about 150 sites, Agfa says, each with a CGScanner 2000 for input of monochrome images.andP;  It now runs on a Sun-3/140 withtwo 327-MB disks.andP;  Thc price has been reduced from $70,000 to $56,000.andM;The 6000 is a &quot;mature product,&quot; but enhancements continue to be made.andP;  Thelatest ones, scheduled for release at Graph Expo,are the ability to put two600OMs on a CG Network, rather than just one, and incremental additions todie user interface and graphics handling.andP;  New graphics features are supportfor round-comer boxes, degradees, blended thick and thin rules, merging andcollaging of graphics, automatic masking of scanned images, creation of dropshadows, spreads and chokes (but without a color monitor) and an auto cleanupfeature.andM;Performance has been improved by enabling the operator to open a filedirectly from the server disk as an alternative to copying it first to alocal disk and then opening it.andM;Data compression algorithms have been added for efficiency in storing andtransmitting graphics.andP;  Approximate ratios are 1:4 for halftones, 1:10 forline art, and 1:50 for degradees, or about 1:7 as an overall average.andM;Agfa CG says it isn't planning to add support for process color to the 6000,but the 6000 will continue to be a viable product for the old MCS fine-aslong as it offers functionality not available on the Integrator.andM;Macintosh as a front endandM;Although the Integrator continues to serve as the key revenue source amongits front-end products, Agfa Compugraphic has seen the Macintosh market as ameans of selling output devices, fonts and Focus scanners.andP;  To serve thismarket, it has put together some packages using off-the-shelf software.andP;  Ithas gone a few steps further and trained its staff to provide hardware andsoftware support for the Macintosh for those customers who want full servicefrom one supplier.andP;  Compugraphic also provides financing.andM;When we heard about this plan, we wcrc skeptical.andP;  How many people would bclikely to eat Agfa to fix a Macintosh?andM;In theory, single-vendor support is convenient and practical.andP;  But if youcount the price of labor, which is likely to be considerably more than $100per hour, and travel time used by service personnel, most pcople are likelyto want to save money by carrying their Mac to the local store for repair.andO;On die other hand, Agfa is offering service contracts that at least spreadthe payments out, even if they don't necessarily save the customer money.andM;Agfa CG says it has sold more than 50 Macintosh systems since March.andP;  Asystem consists of a Macintosh (a II or SE/30), a CG output device (9400,9600 or 9700) with a PostScript processor, and either Quark Xpress or AldusPageMaker.andP;  (Agfa says most people are selecting Xpress.) Available optionsinclude laser printers (the Agfa 340OPS and the Apple LaserWriter), the FocusGS 800 gray-scale scanner and Mac interface, streamer tape, and so on.andM;The package prices aren't much below what it would cost to purchase the itemsindividually.andP;  In fact, since they are based on the list prices of theMacintoshes, a uscr should be able to get a system cheaper by shoppingaround.andP;  For example, a Macintosh IIx with 4 MB of memory and an 80-MB disk,a 940OPS imagesetter, and Xpress or PageMaker software costs $54,000.andP;  AMacintosh SE/30, a CG 940OPS ($40,000) and Xpress or PageMaker cost $48,000.andO;But with any of these packages comes the alternative of buying Agfa serviceand support, which is important to some people.andM;Available options include the usual add-ons: the Agfa Focus scanner for$5,495, the Agfa 340OPS printer for $12,500, the Apple LaserWriter IINTX for$7,000, CG fonts (13 volumes, or 51 faces, for $1,200), etc.andP;  The system canbe purchased with a dual Rip-one supporting CG slave input, die othcrPostScript-or a RasterOps color monitor.andM;Agfa also says it is considering working on its own extensions to Xpressusing the Xtension capability provided by Quark.andM;CAPS: the key is the marketandM;After selling CAPS systems for about 30 months, Compugraphic says that it hasapproximately 45 customers actively using die product.andP;  In addition, we weretold, about 30 of Texet's customers are hanging onto their proprietarysystems that predated die version running on Sun Microsystems workstations.andO;With Texet out of business, Agfa Compugraphic hopes to upgrade those users tothe Sun version.andM;Recent sales have been good, Agfa says, including 27 system orders betweenJuly and December 1988 and about eight this year.andM;Recent developments also have been positive, including negotiation of dealswith SoftQuad and Avalanche for CALSrelated capabilities to focus on thatmarket.andP;  But just as important as providing that functionality will befinding a means of reaching those markets.andP;  To date, Compugraphic hascapitalized primarily on traditional graphic arts customers who need tohandle structured documents.andP;  With its strong facilities for handlingstructured documents, CAPS should sell well in CALS markets.andP;  Thc challengeis to shift the sales focus to office markets where huge amounts of datastored on computers need to be published and where funds are available forpurchasing systems that are CALs-compliant.andP;  Some of Agfa's competitors arebetter prepared to reach these markets, but we don't see why Agfa can't getits share also.andM;Without a contribution from this large pool of prospective customers, thcroad ahead wiU look difficult.andP;  In fact, even with the number of sales thathave been achieved so far, we don't believe that the overall CAPS operationhas been profitablc, partly because of the degree of customizing that hasbeen done for many of the sites.andP;  Not only is it expensive to customizesystems for particular environments, but then every time the base software isupgraded, more customizing often has to bc done to incorporate the newfeatures.andM;According to Bob Crevels, Agfa is working toward producing a more standard,&quot;vanilla&quot; product so that one upgrade fits afl customers.andP;  That is histarget.andP;  And that is the focus of current developments-plus finishing otherenhancements now under way.andM;Frame add-on.andP;  The deal with Frame Technology to make FrameMaker 2.0 software(not yet released) available to CAPS users is proceeding satisfactorily, Agfasays.andP;  It is bcing aimed at four applications:andM;* Handling unstructured documents outside of the CAPS sysandM;tem, (CAPS is designed for highly structured documents and isn't well suitedto less rigidly structured ones.)andM;* Incorporating unstructured pages within a CAPS document.andM;* Providing authors a WYSIWYG input and editing station.andM;* Serving as an entry-level system for customers who don'tandM;have a CAPS system, but who may later buy one.andP;  In other words, FrameMakerwill be used for all types of applications, but users may realize later thatthey need more powerful facilities for handling structured documents, so theymay purchase a CAPS system.andM;There are no restrictions on how or to whom Agfa can sell the Frame software.andO;The two companies plan to release it concurrently, probably within a coupleof months.andP;  Orders are already being taken.andM;Input/output server.andP;  Agfa CG is working also on a dedicated server forhandling scanning input and output functions on a CAPS system.andP;  Using a Sun-3/140, it will provide faster throughput and run on a standard TCP/IPnetwork.andM;CALS support.andP;  Agfa CG is continuing to add to its support for the CALSinitiative, attempting to provide the tools to produce fully compliantdocuments.andP;  The company believes its greatest strength wiU be in its &quot;smarteditor,&quot; which is a vcrsion of the SoftQuad program.andP;  It will be able tohandle any document type definition, has a built- in parser, automaticallyinserts generic tags, and guides the author through the creation of SGMLdocuments.andP;  That is, while editing is taking place, it flags any changcs thatdon't conform to SGML.andP;  Then SGML codes are automatically converted to CAPS'sinternal codingandM;The author/cditor software has been in beta testing for two months and is duefor general release soon.andM;Following that, the intelligent recognition system developed by Avalanche,also undergoing beta testing, will be released within the next two months.andO;It identifies tables regardless of whether they are coded with spaces ortabs, identifies paragraphs, and so  on.andM;Dawn for the newspaper marketandM;In addressing the newspaper market, as we noted earlier, Agfa CG hassuspended development and ncw salcs of the Intrepid line of editorial andclassified systems (although add-on hardware and sofware are being suppliedto existing customers).andP;  No decision has been made regarding the possibilityof offering a replacement product at a future date.andP;  Existing Intrepidcustomers will be supported, at least for the foreseeable future.andM;The company remains committed to the Dawn workstation for producing displayads, however, continuing a role that Compugraphic started in 1978 whcn itintroduced the AdVantage system.andP;  We have covered Dawn previously and won'trepeat the details here, except to say that the latest developments includesupport for '386 PCs and rotation of text and graphics.andP;  These weredemonstrated at the ANPA show in New Orleans in June.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;19120, p.andP;  31)andM;Color systems: recovering from MosaicandM;A year ago, Compugraphic was involved in a multimilliondollar project todevelop the Mosaic system.andP;  This was actually a two-part project that wassupposed to produce a lower-cost version not accommodating scanned colorimages and a higher-priced one that did.andM;The color capabilities werc to be fully integrated with the PowerView andIntegrator text systems.andP;  A new color scanner was bcing developed byAgfa-Gevaert in Europe.andP;  A ncw flatbed version of the 9600 imagesetter,called thc FB, was being designed to provide precise registration foroutputting four color separations.andM;That game plan has been modificd substantially in recent months.andP;  The Mosaiceffort, which as recently as January had been given its own priority statuswithin the EPP unit, has bcen folded in with the rest of the input/outputproducts.andP;  We will never sec a systcm called Mosaic or a 96OOFB.andP;  Some of thcdevelopments will bc salvaged and incorporated into other products.andP;  Otherswill be abandoned.andM;The Agfa color scanner wiU be retained.andP;  Instead of a flatbed version of thc9600, other enhancements will be made to the machine to enable output ofcolor separations.andM;What went wrong? Agfa CG isn't anxious to discuss thc problems it had withMosaic, but it appears that the development effort took longer than expectedand, before anything was rcady for the market, it became clear thatoff-the-shelf software products were advancing at such a rapid rate that itwould bc difficult for Mosaic to remain competitive at its anticipated price.andM;In addition, Agfa says, it was anxious to optimize Randamp;D efforts in the U.S.andO;and in Europc.andP;  It wanted to share the expertise of the color team with thatof the rest of the company; bring the color effort into mainstreamdevelopments.andP;  This led to eliminating the separate Color Systems Division.andM;What's in store? Agfa says it is committed to supplying color capabilities toits users.andP;  In Bob Crevels's words, &quot;The market's desire for a low-cost,PostScript-based color editing and separation system running on standardhardware platforms has never been stronger.&quot; The question remains, though,just what Agfa CG will do and when it will do it.andP;  The 6000M and theIntegrator aren't scheduled to support process color facilitics, but the newQuadex IQ will.andM;Agfa hasn't said anything specific about a replacement for Mosaic, exceptthat this development is a high-priority item and it would be reasonable toexpect to see a product by Drupa.andP;  We wouldn't bc surprised to see it firstat Graph Expo in October, although that hasn't been confirmed.andM;We don't know what platform the new product will run on, although Agfa'sincreasing use of Sun Microsystems workstations might suggest a likelycandidate.andM;Output Systems and Scanners  Compugraphic, which over the years has suppliedmorc than half of all the typesetters installed in the newspaper andcommercial markets, has been hit hard by rccent technological changes.andP;  Notonly have low-resolution, plain-paper machines replaced a lot of UniSettersand EditWriters in small newspaper operations, but at the high end, Linotypegrabbed a near monopoly in the PostScript market, wresting from CG a portionof its traditional customer base.andM;Theresult of thesc two developments (plus other factors related to front-endsystems) was a rather precipitous drop in revenucs for Compugraphic, as wenoted earlier.andM;There was no way Compugraphic (or any of its competitors) could put up muchof a fight against the LaserWriter at the low end of the market, but, asLinotype discovered, the base of LaserWriter users provided a fertile groundfor supplying high-resolution PostScript machines.andM;So, early in 1987, CG announced that it would have PostScript compatibilityby the end of that year.andP;  But it announced its intention before it hadactually finalized its deal with Adobe.andP;  Under pressure from Linotype, Adobebalked and Compugraphic had to look elsewhere.andP;  As a stopgap measure, itturned to Custom Applications, Inc.andP;  (CAI), for a software PostScript &quot;clone&quot;interpreter.andP;  The CAI software, sold as &quot;CG Script,&quot; converted PostScriptinput into standard CG input commands to drive its existing 8400 and 8600typesetters.andP;  Naturally, this setup was limited in its PostScriptcapabilities to what the typesetters themselves were capable ofperforming-which excluded some of thc ways of manipulating font charactersand some other complex functions.andM;The real answer required not only a proper PostScript RIP, but also amoderately priced laser recording engine in addition to the 9600, which hadbeen introduced at Drupa in 1986 and was performing well in a CG environment.andM;Compugraphic attacked the problem by signing a deal with Adobe for an AtlasRip and by developing the 9400 imaging enginc that was introduced at IPEXlast fall.andP;  These developments have led to a resurgence by Agfa Compugraphicin the market, generating a large volume of sales in the product's first fewmonths and restoring some of the momentum the company lost in thc last fewyears.andM;The 9400: CG Slave, PostScript, PCLandM;As we reported from EPEX, the 9400 is configured with the recording engine inone cabinet and the RIP as a separate unit.andP;  The recorder uses a stationarylaser-diode light source and a rotating prism to image across an area 78picas wide on rolls of photographic media at selectable resolutions of 1200or 2400 dpi.andP;  For each raster line laid down, the photographic medium movesone incremental unit according to the resolution in effet.andP;  The recordingspeed is rated at 5&quot; per minute at 1200 dpi and 2.5&quot; per minute at 2400 dpi.andO;The recorder stops and starts as needed to keep pace with thc RIP.andM;Because of the capabilities of thc laser-diode light source and imagingmaterials, Agfa recommends thc 9400 for producing halftone screens with amaximum mesh of 100 lines.andM;Two Rips, which are now referred to as the 9000 series RIPs, are available:one compatible with Adobe PostScript input and one (called Genics) to handleothcr input (CG Slave now and perhaps PCL in the future).andP;  Two RIPs can beconfigured to drive the same recorder alternately, but not with the ability,to mix elements from one RIP on pages from the other.andM;Genics.andP;  The Genics REP (the generic image control system) consists of anInter 80386 processor with a 34010 graphics coprocessor, 4 MB of RAM and a20-MB disk (expandable to a total of 160 MB).andP;  Its specifications arcattractive: sizing and leading increments of one- sixteenth of a point;rotation of text in one-dcgrec increments and of pages in 90-degrccincrements; expanding and condensing of type from 4 to 99 points; andslanting in one-degree increments to plus or minus 63.andM;Genics supports a variety, of input languages:andM;* CG Slave.andP;  For traditional commercial and newspaper marandM;kets, the 940OG supports input from front-end systems that drive otherCompugraphic typesetters.andP;  As with other current CG devices, it uses&quot;curvilinear&quot; fonts from thc CG library, accessed from disk as needed.andM;* PostScript.andP;  Using a CG Script II PostScript clone RIP fromandM;CAI, the 940OG will accommodate PostScript input in much thc same mariner asan Adobe RIP, although fonts come from thc CG library defined in CG'scurvilinear format.andP;  Seventy-three fonts arc compatible in metricswith AdobePostScript faces.andP;  Fonts beyond those 73 are CG designs and won't provideexact matches with widths of Adobc designs.andP;  Unlike the original CG Script,which translated PostScript input into CG codes and couldn't handle functionsnot supported by thc code or the output device, CG Script II can handle allstandard PostScript functions.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic says it hasn't found astrong market response to CG Script II, perhaps because it doesn't offer asignificant performance advantage over thc Adobe RIP and perhaps becausecompatibility with Adobe fonts is limited to 73 faces.andM;* PCL.andP;  In our report from IPEX, we speculated that AgfaandM;Compugraphic would later offer a PCL interpreter running in the Genicsprocessor.andP;  Although no formal announcement has been made, we believe thatthis will be the case.andP;  We don't know how the PCL interpreter will beimplemented, but wc presume it will sc-ale fonts using the CG Intellifonttechnology and curvilinear fonts.andM;Thc 940OG sells for $35,995.andP;  CG Script II adds $4,995.andP;  Fast start for Adobcmodel.andP;  The vcrsion of the 9400 with an Adobe RIP has been one of the keys toAgfa Compugraphic's effort to regain the momentum it has lost in the marketin recent years.andP;  It appears that the machine has done very well in its firstfew months, based on unconfirmed sales figures from Agfa Compugraphic andgeneral impressions from the field.andM;According to Agfa CG officials, more than 1,200 of the 940OPS units wcrcshipped between the middle of February, whcn shipments wcrc begun, and thcend of June.andP;  That comes to an average of more than 250 machines per month-apace that would yield morc than 3,000 sales in a year if it could bemaintained.andP;  What we don't know is how many of those sales are the result ofpent- up demand for Compugraphic PostScript machines and how many of them arebased on market comparisons and conclusions that thc CG product offers aprice/performance advantage over its competitors.andP;  If the machine canmaintain a similar pace over the next six months, it should indicate asignificant swing in its favor.andM;The machine has basic advantages over some competitive models.andP;  It overlapsthe recording operation with processing in the RIP so that the RIP can beginwork on the second page while the first one is bcing imaged.andP;  Thc system alsocomes with 73 standard fonts, compared with 13 or 35 on most other machines.andO;It sports an 80-MB disk as standard.andM;High-performance PostScript RIP.andP;  The newest development with regard to theAdobe Rip is thc addition of a high-performance PostScript RIP, called the900OPS Max.andP;  It is based on a 25 -MHz 68020 CPU, instead of the 16.67-MHzprocessor in the standard 900OPS, and has 8 MB of memory.andP;  The Max also has a68882 coprocessor, morc optimized code and more efficient memory design,according to Agfa CG.andP;  The result, we are told, is a performance increase ofabout 30% compared with the 900OPS over a board range of jobs.andP;  Agfa alsoclaims that the 900OPS Max will be 20% more efficient than a Linotype RIPIII, but wc haven't bcen able to compare the two ourselves yet.andP;  (We arecurrently running comparative speed tests of these and other machines forpublication in a forthcoming issue.)andM;The Max option will cost several thousand dollars more than thc standard RIP($5,000 more in the U.S., but prices in othcr countries will vary).andP;  It canbe retrofitted on existing 940OPS machines in the field.andM;Beyond that, Agfa says it is working closely with Adobe (the two companies'relations have improved markedly in two years) and plans to support otherproduct developments as they become available.andM;9600: PostScript and colorandM;Since the introduction of thc 9600 in 1986, it has becn repackaged in amodular fashion similar to thc 9400.andP;  It now accommodates either a CG SlaveRip or an Adobe PostScript one.andP;  As we have noted previously, the 9600 isapproximately twice as fast as the 9400 in imaging speed (10&quot; per minute at1200 dpi, 4.5&quot; per minute at 2400 dpi) and uses a helium-neon laser withholographic optics supplied by Holotek.andP;  This gives it the capability ofproducing finer-screen halftones (up to 141 mesh).andM;The PostScript RIP for the 9600 is the same as for the 9400.andM;The newest developments under way for the 9600 are enhancements that willenable production of color separation film on the machine.andP;  This isn't the96OOFB flatbcd unit that was previewed at IPEX last year.andP;  That model hasbeen abandoned.andP;  The new enhancements will support a better leading systembased on edge guides and an optimized spot measuring 20 microns instead of 30on the other machine.andP;  It also will use a reloadable cassette.andM;The new 9600, which is scheduled for initial deliveries this fall, willbecome the standard 9600.andM;9700: wide measure machineandM;There are no new developments for the 9700, which is quite similar to the9600 except in page width: up to 108 picas.andP;  The 9700 uses a slightly fasterprocessor that enables it to run at approximately the same speed as the 9600,only over a wider measure: 10&quot; per minute at 1200 dpi and 4.5&quot; per minute at2400 dpi.andP;  The enhancemcnts to the 9600 to support output of colorseparations wiU not be added to the 9700.andM;The future at the low endandM;The remaining output device in the Agfa CG family is thc 8000-the last of thcCRT-technology machines.andP;  The 8000 is still being manufactured and is stiffserving thc low end of the market, where its $15,000-$20,000 price tag ismuch more within thc budgets of some small shops and inhouse operations thanthe $35,995 9400G.andM;How long win thc 8000 remain as the machine serving the low end? After itsdemise, wil Agfa Compugraphic offer a replacement product based on newertechnology?andM;We didn't get firm answers to those questions, but we were told that thecompany remains committed to serving the low end of the market and it isconceivable that a laser machine less capable than the 9400 could bedeveloped and sold for an attractive price to low-end users.andP;  Where such amachine would be priced within the broad range between the 8000 and the 9400is unclear.andM;Plain-paper engines: 340OPS and 42OXLandM;Agfa CG has introduced two 400-dpi plain-paper recording engines recently:the 340OPS supporting PostScript input and the 42OXL supporting the GenicsRIP.andM;The 340OPS, based on a Minolta engine, uses the Adobe Atlas RIP with 4 MB ofmemory, a 20-MB disk and 73 fonts as standard-the same Rip and fonts as the9000 series highresolution recorders to match proof output with finalhighresolution output.andP;  The 340OPS prints pages at a rate of 12 per minute.andO;(The U.S.andP;  price is $12,500.)andM;The 42OXL, which runs off the Genics RIP, uses the same fonts as are outputon high-resolution recorders (9400, 9600 or 9700).andP;  A single Genics RJP candrive both a high-resolution recorder and a 42OXL.andP;  Imaging speed is 10&quot; perminute on 11&quot; x 17&quot; pages and 20&quot; per minute on 8.andP;  5&quot; x 11&quot; pages.andP;  Thcexpected duty cycle is 30,000 impressions per month and the expected life istwo million impressions, The 42OXL costs $21,495 ($29,995 with a Genics RIPin a current promotional package).andP;  Agfa says it has sold 20 units since the42OXL was introduced in April.andM;The CG610 printer, which used the 600-dpi Panasonic engine, has beendiscontinued, presumably because of low demand.andP;  The CG40OPS, based on LEDtechnology, remaim available but is no longer being featured in the productfine,andM;Scanners: ACS 100, GS 800 and CG 2000andM;The newest scanner development is thc Agfa Color Scanner (ACS) 100 developedin Belgium by Agfa-Gevaert and previewed at the Seybold Seminars in March.andO;It is nearly ready for deliveries, with thc price expected to be under$50,000.andP;  That puts it in an interesting market segment between the low-endand the high-end scanners, providing nice fuctionality.andM;Using a 3,648-element CCD array, the ACS 100 supports resolutions from 300dpi to 2400 dpi and records 10 bits of data per pixel per color, outputtingtrue 24-bit RGB color.andP;  Originals can be transparent (from 35-mm slides to8'x 11&quot; pages) or reflective (from 3&quot; wide, scanned at 1200 dpi, to 12.3&quot;wide, scanned at 300 dpi .For gang scanning, multiple images can be mountedon die platen, given different setups, and scanned in one pass.andP;  Deliverieshaven't started yet.andP;  Pricing win be announced.andM;GS 800 monochrome unit.andP;  The monochrome scanner for the low- end market,cared the GS 800, is a flatbed CCD device supporting both the Macintosh andthe PC at resolutions andamp;om 100 to 800 dpi, with 64 levels of gray.andP;  Weunderstand that developments are under way to support 256 gray levels, but wchaven't seen this capability demonstrated.andP;  It handies originals up to 8.5&quot; x13&quot;.andM;With the scanner, Agfa offers MC View Plus software for scanning, enhancingand manipulating line art or contone images.andP;  Manipulation capabilitiesinclude zooming, editing (with pen, brush, spray), fills, text creation andpolygon creation.andP;  Common file formats are supported.andM;Scanner 2000.andP;  Thc Scanner 2000 was developed five years ago for use with the6000 monochrome graphics workstations that currently support the Quadex, MCS,PowerView and Integrator systems, where it has been the primary inputscanner.andP;  It continues to be available, priced at just under $30,000, but thescanner that is incorporated into the Integrator Graphic System is thc GS800.andP;  No further developments are planned for the 2000.andM;Fonts: Playing on All the Fields  After many ycars in which proprietary fontformats, specific to each typesetter, were the industry norm, we are movinginto an era in which the font industry will be dominated by a fewstandardized formats that work across multiple brands and disparate imagingtechnologics.andP;  We believe that thc formats that become standard will be thoseof the mass-market desktop computing industry:andM;* Apple, whose ncw Royal outline format will appear inandM;Macintosh System 7 next year;andM;* Microsoft, which will add scalable fonts to thc next releaseandM;of thc OS/2 Presentation Manager;andM;*Sun, whose F3 technology, will be part of the next UnixandM;version from Unix International;andM;* Hewlett-Packard, whose PCL language is the basis for thcandM;most popular laser printers in thc world, the Laserjet series andcompatibles; andandM;* Adobe, whose PostScript font technology, has set the qualityandM;standard for mass-market laser printers.andM;While there is no guarantee that 'all of these formats will be popular (infact, it is almost sure that some will fall by thc wayside), we believe thatthis is the list from which the market will make its choice.andP;  All of the fontvendors of e traditional type industry now face the challenge of picking thewinners and converting their designs to the new formats.andM;Agfa Compugraphic, which has been a significant font supplier for most of its25 years, is trying to play all games at once: PostScript, where it offersfonts in Type One and Type Three formats; QuickDraw, where it supplies fontsand a utility, for generating fonts; and PCL, where it is Hewlett-Packard'spartner, supplying both thc Intellifont technology to be used in thelong-awaited PCL Level 5 and the CG font library.andP;  Also available is the TypeDirector program for configuring fonts for a PC.andM;It is too soon to predict who thc winners and losers wiU bc when the fontwars are over, but it is clear that Agfa Compugraphic has put a lot ofresources into the battle and is fighting it on many fronts.andM;In addition to merging its Font Technologies and Typographic Systemsoperations, Agfa CG has been active on the font product front.andP;  Developmentsinclude a new version of the Intellifont systcm for scaling fonts for displayon thc screen and for output to a printer, a routine for automatic insertionof hints into font databases, and a series of font packages for thc Macintoshthat will include a nice utility for configuring fonts.andM;Intellifont developmentsandM;Agfa CG recently announced several new developments for its Intellifontsystem, in addition to opening its file format to the public and offeringunrestricted licensing of thc Intellifont system.andP;  Bullet.andP;  The ncw versionof Intellifont, called Bullet, supports most of the same features as thestandard Intelllfont product but is smaller in codc size.andP;  and faster inoperation-not unlike what URW has done with Nimbus-Q and Bitstream has donewith Speedo.andP;  The main areas in which Bullet lacks Intellifont functionalityare that it generates font bit maps only, rather than outlines, and that itdoesn't support gray-scale fonts.andM;Bullet generates its bit maps on thc fly from the standard line-and-arcoutlines as are used with the Type Director and Intellifont 2.1 systems.andP;  Itcan accommodate unlimited resolutions and point sizes; expanding, condensingand slanting of characters; and character rotation in increments ofone-cighth of a degree.andM;In performance, Compugraphic says Bullet can generate bit maps on demand at arate of 125 characters per second and it can access 20,000 characters persecond from the internal cache memory module when producing 12point, 100-dpicharacters on a 16-MHz 80386 machine with no hardware enhancements.andP;  Wehaven't run Bullet to confirm those numbers .In a different kind of test runwith Nimbus-Q on a 20-MHz Compaq '386, characters were generated at a rate of94 characters per second for Avant Garde and 63 characters per second forPalatino, a morc complex font.andP;  However, those times include disk acccsses,which arc much slower than cache  memory.andM;Bullet's other main advantage over Intellifont, according to Agfa CG, is thatthe code is only 20 KB in size, comparcd with 70 KB for the full Intellifontprogram, (But, as a further comparison, URWs Nimbus-Q code is claimed tooccupy only 7 KB.)andM;In addition to the code space, Bullet requires 8 KB for fixed buffers andapproximately 10 KB pcr hundred bit maps for cache memory.andP;  Storage neededfor bit maps depends on the point size and resolution, of course, but at 100dpi, a 1 -KB block of memory can hold a 61 -point character, 4 KB for122-point, 16 KB for 156-point, etc.andP;  For 300-dpi bit maps, the storagerequired would be nine times greater.andM;Agfa CG says thc outline data format is compact: 290 symbols use 60 KB to 75KB.andM;Bullet is available to software developers to integrate into theirapplication products.andP;  Agfa CG says it can be customized easily and it has asimple application interface, consisting of six function calls.andP;  Pricing ofthe Bullet product hasn't becn announced.andP;  The Intellifont scaling technologyis priced at $30,000.andM;Bullet is scheduled to be available this month.andM;Automatic hint insertion.andP;  Agfa Compugraphic is making available itsautomatic routine for inserting hints into fonts to improve their renderingat low resolution in small sizes.andP;  Already in use by Agfa at its ownfacility, the tools will be offered to othcr font vendors in the thirdquarter of this year, available on workstation platforms.andP;  Agfa CG listed theMicroVax and OS/2 as possible platforms to bc supported later.andM;The company said it takes between two days and 3 1/2 days to generate thehints for one typeface.andM;AgfaType rolloutandM;Agfa Compugraphic has organized its various font offerings into a collectionof typefaces it calls AgfaType, serving PostScript, QuickDraw, PCL andCompugraphic's own users.andP;  The include five series.andP;  Clanic.andP;  The ClassicSeries is no morc than the traditional CG faces used on Compugraphic's lineof imaging devices, including the 8000 and 8400 CRT machines and die 9400,9600 and 9700 laser units.andP;  They sell for about $260 per volume, about fourto eight faces each.andM;Studio.andP;  The Studio Series is intended for users who want to manipulate theoutlines (using programs like Adobe Illustrator or Aldus FreeHand) to designtheir own decorative faces.andP;  The outlines, in Type Three format, arcrecommended only for devices with resolutions of 300 dpi and higher.andP;  Thesefonts include 250 predefined kerning pairs and have the same font metrics asthe Classic Series.andP;  Currently available are 26 volumes totaling 103 fonts.andM;The average price is $169 per volume.andM;Professional.andP;  In this series are the Type One PostScript fonts (hinted andencrypted) based on the technology Agfa has licensed from Adobe.andP;  Eighty-fivevolumes are available, each holding four to six faces, for a total of 410fonts.andP;  Available in both Macintosh and PC formats, these faces cost anaverage of $169 per volume.andM;Desktop.andP;  As yet unreleascd, this series will support Apple's new System 7.0after it is in the field.andM;Intellifont.andP;  This group of faces is supplied for use with PCs andHewlctt-Packard's PCL printers.andP;  It works with Agfa CG's Type Directorsoftware for creating fonts for die PC screen and PCL printer.andP;  In addition,many software developers use Intellifonts through OEM contracts with Agfa CG.andM;Conclusion  For most of its 25 years, Compugraphic has been characterizcd byits large manufacturing operation, its engineering-driven development, itshuge sales force and an aggressive approach to marketing.andP;  More than any ofits competitors, it has been able to define and serve thc broad, middlemarket that required effective, efficient products, if not the mostsophisticated ones in functionality.andM;The merger with Agfa-Gevaert gives thc company a broader focus and a feelingthat it can serve more markets than any other vendor.andP;  In thc electronicprepress market, it has its eyes set on providing full solutions, includingintegrated text and graphics in both monochrome and full, process color.andO;Meeting this objective wiU require completing some pieces that currently arcunfinished, such as the Quadex IQ, providing better support for industrystandards on the Integrator, further improvements in the speed of outputtingPostScript, success in selling its fonts and font technology ,etc.andP;  Thebiggest question mark of all, though, relates to handling color, whichrequires a vast amount of development time and expenditures, not toandM;mention thc problem of specifying the right product for the market.andM;.  Because of the fact that Compugraphic now is Agfa, the resources should beavailable to make this effort.andP;  However, having the resources to attemptthese developments and succeeding in them are two different things.andP;  Werecall vividly Compugraphic's abortive attempts to develop its own tech-docsystem starting with some of the Interleaf code, which ended instead bysigning a deal with Texet.andP;  And still fresh is the memory of the Mosaicexperience, which cost the company valuable time and resources.andP;  And, ofcourse, there is the PCS, a &quot;ground- breaking&quot; idea that failed for reasonspartially beyond CG's control.andM;In the case of the PCS, the setback cost the company dearly, both because ofthe time lost and because of the way the company responded to the failure.andO;Initially Compugraphic pulled back, feeling betrayed by Apple, which hadabandoned the Lisa t'n favor of the Macintosh and which had undercut CG'soutput developments in favor of PostScript solutions.andP;  Understandably,Compugraphic didn't want to engage in other partnerships with Apple.andP;  (Thatrelationship has bcen straightened out since then, though, and Agfa CGreports that it now is on excellent terms with Apple.)andM;In the period following the PCS's fall, Compugraphic first went into a periodof denial of the &quot;democratization&quot; of publishing that was taking place,believing that the activity at the low end was distinctly diffcrent fromhigher-end publishing.andP;  In effect, the company said it would be able tocontinue to operate as in the past by serving the &quot;real&quot; publishing marketthat couldn't be served by desktop publishing solutions.andP;  CG would deal withthe customcrs just above the desktop level.andM;Compugraphic did begin using PCs and Unix workstations as thc basis for newmodels of its publishing systems.andP;  However, it typically has used thestandard platforms as the foundations for proprietary, products.andP;  Most of itsPC- and workstation-bascd products have incorporated proprietaryelements-keyboards, display controllers, operating environments-and runproprietary software using CG command conventions, driver languages andoutput formats.andM;Market trend.andP;  Compugraphic had built its position by being a low-costmanufacturer in the typesetting market.andP;  It sought market segments that itcould dominate and priced its equipment aggressively to achieve domination inthese markets.andP;  As publishing systems became more sophisticated, CG graduallyfound itself moving up market.andM;Thc desktop publishing revolution reinforced this trend.andP;  CG was no longerthe high-volume, low-cost manufacturer.andP;  This change accelerated the upwardmigration already ander way.andP;  When it became less expensive to buy PCs andturn them into proprictary systems than to build its own PC-equivalents, CGdid so.andP;  But the consequcnces were that, while the publishing system marketwas growing dramatically, CG was serving an ever-shrinking portion of thatmarket.andM;If you add up the value of the hardware and software being purchased fordesktop publishing systems, it is clear that Apple passed CG to become thelargest manufacturer of &quot;typesetting&quot; systems quite early in the desktoppublishing revolution.andM;We wonder what would have happened if CG had decided to ride the desktoppublishing wave much sooner, rather than delaying.andP;  We also wonder what wouldhave happened if the company had realized that its real strength was nolonger engineering and manufacturing, but, rather, marketing and distribution.andP;  One of the unfortunate aspects of the desktop revolution is that the onlycompanies that had the nationwide marketing and support organizations to sellfourth-wave system solutions to a large number of smaller users (Compugraphicand Varityper) effectively left this market to computer dealers that couldn'tprovide the kind of system integration and application support that manycustomers would have liked.andP;  Customers have learned to do it themselves toget the benefits of die mass-market products.andM;Agfa CG: where to go from here.andP;  Things have changed considerably ovcr thclast couple of years at Compugraphic.andP;  Thc transition from the proprietarysystems of a traditional graphic arts vendor to the new wave of productsbased on new technology, and marketing trends is well under way.andP;  Some ofthose developments have clearly been successful, while others are too ncw tobe judged.andP;  But many of these changes appear now to fall on thc credit sideof thc ledger:andM;* PostScript.andP;  With Its 9000 series RIPs for the 9400 and 9600andM;imagesetters, Agfa CG has already demonstrated its abililty to compete headto head with other PostScript machines on the market.andP;  As long as this markctremains hungry, Agfa CG should get its share of the business.andP;  Although the9400 costs a few thousand dollars morc than a Linotronic 200P or a Varityper420OB-P (in the U.S.), it provides some additional features that make itworth the extra cost for many people (wider line length, higher resolution,more fonts).andP;  It fills a void in the product line that had to be filled.andM;* PCL.andP;  Although full details of this part of the company'sandM;stratgy haven't been made public, we anticipate this being an important partof the company's ftiture, not only in the business generated byHewlett-Packard's sales of Agfa CG technology: and fonts, but in the sales ofAgfa CG imagesetters running PCL.andM;* Platforms.andP;  One by one, Agfa CG systems are adoptingandM;standard platforms, although some of them still incorporate one or morcproprietary components.andP;  Agfa CG has made it clear that it does supportstandards, although it also places high priority on adding value, whichsometimes involves customizing the standard platforms.andM;* Full-service company.andP;  Although Agfa's sales of MacinandM;toshes haven't set the world on fire, they have been accompanied by asignificant number of service contracts.andP;  Agfa CG has trained its field staffin servicing Macs; if it can get enough sales to make the effort worthwhile,the reputation as a full-service company will be useful to have.andP;  * Quadex.andO;Although it's too early to judge die new QuadexandM;IQ as a production tool, the system appears to be suited to the requirementsand desires of a large portion of the installed base of commercial systems,of which Agfa CG currently has the lion's share with its 850 to 900 Quadexcustomers.andP;  The architecture is designed to be flexible, which should haveappeal beyond the current Quadex user base.andP;  For it remains true that, inspite of the glamor that has bccn associated with some of the commercialsystems built around standard hardware, none of the products running onstandard PCs and Macs can duplicate the productivity, stability andprofessional quality that are characteristic of thc proprietary systems thatonce ruled this market.andM;* Fonts andamp; font technology.andP;  CG has one of the largest librarandM;ies of digitized typefaces.andP;  It intends to supply versions of its fonts inmost of the principal font formats, including Adobe (PostScript), Apple, and,of course, Hewlett-Packard PCL (InteUifont).andP;  The HP connection may well turnout to be a major asset for CG.andP;  HP will include CG's Intellifont format (andthe CG library) as the scalable font technology in its long-awaited Level 5version of PCL.andP;  There are many more PCL printers (Hewlett-Packard Laserjetsand Deskjets) in use than PostScript ones.andP;  If this market docs migrate tothe more powerful PCL I-evel 5 printers, CG (which provides the fonttechnology, the font library and the high-resolution PCL output devices)should reap a bonanza.andM;Further, the HP connection could give CG an edge in convincing Microsoft toadopt Intellifont as the scalable font format for the next generation ofWindows (for MS-DOS PCs) and Presentation Manager (for OS/2 PCs).andP;  As we havcnoted earlier, the Microsoft selection is a highly coveted prize.andP;  Thewinning font technology will be built into every Windows and OS/2 PC sold.andM;* Integrator.andP;  Although the Integrator doesn't command asandM;firm a hold on its market as the EditWriter and MCS did in their heydays, itcontinues to sell and it provides many features that aren't found on theabundant PC and Macintosh systems.andP;  Obviously, thc Integrator costs morc andisn't completely standard, but there are markets where productivity is stillmost important.andP;  Recent enhancements-'386 processor and graphicssubsystem-should help keep it going.andM;But there are also some qucstion marks, which will require time to work out:andM;* Color.andP;  The abortive effort to develop the Mosaic systemandM;was costly in resources, time and credibility.andP;  To be the supplier of allaspects of prepress activities that Bob Crevels has set as the target, AgfaCG has a big task to accomplish if color is to be included.andP;  We don't haveany details about the replacement project under development, but Agfa isquite optimistic both about what it is doing and thc speed of activity.andP;  Weshall see.andM;* Newspaper system market.andP;  Although Compugraphic'sandM;presence in the newspaper market declined with the replacement of One Systemsby Intrepid, it was still a presence.andP;  Now there is only Dawn plus a range ofoutput devices.andP;  Just as the company's presence in the commercial market isbeing rejuvenated by the new Quadex system, Agfa is likely to want to remainin the newspaper market with another system product.andP;  We doubt that a newdevelopment will be undertaken, although we wonder about bringing the new UKsystem to the U.S.andP;  and making the appropriate modifications for this market.andO;.  * CAPS, CALS, etc.andP;  It has been clear for several years that theandM;promise of a gold mine for suppliers of tech-doc systems did not materialize.andO;The greatest sales have gone to desktop systems (Ventura Publisher) andworkstation-based software products (FrameMaker), rather than turnkeysystems.andM;CALS could change this.andP;  Increasing numbers of Department of Defensecontractors will have to have CALS-compliant documentation systems if theywant to stay in business.andP;  This could, indeed, be a gold mine for thosevendors thm can supply CALS systems.andP;  CG's CAPS system is best at handlinghighly structured documents (of thc sort that CALS anticipates) and weakestat handling the broader requirements of the commercial market.andP;  If we wereCG, we would do all we could to refocus both the product and the sales forceon the CALS markct, rather than the conunercial tech-doc market.andP;  This won'tbe an easy transition.andM;Beyond those product issues are the usual concerns faced by all companies,including factors such as employment levels, company morale and enlightenedleadership.andP;  It's hard to know what the appropriate size of the work forceis, aside from looking at the company's profitability.andP;  We understand thatboth Agfa Corporation and the Agfa Compugraphic division are profitable,although the EPP unit within Agfa CG is struggling to come back from a largedeficit last year.andP;  If additional layoffs are deemed necessary to get thatpart of die business back where it belongs, that will have to be done.andM;On the question of morale, when we visited Agfa's main facility and its fontdepartment recently, the morale seemed good.andP;  We got the impression that thenew leadership has been accepted and the directions are supported.andP;  It'sdifficult to keep morale high when cost-cutting measures are in effect andwhen new products aren't ready for the market, so it will be important tomake progress in some areas soon.andM;That depends mostly on the enlightemnent of the leadership, which has a fewkey decisions to make.andP;  The disadvantage they face is that neither KenDraeger nor Bob Crevels has been in the thick of the publishing systembusiness (input/output systems) for very long.andP;  They don't have the longyears of dealing with these issues that Carl Dantas had, which accounted inlarge part for thc company's success over the years.andM;On the other hand, the current age is one of new technology and new marketingstrategies, areas that Draeger and Crevels are familiar with, so they may beable to meet the needs and continue to provide a new perspective.andP;  The fistof people who hope they can do it is longer than the company's 3,700employees.andP;  The industry will be deeply affected if they fail.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
