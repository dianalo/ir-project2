President Rhys Eyton said the company is combining its two main airline operations under the name Canadian Airlines International Ltd., effective April 26.    At a news conference, Mr. Eyton added that the combined, 81-jet fleet will be expanded by next spring with four to six new wide-bodied aircraft, either the European Airbus A-310 or the Boeing 767. The jets, each valued at $55 million (U.S.) to $60 million, will be leased through a finance company rather than acquired outright, he said.    In a separate announcement, Pacific Western Airlines Corp. said it plans to establish a new commuter airline in the province of Ontario beginning in late May or early June, and has placed a $23 million aircraft order with British Aerospace PLC of Britain for the as yet unnamed carrier. The order involves six Jetstream-31 turboprop planes with an option for six more of the 19-seat aircraft.    Pacific Western Airlines Corp. is a Calgary, Alberta, holding company. Canadian Airlines International will consist of the operations of recently acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines, which is Canada's second-largest international carrier, and Pacific Western Airlines, a regional carrier in western Canada.    Mr. Eyton said Canadian Airlines International expects to begin next week the process of eliminating redundant management and operating jobs. He declined to say how many of the 13,000 employees might be dismissed. </TEXT></DOC>
