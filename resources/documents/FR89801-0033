Section 71.171 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this proposed rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Control zones.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
