In what analysts called the first case of industrial espionage between biotechnology concerns, John Stephen Wilson, 33 years old, was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents two weeks ago. He was accused of trying to sell documents that outlined Amgen's production processes for erythropoietin, a new anti-anemia drug, to Genetics Institute Inc..    Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said Mr. Wilson voluntarily left the company last month, saying he had accepted another job. Mr. Wilson couldn't be reached for comment.    Garen Bohlin, a Genetics Institute senior vice president, said the alleged offer, along with samples of Amgen's manufacturing secrets, were contained in a letter, signed &quot;Pimpernel,&quot; that the Cambridge, Mass.-based company received in June. Genetics Institute immediately forwarded the package to Amgen, he said. &quot;We were somewhat surprised&quot; to get the offer, he said, &quot;but had no question as to what our action was going to be.&quot;    Amgen and Genetics Institute currently are the only two companies manufacturing erythropoietin, which was developed to relieve the anemia that results from chronic kidney disease. Amgen, which began selling the drug in Switzerland last month, appears to have a head start on Genetics Institute, which just applied to market the drug in Europe a few weeks ago. If the drug wins U.S. approval, analysts project a $500 million annual world-wide market for it within a few years.    The two companies, each of which claims to hold some exclusive patents on erythropoietin, have been locked in litigation over those matters for more than a year. Mr. Bohlin said the challenges are pending in separate lawsuits in Los Angeles and Boston.    Mr. Wilson was arrested Aug. 11 at a Los Angeles restaurant. The indictment charges him with one count of interstate transportation of stolen property, said U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner. If convicted, Mr. Wilson could be sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison and fined as much as $250,000, Mr. Bonner said.    Because Genetics Institute already is producing the drug, the information Mr. Wilson allegedly tried to peddle might not have been very valuable, speculated Teena Lerner, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. She also said that any industrial espionage would have been &quot;doomed to failure,&quot; in a biotechnology industry &quot;where everybody knows everybody.&quot;    Amgen had second-quarter net income of $305,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $19.4 million. Genetics Institute had a second-quarter net loss of $3.6 million on sales of $6.4 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen shares closed at $30.75, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
