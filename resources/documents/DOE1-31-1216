This paper discussesthe application of automated type-curve match to such well tests. A comparisonwith the best of present methods, i.e., the pseudosteady-state method,shows that automated type-curve match proves to be better in the determinationof swept zone radius when mobility ratio is not high or when multipleflow rates have occurred. The application of automated type-curve matchto two field examples is demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
