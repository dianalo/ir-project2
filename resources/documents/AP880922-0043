Josiah Sang, permanent secretary in the ministry, said in astatement Wednesday that the action was take to rid the Departmentof Wildlife of ``dishonest and unreliable officers who have beenfound not only unproductive but also collaborating with poachers.''   The department has acknowledged that poachers have killed 92elephants in Tsavo National Park during the past four months.   Five game wardens and policemen have been killed and at leastnine wounded in clashes with poachers during the past month,officials said.   In the most recent clash, on Friday, police officers exchangedgunfire with about 50 suspected poachers in Tsavo. Newspapers saida policeman and a ranch foreman were killed and nine policemenwounded.   The Daily Nation, a Nairobi newspaper, said police rounded upmore than 200 people for questioning over the weekend. Police alsosearched vehicles passing through or near the park for gametrophies. There were no reports of arrests.   It is illegal in Kenya to possess wild game trophies without apermit and hunting is not allowed.   President Daniel arap Moi ordered rangers on Sept. 13 to shooton sight poachers caught in the country's national parks and gamereserves. He gave the order after the government suspended miningand prospecting in the country's 53 game and national parks, a moveaimed at denying poachers any cover.   Studies by the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program showthat in the past 15 years, Kenya's elephant population has dropped85 percent. An aerial survey in February of the vast Tasvo park insoutheastern Kenya found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated35,000 in 1974.</TEXT></DOC>
