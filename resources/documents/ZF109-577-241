Seagram andamp;Sons and Heublein, which concentrate on the U.S.andP;  market.andM;But while the acquisition was a strategic coup, it had the potential to be alogistical nightmare.andP;  McGuiness was valuable for its diverse line ofspecialty liqueurs, but with this diversity came 375 stock-keeping units, upfrom 120 before the takeover.andM;To fully exploit this new marketing clout, &quot;the emphasis had to be on ourcost of sales,&quot; says Elmer Cain, Corby's vice president of operations.andP;  Firstto be scrapped was on-site aging of whiskey, the &quot;raw material&quot; for the bulkof Corby's production.andP;  The distillery no longer ages its whiskeys in a cool,musty warehouse a stone's throw from the sleepy Moira River; it trucks themin from parent company Hiram Walker's plant in Windsor.andP;  At the other end ofthe production process, Corby built a $7 million bottling plant in the firsthalf of 1989 to handle its increased output.andM;The last part of the modernization drive targeted the blending operation, theprocess between aging and bottling.andP;  The 39-year-old Phelan, a nine-yearveteran of the distillery, was appointed superintendent of blending inFebruary.andP;  His goal was clear: better management of blending tanks, includingshorter turnaround times and fewer idle hours.andP;  &quot;We're like everybody else,&quot;Phelan says flatly.andP;  &quot;We're trying to cut our lead time between [receiving]an order and actually making the goods and shipping them.&quot;andM;Mix Me a Strong OneandM;Most of the blending operation's efficiency improvements were already inplace when Phelan took the superintendent job.andP;  In 1989 the distilleryinstalled a $215,000 Bran + Luebbe metering pump to automatically add theexact amount of water, distilled alcohol, flavorings, and other ingredientsto the factory's 15 blending tanks.andP;  To govern the pump's activity, Corbyinstalled a programmable controller, an industrial computer that regulatesmanufacturing processes.andM;Phelan's work group, housed in second-story offices above the factory floor,had also modernized by centralizing its internal operation on a new CompaqDeskpro 386s PC.andP;  The Compaq's hard disk holds production data, inventoryrecords, and 1-2-3 files containing the recipes for all 140 of Corby'sblended products.andM;To close the loop on its production investment, Corby needed a real-time linkbetween the factory floor and the offices above.andP;  Without the link, a blenderhad to locate a recipe in the spreadsheet, multiply the ingredientproportions by the desired size of the batch, and print out the number ofliters of each ingredient to be used in that particular batch.andP;  He thencarried the printout downstairs and rekeyed the data into the Allen-BradleyPLC 5/25 that controls the pump, a laborious task accomplished by jabbing thepressure-sensitive keys on the face of the unit with one finger.andM;&quot;Doing that manually is a real pain in the ass,&quot; declares Phelan.andP;  Anincorrect entry required the operator to recalculate the amounts of all theingredients to maintain the correct proportions for the blend.andP;  In the worstcases, the blenders had to set aside the contents of the tank for reblendingwithin a larger batch, or scrap the tank entirely and redistill its contents.andM;Most important, manual data transmission wasted precious time during theproduction day.andP;  Blending time for some products can be as short as an hourand a half, and washing a tank to prepare it for the next batch takes no morethan 15 minutes.andP;  On some days, there was almost enough time to squeeze in anextra batch--but not with manual data transfer.andP;  &quot;If data transfer is 15minutes faster for three batches,&quot; confirms Phelan, &quot;we can get an extrabatch in.&quot;andM;Enter @FactoryandM;In May Phelan turned to Sutherland-Schultz Ltd. for help in downloading therecipe data.andP;  The Kitchener, Ontario, construction-engineering firm andsystems integrator had played a key role in the design and construction ofthe new bottling plant.andP;  Sutherland-Schultz's advice was simple: If you'realready using 1-2-3, try Lotus's @Factory.andM;Sutherland-Schultz, whose 1989 revenues were more than $90 million(Canadian), became an @Factory value-added reseller (VAR) after searching for&quot;an off-the-shelf application that would allow clients to squeeze moreproductivity from their existing plant and equipment,&quot; says Roy Ojala,Sutherland-Schultz's director of marketing.andP;  &quot;Because @Factory is availableoff the shelf, we don't have any risk, we don't have any development time.&quot;andM;Sutherland-Schultz adds value to the @Factory package by physically linking aPC to the programmable controller network (installing a network card ifnecessary) and by supplying terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) software tocomplete the link.andP;  Because each programmable controller network isdifferent, each requires a different TSR to gather data from the network andtransfer it to @Factory.andP;  VARs like Sutherland-Schultz write these TSRs andbundle them with @Factory.andM;Because of the work the TSRs do behind the scenes, the @Factory interfacealways appears the same to the user.andP;  An @Factory application can betransplanted from one programmable controller network to another with onlyminor modification, as long as both networks have a TSR that supports@Factory.andP;  &quot;The product was designed with that kind of flexibility in mind,&quot;explains Jim Convis, the manufacturing marketing manager at Lotus.andP;  &quot;Wewanted it to be a universal interface to manufacturing information.&quot;andM;@Factory competes in the fast-growing market for low-priced industrialsoftware.andP;  A total @Factory package, including @Factory, 1-2-3 Release 2.2,and a collection of VAR-written TSRs, can cost as little as $2,500 (U.S.).andO;If the customer needs network cards or boards to tap into a programmablecontroller network, the package can run as high as $5,000.andP;  The bottom linefor Corby was a PC-to-programmable-controller link that cost about $8,000less than Phelan had expected to pay for software that supported only theAllen-Bradley programmable controller.andM;A 50,000-Liter BottleneckandM;But automating the batch-downloading process alone doesn't assure schedulingefficiency.andP;  Once blending is completed, filtering hoses transfer the blendedproduct to one of 26 stainless steel holding tanks, ranging in size from7,000 to 53,000 liters, that crowd the floor of the blending factory.andP;  Theblending operation then waits for its &quot;customer,&quot; the bottling plant, to usethe finished product.andM;Once drained by the bottling factory, the holding tank is washed to ready itfor the next batch of blended product.andP;  Holding tanks that sit full, orpartially full, create a bottleneck for the blending operation.andP;  As with theblending tanks, &quot;the key for me is to turn the holding tanks over as manytimes as I can,&quot; explains Phelan.andP;  &quot;The more times I can fill a holding tankand empty it, the more I can blend.&quot;andM;Once again there was a missing link, this time on the opposite side of thedata highway.andP;  Corby had installed a second Allen-Bradley programmablecontroller to monitor holding-tank levels, but the real-time data it gatheredweren't available on Phelan's PC.andP;  So a member of the blending work group,clipboard in hand, had to climb over a tangle of 3-inch hoses on the factoryfloor and record readings from pneumatic gauges on the tanks.andP;  Phelan sums upthe situation with typical directness: &quot;It was awkward and kind ofinconvenient, so people didn't do it.&quot;andM;Without regular spot checks to determine the rate at which the bottling plantwas draining a tank, it was impossible to predict when the tank would beempty and available for another batch.andP;  It might be in a couple of hours ornot until the next day.andP;  Nobody really knew.andM;Constantly ReadingandM;Ojala, a newcomer to macros, was responsible for customizing Corby's1-2-3/@Factory interface.andP;  To tackle Phelan's original goal of batchdownloading to the metering pump, Ojala used 1-2-3's @INDEX function to peerinto a spreadsheet database of Corby's 140 secret recipes.andP;  The downloadingmacro automatically multiplies the recipe proportions returned by @INDEX toachieve the desired batch size, then uses these results as arguments in an@WRITE function.andP;  With the @Factory add-in, the entire process requires asingle spreadsheet input.andP;  &quot;They choose a recipe number, and it's downloadedimmediately to the programmable controller,&quot; says Ojala.andM;To monitor the holding tanks, Ojala wrote a macro that uses @Factory's @READfunction to check each tank every five seconds to provide real-timeinformation.andP;  Every half hour, the macro writes the current tank levels to adisk file, giving the blending group a continuous record of tank status.andP;  Ifthe 1-2-3 file for tank monitoring is currently in the PC's memory, the macroupdates it as well with each five-second reading.andP;  If it isn't, @Factorycontinues to monitor levels and write them to disk in the background.andM;&quot;The fact that this can run in the background is probably the most appealingfeature,&quot; says Phelan.andP;  &quot;I want to be able to use that computer to do otherthings.andP;  @Factory runs in the background, and when we want to see it, we pullit up and look at it.&quot;andM;Against the GrainandM;The implementation of @Factory and other new technology, such as the meteringpump, represented &quot;a cultural change for the people who work here,&quot; Phelansays.andP;  In September, four months after the new system was installed, Phelan'stwo assistants, Chris Tylecki and Cam Potts, still doubted its usefulnessbecause of delays in calibrating both the holding tanks and the meteringpump.andM;There is less room for skepticism on the factory floor.andP;  The metering pumpautomates a task that has been done manually since the industry began morethan four thousand years ago.andP;  The four blenders no longer spend the bulk oftheir day watching a meter as a hose pumps ingredients into a blending tank.andO;Instead, they're busy unloading barrels of aged whiskey, filling outexcise-tax paperwork, and mixing new batches of delicately flavored liqueurs.andM;Eventually, Corby may be able to get by with fewer blenders, but because itnow blends a broad line of liqueurs for its McGuiness label, the floor of theblending operation isn't likely to become fully automated anytime soon.andP;  Somebatches require only centiliters--no more than a few drops--of concentratedflavoring.andP;  That still takes a human touch.andM;Savoring SuccessandM;The real-time link between management and factory floor has proven a vitalcomponent of Corby's multi-million-dollar effort to maximize the productivityof the distillery's plant and equipment and keep profits flowing.andP;  &quot;Thesystem of doing it all in your head just doesn't work,&quot; Phelan says.andO;&quot;@Factory allows us to cycle more product through here without increasing thesize of the plant.&quot;andM;The capital investment has already begun to filter to Corby's bottom line.andO;In the fiscal year that ended February 28, operating income rose 21%, to$21.2 million, on sales of $104.8 million, defying analysts' expectations oflackluster performance.andP;  Return on assets climbed to 11.1%, up from 10.1% theprevious year.andP;  Since the McGuiness acquisition, Corby &quot;has come a long wayin terms of profitability, asset productivity, and marketing and saleseffort,&quot; says Irene Nattel, an industry analyst at Levesque BeaubienGeoffrion, a brokerage firm in Montreal.andM;Last year Corby shareholders rejected Hiram Walker's bid to buy the 48% ofCorby that it doesn't already own.andP;  Nattel expects Walker to repeat the offerand believes that the outcome will ride on &quot;who can hold out longer.&quot;andP;  In themeantime, she says, &quot;cost control and productivity are critical in adeclining market.andP;  [Corby is] certainly maximizing the potential of thecurrent situation.&quot;andM;READING AND WRITING ON THE FACTORY FLOORandM;Using @Factory can be as simple as reading data from a single factory machinethrough a PC's RS-232 port.andP;  But the program's ability to work with multipleprogrammable controllers was crucial to its acceptance in a moresophisticated manufacturing environment like Corby's.andP;  @Factory's two add-in@functions, @READ and @WRITE, allow simultaneous transfer of information backand forth between 1-2-3 and multiple programmable controllers.andP;  &quot;You haveaccess to every programmable controller, no matter where it is in the plant,&quot;says Roy Ojala, Sutherland-Schultz's director of marketing.andM;Generally, each programmable controller contains a number of registers thatmonitor a certain machine or process within the plant.andP;  When installing@Factory, the customer or VAR sets up a configuration file that assigns eachof these registers a tag name--a string that can be used as an argument inthe @READ and @WRITE functions.andP;  The syntax of the @READ function, forexample, is @READ(device name,variable name,variable type,[domain name]).andM;The device name argument identifies which programmable controller to read.andO;By specifying a variable name, managers can read a particular register onthat programmable controller.andP;  The variable type argument tells thespreadsheet how to display the data--for example, as a floating-point numberor as a string.andP;  The optional domain name argument can be used to specify agroup of variables to which the target variable belongs.andP;  A second @READformula in the same spreadsheet can monitor a second register.andP;  Corby'stank-monitoring spreadsheet contains 26 @READ formulas, one for each holdingtank.andP;  The formulas are identical except for their variable name arguments.andM;The syntax of the @WRITE function is @WRITE(value,device name,variablename,variable type,[domain name]).andP;  Corby's spreadsheet uses 1-2-3's @INDEXformula as the value argument in the @WRITE formula for its batchdownloading.andP;  The @INDEX formula looks into the recipe database and finds thecorrect proportion for a certain ingredient.andP;  The spreadsheet then multipliesthe ingredient proportion by the size of the batch and writes it to theAllen-Bradley PLC 5/25 that controls the metering pump.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
