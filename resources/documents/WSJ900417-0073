The Institute of International Finance said banks will be&quot;cautious&quot; about making new long-term loans to governmentsand government-owned enterprises in Eastern Europe becausethey fear a repeat of the large loan losses they had in LatinAmerica and other Third World nations.</LP><TEXT>   In a report released yesterday, the institute said banksare likely to confine themselves for the most part tofinancing trade and specific development projects in EasternEurope. Such loans generally are for short periods and arebetter-collateralized than &quot;sovereign risk&quot; loans, which arebacked by borrowing governments.   The institute acknowledged that its assessment of EasternEurope's prospects is partly intended to lower expectationsof the region's capacity to be rapidly integrated with theWest. &quot;There's a grave danger that all this hype aboutEastern Europe can give an impression of economic strengththat isn't there,&quot; an institute spokesman said.   The report urged Western governments and multilateralfinancial institutions, including the newly created EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development, to accept most ofthe burden of aiding Eastern Europe. &quot;The banks aren't in thebusiness of conducting foreign economic policy,&quot; said HorstSchulmann, the institute's managing director.   The report noted that countries in Eastern Europe arestill poorly integrated into the world economy and have largedebt burdens. At the end of last year, seven East and CentralEuropean countries collectively owed the West $116.8 billion;that doesn't count those countries' debts to the Soviet Unionand its allies, which aren't convertible into othercurrencies.   The report said Hungary and Poland are moving ahead oftheir neighbors in adopting market-oriented policies, whileRomania and Bulgaria are lagging far behind. It added thatEast Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have the bestchances of obtaining fresh financing because of theirdebt-service record, close ties with the West and therelative strength of their reform governments.   The institute suggested that East European countries needto attract more private investment before they can obtainsubstantial new bank lending. Banks won't step up theirlending until they see a &quot;better balance between debt andequity&quot; in the region's capital supply, said Mr. Schulmann.By attracting more long-term capital, Eastern Europe canavoid a debt crisis such as occurred in many Latin Americancountries in the early 1980s, he asserted.   The report said East European countries can best helpthemselves by abandoning rigid price controls, releasingstate enterprises to the private sector, liberalizing tradeand investment rules and moving toward a system of freelyconvertible currencies. At the same time, it said, thesecountries can make their markets more attractive to foreigninvestors by establishing property rights, improving theirjudicial systems and promoting uniform accounting standards.   Mr. Schulmann added that Western banks will have moreincentive to do business in the region if they are allowed toopen branches and provide general banking services there.Currently, the opportunities for Western banks to providesuch services are limited.</TEXT></DOC>
