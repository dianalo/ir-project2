Tokyo stocks closed easier in thin dealings as investors turned lethargic ahead of the &quot;Obon&quot; summer holidays and a forthcoming U.S. economic indicator, brokers said.    In London, strong investor interest in composite insurance and pharmaceutical stocks, combined with news of a higher offer by Boots for Ward White Group, underscored the market's rise.    Dealers said market makers interpreted the renewal of speculative interest as an excuse to mark prices higher, thus giving a technical twist to the market's rise.    &quot;There's no real selling pressure at all because people are afraid of being left out when the market makes its next move forward,&quot; a dealer said.    The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 21.2 points at 2327.5, just a shade below the day's high of 2329.1. At its lowest, the index opened at 2315.9, a rise of 9.6 points.    The narrower Financial Times 30-share index ended up 16.8 points at 1940.8. Volume rose to a robust 731.4 million shares Friday, from 550.1 million Thursday.    Dealers said the market's strength was also demonstrated by its ability to withstand a retreat on Wall Street during the London afternoon. At the London close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.62 points at 2650.99.    The market received an early upward impetus from news that scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Health have found that Wellcome's antiviral drug AZT can forestall the development of AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex in patients with early infection. Wellcome ended 67 pence ($1.10) firmer at 514 pence ($8.42).    Other pharmaceutical stocks rallied in sympathy. Fisons climbed 8 pence to 349, SmithKline Beecham jumped 8 pence to 582, and Glaxo rose 20 pence to #15.10. Dealers said Glaxo's rise was also fueled by rumors that it is considering merging its research and development facilities with ICI's.    Composite insurance stocks rallied sharply on news that Australia's Adelaide Steamship Co., a group of companies headed by Australian financier John Spalvins, had sold its 13.01% stake in Commercial Union Assurance to Sun Alliance Group for #256 million.    Pharmaceuticals retailer Boots raised its hostile takeover offer for the stores company Ward White Group to 445 pence a share, or around #900 million. Ward White swiftly rejected the offer and hinted that a rival higher offer may be forthcoming. Ward White shares ended 12 pence higher at 451, while Boots closed up 2 pence at 301.    Meanwhile, in Tokyo, most investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the release after the close of U.S. jobless figures for July and the start of the holidays. The summer holiday season began over the weekend in Japan. It draws many investors and brokerage employees away from the markets from mid- to late August, but major financial markets will remain open through the month.    The Nikkei average of 225 issues dropped 37.82 points to 34741.99. The index fell 119.53 points Thursday.    Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million shares, down from 500 million shares Thursday.    Declining issues outnumbered advancers 430 to 416, while 240 issues were unchanged.    In early trading Monday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index fell 41.44 points to 34700.55.    Higher-priced stocks served as the main springboards for buying last week. But they didn't have the strength to pull the rest of the market higher by Friday afternoon's close, brokers said.    The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which fell 16.55 points Thursday, was down 3.42 points at 2613.27.    Currency shifts also damped investor buying interest, brokers said. The dollar, which fell to 135 yen in Tokyo earlier in the week, surged to 138 yen Friday after a report in the Japanese press that the U.S. was poised to retaliate in Lebanon in the face of the hostage crisis. In Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.55 yen, up sharply from its Tokyo close Friday of 138.05 yen.    Also, reports that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is in critical condition from cancer gave a boost to the U.S. currency.    In addition, the stock market was bruised by a fall in the bond market.    Market activity in the afternoon reflected morning trading. Higher-priced stocks remained the focus of buying interest by individual investors, who were leading participants in thin dealings.    Much of Friday's buying centered on advanced technology issues, partly because of their strong earnings outlook, brokers said. Kyocera was up 130 yen (95 cents) to 6,450 ($47.05), Sony rose 50 yen to 7,980 and Fanuc gained 40 yen to 6,690. Several issues rose on rumors of speculative buying. Among them were Konica, Dai-ichi Hotel and Nippon Shinpan.    Friday's losers included Tokyo Electric Power, which was down 100 yen to 6,210 on profit-taking along with many construction, steel and financial issues.    In Hong Kong Friday, a Japanese news service report on Chinese leader Deng sent share prices into a tailspin, wiping out gains from Thursday's broad rally. But bargain-hunters swept in after the sell-off and carried prices solidly above the day's lows. Shares in Sydney firmed as steady buying support from local institutions carried the market to its second consecutive post-crash high.    In other Asian and Pacific trading Friday, share prices closed lower in Taipei, Singapore and Seoul, mixed in Manila and higher in Wellington.    In Frankfurt, share prices resumed their summer rally Friday after a one-day breather and closed sharply higher in active trading. Stocks in Amsterdam closed at a high after the firm dollar delivered a boost to most sectors in the final hour.    Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Brussels and Milan, lower in Paris and Stockholm and mixed in Zurich. South African gold stocks closed mixed.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. @ % This @ Aug 3 Aug 2 Year @U.S. ........................... 317.4 317.0 + 24.0 @Britain ........................ 697.5 697.9 + 27.7 @Canada ......................... 433.2 432.5 + 18.0 @Japan .......................... 1549.1 1560.2 + 9.1 @France ......................... 526.9 527.4 + 19.0 @Germany ........................ 247.5 250.0 + 19.0 @Hong Kong ...................... 1970.7 1939.6 - 2.9 @Switzerland .................... 228.4 225.9 + 32.1 @Australia ...................... 335.1 332.4 + 15.4 @World index .................... 545.4 551.2 + 10.3 </TEXT></DOC>
