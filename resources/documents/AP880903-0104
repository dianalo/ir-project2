The 19-day wave of strikes, which involved 100,000 employeesnationwide, ended in a whirlwind of appeals and arm-twisting.Walesa urged supporters to end local disputes so that promisedroundtable talks could begin on union pluralism and legalizingSolidarity.   The labor unrest was the strongest challenge to communistauthorities since they crushed the Soviet bloc's first independentlabor federation with the 1981 martial law crackdown.   Walesa said the strikes were a warning to authorities to meetworkers' demands and that if they fail, ``all this will be repeatedagain ... stronger and more dangerous, and that problem will beeven more difficult to solve.''   Walesa said he had had to convince the striking miners ``thatdespite everything Polish problems can be resolved only when thehand is outstretched for reconciliation.''   Strikers at the July Manifesto coal mine near the southern townof Jastrzebie, where the nationwide strikes began Aug. 16, carrieda Solidarity banner as they marched out in a steady rain at about 6a.m. after 15 hours of negotiations among Walesa, strikers andmanagement.   In the Baltic port city of Szczecin, about 1,800 dock workersabandoned a strike at 12:15 p.m. and 600 bus workers about an hourearlier. The port and the city's main bus depot had been occupiedby strikers since Aug. 17.   During the strikes, Poland's two biggest ports were virtuallyshut down and production of coal from the Silesia region, a vitalsource of hard currency, was sharply reduced. Authorities claimedlosses of tens of millions of dollars.   Police ended some strikes, but the final breakthrough came whenthe government agreed to the first high-level meeting betweenWalesa and authorities since 1982.   After that meeting Wednesday and the promise of further talks,Walesa put his personal reputation on the line to end the strikesdespite opposition from many strikers.   Solidarity and authorities are readying lists of proposedparticipants for the roundtable, which could start any day, saidRoman Catholic mediator Jacek Ambroziak in Warsaw.   ``Lech is really pushing for it. He would like talks to beginnext week and hopes to be ready then,'' said Solidarity adviser theRev. Henryk Jankowski of Gdansk, who returned Saturday with Walesafrom Jastrzebie.   Weary, unshaven miners walked two miles in the rain to a churchwhere a priest celebrated Mass for strikers, their families andsupporters from other mines. They carried their belongings inplastic bags and sang the national anthem.   Miners from other Jastrzebie-area mines awaited the strikers atthe church and chanted, ``Thank you, thank you.''   ``Everybody was very nervous throughout, but all the strikersacted responsibly, and that's the most important thing,'' saidGrzegorz Stawski, a member of the strike committee. ``Walesa helpedus out a lot. He helped map the way out of our situation.''   Miners had demanded that Walesa come in person and explain whythey should end their stoppage, and when he arrived the discussionswere ``very hot and tense'' said Jankowski.   Guaranteeing strike organizers would not be fired was the laststumbling block in talks to end the strike, said Jan Litynski, aSolidarity adviser who was at the mine.   The strike ended exactly eight years after the government signedaccords with striking coal miners in Jastrzebie during the upheavalthat gave rise to Solidarity.   A string of police vehicles pulled out of the city Saturdaymorning, road blocks were dismantled and no strike banners remainedat the mine.   Port and transit workers in Szczecin offered early Fridayevening to stop their strikes as soon as job security wasguaranteed for strikers at the bus depot, said strike committeemember Artur Balasz.   Management said it would meet the demands but then withdrew itspromise, he said. But workers decided to leave the port andstrikebound bus terminal anyway and await Walesa's talks with thegovernment.   ``We state that we will continue our struggle,'' workers said ina communique issued by the committee.   Balasz said the workers ended their strike as ``an expression ofsupport for Lech Walesa. We just wanted to follow his suggestions.''   Shipyard and port workers in Gdansk and steel workers in thesoutheastern city of Stalowa Wola ended strikes Thursday after theappeal from Walesa.   On Wednesday, during Walesa's first meeting with seniorauthorities since 1982, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak andAlternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek agreed to discuss theunion's future and other issues at the roundtable as soon asstrikes ended. Church and representatives of official trade unionswere also expected to take part, said Solidarity sources.   Miners at the July Manifesto mine started the wave of strikes,disgruntled by paychecks that they said fell short of promises.They demanded better working conditions and higher wages tocompensate for inflation of about 60 percent.   But like other strikers around the country who quickly joinedthe strikes, their No. 1 demand became legalization of Solidarity.   Communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unionsin an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980 in Gdansk, opening the way tolegal registration of Solidarity.   Even after it was suppressed in the December 1981 martial lawcrackdown and outlawed in October 1982, it survived, first mainlyas an underground organization and more openly in recent years.</TEXT></DOC>
