The question for Mexico is how many of its approximately 560creditor banks will submit bids under the program before thedeadline at 4 p.m. EST Friday.   The plan was devised by the Mexican and U.S. governments to tryto reduce Mexico's heavy debt burden, the second highest in thedeveloping world after Brazil.   Christine Bindert, senior vice president at the investment firmof Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said the program``should be fairly successful with a lot of participation,particularly from European and (U.S.) regional banks.''   The big money center banks in the United States, though, wereexpected to shun the program.   ``They're bound to get some takers,'' said a European banker inMexico City, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The questionis: How many, and at what price?''   The new program involves exchanging some of the debt Mexico owesforeign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will beissued by the government.   The bonds, which will be backed by $10 billion worth of specialU.S. Treasury securities, will carry a higher interest rate thanMexico is paying on the old debt.   Analysts doubt the government will be able to market the entire$10 billion package. Mexican officials, they say, would like tosell at least $3 billion of the securities.   The success of the program hinges on the sticky question of howmuch the banks are willing to take for their old loans. In earlyFebruary, Mexican debt was selling for about 48 cents on the dollarin the secondary market.   In the auction, the bankers will try to get as much money asthey can for their old loans, while Mexico will want to buy thedebt cheaply.   Analysts predict the average discount rate will range from 60cents to 70 cents on the dollar.   Some banks have expressed concern about the program because theyare unhappy that Mexico will still get loans at 100 percent oftheir value while paying back, through the new program, its oldloans at less than that.   They also are reluctant to accept losses on the loans and worryabout government regulations concerning accounting for the losseson their books.   Mexico's treasury secretary, Gustavo Petricioli, recently askedU.S. officials to give ``the most favorable treatment possible'' tobanks taking part.   The program will let Mexico retire part of its foreign debt forless than face value and slice the $8 billion or so annual interestfee on the debt.   The banks are submitting sealed bids to J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., theNew York banking company acting as exchange agent for the deal.Morgan said earlier this week that it had already received someoffers, but it declined to release any details.   Mexico is expected to announce next week how many _ if any _bonds will be issued. Officials have said that if the offers arenot good enough, they may reject all of them.   As the deadline neared this week, many bankers were reluctant tosay if they would bid.   ``We're still studying the program in terms of our ownparticipation,'' said James H. Mitchell, spokesman for Bank ofAmerica in San Francisco.   In London, none of Britain's big four commercial banks would saywhether they planned to bid.   ``We haven't said what we're going to do,'' said an official atLloyds Bank. Added an official at National Westminster Bank, ``Ourdecision hasn't been made yet.'' Both demanded anonymity.   Analysts expect smaller banks, worried about holding Mexicandebt, to use the program as a way to get out of internationallending.   The chairman of Britain's Midland Bank, Sir Kit McMahon, foundthe plan inappropriate for banks wanting to remain in the businessbecause it involves explicitly accepting that the debt is worthless than its face value, a spokesman said.   That echoed comments by John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, thebiggest bank-holding company in the United States. ``We'relong-term lenders, and we're happy with our portfolio,'' he said.   ``The bonds being offered are good ideas for banks who want toget out of lending to Latin America and provide a good way forthose institutions to lower their exposure to Third Worldcountries,'' Reed told the New York Times.   However, West Germany's largest bank, the Deutsche Bank, said itwould bid for the bonds.   ``There had been so many proposals to solve this problem,'' saidspokesman Hans Dettmar. ``Finally this plan comes up. It's a newapproach, and we want to see how it works.''   Japanese banks also were close-mouthed about their plans.   In Tokyo, an official of a major bank said no decision had yetbeen made. ``But I think that even if we do participate, it willnot be in a very aggressive manner,'' he said, demanding anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
