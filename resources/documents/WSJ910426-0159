Since 1985, Congresshas considered bills that would require employers to givetheir employees a certain number of weeks of unpaid time offto cope with childbirth and family illnesses, guaranteeingtheir jobs back on return.   Last year, Congress actually passed such a measure butPresident Bush vetoed it, and there were not enough votes foran override. This year, a bill is expected to reach the Housefloor in early May. A similar Senate bill has just clearedthe Labor and Human Resources Committee.</LP><TEXT>   Parental leave has enormous popular support -- 71% of thepublic approves of the idea, according to an NBC/Wall StreetJournal poll in 1990. In fact, parental leave is such apopular idea that 25 states, the District of Columbia andPuerto Rico already have laws, most enacted fairly recently,that require at least some categories of employers to offerleave to their employees under some circumstances, accordingto figures collected by the Women's Legal Defense Fund. Abouttwo dozen states have bills pending that would either putleave laws onto the books or expand existing laws, reportsthe American Legislative Exchange Council.   In addition, in a 1989 survey by Time magazine and theCable News Network, 66% of respondents indicated theiremployers already had maternity-leave programs. (EileenTrzcinski, a professor of consumer economics at CornellUniversity, helped prepare a study of leave policies for theSmall Business Administration that showed much lower numbers-- fewer than 19% of employers offered leave. But she saysshe did not count the most common form of leave,maternity-disability leave.) At companies without formalleave policies, it is likely that many new mothers andparents of sick children work out informal arrangements fortime off.   The fact that states are readily experimenting with leavepolicies ought to make federal lawmakers reluctant to jumpinto the fray with a single nationwide law that wouldeffectively end most local experimentation. Furthermore, thepending congressional bills go much further than most statesin creating leave entitlements. That is why both the Houseand Senate bills style themselves &quot;The Family and MedicalLeave Act of 1991.&quot; Those who think the congressional billsare simply a nice way to let working mothers nurse newbornsor care for sick kids ought to think twice. In fact, thecongressional bills are not strictly &quot;parental&quot; leave billsat all but proposals, among other things, to entitle anyemployee of any age, parent or not, married or single, tothree months of leave every year as long as a physicianattests he or she has medical problems.   The state laws vary widely. Six states (Florida, NorthCarolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and WestVirginia) require leave only for government employees, whilethe others extend leave rights to the private sector. Of theprivate-sector leave laws, the oldest statutes, typicallyenacted during the 1970s, are classic maternity-leave laws,allowing women to take a certain amount of time off (a&quot;reasonable&quot; amount in some states) for childbirth andpregnancy-related disabilities. These laws, in effect in 10states (California, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Vermont)and Puerto Rico, track regulations under federalequal-employment laws requiring employers to treat pregnancyas a disability.   Three states (Minnesota, Oregon and Washington) have lawsthat go a step further, requiring &quot;parental&quot; leave. Thesestatutes are gender-neutral, giving fathers the same right asmothers to take time off when a child is born or adopted. Afourth state, Kentucky, also requires parental leave, butonly for adoptions.   A third permutation on the leave model is &quot;family&quot; leave,time off not just for births and adoptions, but when aspouse, child or other close relative is sick. New Jersey hasthe only family-leave law, which went into effect in 1990.   The fourth and most far-reaching permutation is &quot;familyand medical&quot; leave, which extends leave to employees withmedical problems. Four states (Connecticut, Maine, RhodeIsland, Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia requireemployers to offer both family and medical leave -- as wouldthe bills in Congress. The District's ordinance defines a&quot;family member&quot; as anyone with whom the employee shares aresidence and has a &quot;committed relationship.&quot;   Now, one might ask what medical leave for oneself has todo with the vaunted purpose of parental-leave laws, which isto prevent working parents from being penalized for stayinghome with their children during times of need. Medical-leaveprovisions seem to have crept into parental-leave laws as away to ensure a broad constituency for them. &quot;Virtuallyeveryone in their career would need to be out for one of thereasons in this bill,&quot; says Cornell's Ms. Trzcinski.   The state laws vary widely in the amount of leave theyrequire, with 12 weeks every two years being common. The lawsalso vary widely in size of businesses affected. Somestatutes apply only to concerns with 100 or more employees,while some of the narrower maternity-leave laws affectbusinesses with as few as three employees or even one. TheDistrict of Columbia currently sets the record forliberality. By April 1994, under a three-year phase in, allbusinesses with 20 or more employees must provide 16 weeks ofleave every two years for births, adoptions and illnesses,including one's own.   The congressional bills, which would not supersede anystate laws that happened to be more generous, would require12 weeks of leave annually as a matter of legal right at allbusinesses with 50 or more employees. (The House bill exemptsa company's top 10% of salary-earners from the leaveentitlement under some conditions, while the Senate billcontains no such exemption.) Furthermore, they contain aprovision found in almost none of the state laws: arequirement that employers continue paying for group healthcoverage for employees on leave. Only New Jersey and theDistrict of Columbia have such a requirement for the privatesector. A judge recently struck down the New Jerseyprovision, citing pre-emption by federal pension laws, butthat reasoning would not apply to a federal leave mandate.   And where there are legal rights, there are lawyers.Unlike most state leave laws, the House and Senate billswould allow employees wrongly denied leave to collect up tofour times their out-of-pocket losses plus attorney's fees.This is a sure incentive for imaginative employees and theirlawyers to seek court rulings stretching the law to theiradvantage.   For example, Wisconsin's law allows leave-takers tosubstitute for unpaid parental leave any paid leave to whichthey are entitled, such as vacation or personal time. Anadministrative tribunal and a lower court interpreted thesubstitution provision to allow a schoolteacher to collectsick pay for the week he took off when he and his wifeadopted a baby. The school district is appealing. &quot;Employerstypically want employees to be sick when they take sickleave,&quot; says Paul Lucke, a Milwaukee management lawyer whopredicts cutbacks in paid sick leave for all if the rulingsstand.   The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1991 is hamhanded andinflexible, and it is likely to prove expensive and rewardmalingerers. Nonetheless, it attempts to deal in a humane waywith a growing social phenomenon: the number of mothers ofinfants and small children who are now in the labor market.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 38% of all womenwith children under age six work full time. This is aminority, but it is a substantial one. Some of these womenwork because they have no husbands and get no or laughablechild support. Some work because they love their jobs. Somework because feminists told them it was demeaning to stayhome, or because they think they can't survive without aSub-Zero in the kitchen or twin Beemers in the garage. Butmost mothers work for one simple reason: to pay the mortgage.   To hear most people talk, you'd think there are only twopaths society can take. One is to make every adult go to workevery day and complete the process of turning the home into abarracks for sleeping, parking the laundry and microwavingthe meals. The other is to join the burgeoning constituencyfor federal leave laws.   But there's a third choice. It is to use tax and otherincentives to get mothers (and fathers, where possible) backinto the home when they so desire. Liberals call this tryingto &quot;turn back the clock,&quot; but the fact remains that childrenneed the individualized attention that only a parent can giveat 13 weeks as well as at 12 weeks, and when they are healthyas well as when they are ill.   ---   Mrs. Allen is a contributing editor at Insight magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
