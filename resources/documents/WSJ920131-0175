Separately, talks have cooled between the Nigerianstate-oil company and Phibro over the possible acquisition ofa 20% stake in Phibro's U.S. operations, according to peoplefamiliar with Phibro.</LP><TEXT>   The metals transfer to Phibro, a unit of Salomon Inc.,comes more than a year after Salomon Brothers absorbed theprecious metal operations of Philipp Brothers Inc., which wasdismantled in 1990 after a string of losses. Salomon held$150 million in precious metals assets as of Sept. 30.   Phibro also said it plans to absorb Salomon's Londonmetals business, when it receives regulatory approval. Theprecious metals group trades gold, silver and platinum.   The transfer is an attempt &quot;to capitalize on the synergiesthat exist within Phibro's world-wide energy business and inparticular in the area of commodity derivatives,&quot; said AndrewJ. Hall, Phibro chairman, president and chief executiveofficer.   Phibro, the world's largest oil-trading company and a bigrefiner, will operate the business through a division calledPhibro Energy Metals; it will be run by Phibro executivesAndrew Hecht and James DiPiazza.   The cooling of talks between Phibro and Nigerian NationalPetroleum Corp. came after periodic discussions about thepossible sale of a Phibro stake, held since 1988. Talks hadintensified late last year after Phibro created a separatedivision to handle its domestic oil refining, crude oilgathering and liquified-petroleum gas trading businesses.   But a recent cabinet reshuffle in Nigeria has thrown thefuture of Nigeria's oil industry and that of its energyminister into question, people familiar with Phibro said.   A Phibro sale offers an opportunity for Nigeria to enterthe U.S. refining and marketing business. And Phibro stillappears serious about spinning off assets amid weak earningslast year.   Through September, Phibro reported pretax profit of just$26 million, down sharply from a record $430 million in theyear-earlier period. Phibro recently said it anticipates apretax loss of $60 million in 1991's fourth quarter, largelystemming from a charge reflecting plunging oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
