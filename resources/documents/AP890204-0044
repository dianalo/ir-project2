Frigid air pushed south and east, bringing subzero wind chills tonormally balmy south Texas, coating New York City and Philadelphiawith freezing rain and sending temperatures plunging across Georgia,Louisiana and Alabama.   By Sunday, the National Weather Service said, the arctic air isexpected to reach central Florida, completing the southeastwardmarch that began in Alaska about a week ago.   Heavy snow fell in the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, andtemperatures remained well below zero across much of the nation'smidsection. So far, at least 16 deaths around the United States havebeen blamed on the cold weather.   Leo Burnett, a forecaster in the National Weather Service officein Fargo, N.D., said he and his colleagues were beginning to catchblame for the painfully cold weather. The high temperature in Fargoon Friday was 15 below zero, and some people needed a scapegoat.   ``They're getting a little cabin fever, I guess, and they have totake their frustrations out on someone, so they call and kind of getall over the weatherman every once in a while,'' Burnett said.``We've got thick skins.''   One man, he said, called to say, ``I'm just in a fit ofdepression, and I blame you guys. ... I've got to get out of here.I'm going to go to Florida.''   The caller had better move fast. Parts of the Southeast enjoyedrecord warmth Friday as they awaited the cold _ it was 77 degrees inApalachicola, Fla., breaking the old record for Feb. 3 by a degree.   Other records included 77 in Ashville, N.C., 75 in Atlanta and 84in Charleston, S.C.   But by midnight Friday, it was 49 in Atlanta, and forecastscalled for the temperatures to continue dropping, possibly reachinginto the teens by Tuesday.   Temperatures dropped 40 degrees in parts of Louisiana, worryingstrawberry farmers and casting a chill _ but not a pall _ over MardiGras festivities.   ``Snow, sleet, ice or 80 mph winds _ those are the only thingsthat would stop a parade,' said Assistant Police Chief Ray Holman ofNew Orleans. ``Cold weather doesn't dampen many spirits, but it maycause people to drink more of them.''   Such parade-stopping conditions aren't likely in New Orleans, butthey provide a fair description of weather across much of the West,where winter storm warnings were in effect early today in parts ofCalifornia, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.   In northern California, up to three feet of snow, whipped bywinds of up to 70 mph, fell Friday in parts of the Sierra Nevada andmore was expected today. The Utah Highway Patrol reported ``lots andlots'' of minor accidents on slick, snowpacked freeways around SaltLake City, but ski resort operators were cheering over the extrafoot or more of snow that coated the nearby mountains.   A Greyhound Trailways bus with 15 people aboard spun around andoverturned Friday on an icy Interstate 70 in Colorado near the Utahline. Police said 14 people were hospitalized in Grand Junction withbroken bones.   About 14 Denver high school basketball players and a coach weretreated for possible carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermiaFriday night when a heater in their chartered bus apparently failedin bitter cold weather west of Denver. All were treated and releasedfrom two Denver hospitals.   Subzero cold in Montana caused ice jams on the Bighorn, Missouriand Clark Fork rivers. The town of Wisdom, Mont., recorded thenation's lowest temperature of minus 52, and rancher Helen Carey,who lives about 30 miles south of Helena, said her newborn calveswere losing their ears to frostbite.   ``Poor little things, they've really had a tough go of it,'' shesaid.   Power outages left people without heat in several places aroundthe country, including the suburbs of Kansas City, Mo., where arecord low of 7 below zero was recorded at the airport Friday.   And in Wassau, Wis., sponsors of the Badger State Winter Gamesconsidered calling off this weekend's cross-country ski racesbecause of subzero cold.</TEXT></DOC>
