Rehnquist has stronglyendorsed a proposal to raise federal judges' salaries by 51 percentto $135,000 a year.   In his 1988 year-end report on the federal judiciary, Rehnquistthrew his weight behind a presidential commission's recommendationof big pay raises for judges and about 2,000 other top federalofficials.   Besides calling for the pay raise for trial judges, who now make$89,500, the commission recommended boosting salaries of federalappeals court judges from $95,000 to $140,000, a 47 percent jump; ofSupreme Court associate justices from $110,000 to $165,000, a 50percent increase; and of the chief justice from $115,000 to$175,000, a 52 percent increase.   The recommendations are pending before President Reagan, who canaccept or modify the figures before sending his fiscal 1990 budgetto Congress on Jan. 9.   Under the law, whatever pay increases the president endorses willtake effect 30 days later unless both the House and the Senate voteto set them aside.   ``Over the past two decades, the purchasing power of federaljudicial salaries has been seriously eroded by inflation,''Rehnquist said.   The buying power of an appeals court judge's salary has dropped30 percent in the past 20 years, said the chief justice, adding,``While the salary of the median household has increasedapproximately 200 percent to keep pace with inflation since 1969,the salaries of federal (trial) judges rose by little more than halfthat amount.''   Rehnquist cited a recent American Bar Foundation survey in which30 percent of the federal judges who responded said they planned toresign before retirement unless ``a significant increase incompensation'' is provided.   ``Dozens of federal judges have resigned from the bench duringthe past 15 years, far more than ever before, due in large part tofinancial reasons,'' Rehnquist said. ``And the problem appears to begrowing worse.''   He said judicial salaries are directly linked to ``the quality ofAmerican justice.''   Comparing justice and medical care, Rehnquist said, ``We areinterested in receiving the best medical care available. If thequality of medical treatment is poor, it is little consolation thatthe cost may be low.''   He added: ``The right to one's day in court is meaningless if thejudge who hears the case lacks the talent, experience andtemperament that will enable him to protect imperiled rights and torender a fair decision.''</TEXT></DOC>
