Taylor said at a news conference called by the CitizensCommission on Civil Rights.   The private group released a 37-page report titled ``One Nation,Indivisible: The Civil Rights Challenge for the 1990s,'' whichoffered evidence of a falloff in civil rights enforcement in theReagan era.   It said the Justice Department has filed 31 cases to challengediscriminatory voting practices since 1981. Panel members calledthat a sharp drop from the record of earlier administrations.   The report also said enforcement of equal employment rulesapplying to federal contractors declined from 269 cases in 1980 to22 cases in 1986.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that 2million cases of housing bias occur each year, but an average of 10housing discrimination cases have been filed annually, the reportsaid.   Taylor said that number represented about half the level underthe administrations of former presidents Carter and Nixon.   Justice Department spokesman Mark Weaver criticized the notionthat there has been a slowdown.   He cited a victory in a key housing bias case in Yonkers, N.Y.,as well as a major voting rights case pending against Los AngelesCounty and a lawsuit filed two months ago to bar alleged hiringdiscrimination by New Jersey's police hiring system.   ``We've taken heat for these things but we've continued toenforce the laws strenuously,'' he said.   He said he could not readily verify that the eight-year total ofvoting rights cases was 31. But he did say that because courtactions under previous administrations remain in place ``the numberby definition gets smaller.''   As for cases involving federal contractors, he said, the JusticeDepartment has no authority to initiate suits and merely acts onmatters referred to it by the Labor Department.   Arthur Flemming, chairman of the commission, said the group wassending its report to Bush ``in the hope that he can turn around the'80s as far as civil rights enforcement is concerned.''</TEXT></DOC>
