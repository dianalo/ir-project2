GOP officials contend they dodged a bullet with Quayle's mediocre debate performance -- it wasn't memorable enough to detract from the top of the ticket. They believe next week's Bush-Dukakis debate will be inconclusive and say they have wrapped up enough electoral votes to focus their resources on closely contested industrial states. Even Democrats doubt polls showing the race almost even.    Democrats say that Dukakis, while addressing up his own weaknesses on national security, must attack Bush relentlessly in the final four weeks, mainly on domestic issues. But he must also appear more likable -- and those two goals conflict. Democrats rush out post-debate ads roasting Quayle's performance and contrasting him with Bentsen.    A critical issue is whether Bentsen's strong showing puts the Democrats back in contention in Texas.    MILLER LEAVES an OMB with tattered credibility and a demoralized staff.    Career staffers fret that the budget office is increasingly partisan, rather than a place of &quot;neutral competence.&quot; Miller's deputy and successor, Joseph Wright, draws fire for a clumsy effort to use an in-house analysis to attack Dukakis. Congressional aides say OMB cut by 50% the projected cost of a new Medicare drug benefit after the administration decided to support it.    Alcoa chief Paul O'Neill, a former OMB official, agrees with critics who say &quot;there is a lot more credibility put in the Congressional Budget Office&quot; than in OMB's numbers. &quot;I'm glad that observation wasn't made on my watch,&quot; he adds. Even Bush relies on the CBO rather than the budget office to defend his deficit-reduction plan.    MOSCOW'S MOVES won't cure growing economic woes, U.S. analysts say.    The analysts estimate Soviet inflation at 8% and rising, and a budget deficit proportionately about twice America's. Experts expect price rises and currency devaluation, producing more grumbling from workers and pushing Gorbachev even further toward reform. He &quot;is a learner who becomes more radical as he learns what has to be done,&quot; says Brookings analyst Ed Hewett.    Gorbachev rival Ligachev's transfer to agriculture is seen as setting him up for a fall. If the big problems aren't solved, Ligachev will be blamed and his conservative outlook discredited. His move may help improve U.S. relations; he had advocated more &quot;class struggle&quot; in foreign policy.    But the new KGB head made his mark by expanding spying on the U.S.    AM-BUSHED? Some political strategists believe the Bush camp is privately angling to get CBS's Dan Rather as a questioner for the final debate. The theory is that, having clashed with Bush earlier this year, Rather would be gun-shy. Dukakis forces would have a tough time vetoing him, since they initially advocated a panel of four network anchormen.    REVERSE COATTAILS: Democratic Senate candidates narrow their deficits in such states as Minnesota and Connecticut even as Dukakis dips in state polls. Political analyst Alan Baron sees a connection: &quot;There's something about people instinctively liking balance&quot; between partisan control of the White House and Congress, he suggests.    I DIDN'T MEAN YOU: Iowa Democratic Sen. Harkin tells reporters that Quayle isn't qualified to be a potential president because he is too immature at age 41, has had too easy a life and relied too much on his father. Looking on -- and looking uncomfortable -- is 40-year-old Democratic Sen. Gore, the son of a senator and himself a former presidential candidate.    A BROAD COALITION tries to focus public attention on housing and homelessness. The Junior League sponsors a study on the effects on children and families, while the National Association of Homebuilders plans a major symposium next month. Over 100 political and comic-strip cartoonists will devote their Oct. 25 space to the issue.    DRUG TRAFFICKING spreads through the Caribbean as policy makers squabble.    U.S. analysts say smugglers increasingly use Jamaica and Haiti as bases, mostly because the Bahamas has received so much attention from American law-enforcement officials. But a plan to attack the new trafficking pattern bogs down between Congress and the administration.    The administration's National Drug Policy Board backs down from its initial acquiescence to House Democratic plans for $100 million for additional helicopters and stepped-up enforcement aimed at Jamaica and Haiti. DEA and State Department officials balked, arguing that the funds would be better spent on crop-destruction efforts in Latin America.    Advocates of naming a single anti-drug &quot;czar&quot; use the bureaucratic battle to support their arguments.    MINOR MEMOS: Bush aide Lee Atwater refers to post-debate analyses by partisans of the candidates as &quot;spin-terviews.&quot; . . . Though Quayle ridiculed Dukakis for once suggesting Midwestern farmers should plant endive, Reagan's Agriculture Department issues a $35,000 grant to divine why it grows better in Belgium than in the U.S. . . . Wrong number: Trying to find 30 people willing to sign pro-Bush letters-to-the-editor, GOP officials phone Rep. Mineta's office for suggestions; he is a Dukakis co-chairman. . . . The ACLU has received five guest memberships for Bush since the debate. </TEXT></DOC>
