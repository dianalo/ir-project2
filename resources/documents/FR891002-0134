Salapka on (202) 287-0590.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 1, 1989, Treasury publisheda final rule concerning the reduction of fees in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 8532). Treasury proposes to reduce theper-item fee paid to the large note option and remittance option depositariesfrom thirty ($0.30) cents per Federal tax deposit coupon processed to twenty-five($0.25) cents. Treasury regulations in the ``Treasury Financial Manual''on paying fees to financial institutions for maintaining Treasury Tax andLoan (TTandamp;L) accounts and processing Federal tax deposit payments willbe revised to reflect the new fee schedule. The ``Treasury Financial Manual''may be obtained from any Federal Reserve Bank.Reasons for Treasury's policy regarding FTD payments include: First, depositariesthat choose to participate in the Treasury Tax and Loan Investment programearn interest on the overnight use of funds deposited as Federal tax payments.Second, Treasury has determined that the larger depositaries are in a betterposition to accommodate the fee reduction. The larger depositaries processthe largest dollar deposit volumes and generally benefit most from theovernight use of Federal funds.Treasury estimates the earning capacity of depositaries from the overnightuse of Federal tax deposit funds during Fiscal Year 1988 was approximately$142 million. This estimate is based on the FY 1988 Federal tax depositdollar volume cited in the ``Daily Treasury Statement'' dated September30, 1988. Further, Treasury estimates that implementing the new fee structureon November 2, 1989 will save the Treasury nearly $3.3 million in FiscalYear 1990.Treasury plans to reduce fees paid to all depositaries that process over$10 million in Federal tax deposit dollar volumes annually, regardlessof classification as note option or remittance option depositaries. However,there is an exception for the MBDP participants. Treasury will decide ata later date when fee reductions, if any, will be implemented for the smallerdepositaries and MBDP depositaries. The new and any subsequent fee scheduleswill be published in the ``Treasury Financial Manual.'' Future notice of,and opportunity to comment on, any subsequent reductions in the fees paidto depositaries for processing FTD payments will be provided to the affectedfinancial institutions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment</ITAG>Nearly, 3,200 financial institutions participate as note option depositarieswhile approximately 11,400 financial institutions participate as remittanceoption depositaries. Treasury estimates that approximately 3,900 financialinstitutions will be affected by the fee reduction. The larger financialinstitutions process the largest dollar deposit volumes and generally benefitmost from the overnight use of Federal funds. In Fiscal Year 1988, thenote option depositaries processed $498.6 billion in FTD payments whichcomprised 70% of the total FTD dollar deposit volumes received by TTandamp;Ldepositaries. The remittance option depositaries processed $211.2 billionin FTD payments in FY 1988 which was 30% of the total FTD dollar depositvolumes received by TTandamp;L depositaries. Note option Class B and ClassC depositaries and remittance option Class 1 depositaries would lose proportionatelyless income from loss of fees relative to the smaller note option ClassA and remittance option Class 2 depositaries. Therefore, Treasury has determinedthat the fee reduction will be limited to note option Class B and ClassC depositaries and remittance option Class 1 depositaries, which processover $10 million in FTD deposits annually.Distribution of the revised ``Treasury Financial Manual'' to the FederalReserve Banks and TTandamp;L depositaries will be coordinated with the feereduction.<ITAG tagnum="6">W.E.
