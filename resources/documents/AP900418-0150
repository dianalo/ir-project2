The environmental advocacy group said its study of previouslyunreleased Navy records showed that 1989 was, ironically, one ofthe Navy's safest years despite the April explosion which killed 47sailors aboard the battleship USS Iowa and several otherheadline-provoking accidents in the wake of that tragedy.   Greenpeace, citing data obtained from the U.S. Navy SafetyCenter under the Freedom of Information Act, said the Navyregistered 106 accidents last year, the fewest of any year in thedecade except 1988, when there were 83. The most, 248, occurred in1981, it said.   The Navy did not dispute the figures, though a statement fromCmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy Information Office, put thecount of ``major'' accidents last year at 69. By ``major,'' hereferred to what the Navy calls Class A accidents _ involving lossof life, or property damage exceeding $1 million.   The Greenpeace figures, according to author Joshua Handler,counted Class B accidents as well _ property loss exceeding$200,000 _ and a few ``significant'' Class C accidents involvingproperty damage of under $200,000.   ``The Navy has been unrelenting in its pursuit of safety andthis has resulted in continued improvement during the decade of the80s,'' said Baker. ``Our goal continues to be to make the Navy assafe as possible.''   A string of accidents last year led the Navy to take theunprecedented step of ordering a two-day freeze of its operationsso officers and sailors could concentrate on safety reviews,inspections and lectures.   The Greenpeace report, released Wednesday, said the Iowaexplosion and the sinking of a Soviet Mike-class nuclear submarineearlier in April made naval accidents a running news story in 1989,ensuring press coverage of many of those which followed. ``But 991U.S. naval accidents went unreported by the news media in the1980s, almost two-thirds of the total for the decade,'' it said.   ``Government secrecy still inhibits a full accounting of thenaval accident record,'' the report said. ``Information is stilltoo sketchy to determine the dangers accidents posed to nuclearweapons or reactors, particularly since direct data about accidenttrends for U.S. naval nuclear weapons and reactors continues to bekept secret.''   Still, ``the U.S. Navy provides more information that any othercountry on its accident record,'' Greenpeace said. Despite unusualSoviet candor over the fire which resulted in the loss of 42sailors and their Mike-class sub in the Norweigian sea, the reportsaid, ``the Soviet record on disclosure is still horrendous.''   Greenpeace estimated that the world's five nuclear navies _including Great Britain, France and China _ together suffered 3,200accidents in the 1980s, or almost one a day. The guess was based onthe number of U.S. accidents, 1,596, compared to the fleet sizes ofthe other nations.   It said about half the 99 ships and submarines involved indocumented accidents last year were nuclear powered, and,similarly, about half were capable of carrying nuclear weapons.American vessels accounted for 78 percent of the documentedepisodes. Soviet ships and submarines were involved in 8 percent ofthose cases, while those from Great Britain accounted for 7 percent.   The report, while mentioning fatalities caused by accidentspreviously reported, did not mention overall death tolls.   But it did say:   _The sinking of the Soviet Mike-class sub raised the totalnumber of nuclear warheads on the ocean floor from 48 to 50, with43 of those from the Soviet Union and 7 from the United States. Italso raised the number of sunken naval nuclear reactors from 7 to8, with 5 of those from the Soviet Union and three from the UnitedStates.   _Collisions, fires and explosions accounted for almost half ofthe 439 accidents involving U.S. surface ships in the 1980s, withthe largest portion occurring in the Atlantic Ocean.   _Forty percent of the U.S. naval accidents during the decadeinvolved submarines.</TEXT></DOC>
