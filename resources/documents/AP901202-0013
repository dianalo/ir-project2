(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Columbia shot spectacularly througha moonlit sky early Sunday, carrying seven astronauts and anastronomical laboratory into space and helping the nation's spaceshuttle program end a frustrating year on an upswing.   ``It's like an early Christmas present,'' said launch directorBob Sieck. ``It sure goes a long way to erase the disappointmentsthat we had this summer.''   A Soviet Soyuz rocket carrying two cosmonauts and a Japanesetelevision journalist was launched 84 minutes later, bringing to 12the number of people in space, the most ever at one time. Twocosmonauts are on the space station Mir. The Columbia crew hopes tocontact the Soviet crew via ham radio.   Columbia had been grounded since May by hydrogen leaks, and theshuttle Atlantis was also delayed by leaks. The launch at 1:49 a.m.EST came on the fifth attempt to put Columbia and its astronomy labin space for a 10-day mission.   ``It was spectacular to watch it go up,'' said Arthur Davidsonof Johns Hopkins University, principal investigator of one of theAstro observatory's ultraviolet telescopes. ``We're getting a wholenew look at the universe.''   The 100-ton spaceship flooded the sky with light visible forhundreds of miles as it thundered toward a 218-mile-high orbit. Thelaunch was delayed 21 minutes when the Air Force, which hasresponsibility for range safety, sent a helicopter into a layer ofclouds to confirm that visibility was sufficient.   The unusual helicopter check surprised NASA officials, but AirForce Col. John Wormington said afterward that it saved the launchfrom being postponed.   The moon shining through the clouds over the Florida coast wasbrightened by the shuttle's 700-foot pillar of flames.   ``We really had a light show coming up. That was reallysomething,'' said Columbia's commander Vance Brand, at age 59 theoldest person to reach space.   It was NASA's sixth shuttle flight this year, three fewer thanplanned because of the hydrogen leaks that grounded Columbia andAtlantis through summer and early fall. Atlantis returned from asecret military flight less than two weeks ago.   Astronomers have been waiting anxiously to send up the $150million observatory since the mission's original launch date in1986. The mission was delayed until this year by the Challengeraccident.   As Columbia orbits high above Earth's distorting atmosphere,four astronomers on board will operate Astro's three ultraviolettelescopes round-the-clock. An X-ray telescope will be managed bycomputer commands sent from the ground.   The observatory will remain anchored in Columbia's cargo baythroughout the flight and return to Earth with the shuttle.   Scientists expect to be surprised by many of Astro's findingssince ultraviolet light and X-rays are invisible from Earth.   About 240 objects will be studied, including Jupiter, quasars,binary stars, a supernova and Comet Levy, which is on its way outof the solar system.   Columbia's other crew members are pilot Guy Gardner, missionsecialist Mike Lounge and astronomers Ron Parise, Jeffrey Hoffman,Robert Parker and Sam Durrance.</TEXT></DOC>
