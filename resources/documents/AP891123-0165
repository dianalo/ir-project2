Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, released the forecast after a briefmeeting of a special monitoring panel.   Ministers attending the session agreed to huddle privately onFriday before opening OPEC's full winter conference on Saturdaymorning.   The ministers will try to come up with a new production andpricing arrangement that will halt output cheating and keep crudeprices firm in the months ahead.   With higher output in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and SaudiArabia, the cartel produced nearly 23.5 million barrels of crude aday last month, according to analysts' estimates.   That is considerably higher than the current, fourth-quarterceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day.   Despite the surge, prices have held fairly strong. But if thecartel were to pump more oil than required by consuming nations,prices could plummet.   Subroto said the average price of a basket of crudes monitoredby OPEC was $17.16 a barrel from January through the third week ofOctober when it reached $17.76.   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. Just a year ago, the OPECbasket registered $12.34.   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.crude, have been running about $20 a barrel. Middle Easternvarieties have been a few dollars less.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been cheating openly,pumping as much as double their individual quotas of about amillion barrels a day, according to analysts.   The overproduction is intended to underline their demands forbigger shares of OPEC's total output.   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and the world's largestcrude exporter, recently joined in the overproduction, a move seenby analysts as a negotiating ploy before the talks.   At a September meeting, Iran offered a proposal to cover thedemands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The plan receivedconsiderable attention but failed to gain quick approval by allnations.   Subroto said the proposal ``certainly is still there, but Ipresume there will be other proposals as well.''   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh refused to respond when asked if theplan were still alive.   But Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said, ``It'shistory ... because things have changed.''   In his economic report, Subroto said OPEC expected an increasein world economic growth of 3 percent next year, a bit under the3.3 percent pace of 1989.   Total demand for oil _ excluding such centrally plannedeconomies as the Soviet Union _ was estimated at 51.8 millionbarrels a day in 1990, up from 50.9 million barrels this year.   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said earlier thatKuwait offered slightly more conservative projections. It estimatedworld demand at 51.5 million barrels a day next year and the callon OPEC oil at 21 million barrels.   Subroto said Kuwait had gone along with the majority view.   The ministers, even usually talkative ones, said little uponarrival in Vienna, insisting they needed to talk first to theircolleagues.   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba, apparentlydefending his his country's output, said, ``We tackled our quotaourselves in accord with the interests of our people and ourcommitment toward OPEC.''   Once the ministers set a new production ceiling, they will haveto divvy up the total among all nations.   Iran's September plan called for lifting the overall supplyceiling to 21.5 million barrels a day to meet the demands of Kuwaitand the United Arab Emirates for larger shares of the total. Gabonand Ecuador would also get more.   Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela would see their sharesshrink as would Iran and Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Libya and Qatar wouldremain unchanged.   Saudi Arabia's minister, Hisham Nazer, has said his country willnot cut its one-quarter share of total output.   But one oil official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidother countries would like the oil giant to kick in some, too.   ``It would give credibility to the whole exercise if all areseen as having contributed to resolution of the problem,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
