The ``not in my backyard'' syndrome was debated Tuesday duringthe annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancementof Science.   ``In the cases I examined, the community wants to have someaccountability if there are any health and safety implications tothe research,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, an associate professor ofurban and environmental policy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.   Community opposition to research facilities has blossomed withincreasing public concern over toxics, land use and other issues,and with passage of tougher environmental laws, he said.   But Syracuse University sociologist Allan Mazur disagreed at anews conference on the ``not in my backyard'' syndrome.   Mazur said such controversies have become common largely``because of the journalistic coverage of them. It will get a lot ofsympathy.''   During a Saturday night keynote address to the convention,Stanford University president Donald Kennedy said scientists'ability to solve society's problems is suffering as someenvironmental and no-growth groups become ``enemies of scientificprogress.''   ``We need a lot more stiffness in the face of special politicalinterests that are hostile to American science,'' Kennedy said,calling San Francisco ``the nation's capital of activist,single-issue and `not-in-my-backyard' politics.''   On Tuesday, Stanford associate vice president Larry Hortondenounced what he called ``cynical manipulation'' of environmentallaws by animal rights activitists and others opposed to research fornon-environmental reasons.   The extent of mutual hostility on the issue became apparentduring the news conference Tuesday.   Hotel security police escorted community activist Margaret Vergesfrom the session after she claimed to be a reporter and launchedinto a brief speech against the University of California's plans toestablish labs in a building it owns in San Francisco's LaurelHeights neighborhood.   She later accused scientists of being ``arrogant, hostile,mean-spirited and unwilling to bargain.''   George Carr, president of the Laurel Heights ImprovementAssociation, said homeowners oppose the University of California atSan Francisco research facility because it's an industrial use in aresidential neighborhood and because they fear it will harbor toxic,radioactive, infectious and cancer-causing substances.   The university disputes the allegations.   ``The university has tried to push us in the press as ... localdissidents opposed to science. That's a lot of bull,'' Carr said.   He called biomedical research necessary, but added, ``One cannotdestroy the quality of life that the research is intended topreserve.''   Yet zoning laws often fail to address whether small research labsshould be allowed in residential zones, Krimsky said.   He said cases of communities seeking to exert control overresearch included studies of germ warfare agents, nuclear weaponsresearch, semiconductors and genetically engineered microbes thatwould be released to the environment.   But Horton indicated environmental concerns sometimes areridiculous.   There was a ``hysterical'' reaction against pollutants from theproposed building where Stanford wanted to house research rodents,even though ``the most serious substance to be used was a cleanercalled Zonk to clean the cages,'' Horton said.   Krimsky said scientific chaos could result if national standardsfor experiments on animals and humans were superseded by localstandards. ``Researchers would move to the community where theywould have the easiest set of guidelines,'' he said.   And the ultimate result, Mazur said, might be to drivelaboratories to poor areas without activist neighborhood groups.</TEXT></DOC>
