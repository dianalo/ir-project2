All 10 Canadian provinces must ratify an accord by next Junethat would allow Quebec to endorse the federal constitution byrecognizing Canada's only majority French-speaking province as a``distinct society'' within the country.   New Brunswick and Manitoba, arguing that the agreement wouldweaken the federal government, so far have refused to sign.Newfoundland also has threatened to withdraw its support from theaccord, known as the Meech Lake Agreement.   Speculation before Quebec's Sept. 25 election had been that asmashing victory for the Liberal Party led by Premier RobertBourassa would allow him maneuvering room that might lead to acompromise on the constitutional agreement.   Bourassa won his second consecutive majority government, but theParti Quebecois, urging eventual independence for the province,slightly improved its showing from the last provincial election in1985.   The party captured 40.2 percent of the vote _ up from 38.6percent four years earlier _ surprising analysts who had predictedits demise.   The Liberals, hurt by defections to a new party ofEnglish-speaking voters irate about provincial language policies,slipped from 56 percent to 49.9 percent, although they still hold92 of the 125 seats in the provincial assembly.   The Liberals argue that any change in the constitutionalagreement, reached by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10provincial premiers in 1987, would kill the plan and further kindleQuebec separatism.   The Meech Lake Agreement was seen as a way for Quebec, whosepopulation is 81 percent French-speaking, to get around itsobjections to signing a national constitution earlier in the decade.   Canadian independence dates to 1867, but British jurisdictionover the constitution did not formally end until April 17, 1982,when Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed the new Constitution Act.   Quebec's assembly was the first to ratify the agreement on a``distinct society'' for the province. Seven other provinciallegislatures followed, as did Parliament on June 22, 1988, but thetwo holdout provinces are needed for it to take effect.   Opponents of the accord charge that recognizing a distinctsociety within Canada would weaken the federal Charter of Rightsand that provinces would be given too much power. In addition, theEnglish-speaking provinces traditionally have been wary of Quebec.   The federal constitution applies to Quebec even though it hasnot signed the document, but the refusal makes it more difficultfor changes to be made on such national issues as native rights andthe way the Senate operates.   Bourassa's statements since the provincial election have impliedthat those who supported his party did so with the expectation thatit would lead to Quebec's recognition as a ``distinct society,''and voters could support separatism if the Meech Lake Agreement iskilled.   ``The facts are there to be read,'' he said, adding that 40percent of the voters ``have supported a party whose main plank isindependence for Quebec.''   Other provinces argue that Quebec's election was fought largelyover local issues unrelated to separatism and the Parti Quebecoismight not fare so well in a referendum held solely on independence.</TEXT></DOC>
