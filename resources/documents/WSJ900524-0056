Boesky admitted that he had lied to governmentinvestigators, the stock exchange, on his federal tax returnsand in a book he wrote prior to his November 1986plea-bargain agreement.   Cross-examined by Thomas Puccio, the attorney for John A.Mulheren Jr., Mr. Boesky said often that he couldn't rememberwhen he had lied, or how many times, even though &quot;I did notlike lying.&quot; Mr. Boesky said, however, that since he agreedto plead guilty to one felony count related to his trading,he has been &quot;extremely motivated to tell the truth.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Boesky took the stand for the second day in the trialof Mr. Mulheren, who is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. Thecooperation of Mr. Boesky, once Wall Street's best knownstock speculator, led to the indictment of Mr. Mulheren.   Under cross-examination designed to undermine hiscredibility as a government witness, Mr. Boesky acknowledgedthat he lied under oath &quot;several times&quot; prior to hisappearance in this case. He admitted to lying to theSecurities and Exchange Commission about his receipt ofinside information regarding the takeover of SCM Corp. andabout his filing a false statement with the SEC in connectionwith the ownership of Fischbach Corp. securities.   &quot;Can you tell me how many times you lied?&quot; Mr. Puccioasked. &quot;No,&quot; Mr. Boesky replied. &quot;Can you estimate?&quot; Mr.Puccio inquired. &quot;No,&quot; Mr. Boesky said.   Mr. Puccio was often sarcastic during thecross-examination, which began late yesterday and willcontinue today. &quot;Do you know what a pathological liar is?&quot; heasked Mr. Boesky. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum wouldn'tallow Mr. Boesky to answer the question. At another point,Mr. Puccio asked, &quot;Do you like money, Mr. Boesky?&quot; Thewitness replied testily, &quot;Of course, don't you?&quot;   Answering other questions, however, Mr. Boesky admittedthat his book, Merger Mania, was &quot;incomplete and inaccurateby omission.&quot; For example, Mr. Boesky said that he had failedto tell readers that much of the money he made from hisinvestment in Getty Oil Corp., which was the target of atakeover, was based on inside information Mr. Boesky obtainedillegally.   Mr. Boesky also admitted that he lied on tax returns hefiled prior to his plea agreement. But he added that he hadsince amended his returns and paid his taxes. Mr. Boesky saidthat at the time of his arrest, he had assets of &quot;less than$1 billion and more than $100 million.&quot;   By showing that Mr. Boesky's plea agreement left him avery rich man, despite the $100 million he was required topay in fines, Mr. Puccio is expected to attempt to show thatMr. Boesky is biased in favor of the government and may bemotivated to say anything prosecutors want him to say aboutMr. Mulheren. Mr. Boesky completed a three-year prison termlast month.   Mr. Boesky appeared not to help the government's case inone key piece of testimony involving trading of stock of Gulfandamp; Western Inc. Mr. Boesky acknowledged that he discussed thestock with Mr. Mulheren but he stopped short of saying histalks involved directions to Mr. Mulheren to manipulate itsprice, as the government alleged.</TEXT></DOC>
