After all, the probability of a German government permitting those missiles to be launched, therewith ensuring the nuclear annihilation of the German nation, was always closer to zero than NATO's generals would admit.&quot;    Prof. Kristol, in this respect, misses the point. The Pershing IIs, which can travel 1,100 miles in 13 minutes, are present in part to prevent the Warsaw Pact from massing forces in preparation for an attack on West Germany.    The Soviets must indeed expect that the West Germans would be prepared to use those Pershing IIs to destroy tanks and forces gathered on their border. Self-defense against planned aggression need not precipitate nuclear war. Quite the contrary, it can deter it.    The Pershing II is arguably the most practical and useful weapon in America's arsenal. It vastly expands the options available to the president and its presence limits the ability of the Soviet Union to intimidate, or even invade, the Warsaw Pact's neighbors.    The reason Helmut Kohl initially resisted the removal of the Pershings (until George Shultz intervened in West German politics to make Mr. Kohl's earlier position less tenable) was that, unlike shorter-range missiles such as the Lance, the Pershing II would land on Warsaw Pact territory rather than West German territory, thus requiring the aggressor, rather than the victim, to pay the price for initiating armed conflict.
