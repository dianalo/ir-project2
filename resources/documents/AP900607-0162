(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Rifle Association opens itsannual convention in an unfriendly state Friday, hoping to restoreits influence after losses in membership and legislative defeatsacross the country.   An estimated 20,000 members will attend the convention inCalifornia, which last year bucked the gun lobby and passedlegislation banning more than 50 types of military-style assaultrifles.   The organization _ which also has suffered legislative defeats inCalifornia, New Jersey, Maryland and Florida _ won at least atemporary victory Thursday when the U.S. Senate failed to stop afilibuster on a broad anti-crime bill with new restrictions onsemiautomatic weapons.   Democratic leaders, blaming the NRA for their failure, at firstdecided the bill was dead, then sought a compromise to revive themeasure.   NRA lobbyist James J. Baker claimed the Senate action showed theNRA retains some legislative clout.   ``We've lost some battles. The war is far from over,'' Bakersaid. ``You look at the votes in the United States Senate thismorning and I think that gives you the proof that you need based onthe fact that they decided a crime bill that contains asemiautomatic firearms bill would not go forward.''   NRA leaders expect to hear complaints about about theorganization's legislative defeats, and have scheduled a meetingSaturday to field questions from the rank and file about them.   ``I think there's a great deal of frustration among themembership based on a very tough year,'' Baker said. ``...I thinkthat you're going to see that frustration played out at the annualmembership meeting.''   The convention comes at a crucial time in the history of the 2.8million-member organization. Along with legislative defeats, the NRAhas lost support among law enforcement and has lost 240,000 membersin four years.   Baker attributed some of the membership loss to a $10 increase indues in recent years. Opponents of the NRA see a badly damagedorganization.   ``The National Rifle Association has suffered enormous losses,''said Luis Tolley, western director of Handgun Control Inc. ``Overthe last 12 months you're looking at the worst period in the NRA'sexistence.''   The NRA faces divisions in its own ranks between members who feelthe group has gone too far and members who want the NRA to pushharder against gun control.   One of the NRA's biggest losses was in the California Legislaturelast year when lawmakers passed and Republican Gov. GeorgeDeukmejian signed a bill banning many kinds of assault rifles.   The bill was introduced after five children were slain and 29others were wounded in a schoolyard by a man with an assault rifle.The man, Patrick Purdy, killed himself at the end of the Jan. 17,1989, attack in Stockton.   California also now requires a 15-day waiting period for thepurchase of rifles and shotguns.   Elsewhere, Maryland voters approved a referendum in 1988 thatbans sale and manufacture of cheap handguns known as Saturday nightspecials.   This year in New Jersey, Gov. James Florio signed what he calledthe nation's strongest ban on sale and possession of assault weapons.   One NRA problem in fighting gun controls has been loss of supportamong police. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and LosAngeles Police Chief Darryl Gates speak in favor of legislationbanning assault weapons.   Gun control advocates say the NRA has gone too far in itslobbying.   ``Five or 10 years ago you wouldn't have seen the police doingwhat they're doing now,'' said Tolley. ``The NRA has gone off thedeep end.''   Baker acknowledged that loss of law enforcement groups hurt buthe contends the NRA has only lost support among police leadershipgroups.   ``By and large, the rank and file law enforcement officers, theofficer that walks the beat, that comes into contact with thecriminal element in this country, supports the position that guncontrol laws do not do anything to deter criminals,'' he said.   The convention features vendors pushing shotguns, handguns,bullets, crossbows, bulletproof vests, air guns, boots andcamouflage jackets.</TEXT></DOC>
