The target: the cellular telephone favored by the lobbyists,accounting firm representatives, paralegals and even a few of thereporters who fill the halls any time the Ways and Means Committeeconsiders tax legislation.   The committee, still adding pieces to a catchall tax bill thatoriginated as a deficit-reduction measure, voted Thursday to makeit more difficult to claim a tax deduction for cellular phones.   Present law permits a partial writeoff for depreciation ofcellular phones used partially for business. Thus, if a lawyer usesa phone 30 percent of the time for business, 30 percent of the costmay be deducted.   Committee aides said there is evidence some corporations andindividuals abuse the deduction by claiming personal calls as abusiness expense.   Under the committee amendment, no deduction will be permittedunless more than 50 percent of the use is for business; the userwill have to keep records to substantiate the use. The same rulealready applies to cars and personal computers.   The restriction was approved to pay for an amendment by Rep. GuyVander Jagt, R-Mich., that would save money for a few U.S.corporations whose income is earned entirely in a foreign country.Because the government is out of money, the panel requires that anynew tax cut be offset by a tax increase on somebody else.   Vander Jagt's amendment was one of several added to a proposalby Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., that simplifies the corporateminimum tax. That levy was created to ensure that profit-makingcorporations pay some tax even if their deductions and credits arebig enough to wipe out their regular liability.   In another voice vote Thursday, the committee added to the billa permanent extension of the Reagan-era Caribbean Basin Initiative,which temporarily granted tariff-free treatment of certain importsfrom that region. The proposal also extends the preferentialtreatment for the first time to apparel and other textile products.   The CBI changes would guarantee that Caribbean countries wouldbe able to export as much sugar to the United States as they areallowed to under existing quotas this year. Any reduction in totalU.S. imports of sugar would have to be borne by nations outside theCaribbean.   Meantime, Rostenkowski continued to delay a vote on reducing thetax on individual capital gains. A majority _ 13 Republicans andsix Democrats _ of the panel supports a temporary reduction in thetax, which applies to stocks and other assets.   President Bush has called for a cut to spur the economy and toraise revenues. Most Democrats oppose the cut on grounds it wouldlose money after a year or two and because 80 percent of the taxcut would go to those with incomes above $100,000 a year.   Rostenkowski and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley have beenappealing to fellow Democrats to oppose a reduction. But as afallback, the two leaders are weighing a counterproposal that wouldcontinue taxing capital gains at the same rates that apply to wagesand other income but to ``index'' capital gains so that profitscaused solely by inflation are not taxed.</TEXT></DOC>
