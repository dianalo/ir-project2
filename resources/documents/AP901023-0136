Troops in the Southeast Asian country arrested 20 monks at oneBuddhist monastery Tuesday and surrounded 11 other monasteries inBurma's religious center of Mandalay as part of a crackdown ondissent, according to sources in Rangoon.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Burmesegovernment radio reports said 133 monasteries were raided onMonday. She said department officials could not determine how manymonks had been arrested.   Burmese monks have been refusing to provide religious servicesfor soldiers or their families, which in the Buddhist religion isthe equivalent of excommunication.   The monks' actions followed the Aug. 8 suppression of a protestin Mandalay. Western diplomats said two monks and two other peoplewere killed in the confrontation.   ``The United States views these raids as one more proof of theregime's total disregard for human rights,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.``Its object seems to be the suppression of even token oppositionin Burma. We strongly condemn this latest action by the Burmesemilitary.''   Ms. Tutwiler also reiterated the U.S. call for the Burmesemilitary government to transfer power to a civilian government andrelease all political prisoners.   The government of Gen. Saw Maung has refused to turn over powerdespite the overwhelming victory in May elections of the oppositionNational League for Democracy. Opposition leaders have been jailed,and human rights groups accuse the military government ofwidespread abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
