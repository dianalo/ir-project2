(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker headed home toFlorida on Friday to prepare for an appeal of his fraud andconspiracy conviction and the possibility he might be jailed laterthis month, his lawyer said.   ``We got a lynch verdict,'' defense lawyer George T. Davis saidFriday. ``One of the happy things about this is that we weren'tstrung up. We're alive and kicking and raring to go.''   Davis said the Bakkers plan to suspend their storefront ministryin Orlando for the time being to concentrate on the televangelist'sappeal. Bakker is free on $250,000 bond pending his sentencing Oct.24.   ``We're under some tight time restraints,'' he said. ``We haveto anticipate the judge might refuse bail on appeal.''   On Thursday, a federal jury found Bakker guilty of all 24 countsof wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy for bilking his followersof $3.7 million. He faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prisonand fines of more than $5 million.   ``They're doing well,'' said Davis, who shared farewellsThursday night with Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, beforereturning to his home in Hawaii. ``I think Jim has an inner peace.   ``They're in the same mood I'm in _ for some strange reason wedon't feel down.''   Following the verdict, jury foreman Ricky Hill criticized theperformance of Bakker's defense team. ``We kept looking forsomething from the defense and we never saw it,'' he said.   After leaving PTL in March 1987, the couple began the Jim andTammy Ministries, which runs a church in Orlando, and conducts afive-day-a-week evangelistic television show seen on eight cableoutlets.   During Friday's television show, a stand-in for the Bakkersurged the faithful to pray, but didn't specifically mention theverdict.   An aide in Orlando said Bakker would address his followers onSunday.   ``It will be a regular church service,'' said Don Baldwin,acting general manager of Jim and Tammy Ministries. ``Jim will bethere. I don't know exactly what all the plans are for it.''   The Bakkers left Charlotte by car on Friday. They emerged fromco-counsel Harold Bender's office about 12:30 p.m., and Bakkergrabbed some pillows as he joined his son, Jamie Charles, in theback seat of a Ford Taurus sedan.   Mrs. Bakker slipped into the front passenger seat next toBakker's sister, Donna Puckett, who was driving.   Davis said a key to the appeal will be the lack of any obvioussigns of fraud in the government evidence.   ``There are no badges of fraud in this case _ no hidden bankaccounts or false entries in false books,'' Davis said. ``One ofthe key things on appeal is the fact that he actually received lessthan 1 percent of all the money he raised. He raised about $450million for PTL.''   Bakker raised $158 million by selling lodging guarantees, called``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USA retreat near FortMill, S.C. The indictment said he oversold the partnerships afterhe knew there weren't facilities for the people who bought them.   Justice Department special prosecutor Deborah Smith said in atelevision interview Friday that the conviction wasn't a reason tocelebrate.   ``I think it's very sad for his family, very sad for him,'' shesaid. But she added that it was saddest for the thousands of peoplewho sent money, ``many of them their life savings.''   Bakker maintained his innocence after his conviction Thursday.   ``I went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying I wasinnocent of the charges against me,'' a smiling Bakker said. ``Icome out still innocent of the charges against me. I put my faithin God.''</TEXT></DOC>
