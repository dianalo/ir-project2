Matthews Orlando, FLandM;Singapore StingandM;Guy Kawasaki is a pretty neat person.andP;  I read and enjoyed his book, and hedid a swell demo at my user group when he was flogging 4th Dimension.andM;I realize he appreciates well-run organizations, but his praise of Singapore(&quot;The Singapore Way,&quot; October '90, page 41) was a bit much.andP;  Singapore isgoverned by a fascist dictatorship.andP;  Its citizens barely have any freedom ofspeech as we know it or other little things such as due process or oppositionpolitical parties.andM;I'm glad Guy had a ball in Singapore.andP;  He'd probably have enjoyed Mussolini'sItaly too.andP;  After all, didn't Mussolini make the trains run on time?andP;  Goodpasta too.andM;I'm disappointed, Guy.andP;  richard Pachter Boca Raton, FLandM;I wanted to be among the first to tell you how much I enjoyed Guy Kawasaki'stongue-in-cheek article &quot;The Singapore Way.&quot;andP;  As a Singaporean, I was tickledpink to read about his favorable impressions of Singapore and The Mac sceneover there.andP;  It was refresing to read something different, instead of theusual Singapore-basing reviews that you often read in articles about theisland and its political system.andM;In any case, Singapore is determined to be a major player in the globalinformation-technology marketplace.andP;  Soon, not only will there be computersin offices, schools, and homes but they also may all be linked.andP;  Already allthe schools are linked to the Ministry of Education.andP;  When all the computersin the island are linked, think of the incredible power that informationsharing will bring.andP;  First Singapore, next the world]andM;John Heng San Francisco, CAandM;Love appleandM;Apple's behavior last year in temporarily raising prices cost the company alot of goodwill.andP;  For the first time, Mac users realized that Apple might tryto profit at their expense.andM;N ow we have to make a decision.andP;  Are we going to &quot;...Hate the Company, but...Love the Machine,&quot; as was jokingly suggested in October's &quot;Dear Mr.andO;Scully&quot; (Letters, page 14)?andP;  The rightful action is one that makes thecommunity stronger, and in most cases, destroying members of the communitymakes it weaker.andP;  Hating Apple is self-defeating.andP;  Without Apple, there is nomachine.andM;For Apple to succeed in a way that works for the community of Mac users is inall our interest.andP;  MacUser can be a leader by knowing how to ask the toughquestions while still showing that it wants Apple to succeed.andP;  If Applescrews up, we need to tell it -- not to destroy it but to stop it fromscreweing up.andM;Vik Rubenfeld Manhattan Beach, CAandM;Ticked OffandM;In &quot;EtherTalk-to-LocalTalk Routers&quot; (Buyer's Guide, June '90, page 42) youevaluated several AppleTalk-to-Ethernet gateways, including the CaymanGatorBox running GatorSystem version 1.4.1.andP;  The article recommended theGatorBox for NFS file sharing and other high-level gateway features but didnot recommend it for straight LocalTalk-to-EtherTalk routing, owing to speedand consistency problems that were indicated by your test results.andM;At Cayman, we have run your tests and learned that, under certain conditions,the version of GatorSystem you tested indeed routes packets more slowly andless consistently than do other vendors' routers.andP;  However, our testingdetermined that the differences in speed and consistency are usually toosmall for users to perceive.andM;The results you presented contradict this because your tests contained aserious flaw: You used ticks instead of a reliable clock to measure elapsedtime.andP;  Tick counters offer a convenient way of measuring elapsed time on aMac, but they are not reliable enough for performance tests that exercise theMacintosh AppletTalk driver, because this driver interferes with thetick-counter mechanism.andP;  As a result, using ticks for running the comparisontests makes a slightly faster routers look very fast and slightly slowerrouters look very slow.andP;  This method causes minor differences in relativeperformance to appear significant, when in fact users cannot tell thedifference in actual use.andP;  We were glad to see that our data confirmed whatour customers have been telling us.andP;  We look forward to your next lab onEther Talk-to-Local Talk routers.andP;  But please, MacUser, next time stay awayfrom ticks] Eric Janszen Product Marketing Manager Cayman Systems Cambridge,MAandM;Don't Do WindowsandM;Over the past few months, I've been reading articles and editorials aboutWindows 3.0 and how poorly it compares with our Mac environment.andP;  Why?andP;  Ithink most of us already know what an exceptional platform the Mac is.andP;  IfWindows 3.0 is neither a threat nor an Apple product, why am I wasting mytime reading about it in your magazine? Rich C. O'Brien San Diego, CAandM;I read with interest your speed comparisons of Windows 3.0 and variousMacintosh configurations (&quot;Windows 3: The PC to Be Your Best?,&quot; September'90, page 222).andP;  In particular, you compared an 8-megahertz Mac SE with a10-megahertz 80286-based machine and a 4-megabyte 16-megahertz Mac Ilcx withan 8-megabyte 25-megahertz 80386-based machine.andP;  Part of the reason the Macmay not have fared so well in the processor-intensive tests could be that,except for the Mac IIfx, all the Mac configurations ran at a slower clockspeed than did the PCs you were comparing them with.andP;  Furthermore, in thetest comparing the IIcx and PS/2 Model 80, the IBM machine was equipped withtwice as much RAM as the Mac was.andP;  I would have considered this a fairer testif it had compared a Mac SE and an 8-megahertz 80286 machine (if you couldfind one).andP;  A more formidable challenger to the IBM PS/2 Model 80 would havebeen a Mac IIci.andP;  I wish you would consider redoing your IIcx-versus-Model-80benchmark -- this time with an 8-megabyte Ilci.andP;  Sonny Shrivastava Danville,CAandM;Yes, I ScanandM;Our thanks to Ron Hipschman and MacUser Labs for their informative review ofhand-held scanners (&quot;Hand-Held Scanners,&quot; September '90, page 167).andP;  We wouldlike to clarify a couple of points.andP;  Here are LightningScan's correctspecifications for three items in Table 6 (page 190):andM;* Scaling range: 25 to 100 percent.andM;* Resolution: True 400 dpi, not interpolated as stated.andM;* SCSI-box dimensions for LightningScan 400: 8.25 X 6.25 X 2.3 inches.andM;Our $189 upgrade mentioned on page 172 applies only to users of our originalversion of Lightning Scan -- not to ThunderScan.andP;  However, ThunderScan userscan contact Thunderware directly to obtain special pricing on theLightningScan 400.andP;  Brian Smith Thunderware Orinda, CAandM;A Missing Dialog BoxandM;When tranferring the same file back and forth between two Macs, I haveseveral times lost the latest edition of that file.andP;  I really do need adialog box such as that in Figure 1.andP;  Will Apple create this dialog box withsystem 7.0, or is there a utility that can do this for me? Per G. WyholtGoteborg, SwedenandM;Powerful UltraPaintandM;We at Deneba Software are pleased that you reviewed UltraPaint (September'90, page 69), but there were several inaccuracies that MacUser and itsreaders should be aware of.andM;Your reviewer noted a redraw problem that covered up the Layer Manager.andP;  Thisbug occurred in a beta version but was corrected in the shipping version.andO;The cursor's behavior of changing colors is not a bug but rather a legitimatemethod of displaying the cursor (also used in Studio/8 and PixelPaint) tomaintain optimum visibility.andM;Your reviewer mentioned the blinking cursor as a product-specific flaw.andP;  Thisphenomenon is not unique to UltraPaintandgt; it occurs under the same conditionsin PixelPaint, Studio/8, Digital Darkroom, ImageStudio, and SuperPaint.andM;Contrary to your reviewer's statements concerning complexity and clutter, wedo not believe that users must sacrifice clarity to access all ofUltraPaint's power.andP;  Total control can be obtained with only three windowsopen, and the tools are both fewer and more distinct than the reviewerstates.andP;  (The free-form tool and pencil, for example, are not the same.andP;  Thefree-form tool creates Bezier curves and polygonsandgt; the pencil edits pixels.)andM;These inaccuracies, as well as others, have led us to conclude that yourreaders deserve a fairer and more accurate representation of UltraPaint.andO;Joaquin de Soto Vice President Deneba Software Miami, FLandM;McGee WhizandM;Rebecca Parascandolo's description of our program McGee (September '90, page115) is reasonably accurate, but it might have been more insightful had sheengaged a preschool child for help with her review.andP;  McGee is targeted apreschoolers who are using a computer for the first time.andP;  Activity selectionand overall size of the program (two disks) are limited to allow youngchildren to run the program by themselves without extensive disk swapping orthe frustration of clicking on dead screen areas.andP;  Steve Vance LawrenceProductions Galesburg, MIandM;The Big ScreenandM;Your October '90 issue was exceptional, but why didn't you mention in &quot;PowerPresentations&quot; (page 191) the option of Generation X's (no relation to BillyIdol, I think) new video card/box and a big-screen TV?andP;  A 25-inch televisionalong with this new technology would run less than $1,000--much morecost-effective than LCD projectors.andP;  Even with the 50- or 60-inch behermoths,the price is consistent with those of LCD projectors.andM;Plus you have the benefit of a working television for use with VCRpresentations or just for showing football games at the office party.andP;  Suchan expenditure would be easier to justify than the LCD technology, especiallyto old-school computerphobe bosses (who do, in fact, still exist).andP;  Jim DownsHuntington Beach, CAandM;Go FishandM;I was little disappointed with &quot;33 Unsung Shareware Programs&quot; (October '90,page 244).andP;  Games, INITS, and hacker supplies are nice, but i'm sure many Macusers would like to do more with their machines than watch fish swimmingacross the screen.andP;  We'd like to see what sort of educational sharewareprograms exist that we could use to build an actual library, such as aprogram about fish that would show how to identify certain types.andP;  JohnBrosnan Mankato, MNandM;Game PreserveandM;I read with interest John Dvorak's column in the October '90 issue.andP;  However,I must take exception to one comment.andP;  He wrote about Atari and its&quot;just-plain-mean suit against Nintendo.&quot;andP;  If I remember correctly, Nintendofirst sued Atari, because Atari had found a software way around the lockoutchip in the Nintendo system.andP;  This allowed Atari to produce cartridgeswithout buying Nintendo's chip.andP;  Atari countersued.andP;  From Dvorak's tone, itsounds as though he thinks the chip is a good idea.andP;  I can imagine hisoutrage if Apple computers could accept only disks sold by Apple and all thesoftware companies had to buy their disks from Apple.andP;  Although the chip hasreaped untold profits for Nintendo, the prices for the cartridges areoutrageous.andP;  Aren't Mac software and hardware expensive enough? Paul G.andO;Gifford State College, PAandM;What Goes On?andM;As a programmer for close to 20 years, I totally agree with Thom Hogan'scomments concerning diagnostics (&quot;The Self-Supporting Mac,&quot; October '90, page263).andP;  When I first received my Mac, I was appalled at the number of manualsand the amount of useful information that came with it.andP;  I have InsideMacintosh and other books and am still trying to figure out what's going oninside the box.andP;  Now, I realize that I'm much more technically inclined thataverage users, but I'm tired of calling Apple, at my expense, and having tosay things such as, &quot;OK, if you don't know it, tell me who does]&quot; Ed FouseEuclid, OHandM;Letter ImperfectandM;I appreciated your in-depth Buyer's Guide to PostScript printers in theOctober '90 issue (&quot;The Letter-Perfect Post-Script Printer,&quot; Buyer's Guide,page 5).andP;  Unfortunately, the usefulness of this evaluation is marred bycontradictory product scoring presented in the article.andP;  The caption thataccompanies Figure 1 (&quot;Jury Results,&quot; page 16) points out that the NECSilentwriter2 290 &quot;consistently brought up the rear, with the worst imagequality,&quot; while the chart places this printer well ahead of most of the otherprinters in the overall subjective rating of text and graphics quality.andM;Additionally, this chart shows the LaserMAX 1000 Personal Typesetter as theclear overall winner in text quality.andP;  However, later, in the sidebar&quot;All-in-One: The Desktop Publisher,&quot; potential printer buyers who specializein desktop publishing are warned that the &quot;The LaserMAX 1000 had the bestgraphics performance, but this was offset by its poor text quality.&quot;andP;  Infact, the quality of text was so poor that this enhanced-resolution printeractually &quot;scored lower than some 300-dpi printers.&quot;andP;  For many professionalpublishers, this concluding statement would immediately remove this otherwiseexcellent printer from their shopping lists.andP;  Todd Cranston-Cuebas SanMarino, CAandM;6, No TrumpandM;Bobker's Dozen (October '90, page 48) failed to mention that Artworx's Bridge6.0 reneges as well as deals the same card to two players.andP;  When I wrote tothe company about the problems, it advised me to buy the upgrade (I hadversion 5.0).andP;  As version 6.0 still has the problems, I feel duped by thecompany and would not recommend buying anything from it.andP;  David LazarOlympia, WAandM;DIY DPIandM;On page 58 of your October '90 Buyer's Guide (&quot;Do-It-Yourself PrinterTesting&quot;), you present an interesting set of graphics for testing PostScriptprinters.andP;  Everything looks great with the exception of the scannedphotograph.andP;  On page 54, you note that the photo was a 200-dpi scan.andP;  If theimage was reproduced at the original size of the scan, the &quot;blockiness&quot; seenhere should not have occurred.andP;  Lawrence J, Grinnell Palm springs, FLandM;Where's Bruce?andM;As we all know, many commercial programs are available for the Mac that costtoo much, come with unintelligible documentation, and may or may not run atall on newer machines.andP;  But with Bruce Tomlin's wonderful shareware programSoundMaster, I have seen adults laugh when the Mack went &quot;blaah]&quot; whileejecting a disk and children squeal with delight at the sound of the wickedwitch cackling.andP;  &quot;I'll get you my little pretty]&quot;  All this for $15.andM;I'd like to send Mr. Tomlin his shareware fee.andP;  I sent a postcard to theaddress that was listed in your magazine to be sure he was still there, but Ihave not received a reply.andP;  Please do everyone a service by locating andprinting his current address.andP;  Keith Johnson Malmstrom AFB, MT</TEXT></DOC>
