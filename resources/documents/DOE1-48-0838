<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0838 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have studied the generation of inhomogeneity in the baryon-number densityduring the cos- mic quark-hadron phase transition. We use a simple modelwith thin-wall phase boundaries and ideal-gas equations of state. Theresult depends on the unknown nucleation scale r{sub 0}. Large-amplitudeinhomogeneities can be created if r{sub 0} is small and T/sub c/ is low.The distance scale of this inhomogeneity is then the bubble coalescencescale. It seems unlikely that the inhomogeneity could have significantlyaffected the light element abundances produced in the cosmic nucleosynthesis.</TEXT></DOC>
