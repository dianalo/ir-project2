Spokesmen for the wo sides said the gulf between them was wideand they expect no early agreement. But Roman Catholic Churchofficials, who had acted as mediators in earlier meetings, said theof two-day round of talks are the most substantial so far and theyare hopeful.   ``We consider this meeting very important. It could be asignificant step toward peace,and that is why we are helping theparticipants with our prayers,'' Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas,the head of El Salvador's Catholic church, told reporters Sunday.   But Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal, who isplaying host to the talks, had a different opinion: ``It would be amiracle if an agreement is reached in these negotiations.''   At a preliminary meeting in Mexico City last month, both sidesagreed to this week's talks and to subsequently meet at 30-dayintervals until a peace accord is reached.   Three meetings by the preceding administration of President JoseNapoleon Duarte's administration with guerrilla leaders from 1984to 1987 all ended in deadlock, with the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front demanding to share power in a newgovernment before laying down its weapons.   Cristiani succeeded Durate on June 1 for a five-year term. Hisultra-conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance had defeatedDuarte's centrist Christian Democrats in national elections inwhich leftist groups refused to participate.   Since then, the rebels have softened their demands.   At the Mexico meeting, they offered for the first time to call atemporary cease-fire by Nov. 15, form a political party and runcandidates in future elections if Cristiani agrees to undertakewide-ranging social, political and constitutional reforms andreduce military ranks.   Cristiani, who is demanding an immediate cease-fire while talksof reform continue, said Saturday that the rebels are expected tostep up attacks in coming days in an effort to bolster theirpositions at the talks.   Rebel spokesman Cesar Marti said Sunday that the front will notagree to stop fighting unless terms _ including reforms _ areagreed upon first, adding that ``the negotiations will bedifficult.''   ``The government wants us to lay down our weapons and negotiateafterwards. `But we want a temporary truce and progressively worktowards a definite cease-fire, with absolute guarantees there willbe true democracy in our country,'' he said.   According to human rights groups, more than 70,000 people havebeen killed in the civil war and the United States has beenproviding $1 million daily in military and economic aid to prop upa succession of Salvadoran governments.   The talks were to be held at a church retreat in Moravia, asmall town six miles northeast of San Jose, and monitored by churchleaders, and observers from the United Nations and the Organizationof American States.   The talks are being held within the framework of peace accordsCristiani and four other Central American presidents signed inHonduras in August to end the Salvadoran war, a U.S.-supportedContral rebel war in Nicaragua and a long-simmering leftistinsurgency in Guatemala.   Before the talks open, Marti said the nine-member rebelleadership would meet with President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, whowon the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring a regional peace plan.</TEXT></DOC>
