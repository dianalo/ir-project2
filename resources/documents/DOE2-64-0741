<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0741 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple FORTRAN program called ROTXSU3, which determines eigenvaluesof the quantum rotor and the corresponding algebraic SU(3) model Hamiltonian,is introduced. General analytic expressions for matrix elements of thetwo Hamiltonians are given. These results are used to establish the equivalenceof the SU(3) and rotor theories in the min({lambda}, {mu}) andgt;andgt; L limit,where {lambda} and {mu} are SU(3) representation labels and L is theangular momentum. The results can also be used to study group expansionand deformation mechanism since T/sub 5/ x SO(3), the symmetry groupof the quantum rotor, is a contraction of SU(3). A mapping between eigenvaluesof the invariant operators of the two theories gives a relationship betweenthe parameters of their Hamiltonians. This mapping also leads to a shell-modelinterpretation of the {beta} and {gamma} shape variables of the collectivemodel.</TEXT></DOC>
