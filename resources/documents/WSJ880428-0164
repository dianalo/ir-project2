The struggle apparently has escalated to a point where the Food and Drug Administration perceives it to be a threat to its entrenched power and is now employing all the bureaucratic devices that destroy initiative, insult logic and lack compassion.    We have all lived through the tortures of disease; however, none is more devastating than the ravages of Alzheimer's. Please give the victims and their families the hope of dignity and intellectual activity as opposed to the definitive life sentence of living in a shell devoid of mental faculties and controlled bodily functions.    Ian H. Tissot   Rockaway Point, N.Y.    ---   The Journal is to be commended for its support of Dr. Summers's vital research on THA treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The intransigence of FDA bureaucracy is unconscionable.    Phyllis Liebson   Santa Fe, N.M. </TEXT></DOC>
