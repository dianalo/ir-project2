MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In simpler times, a politician, a president,could tailor his message to fit his audience, and chances were theadjustments would go unnoticed.   In the era of instant communications that doesn't work verywell; television makes all audiences into one. But President Bushand some other Republican leaders are trying to deal with theabortion issue as though the old way might still work.   The objective seems to be to deal with abortion separately,apart from other issues. That's understandable as abortion becomesan increasingly worrisome topic for Republicans, who saw it workagainst their 1989 candidates. The trouble is that isolating issuesis as difficult as fine-tuning speeches.   For example, Republicans pride themselves on a philosophy thatseeks to keep government from intruding on private decision-making.Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois, who favors abortion rights,suggested that GOP tenet could be cast into doubt by a candidateopposed to abortion, since that would involve the government in oneof the most sensitive of private decisions.   He raised the question at a conference of Republican governorsearlier this month. It already had been answered in one election:Virginia Democrats made effective use of that theme in narrowlywinning the contest for governor.   Bush had said in advance there was no evidence that single-issuevoters would make abortion a decisive issue. But in the hairbreadthVirginia verdict, it almost certainly influenced enough votes toshape the outcome.   That points to the Democratic course in dealing with abortion inthe 1990 campaign. Their 1989 candidates succeeded in claiming thecenter on the issue. Strategists for both parties agree that iswhere the majority of the voters are, pro and anti-abortionzealotry notwithstanding. ``My sense on this issue is that theAmerican people are in the middle,'' said William Bennett, the drugpolicy chief, offering the governors' conference some unsolicitedadvice.   But the Republicans have had more trouble getting there.   Bush's own position has come all the way from support for the1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion to ardent,active opposition. He vetoed four appropriations bills this fallbecause they would have permitted the use of tax dollars to pay forabortions for needy women who were victims of rape or incest. Bushwould permit abortion in those cases, but not with public funds.   The Republican Party platform advocates a constitutionalamendment to bar abortions. That doesn't bind anybody; as GOPleaders hasten to point out, party platforms usually are ignored.But it does set a starting point.   The national party position that counts is the one anti-abortioncourse President Bush is setting.   The Bush administration has been urging the Supreme Court tooverturn its original abortion decision. That call is repeated inadministration briefs on two cases that are to be argued before thecourt tomorrow, on Ohio and Minnesota laws requiring that parentsbe notified before abortions are performed on their teen-agedaughters.   On a narrowed issue such as parental advice or consent forteen-age abortions, the opinion surveys and the politicalstrategists agree that a candidate probably could find majoritybacking. When it is broadened and simplified into a flat yes or noon abortion rights, it's hard to handle.   Bush said there is plenty of room in the Republican Party fordiffering opinions on abortion, and among Democrats, too.   On Nov. 14, Bush met with four Republican women House memberswho support abortion rights, listened to their arguments, but saidhis own views are not subject to change. His spokesman then saidthat agreement on abortion was not a test of support; that Bushwould back all Republican candidates, without regard to positionsdiffering from his own.   Two of the four House women want to move to the Senate in the1990 elections, and Bush campaigned for them last week. He avoidedthe abortion issue, speaking as though it didn't exist.   At a Chicago fundraising reception for Rep. Lynn Martin ofIllinois, Bush said the congresswoman has been ``right on issueafter issue. She thinks like I do, like you do.''   Then he went to Providence in behalf of Rep. Claudine Schneiderof Rhode Island, and praised her independence. ``I always knowexactly where she stands,'' the president said.   Flying home on Air Force One, he vetoed another bill because ofabortion funding. Rep. Schneider, a presidential passenger, saidshe was disappointed.   Looking for the lessons of 1989, Chairman Lee Atwater and otherRepublican leaders are counseling 1990 candidates to take clearpositions on abortion, state them early in the campaign, and standfirm.   Bennett told the governors he won't mind if Republicans are aminority because they stand on principle.   He holds office by appointment.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
