Hay, who isto retire as chairman and chief executive officer, to receive$750,000 a year for consulting services. Mr. Hay's consultingcontract is to last for 2 1/2 years.   The company has announced that David H. Hoag, head ofLTV's steel unit, will succeed Mr. Hay, who has been chairmanand chief executive for eight years. The leadership change isexpected to take effect Feb. 1.   After negotiations in the judge's chambers, the steel,aerospace and defense concern agreed to reduce Mr. Hay'sannual compensation by half to $375,000 a year, with thebalance to be paid upon confirmation of the company'sreorganization plan. In addition, the company reduced theamount of the premium it would pay for Mr. Hay's insurancepolicy to $82,500 a year from $109,000 a year for sevenyears.   One witness at the hearing said that the changes wouldreduce Mr. Hay's compensation by approximately $1 millionover the life of the contract.   A lawyer for an association of retired steel workersobjected to the plan, saying that Mr. Hay's packagerepresents a &quot;distorted set of priorities&quot; at a time when thepension benefits of the workers are being cut.   But Judge Lifland approved the plan, saying that thechanges created an incentive for Mr. Hay to help the companyemerge from bankruptcy. &quot;I'm sure Mr. Hay realizes that timeis money,&quot; said Judge Lifland.   Judge Lifland also approved the compensation plan for Mr.Hoag, who is to receive a base salary of $550,000, before aperformance-based bonus that could double his pay, as well asother benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
