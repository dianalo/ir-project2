He had collapsed during aweekend hunting trip.   Strauss was a formidable power for decades and weathered a 1962scandal that forced his resignation as federal defense minister. Heled the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party ofChancellor Helmut Kohl's national Christian Democrats.   Kohl's office said the chancellor was breaking off a trip to theFar East to return to West Germany.   Spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said the government was ``deeplyaffected'' by the death of Strauss. Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher called him ``one of the most important personalities ofGerman postwar history'' and declared: ``His political achievementsdeserve the respect of all citizens.''   His influence was particularly strong during the last decade,when he was governor of Bavaria, and Kohl needed approval from theburly boss of Munich for major domestic programs.   It was in foreign affairs, however, that Strauss insisted onmaking his influence felt and his name known.   He visited communist East Germany in 1983 to deliver a creditline of 1 billion marks, then worth $400 million, in return forconcessions that included removal of some guns and mines from theborder.   Also in 1983, Strauss visited Poland and Czechoslovakia fortalks with the leaders of those Soviet-bloc states.   In Israel two years later he defended his advocacy of WestGerman arms sales to Saudi Arabia, dismissing claims that hiscountry should not sell arms to Arabs because of its moralresponsibility for Nazi crimes against Jews.   Strauss was a firm supporter of NATO and its decision to basenuclear missiles in Western Europe.   He was fluent in English and often visited Washington formeetings with U.S. political leaders, including President Reagan.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Reagansent a message of condolence describing Strauss as ``one of thegreat figures in the democratic history of the Federal Republic ofGermany. He was a firm friend of the United States, sharing ourdedication to human freedom and close cooperation between our twocountries.''   An active amateur pilot, Strauss flew the airplane that took aBavarian delegation to the Soviet Union in December 1987 for talkswith Mikhail S. Gorbachev and leaders.   A month later, he visited Johannesburg and expressed ``moderateoptimism'' about South Africa, whose 26 million blacks are denied avoice in national affairs. He also said the white authoritiesdeserved recognition for reforms.   The governor was outspoken and fervently Roman Catholic, twocharacteristics of his mountainous southern state.   He collapsed Saturday while hunting in the Regensburg area withPrince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, one of the world's richest menand West Germany's largest landowner.   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau said in its eveningeditions Monday: ``F.J. Strauss is Dead! State Ceremony Ordered.''   Accompanying the front-page article was a photograph of Straussand the prince, both clad in traditional green loden Alpine huntingoutfits, taken on a simliar outing in 1983.   An official announcement said Strauss died in a Regensburghospital after ``multiple-organ failure,'' including kidneys andlungs. The cause of death was given as ``heart and circulationfailure.''   Strauss had been in a coma, kept alive with a respirator.   As defense minister in the early 1960s, Strauss claimed a reportin Der Spiegel magazine criticizing military maneuvers bordered ontreason. He created further controversy by ordering several of theleft-leaning magazine's staff members arrested, and was forced toresign in 1962.   Leftist publications also accused Strauss of involvement inpayoff scandals in the purchase of military fighter jets, and indeals involving the U.S. aircraft company Lockheed.   One of the governor's favorite political sports was tauntingleftist foes. After his death, the Greens party said his name wassynonomous with ``cold War, arms buildup, atomic policies and amagisterial understanding of politics.''   Strauss became a cabinet member in 1953 under West Germany'sfirst chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, and was finance minister the``Great Coalition'' Kurt Georg Kiesinger formed in 1966 with theleftist Social Democrats. He became governor of Bavaria in 1978.   His wife died after a car accident in 1984. His three children _daughter Monika Hohlmeier and two sons Max-Josef and Franz-Georg _live in the Munich area.</TEXT></DOC>
