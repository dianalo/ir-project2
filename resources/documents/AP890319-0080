But now, awash in waves of emotional depression,he lives in the streets.   The 24-year old computer whiz with a genius IQ, who as ateen-ager was the target of a highly publicized FBI crackdown oncomputer hackers, now spends his days on park benches and his nightsin shelters and concrete doorways.   Known at the height of his fame by his code name ``The Hacker,''Landreth has all but dropped out of society, saying mood-alteringdrugs and antidepressants couldn't ward off the depression that hasdogged him.   But Landreth said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times thathe remains confident in his ability to control computers, and couldmake lots of money using his talents. But he said he must live byhis own rules.   ``I could set up a data base system for a company and walk awaywith a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'dnever regret it,'' he said. ``The five or six thousand for five orsix hours of work would interest me, but I haven't fallen for it.   ``I didn't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulatingfor several eons, so I wouldn't know how to look at money,'' he said.   Landreth gained notoriety in 1983 when the FBI cracked down onhim and other hackers.   With an IQ measured at 186, well into the genius category,Landreth was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based GTETelemail electronic mail network to take a look at computercorrespondence from the Defense Department and National Aeronauticsand Space Administration.   Landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud,was fined $87 for using computer time he didn't pay for and wasplaced on three years' probation.   During his legal problems, Landreth appeared to be in control ofhis life, giving lectures to business executives, doing freelancecomputer work and promoting a book about his experiences, ``Out ofthe Inner Circle,'' which has sold about 68,000 copies.   But in September 1986, Landreth disappeared, leaving behind arambling, eight-page essay touching on such subjects as man'sevolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war andgreed, and suicide.   ``I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country,bored getting raided by the FBI, bored in prison, bored writingbooks, bored being bored,'' read the last page. ``I will probably bebored dead, but this is my risk to take.''   Landreth drifted for almost a year, turning up in the Oregon townof Minnville, near Portland, where he was arrested for violating hisprobation.   He was sent back to San Diego, where he found that he had about$9,000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. Herented an apartment, but it burned down. He eventually landed on thestreets.   ``The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if Idid things in a constructive way,'' he said. ``But I haven't decidedto do that.''   He prefers, for now, to live by his own definition of freedom,even though he knows some of his friends and family think he'swasting his life.   ``I don't know what (freedom) is good for any more than anyoneelse knows what it's good for,'' he said. ``So it's really in howyou look at it.''</TEXT></DOC>
