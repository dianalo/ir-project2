(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some 200 police officers were convergingon the state capital for the signing of a gun control law thatmakes Maryland the first state to ban the sale of Saturday NightSpecials.   White House press secretary James Brady was invited to watchGov. William Donald Schaefer sign the bill into law today.   Brady's wife, Sarah, was scheduled to be the main speaker forthe State House ceremony. She became active in gun control effortsafter her husband was seriously wounded in John Hinckley Jr.'sassassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981.   Legislative leaders and other top officials who helped push thebill through the General Assembly last month were to join dozens ofother invited guests, including police officers from neighboringstates, for the ceremony.   Schaefer aides say the ceremony was not intended as a show offorce to pro-gun groups that are collecting signatures on petitionsto place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in November.   Rather, the aides said, the ceremony was a way of sharing themoment with the many people who helped get the bill passed despitefierce opposition from the National Rifle Association and Marylandgun groups.   After losing to gun control forces in the legislature, the NRAand other gun groups began a campaign to petition the bill toreferendum and persuade the voters to reject it in November. Theysay they are confident they can obtain enough signatures to get themeasure on the ballot.   State officials say the bill is unique because it creates aboard to determine which handguns can be sold in Maryland beginningin 1990. It will not be illegal to possess guns that have not beenapproved by the review board, but it will be against the law foranyone to sell weapons not on the approved list.   The law is primarily aimed at cheap handguns, known as SaturdayNight Specials, that are often used in street crimes and are theweapon of choice for young criminals.   The review board also is directed to omit from the list ofapproved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed oraltered and guns made primarily of plastic that aren't easilydetected by metal detectors.</TEXT></DOC>
