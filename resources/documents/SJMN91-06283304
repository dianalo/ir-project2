The traffic would be horrible.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LOS GATOS BURNS OVER BURGER BID  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The Burger King, which comes before the Los Gatos planning commission forapproval tonight, would open in the 2,700-square-foot building at the cornerof Frank Avenue and Los Gatos Boulevard that is now occupied by Pace OpticalCo.;   The town's planning staff has recommended approval of the project ifthe commission comes up with findings showing the restaurant, which will addsignificant traffic to busy Los Gatos Boulevard, would be a benefit to thecommunity.;   Officials fed up with traffic;   The town for years had a policydiscouraging approval of new or expanded businesses in busy areas if thebusiness was expected to generate new traffic. Officials were fed up withtraffic congestion. Last year, however, they softened the policy to allow newbusinesses if owners showed they would benefit the town, despite the traffic.;  Planner Kirk Heinrichs said the Pace Optical building 20 years ago housed aBurger Chef, one of the first fast food restaurants in the area. &quot;The buildingstill has the restaurant infrastructure -- the plumbing, grease traps, a sewerline -- so very few changes would be necessary,&quot; he said.;   The Burger Kingalso would use the current entrance and exits off Frank Avenue and Los GatosBoulevard.;   But the residents don't like the fact that everything is inplace for the Burger King to easily get its approval.;   &quot;I don't like theidea of more people throwing french fry wrappers around our street, like theydo now,&quot; said Marilyn Esparza, whose home is six doors away from the proposedrestaurant. &quot;And we already have people come park in front of our houses andsit and eat lunch from the other restaurants.&quot;;   U-turns for hot dogs;   Oneblock north of the proposed Burger King is a Jack-in-the-Box and one blocksouth is the hot dog eatery Happy Hound. Several years ago, residents on LeroyAvenue near the Happy Hound complained of heavy traffic, customers makingU-turns in the middle of their block and large trucks making deliveries to thediner.;   Town officials established permit parking areas, restricted truckdeliveries and prohibited U-turns.;   Residents, like Richard Lee, said theyhope if the restaurant is approved, town officials will impose similarrestrictions to keep traffic at a minimum and discourage customers fromparking on Frank Avenue.;   &quot;We're entitled to the same conditions as theother neighbors have, and we intend to fight for them,&quot; said Lee.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911009  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  475  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 9, 199100283304,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
