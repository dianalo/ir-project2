Our primary concern was to reduce the lightscattering of the sputtered layers as much as possible because scatteringis one of the key problems of such mirrors. For the scattering measurementswe used substrates of BK7, fused silica and silicon wafers. The siliconwafers proved to have the best and most reproducible surface quality.Therefore they were mostly used for the basic scattering investigations.Starting from very high scattering levels (approx. 1000 ppm) due to flakinginside the deposition chamber we could reduce this value to the few ppm-range.This value is comparable to that of the best gyro mirrors produced bysecondary ion beam sputtering, making the magnetron sputtering processan attractive alternative to the highly sophisticated ion beam sputtering.</TEXT></DOC>
