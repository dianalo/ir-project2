HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists are tackling the problems of growingold and finding some success helping frail, flabby bodies becomeyouthful again.   There's no cure for old age, but scientists are developing thenext best thing: therapies that can forestall and even reverse someof the most disabling and disturbing effects of the inevitable.   ``There has been just a remarkable increase in interest, at longlast, in the problems of older people,'' said Dr. Reubin Andres, anaging expert at Johns Hopkins University. ``It's a hopeful timethat we are living in. A lot of advances are being made. But thatdoesn't mean that we have the youth pill.''   While indeed none is exactly a youth pill, scientists reportedthree discoveries in the past month that could help make growingold just a little easier:   _The most dramatic announcement was the effects of human growthhormone, which spurs the body to make muscle. Six months ofinjections wiped 20 years off elderly recipients' sagging physiques.   Doctors cautioned that they don't yet know how many people couldbenefit. But if the hormone works as well as they hope, it couldgive many the strength to keep walking and fending for themselveswell into old age.   _Another team demonstrated that the prescription medicineetidronate can strengthen aging spines. It stops and even reversesthe gradual loss of backbone. This sharply reduces the risk ofcrushed vertebrae, a common and painful condition especially commonamong elderly women, that results in stooped posture.   _Taking an entirely different tack, a group of doctors showedthat even nursing home patients in their 90s can build up theirmuscles through regular exercise.   It was just coincidence that the reports came out at the sametime. But the three studies share an important theme of geriatriccare: All are steps toward helping folks stay active, mobile andindependent into old age.   The need for this research is obvious. Growing old is a growingproblem. The Census Bureau estimates that by the year 2030, whenbaby boomers hit their senior years, there will be 66 millionAmericans over age 65 _ 2{ times more than 1980.   Certainly, even the most optimistic scientific seers do notexpect to conquer death any time soon. The human body is simplybuilt to wear out. Beyond gray hair and wrinkles, eyesight dims,balance fails, muscles turn to flab. But these breakdowns are notquite so certain as they once seemed.   ``The general attitude has been that aging is a geneticallyprogrammed, cellular event, determined when you are born,'' saidDr. Seymour Reichlin, chief of endocrinology at New England MedicalCenter.   ``It's programmed so that cells die at a certain rate, and thereyou are,'' he said. ``The data with growth hormone raises the issueof whether some of the aging process is not genetically programmed,or perhaps the program can be changed.''   Hormones, in fact, are one of the hottest areas of agingresearch. The body generates lots of these proteins to regulategrowth and other chores. In the fourth decade of life and beyond,much of this production begins to taper off. So scientist areasking: Why not put them back?   Hormone replacement is nothing new. Doctors have long advisedwomen to take estrogen supplements to keep them healthy after theirbodies slow the natural production of this sex hormone followingmenopause. But now scientists are looking into keeping the bodyyouthful with other varieties.   Among the possibilities:   _Testosterone. This is the major male sex hormone. Many men loseits production when they get old. Restoring it could help thembuild up muscle and regain lost sex drive.   _Somatomedin C. Human growth hormone stimulates the body to makethis protein, which in turn promotes muscle production.   _Blood cell growth factors. The body produces a host of thesehormones to stimulate the production of white blood cells thatguard against cancer and infection. Fine-tuning these hormones maykeep people healthier in old age.   _Nerve cell growth factors. In theory, at least, these proteinsmight help the body replace brain cells that are destroyed byAlzheimer's disease or lost through the natural wear and tear ofaging.   Dr. Evan Hadley, chief of the geriatrics branch of the NationalInstitute on Aging, and others believe even more ills of aging willsoon be controlled, if not cured.   ``I am very hopeful,'' he said. ``There is a real possibility ofsignificantly reducing the problems of physical frailty in old ageover the next decade.''</TEXT></DOC>
