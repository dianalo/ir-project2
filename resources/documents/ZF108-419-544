(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By David StromandM;The latest version of IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) costs $830 -- abargain, actually, considering its raft of new features.andM;Nonetheless, OS/2 EE version 1.2, which IBM began shipping a month ago, hasroom to improve, particularly in its printer-setup procedure and inasynchronous communications applications.andM;The upgrade includes some long-awaited features, such as printer support,support for Presentation Manager-style windows, and LAN services for both thedatabase and communications modules.andP;  IBM has finally delivered on all of theenhancements it announced two years ago.andM;Noteworthy additions include support for IBM's REXX procedural language andthe ability to support 3270 network gateways (see stories, this page).andP;  Onthe other hand, the asynchronous modules remain EE's weakest link, despitesome beefing up from earlier versions.andM;Unlike earlier releases of OS/2 EE, which did not properly support a widevariety of output devices, version 1.2 was able to produce high-qualityoutput during testing.andP;  Tests were conducted using Presentation Managerapplications, such as Describe Inc.'s DeScribe, Microsoft Corp.'s Excel andLotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3/G.andM;Installing printer drivers, however, is not easy; in fact, the process seemslike a kind of slow torture (see story, this page).andM;There are now two Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  LaserJet printer drivers for OS/2 1.2.andO;One is shipped with the IBM software and supports font cartridges over theentire LaserJet line, including the older model I and II printers.andP;  A seconddriver available from Hewlett-Packard includes support for scalable fonts.andO;(The IBM driver does not support scalable fonts.)andM;Things get worse when using OS/2 with the IBM Quietwriter III driver.andP;  PCWeek consistently got protection errors when printing from 1-2-3/G, whileExcel and DeScribe couldn't even locate the driver.andM;Perhaps the most significant enhancement in OS/2 EE is its ability togenerate Presentation Manager applications with support for Remote DataServices.andP;  These new features make it possible to develop fairlysophisticated database applications that take advantage of the PresentationManager interface without any programming.andM;Version 1.2 provides the first PC-based database server from IBM.andP;  As aresult, multiple DOS and OS/2 workstations can access a database via LANconnections without the need to load the LAN operating systems software.andM;As with other database servers such as Gupta Technologies Inc.'s SQLBase, theentire database is not loaded across the network, thus improving performance.andO;IBM Token-Ring, IBM PC Network and Ethernet are supported (the latter onlyfor OS/2 workstations).andM;PC Week was able to quickly set up a database workstation and server on aToken-Ring network with a minimum of effort, using menu prompts and theon-line OS/2 reference materials.andM;One limitation, though, is that databases at first must be defined locally onthe server using the Query Manager module.andP;  Once this is done, users cancreate and modify the database remotely and build Presentation Manager-stylemenus to access data files.andM;Async Support Still WeakandM;Despite some improvements, the asynchronous-communications aspect of version1.2 is still the weakest component in the entire Extended Edition product.andO;It lacks some critical features of products such as CrosstalkCommunications/DCA's Crosstalk Mk.4 and Hilgraeve Inc.'s HyperAccess/5.andM;PC Week tested the asynchronous-communications capabilities of ExtendedEdition with several different modems on IBM PS/2 Models 80 and P70.andM;The good news is that as a PM application, the asynchronous feature fits muchmore effectively within the overall EE package.andP;  As with the 3270 emulationmodule, its icon changes color when new information appears on-screen.andP;  Thesoftware now supports both eight data bits as well as seven data bits, so itis possible to download binary files.andM;Both 3101 and VT100 emulations and Xmodem and ASCII file transfers were alsocompleted without a hitch.andP;  Prior versions of OS/2 had some problems withVT100 emulation.andM;The bad news is that there is no support for Ymodem and Kermit file-transferprotocols, nor is there a scripting capability; additional software isrequired for modem pooling.andM;----------Additional analysis by Bob Holmes, a systems consultant with a large Westernutility, and Denise Schmidt, an independent systems consultant based inOmaha, Neb.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
