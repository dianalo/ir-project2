A bill relaxing most of the Depression-era separation betweencommercial and investment banking passed the Senate in March.Competing, although more restrictive, versions have cleared theEnergy and Commerce, and Banking committees in the House.   However, a jurisdictional battle between Rep. Fernand J. StGermain, D-R.I., chairman of the Banking Committee, and Rep. JohnDingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,has dimmed hopes of passing a banking bill before Congress adjournsfor the fall election campaign.   According to a congressional aide who spoke on condition ofanonymity, staff members from the Banking and Energy and Commercecommittees met Tuesday, but ``fundamental differences remain.''   Wright has taken the position that St Germain and Dingell mustresolve their dispute themselves.   But, Greenspan told Wright in a letter dated Friday, ``I amcertain that those differences could be quickly resolved with theassistance of your leadership.'' A copy of the letter was obtainedTuesday.   Greenspan said the legislation was of ``vital importance'' forthe ``long-term strength, stability and viability'' of the bankingsystem and of ``great importance to the public because it willresult in reduced cost and improved financial services.''   In the Senate, Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,D-Wis., said Tuesday he plans to move forward with his plan toattach the Senate banking-securities bill to an unrelated bankingbill that has already passed the House. The idea is to give theHouse a way to act without sorting out its jurisdictional snarl.   However, Proxmire has been unable to get unanimous consent fromall of the Senate's 99 other members for the move. He could proceedwithout such an agreement, but only at the risk of prolonged debateat a time when Congress is trying to adjourn.</TEXT></DOC>
