One model is based on deconvolution of experimental tracerresponse curves into a network of flowpaths connected in parallel withheat transfer calculated individually in each flowpath. The second modelis based on one-dimensional flow through the rock with a block size distributiondescribed as a group of equivalent-radius spheres for which the heattransfer equations can be solved analytically. The two-models were appliedto the planned Phase II long-term thermal drawdown experiment at FentonHill, NM. The results show good agreement between the two models, withestimates of temperature cooldown from 240{sup 0}C to 150{sup 0}C ina few years depending on selected operation parameters, but with somewhatdiffering cooldown curve characteristic shapes. Data from the long-termexperiment will be helpful in improving the two models.</TEXT></DOC>
