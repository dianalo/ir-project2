Even though their video displays and junk food havens act asmagnets for bored youngsters on hot summer afternoons, some mallmanagers said Monday that loiterers aren't welcome.   And in several cases, kids have been arrested for trespassing.   Last month, a 14-year-old was picked up while waiting for hismother at Shoppers' World in Framingham, police said. At least fourother such arrests have been made at the same mall this summer andsimilar incidents have been reported elsewhere.   Jamie LeBlanc, 15, said he and his pals frequent The WatertownMall and regularly spend money on the latest tapes and newestfashions. Lately, he said, they've repeatedly run into trouble.   ``I was sitting in Dunkin' Donuts with my friends and a coptapped his billy club on my shoulder and told me to get out,'' saidLeBlanc, who had bought a cup of coffee. ``I was just sitting theresmoking a cigarette, not bothering anyone.''   Zollo said taking a hard line on teen-age conduct could beinstant death for shopkeepers and cinema owners who rent space inmalls expressly because of the ready audience.   Every year, youngsters between the ages of 12 and 19 spend $31.3billion of their own money at shops nationwide and account for $79billion in retail business when the money their parents gives themis factored in, Zollo's research found.   Last week alone, 13 million teen-agers bought movie tickets andduring the summer nearly 65 percent of the nation's 27 millionteen-agers saw at least one feature, he said.   ``Obviously malls hold two functions for teens,'' Zollo said.``One is of a social nature and the other is shopping. They do boththere and the more time they spend, the more money they spend.''   Mall owners agreed they don't want to discourage teens fromcoming, but said they have to draw the line somewhere.   ``It's a delicate balance,'' said Henry Hudson, general managerat the South Shore Plaza in Braintree. ``The mall managers have tomaintain control in the centers for the benefit of the patrons.''   Boston police spokesman Scott Gillis said anywhere from five to15-plus officers patrol busy city shopping areas for troublemakers,especially during vacation time.   ``We tell people (loiterers) to move on and if it gets to be aproblem we lock them up for disorderly conduct,'' he said.``Nuisance-type loitering is definitely not acceptable and will notbe tolerated.''   Randy Boon, a researcher at Stillerman Jones and Co., anIndianapolis-based marketing research firm, said mall managers don'twant to see a few overactive or offensive kids discourage businessoverall.   ``It's a big thing. A lot of customers that go in tend to bescared away if there are a lot of kids hanging out who don't seem tobe doing anything,'' he said.   No one wants to see kids wreaking havoc at their local malls, buta little goofing off is to be expected, said Carolyn Kennedy,general manager at Assembly Square Mall in nearby Somerville.   ``Shopping centers are a gathering place. Kids don't have maltshops anymore,'' she said. ``They need a place to go.''</TEXT></DOC>
