Van NameandM;The earliest peripheral-sharing devices were simple A/B switches for printersthat required virtually no administration.andP;  Many of today'speripheral-sharing devices can do much more, but they are also more complexto set up and manage.andM;The first step is still the same: Connect the cables.andM;Cable technology is largely the same as it has been for years.andP;  The biggestimprovement is that many peripheral-sharing units now use modular cables thatare much like telephone wires.andP;  These modular cables come in four- andsix-wire configurations that follow the RJ-11 standard, and in eight-wireversions that follow the RJ-45 standard.andM;One end of the cable snaps into an appropriate port on the peripheral-sharingdevice.andP;  The other end typically attaches to a two-sided cable &quot;head&quot; thataccepts the cable's modular end on one side and has a standard PC connector(a DB-25 or DB-9) on the other.andM;But the installation job does not end there.andP;  The installer or administratormust also configure the peripheral-sharing device and all the PCs connectedto it.andM;To set up the peripheral-sharing unit, the administrator issues the unit aseries of commands that tell it what types of devices are attached to it andthe characteristics of each device.andP;  The administrator issues the commandsfrom one of the PCs that are connected to the peripheral-sharing unit.andM;Sending InformationandM;Administrators send these commands in one of two basic ways.andM;The first way is to use a terminal emulator on the PC to type commandsdirectly to the peripheral-sharing unit.andP;  The INCS-64 peripheral-sharingunit, from Western Telematic Inc. of Irvine, Calif., accepts commands in thisway.andP;  It recognizes such shorthand instructions as &quot;I 4&quot; (for initialize port4).andM;The information the administrator has to supply for each peripheral dependson the peripheral-sharing device, and there can be as many as two dozenparameters.andM;The other way to send configuration information is through a vendor-suppliedprogram.andP;  Such programs typically prompt the administrator for information,then pass the data to the peripheral-sharing unit.andP;  The Master Switch, fromRose Electronics Inc. of Houston, works this way.andP;  Its MSCONFIG program leadsthe administrator through a series of questions about each port on the unit,then downloads the results.andM;Setting up the peripheral-sharing device is only half the battle.andP;  Theadministrator must then configure each of the PCs connected to the unit.andM;When users want only the simplest features, configuration takes little work.andO;The administrator's only job is to set the baud rate of the PC's serial portappropriately, then redirect all print requests to that port.andP;  A pair of DOSMODE commands in the PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT file will typically suffice; manyproducts will even issue the commands automatically.andM;The configuration job gets more complex when the user wants to take advantageof a peripheral-sharing device's more complex features.andP;  The NetCommander 32,from Digital Products Inc. of Watertown, Mass., for example, lets users issueprinter-control commands from a pop-up terminate-and-stay-resident utilitythat runs on each user's PC.andP;  With this utility, users can send such detailedcommands as the font to use on a laser printer.andM;The NetCommander administrator must also set up on each PC a list of allavailable printers and the name of the default printer.andP;  A new version of theNetCommander's AutoInstall program simplifies the procedure somewhat byletting the administrator download configuration information for each PC.andM;To share modems and other peripherals, administrators typically need toinstall additional software and configure the peripheral-sharing unitappropriately.andP;  Many vendors offer advanced sub-LAN features that furthercomplicate the installation and configuration.andM;Despite the work it can require, however, setting up a peripheral-sharingdevice is still far simpler, on the whole, than configuring a LAN orminicomputer.andP;  The bulk of the work must be done only once, when theadministrator installs the product.andP;  After that, most peripheral-sharingproducts -- unlike LANs -- require little or no further administration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
