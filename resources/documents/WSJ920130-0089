The measure would ban copying.   The protection, which could be approved by EC memberstates by year end, would last for 10 years after adatabase's creation. Its application would range fromnewswires and electronic legal research services to datingnetworks. An EC official estimated the fast-growing EC marketfor electronic information will total $4.45 billion thisyear, about a third of the world-wide market.   The directive would be one of the world's mostfar-reaching. In the U.S. and Japan, where copyright lawprotects databases, pirates exploit big loopholes -- coverageof database organization but not the data itself, forexample.   Under the directive, non-EC databases would benefit fromthe extra EC protection only if their home country offered asimilar shield. This reciprocity clause could raise alarms inthe U.S., where such provisions are considered discriminatoryand a barrier to free trade.                                                                                                          JAPAN TO EXPLORE OFF VIETNAM                                                                                                          Arabian Oil Co. of Japan said its ADC Energy DevelopmentCo. unit and Taikoku Oil Co. agreed in principle to explorefor oil and natural gas off southern Vietnam. The pact withPetrovietnam, which could be completed for prospecting byyear end in a 1,000-square-mile area in the South China Sea,would mark the first time a Japanese firm exploited thatregion of Vietnam. Arabian Oil is owned 10% each by SaudiArabia and Kuwait. Vietnam's offshore oil reserves areestimated at up to three billion barrels.                                                                                                          MEXICO TO AID SMALL BUSINESS                                                                                                          Mexico's National Finance development bank will expand itslending program to encourage small and medium- sizedbusinesses. The agency hopes this year to channel $6 billionto 85,000 companies, up from $4 billion to 52,800 firms lastyear. Companies that generate new jobs may qualify for theloans.                                                                                                          MARCOS CURRENCY TO BE SCRAPPED                                                                                                          The Philippines central bank said it would demonetizepaper money printed during the late Ferdinand Marcos'sadministration. The New Society series of notes will cease tobe legal tender after Feb. 2, 1993, though they may beexchanged for valid currency until Feb. 2, 1996. The banksaid its move was a routine periodic retirement of bills andunrelated to rumors that large sums of New Society notes werebeing used by Marcos associates to fund his widow Imelda'spresidential bid. When the Marcoses fled the Philippines in1986, they took several crates of newly minted money.                                                                                                          MALE TEMPS GROW IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Men in their 20s and 30s are reversing women's dominationin Japan's temporary-employment field, reflecting a changinglife style, people in the industry said. The trend, with menaccounting for up to 70% of those registered for temporaryjobs, intensified as the domestic economy's pace slowed.Corporations reining in personnel costs have hired skilledworkers on a part-time basis. And young people increasinglyaren't seeking lifetime employment in Japan.
