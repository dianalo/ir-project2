ShererandM;BOSTON -- Microsoft Corp. opened the doors to its language-development labslast week, providing a glimpse at a long-term game plan to add improvedoptimization and object-oriented programming capabilities to its line oftools.andM;Without providing specific detail, Microsoft officials discussed, at a pressbriefing here, a strategic direction for its language family, emphasizingplans for advanced code optimization, greater use of DOS extenders andincreasingly sophisticated, integrated development environments.andP;  Companyofficials also hinted at key features slated for a forthcoming C++ compilerand future C, C++ and FORTRAN offerings for the 386 and 486.andM;&quot;This is the vision for the next couple of years,&quot; said Fred Gray, generalmanager of languages at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash.andM;In the near-term, users said Microsoft should focus its efforts on deliveringits C++ compiler.andP;  &quot;They have to establish themselves in that environmentquickly, because other tools are beginning to gain ground, like Borland'sTurbo C++,&quot; said Kirk Hurford, a partner at consulting firm Lucas ValleyTechnologies in San Rafael, Calif.andM;To endow its languages and operating systems with object-orientedcapabilities, Microsoft is embracing a conceptual model known as theMicrosoft Common Object Model.andP;  This defines a series of object managers thatwill be built into languages, applications and operating systems, said MartinO'Riordan, project leader for Microsoft C++.andM;These object managers control how objects, such as pieces of data, documentsor application components, are manipulated.andP;  Without specifying a time frame,O'Riordan said the object managers will first appear in Microsoft's C++compiler, which will include a &quot;run-time object manager&quot; that representsobjects at the machine level.andM;Another component of the model is an &quot;abstract object manager,&quot; anapplication programming interface that will handle the creation andmanipulation of objects generated by languages or applications.andM;The third component, the &quot;system object manager,&quot; will be built into theoperating system and will retrieve objects from local files and memory, andfrom files and memory across networks.andP;  These object managers will surface infuture versions of OS/2 and Windows, O'Riordan said.andM;While Microsoft gave a cursory peek at its object-oriented plans, it wasforthcoming about future code-optimization techniques.andM;The current C 6.0 optimizes code across an entire procedure, but Microsoft isworking on ways to optimize code across multiple procedures, officials said.andO;Microsoft is also working to let its compilers automatically pass parametersin registers, they added.andM;To help developers manage code in large applications and to allow greaterintegration of third-party tools, Microsoft will expand its integrateddevelopment environment to store low-level program information in anobject-oriented database.andM;&quot;I agree that the way to do things intelligently in the long term may be withan object database, but they've got a long way to go to get to that point,&quot;said Bill Morton, a manager of development at software consulting firmComputer Sciences Corp. in El Segundo, Calif.andM;In the more immediate future, Microsoft will upgrade its C compiler tosupport 386- and 486-specific development.andP;  This will appear in concert withthe introduction of Microsoft's 386-based OS/2 version 2.0, which Microsoftplans to deliver by the end of this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
