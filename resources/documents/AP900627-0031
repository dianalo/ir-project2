Testifying Tuesday before a House Government Operationssubcommittee, retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. said thegovernment's attitude casts doubt on how honestly it is dealingwith dioxin exposure in the environment.   Agent Orange, used in highly concentrated form to remove cropsand enemy cover, was contaminated during its manufacture withdioxin, an unwanted byproduct that the Environmental ProtectionAgency considers to be a probable cause of cancer.   The federal Centers for Disease Control, however, says it cannotstudy the health effects of Agent Orange exposure on veteransbecause it is impossible to determine reliably who was exposed whenjungles were sprayed to deprive enemy troops of cover.   Veterans groups contend that military records can match sprayingactivities with troop movements. Agent Orange   Zumwalt, who commanded naval forces in Vietnam, reported toVeterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski in May that thegovernment and industry ``intentionally manipulated or withheldcompelling information on the adverse health effects'' associatedwith exposure to the ingredients of Agent Orange.   Key among those ingredients is dioxin, although scientists atTuesday's hearing said other contaminants may also be blamed forcancers, birth defects and other afflictions.   ``... The flawed scientific studies and manipulated conclusionsare not only unduly denying justice to Vietnam veterans sufferingfrom exposure to Agent Orange, they are now standing in the way ofa full disclosure to the American people of the likely healtheffects of exposure to toxic dioxins,'' said Zumwalt.   He reiterated charges by outside scientists that two influentialindustry-sponsored studies on plant accidents used fraudulent data,and that scientists refuse to use animal data clearly showing aconnection between dioxin exposure and disease.   ``While dioxin apologists concede dioxin's carcinogenic effectson animals, they insist that humanity has a miraculous dispensationfrom the harmful effects dioxin wreaks on other species of theanimal kingdom,'' he said.   Derwinski retained Zumwalt last fall as an unpaid adviser tohelp resolve the Agent Orange question, which has been debated fortwo decades.   Since Derwinski took over last year as head of the VeteransAffairs Department, compensation to veterans has begun.   Without stating outright that Agent Orange exposure was thecause, the VA has decided to compensate the few thousand veteranswith non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcomas, both rareforms of cancer.   Zumwalt said in his report May 5 to Derwinski that based on hisreview of scientific literature, those two cancers and 25 otherafflictions should be considered to be linked to Agent Orange.   Derwinski chose Zumwalt because of his unique position. As acommander, he ordered the herbicide to be used. Among those servingin Vietnam at the time were Zumwalt's son Elmo, who later died ofHodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.   Other witnesses said Tuesday that more attention needs to befocused on both key ingredients of Agent Orange, not just the one,2,4,5-T, that was contaminated with dioxin.   They said the other ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers andother ailments linked to Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-Dwas also contaminated with harmful compounds, some related todioxin, they said.   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter tokill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weedsin corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.   The farm-chemical industry believes further research into 2,4-Dis needed, but the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates therisk of harm is relatively small if it exists at all, industryspokesman Garry Hamlin said in a telephone interview fromIndianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
