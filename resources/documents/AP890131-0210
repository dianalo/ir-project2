Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a statement introducing agovernment policy document, called the plan the ``most far-reachingreform of the National Health Service in its 40-year history.''   The opposition Labor Party, which introduced free health careafter World War II, accused her Conservative government of settingout to wreck the system.   The changes will be drafted later as a parliamentary bill that isassured of passage by the Conservative-dominated Parliament. Theyare expected to be in operation within the next three years.   The plan was seen by some as an attempt to borrow from theAmerican health system, with its emphasis on private care, withoutincreasing spending.   ``In other words, excellent care, eventually, for perhaps as muchas three-tenths of the population, but deteriorating health care forthe remainder,'' said Dr. David Owen, a physician who leads thecentrist Social Democratic Party.   Government officials said the reforms would streamline the healthbureaucracy and give the public wider choice, while denying no oneaccess to free treatment.   It was a ``change of pace, rather than a change of direction,''said Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke.   ``The National Health Service is and must remain open to allregardless of income, financed mainly out of general taxation,'' hetold the House of Commons.   Under the plan, the 320 biggest and most sophisticated of the2,000 state-run hospitals in Britain can become self-governing in1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing localauthorities for the others.   Breaking another post-war tradition, the self-governing hospitalswill charge patients for extras such as choice of meals, privatetelephones or television.   For the first time, too, private health insurance for theelderly, who are the biggest burden on the state system, will betax-deductible. Allowing the state-run hospitals to take infee-paying patients also will have the effect of boosting privatehealth insurance.   Self-governing hospitals will be able to attract higher qualitystaff, from consultants to cleaners, by setting their own pay scales.   Other changes planned over three years include fining generalpractitioners who resort too readily to prescibing medicines.   Family doctors with big practices will get separate state budgetsto buy drugs and hospital treatment from private, state orself-governing hospitals for elective surgery. They will be allowedto keep half of any savings on the drugs budget.   Consultants and general practitioners will have their costsindependently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged tocompete for patients.   Labor's parliamentary spokesman on health, Robin Cook, said theplan was the work ``of people who will always put a healthy balancesheet before healthy patients.''   Left-wing health workers' unions were outraged.   Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the biggest health union _ theNational Union of Public Service Employees _ described the proposalsas a ``cynical charter'' to replace the NHS with ``a commercialcircus.''   ``Treatment will be price-tagged, leaving the poor, thechronically sick and the elderly out in the cold. Sick people willbe shunted round the country in a scramble for the cheapest care,''said Bickerstaffe.   The National Health Service, which with a staff of 1 million issecond only to the Soviet army as the biggest employer in Europe,has been a major frustration for Mrs. Thatcher since she won powerin 1979.   Mrs. Thatcher insists on her right to private health treatment``at the time I want and with the doctor I want.'' She argues it ispointless to throw more money at the National Health Service withoutincreasing its efficiency.   The service, used by 90 percent of the population, is popularwith voters and Mrs. Thatcher has held back from exposing it to herstrategy of rolling back the frontiers of socialism.   Instead, spending has increased in real terms by nearly one-thirdsince 1979 to $38.7 billion a year.   But the enduring public image is of a system subjected to budgetcuts by the Thatcher administration in which children die waitingfor heart surgery.   Waiting lists persist partly because demand is limitless andtreatment ever-more expensive and sophisticated. Britain spends 6percent of gross national product on health, compared with anaverage of 9 percent in other industrialized countries.   The service is funded out of general taxes and a compulsory 10percent deduction for health and state pension contributions fromeach employee's salary, which employers have to match.</TEXT></DOC>
