The capacitor uses the powdered activated carbon or the activatedcarbon fiber as solid and the organic electrolytes as liquid. When electriccurrent is on to the electric double layers under the condition keptin contact with the activated carbon and the organic electrolytes, thecharge is accumulated. Using phenol system activated carbon fibers, thecapacitors with average pore diameter of 2-5nm and specific surface of1500-3000m{sup 2}/g were fabricated and the features were investigated.As the results, the capacitors indicated superior characteristics asthe polarization electrodes of the electric double layer capacitor. Especially,the pore distribution, the specific surface, the fiber strength and theelectric dust collection character of the activated carbon fibers hadgreat effect on the capacitors characteristics. And it was confirmedthat the capacitors used phenol system activated carbon fibers as thepolarization electrodes indicated the most superior characteristics.(26 figs, 8 tabs, 37 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
