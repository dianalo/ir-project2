She watched the movie instead.   ``It only took me three hours to watch the movie and it wouldhave taken me 12 hours to read the book,'' said the ninth-graderfrom Ventura, Calif.   Her father, Jim, owner of Salzer's Video Store and a boardmember of the Video Softwares Dealers Association, is familiar withthe situation.   ``It's a problem,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``A kidessentially can rent a classic movie and do a book report from it.Kids are taking shortcuts.''   Videotape retailers across the nation say many teen-agers,children of the television generation, are taking study guides thatsummarize literature one step further and turning to videotapes forhelp with homework, renting rather than reading.   Tiffany said her teachers sometimes show movies in class, butonly after students presumably have read the correspondingliterature. She said she watched ``Clan of the Cave Bear'' thenight before a report on the book was due.   ``The teachers say the movie is different. Sometimes it is, butstudents don't really care,'' she said. ``It's better to get a `C'than an `F.'''   At parents' requests, Art Marra pulled ``To Kill A Mockingbird''from the shelves at his HTO Video store in suburban Pittsburghafter students were assigned to read the book.   Since then, Marra periodically has refused to rent certainvideotapes to youths because he learned the corresponding bookswere homework assignments.   ``We're a community-oriented shop. We try to give the communityany cooperation we can,'' Marra said.   Mike Petraglia noticed young people make sporadic runs oncertain films at his Video-O-Video store in Pittsburgh. He said apopular videotape among teens is ``Dirty Dancing,'' but whenassignments dictate, he can't find enough copies of ``Death of aSalesman,'' ``Treasure Island,'' ``Grapes of Wrath'' and ``BillyBudd.''   ```Gone With the Wind' has been picking up a little bit. I thinkit's book-related,'' he said.   Students always have searched for the easier way, and the videoscholar is just a variation of the Cliff Notes customer, said ScottTreibitz, spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers, basedin Washington, D.C.   For 29 years, students have used Cliff Notes to providesummaries and analysis of books, and sales of the study guidesstill are growing, said Doug Lincoln, spokesman for Cliff NotesInc. of Lincoln, Neb.   ``The problem now is with the access of video cassette recordersand with the access of video stores,'' Treibitz said.   Lincoln said Cliff Notes may produce its own videotapes, but hedeclined to discuss details.   ``The generation that is in elementary school now, they'recertainly in the video age,'' Lincoln said. ``I would have to saythe (use) of video will probably only increase.''   Teachers are increasingly using videotapes in the classroom, andas a supplement the tapes are helpful, said Judi Boren, spokeswomanfor the North Allegheny County School District in suburbanPittsburgh.   ``You can't use the video as a Cliff Note kind of crutch,'' Ms.Boren said. ``There's a saying, `I read the book. I don't need tosee the movie.' If you make some comparisons, maybe you need to doboth.''   ``A teacher can give a lecture on the Grand Canyon, NiagaraFalls, space exploration,'' Treibitz said. ``A video not only givesthat same material, but shows the visuals to reinforce thatmaterial.   ``It can't replace reading, it can't replace writing and thereare times it can't replace the lecture,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
