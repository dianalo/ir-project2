Moody's said it downgraded Masco's rating becauseof high debt levels and modest interest coverage, in partbecause of the debt of its Masco Industries affiliate. Also,Masco has spent about $2 billion on the acquisition andintegration of its home-furnishing operations since 1986,Moody's said. The rating service said the company's expansionhas kept debt levels high both at Masco Corp. and 49%-ownedMasco Industries. Debt-protection measurements have weakenedbecause of reduced earnings, Moody's said. Masco's earningsin the first quarter were $69.8 million, or 45 cents a share,down 7.4% from $75.4 million, or 48 cents a share, a yearago. Masco, a Taylor, Mich., maker of building and homefurnishings, declined to comment.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
