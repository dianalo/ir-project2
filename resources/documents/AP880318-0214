Baker III to head a working group to coordinaterecommendations for altering the government's regulation offinancial markets.   The group was appointed under a presidential order afterNicholas F. Brady, head of Reagan's task force on the Oct. 19 stockmarket crash, told Congress on Thursday that a repeat of that eventcould occur unless the government's regulatory authorities are putunder one roof.   Brady's commission earlier had called for making the FederalReserve Board a ``super regulator'' with authority over both theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities FuturesTrading Commission in regulating financial markets.   But that idea has been rejected by the heads of all threeagencies.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he doesn't wantthe added authority. And a turf fight has erupted between SECChairman David Ruder and the CFTC's new chairwoman, Wendy Gramm,over which agency should regulate stock index futures.   The SEC has blamed trading in stock index futures for worseningthe October crash, which saw the Dow Jones average of 30 industrialstocks fall more than 500 points in one day.   Ruder has suggested that regulation of trading in index futuresbe transferred from the CFTC to his agency, an idea opposed by bothGramm and Brady.   Commodity exchanges where the futures are traded and the CFTChave maintained that activity on the index futures markets Oct. 19had no affect on the severity of the collapse in stock prices.   Named with Baker to the working group were Greenspan, Ruder andGramm plus the five other governors now on the Federal Reserve'sboard and four other members each from the SEC and CFTC.   Reagan gave the group 60 days to report back to him on anyprogress in ironing out their differences and coming up withrecommended legislation.   ``The goals are two-fold,'' said White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater. ``First, to ensure the continued integrity,competitiveness and efficiency of our nation's financial marketsand, second, to maintain the public's confidence in those markets.''   Specifically, the panel was told to look at the desirability ofa ``tie-breaking referee'' with emergency powers and more formalinter-maket coordination and cooperation mechanisms among the threeagencies.   It also was told to examine the adequacy of private sectorcapital for futures floor traders, market makers and broker-dealersand whether margin requirements need to be strengthened and``harmonized.''   Other issues the panel was told to explore include thedesirability of simultaneous trading halts in all markets to cleartransactions, imposition of price limits on stocks, index futuresand options, emergency measures to restrict large, rapidliquidations and revising equity short-sale rules.   ``None of them is simple,'' Fitzwater said of the issues, `and,while deserving high priority, may not be resolved quickly orwithout considerable reflection.''</TEXT></DOC>
