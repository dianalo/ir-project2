Complaints about covert action fall into two broad categories. Some critics argue that it is inconsistent with American values; others, including former CIA director Stansfield Turner, contend that it usually accomplishes little and often backfires. Harvard lecturer Gregory Treverton notes in his new book, &quot;Covert Action,&quot; that some idealists believe &quot;even the 'successes' of covert action seem ambiguous or transitory in retrospect, {and are} accomplished at some cost to what we hold dear as a people and to America's image in the world.&quot;    But if the administration's covert operations in Iran and Nicaragua have been embarrassing flops, in Afghanistan one of the largest secret wars in American history helped prompt Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to declare last week: &quot;We want to bring our boys home as soon as possible.&quot; The CIA's success there suggests that if expecting too much of covert operations is foolish, so is writing all of them off as quixotic or immoral.    At first glance, the reverse results of the CIA's secret wars in Afghanistan and Nicaragua defy logic. The Afghan rebels are pressuring 115,000 Soviet troops to pull out of an adjacent &quot;socialist&quot; country that's of little strategic importance to the U.S. The Nicaraguan Contras are nowhere near unseating the Soviet-backed regime in Nicaragua, a country of little consequence to Moscow but not far, in this day and age, from America's border.    Nor are the Afghans more congenial to the U.S. than the Contras. Indeed, despite the survivors of the fallen Somoza dictatorship in the Contras' ranks, their blemished human rights record, and their critics' charges that some of them have been running drugs, the Nicaraguan insurgents are more amicable to America than the Afghan mujahedeen, many of whom are strangers to the Geneva Conventions and friends of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Yet the Afghans are popular on Capitol Hill and the Contras aren't.    Why, then, have the Afghans succeeded where the Contras have failed?    First and perhaps foremost, the Afghans are simply better warriors than the Nicaraguans and their courage against long odds has inspired support not only from the U.S., but from Pakistan, China, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Second, the Afghans are fighting a Soviet occupying force that invaded their country; the Contras are fighting to oust a revolutionary government that, although it has broken many of its promises, was swept into power with broad popular and regional support. It is easier to argue that the Soviets should be driven from Kabul than the Sandinistas from Managua.    But perhaps the fundamental difference between the Contras and the mujahedeenand the one that is most instructive -- is that no one doubts the Afghans would fight on even if the U.S. cut them off. The Reagan administration concedes that the Contras, on the other hand, cannot survive without American military, economic, and political support. The lesson is that the U.S. can't create the will to win, but Washington can successfully support such commitment when it finds it.    Paradoxically, the Afghans' fierce independence and even their hostility to the West are regarded as assets, proof that they aren't simply tools of the CIA. The managers of the agency's Afghan program have tolerated the feuding and the anti-Western sentiments of the mujahedeen groups, but in Central America the CIA spent two years vainly trying to force the unpredictable former Sandinista leader Eden Pastora to throw in with the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Democratic Force.    But the U.S. objectives are what most distinguish the successful Afghan operation from the unsuccessful Nicaraguan one. Despite years of rhetoric about interdicting Nicaraguan arms shipments to El Salvador and promoting a negotiated settlement, the aim of the secret war in Nicaragua has always been to oust the Sandinistas. In Afghanistan, the U.S. objective originally was simply to make the Russians pay for invading Afghanistan; today, its goal is to force the Soviets out, not to create a proWestern Afghanistan.    One of the essential requirements for a successful covert operation is knowing when to cash it in for a reasonable payoff. In Nicaragua, the administration ignored every opportunity to trade its support for the Contras for assurances that the Sandinistas would stop exporting their revolution. In Afghanistan, where it is willing to settle for a Soviet withdrawal and guarantees of neutrality, the Reagan administration finally may have something to show for its fascination with covert action. </TEXT></DOC>
