The turf battles may be costing the U.S. banking industrybillions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Banks are probably missing about $12 billion in revenuesthat they could be earning if all potential private bankingcustomers now at the branch level were moved into affiliatedprivate banks,&quot; says John DeMarco, senior vice president atPSI, a Tampa, Fla., market research concern.   The shortfall is particularly glaring at a time when manybanks, credit-wary from the worst crisis to sweep theindustry since the 1920s, struggle to develop stronger salescultures that will allow them to rely more on fee-basedservices in the 1990s.   Those banks that break down internal barriers and turntheir retail branches into gathering machines to feed themost profitable parts of the bank will leap ahead of theircompetitors in the coming decade, consultants say.   Many private banking divisions have had a standing policyof not stepping on their colleagues' toes to get newaccounts. But bankers are realizing that if they don't offerwealthy retail bank clients private banking services,including money management, trust services, large personalloans and specialized brokerage services, some other bankwill.   &quot;The best source of new business is old clients,&quot; saysMichael M. Cassell, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. executivevice president of private banking. Branch referrals areincreasing at the bank partly because the private bank wasgrouped together with the retail bank and three other bankinggroups in a reorganization last year, he says. Since then,the heads of all the banking groups have breakfast togetheronce a week to swap ideas, the result of a concerted effortby top management to create more of a flow of business acrossdepartmental lines.   While there is no cash reward or specialrevenue-allocation system in place to encourage the retailbranches, Mr. Cassell says referrals are remarked upon at asenior level and could lead to &quot;enhanced compensation&quot; andcareer advancement for the employee involved.   Cleveland's Ameritrust is implementing a new incentiveprogram in which any employee who refers an account to theprivate bank will receive a percentage of the first-yearrevenue generated by the account at the private bank level.   The branch, too, will receive a cash award that shouldcompensate it for the revenue lost in giving up the account.   While optimistic, Charles Berkey, head of Ameritrust'sprivate banking division, admits that the program is&quot;imperfect.&quot; Branch managers are only compensated for oneyear of lost deposits, while the private bank will go onearning money on the account indefinitely.   Nevertheless, Ameritrust is ahead of most other banks withits incentive program. Few other banks offer regular cashincentives for referrals at all. If they do, it is usually asmaller amount offered as part of a limited promotion; $100is typical. Bankers are wary of offering more.   &quot;You don't want {the branch manager} spending time tryingto sell private banking customers and have the teller line goto hell,&quot; says David Officer, a former private banker who isnow executive vice president at Boston Co., a moneymanagement firm.   Chase Manhattan's private banking chief James Zeigon sayshis group tries to avoid the problem altogether simply byleaving the account at the branch when possible while sellingthe client added services from the private bank.   But at most banks, cross-selling of banking products is onthe decline. Barry Leeds andamp; Associates sent &quot;mystery shoppers&quot;into 300 banks and thrifts around the country last year toconduct more than 25,000 transactions in order to assess thecurrent state of banking services. The survey found thatcustomer-service representatives tried selling products orservices other than those requested by the customer only halfof the time, down from 60% of the time in 1988.   Yet, the typical affluent household generating $1,000 inannual revenue at a retail bank will spend $5,000 a year ormore as a private banking client receiving investment advice,trust management and jumbo loans, says David Ross Palmer, aprivate banking consultant based in New York. He adds that 3%of the households doing business at most retail banks earn$100,000 or more a year and have a net worth of at least$500,000 each, excluding their homes.   The challenge is convincing branch managers to serve upaccounts that count toward their performance and prestige.&quot;There is a feeling of `why should I help this guy walkingaround in suspenders and a Hermes tie, while I'm down in thetrenches?'&quot; says Boston Co.'s Mr. Officer.   &quot;Shadow accounting,&quot; or keeping two sets of books, is theapproach some banks take to convince branch managers theywon't be hurt by giving up a plum account. The accountbalance remains on the branch's books, even though thedeposits are moved to the private bank. The double countingis washed out at some point further down the accountingstream.   Branch managers complain, however, that the system isoften full of holes. They note that the private banker canfail to enter new balances into the shadow accounting system,something the branch manager can only discover by chance.   But mining the bank's client base is also cheaper andeasier than prospecting for new business among the accountsof rival banks. And bankers say losses are likely to be lowerif loan decisions can be based on a longer credit historywith the bank. Indeed, many private banks that made unsecuredloans to win customers in the 1980s were left holding the bagwhen times turned tough.   Retail branches, however, can be too conservative when itcomes to wealthy clients, say consultants. Mr. Palmer tellsof a wealthy California produce farmer who, after years as acustomer at one large local bank, wanted to borrow severalhundred thousand dollars to set his sons up in business. Hislocal branch wouldn't make the loan and failed to refer himto the bank's private bankers, who probably would have loanedthe money gladly.   The farmer turned to the private bankers at a cross-townbank for the loan, and now does all of his business there.Few banks track this sort of customer attrition, but bankersconcede that such cases aren't rare.</TEXT></DOC>
