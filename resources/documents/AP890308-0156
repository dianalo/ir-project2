Bennett'sspokesman, Don Hamilton, said Wednesday. ``He's not too upset aboutit.''   In fact, Bennett met Wednesday with National Rifle Associationrepresentatives, a meeting that had been scheduled before Bushannounced Tuesday that he had asked his designated drug policydirector to find a solution to the weapons problem, Hamilton said.   It's not clear whether Bennett will incorporate hisrecommendations into the national drug control strategy due 180 daysafter he is confirmed as director of national drug control policy orif he will issue a separate recommendation, Hamilton said.   Asked Wednesday what Bennett and the NRA representatives werediscussing, Hamilton said, ``I think he's seeking input and advice.I'm rather confident he has not made up his mind.   ``He's interested in seeing that firepower out of the wronghands,'' Hamilton said. ``He's concerned with the problem and he'dlike to seek a solution that's consonant with the Constitution andindividuals' rights concerning firearms. But he doesn't want to seethat firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys.''   The Senate Judiciary Committee, which held two days of hearingson Bennett's nomination last week, is scheduled to vote on itThursday. There was little opposition raised during the hearings andhe was expected to be approved by the committee, then approved bythe full Senate, possibly as soon as Friday.   The weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of AK-47sand Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can switch backand forth from semiautomatic to automatic.   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of fiveCalifornia schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on theweapons with high-capacity ammunition clips. Bush, a member of theNRA, has said he opposes such regulation, while first lady BarbaraBush supports a ban.</TEXT></DOC>
