He compared Kingston to Pittsburgh Penguins Coach Bob Johnson,a former college coach who guided the Calgary Flames to a 193-155-52 recordfrom the 1982-83 season through the 1986-87 season.;    The Sharks luredKingston from Norway, where he had coached the national team for the past twoseasons. He earlier spent 15 seasons as coach at the University of Calgary.;   &quot;Bob went to Calgary with no NHL experience,&quot; Ferreira said. &quot;They're bothteachers and they're guys who are patient.&quot;;    Details of Kingston's deal,signed Friday, weren't revealed, but co-owner George Gund confirmed it was forat least three years. Sources said they would be surprised if it was for lessthan four, considering Ferreira signed Pierre Page (now the general manager ofthe Quebec Nordiques) to a reported four-year contract with the MinnesotaNorth Stars in 1988, when Ferreira was the G.M. there.;    The same sourcessaid Kingston probably will earn less than the average annual salary for anNHL coach, which is about $200,000.;    The Sharks debut in the NHL nextseason, and Kingston said his first priority is to work with Ferreira toselect assistant coaches. Kingston said he will hire two general assistants,plus a goalie coach and a strength coach. Kingston wouldn't reveal candidatesfor the positions but indicated that Bob Murdoch, fired recently by theWinnipeg Jets, might be considered.;    Kingston worked for Ferreira duringthe 1988-89 season as an assistant coach at Minnesota. And Ferreira said healways has been impressed by Kingston's ability to teach.;    &quot;There isn't apro athlete anywhere who doesn't want to get better,&quot; Ferreira said. &quot;Youcan't fool players. It doesn't take long for them to know who's going to makethem better.&quot;;    Ferreira said he visited extensively with Calgary GeneralManager Cliff Fletcher and New York Islanders G.M. Bill Torrey to get theiradvice about what qualities would be most important for a coach of anexpansion franchise. Fletcher and Torrey have been with their teams since theyjoined the league as expansion franchises in 1972. Fletcher's teams have wonthe Stanley Cup once and the Islanders have won it four times.;    &quot;What keptcoming back was that we needed someone with experience who was a teacher,&quot;Ferreira said.;    Kingston has worked mostly with young players. But despitehis lack of NHL experience, Kingston said he feels qualified for the job.;   &quot;I think I have the ability to communicate well with players, and I feel I canwork with people, period,&quot; he said.;    Because most of their players will beyoung, the Sharks will have to concentrate on defense at first, Kingstonsaid.;    &quot;That's the one aspect you can control a little,&quot; he said. &quot;If youlook at the successful teams in all sports, aggressive defense is a key.&quot;;   Kingston has said he believes it will take five to seven years to turn anexpansion team such as the Sharks into a Stanley Cup contender.;    &quot;We aren'tkidding anybody,&quot; he said. &quot;We're going to have to walk before we run, and weknow there are going to be some tough nights here. But if we can develop aconsistency of effort, I think that will take us through those nights.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE WEAVER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910413  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  611  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 13, 199100104161,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
