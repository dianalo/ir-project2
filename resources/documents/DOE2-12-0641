The guidance is specifically intended to providethe fundamental approach necessary to meet the performance assessmentrequirements. The document is written for LLW facility operators or otherpersonnel who will manage the performance assessment task. The documentis meant to provide guidance for conducting performance assessments ina generally consistent manner at all DOE LLW disposal facilities. Theguidance includes a summary of performance objectives to be met by LLWdisposal facilities (these objectives are derived from current DOE andother applicable federal regulatory guidelines); specific criteria foran adequate performance assessment and from which a minimum set of requiredcalculations may be determined; recommendations of methods for screeningcritical components of the analysis system so that these components canbe addressed in detail; recommendations for the selection of existingmodels and the development of site-specific models; recommendations oftechniques for comparison of assessment results with performance objectives;and a summary of reporting requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
