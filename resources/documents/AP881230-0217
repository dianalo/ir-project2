Consumers and businesses generally saw short-term interest ratessoar while longer-term rates were little changed from the previousyear, a mixed blessing for both groups.   As a result, the so-called yield curve, which illustrates thedifference between short- and long rates in the bond market, took anunusual turn in 1988. First it flattened from the normal upwardslope, then started to invert for the first time in about six years.   ``I think if you were to try to isolate one key factor of the1988 fixed-income environment it was the pronounced flattening ofthe yield curve,'' said William V. Sullivan, director ofmoney-market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   On the last day of trading in 1988, for instance, the yield onthe one-year Treasury bill was slightly higher than that of thebellwether 30-year bond, 9.00 percent vs. 8.98 percent. The3-month-bill yield was still 0.64 percentage points lower than thelong bond, although normally the gap is around 2 percentage points.   Long-term rates usually are significantly higher to compensateinvestors for their increased risk. (For instance, it's more likelythat someone will renege on a 30-year debt than on one lasting threemonths.)   The last time the yield curve inverted, the stock market took atumble and the nation headed into a recession.   Few economists, though, are predicting a similar scenario for1989. In fact, it was fears of the opposite occurring that pushedshort-term rates as high as they are now.   ``The short-end rise (in rates) came from the Fed tightening,''said Sullivan.   At the start of 1988, the Federal Reserve eased its creditpolicies by keeping interest rates down, out of near-universalconcern the country was close to a recession from the previousOctober's stock market crash.   But the economy showed surprising resilience. The Fed thenstarted to worry about rising inflation, along with an unstabledollar in foreign exchange, and switched gears by tightening credit.   Inflation actually remained in check throughout the year, whichis partly why long-term interest rates and prices remained fairlystable, economists said.   The central bank took its biggest inflation-fighting stand inAugust, when it raised the discount rate, the interest charged onloans to member banks, a half percentage point to 6.5 percent. Otherindirect movements have been made known since.   Commercial lending rates followed suit. Major banks lowered theirprime lending rates _ used to set rates on most corporate andconsumer loans _ a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent onFeb. 2, then raised them a half percentage point four times to 10.5percent by year's end.   There was a similar pattern for mortgage rates. For aconventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rates ranged from a low of9.84 percent in mid-February to a high of 10.77 percent at year'send, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   The interest rate climate didn't have too much effect on thevolume of municipal and corporate issues.   For the year, the volume of municipal issues totaled around $112billion, compared with $101.5 billion in 1987. The volume ofcorporate issues rose to around $275 billion from $272.19 billion.   Many economists predict that rates will continue to rise duringthe first half of 1989, with the 30-year Treasury bond yielding asmuch as 9.5 percent. It was as low as 8.29 percent in February andas high as 9.45 in August.   During the second half, interest rates should decline as theeconomy starts to cool down, economists predict.   ``We expect Fed policy next year to be driven primarily byinflation and inflation expectations,'' said Elliott Platt, aneconomist with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Corp.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 31-Jan. 1</NOTE></DOC>
