They had argued about a girl. Now, a crowd gathersas Jermaine flicks insults at Judonne.   Suddenly, Judonne pulls out a gun and shoots Jermainethree times in the chest.</LP><TEXT>   The dead boy is 15. The shooter is 14. They had been bestfriends.   Appalling as this brutal event was, even more appalling isthat it only attracted attention here because, through achance encounter several years ago, Jermaine had beenbefriended by this city's police chief. But the chief soonleft office, and the streets reclaimed Jermaine.   His death is part of an ominous new escalation in the waveof black juvenile violence in Washington and other bigcities. The victims and assailants are getting younger, thefatal disputes even more trivial. Drugs, though ubiquitous inthe backdrop, don't figure directly in much of the bloodshed.&quot;We now see senseless violence for the sake of violence,&quot;says Washington's U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens. Killings breedmore killings. Death becomes normal, people numb to the wasteof life.   Most young victims, absent any local celebrity, go toburial anonymously. On a warm late-winter evening, more than100 people gather in the Fairlawn neighborhood of southeastWashington to mark the death of Michael Hilliard, 16, who wasshot in the back of the head while walking away from anargument at an afternoon basketball game. Michael's twobrothers slump on a funeral-home couch weeping miserably. Butotherwise the scene is like a church bake sale or a bingonight: people gossiping or nodding to each other blankly,looking bored; little children racing in circles, performingkung-fu kicks.   Standing outside after paying his respects, a policeofficer who knows the family says, &quot;There's no sense ofanything special happening. Another 16-year-old bites thedust.&quot;   At Shaed Elementary here, children are being taught&quot;non-violent conflict resolution&quot; in special classes led by ateam from the Washington Hospital Center. But it's an uphillstruggle: When one class of 10- and 11-year-olds is asked howmany know someone who has been killed, 14 of the 18 studentsraise their hands and volunteer the circumstances. Brian, achunky extrovert in the front row, tells of the death ofAkim, 18: &quot;They shot him.&quot; Why? &quot;Over a radio.&quot;   In the back of the class, Philip, skinny and shy, nods andwhispers, &quot;I saw a boy shot for his sneakers.&quot;   &quot;Values have changed,&quot; says Daniel Austin, a teacher atthe school. &quot;Parents send kids to school and say, `Hit back.'. . . No one just walks away. They fight it out, shoot itout.&quot;   Why do kids shoot rather than punch or kick? &quot;Just beatingsomeone doesn't get it any more,&quot; says Keisha, a 16-year-oldhigh-school sophomore. &quot;Times change. Kids are not satisfiedwith doing a beating. They want to end it.&quot;   This is far from just a drug problem. Juveniledrug-offense arrests in Washington have declined for twoyears, while the percentage of all teen-agers arrested whotest positive for drug use has also dropped. Yet recordnumbers of people 17 or younger have been arrested on murderor weapons charges. In the three years from 1986 through1988, 43 juveniles were arrested for homicide. In just thepast two years, 1989 and 1990, police arrested 129 juvenilesfor homicide.   The U.S. reported this month that a black male, age 15 to19, is almost three times more likely to die from a shootingthan from illness. A white teen-ager is 11% more likely todie from a bullet than a disease.   Broken homes and easy access to guns have existed for along time without the current degree of slaughter. &quot;In thistown, the weapons have always been out there; it's thebehavior of the young people that's changed,&quot; says MauriceTurner, the former police chief who tried to help JermaineDaniel.   A neighborhood such as northeast Washington's Edgewoodsection, where Jermaine Daniel lived and died, provides awindow on the mayhem.   The Edgewood Terrace Apartments, a mixture of public andprivate housing, sprawl across eight acres at the foot of agently sloping hill. Less than a mile away, college students,most of them white, stroll to classes on the well-tendedcampus of Catholic University.   The project, opened in the early 1970s, was to be a modelof how to mix working-class tenants with the poor, usingstrict screening of applicants to keep out malingerers andcriminals. The experiment worked briefly. But soon themanagement, trying to keep apartments occupied and governmentsubsidies flowing, became less choosy about tenants and lessscrupulous about maintenance.   In the years since, much of the complex has deteriorated.Plywood boards cover windows in abandoned units that stink ofbacked-up sewage. Broken glass glitters on empty basketballcourts; the bent backboards have no rims. Green-black waterfills the bottom few feet of a swimming pool that hasn't beenused for 10 years.   The crack of gunfire surprises no one. Roughly threepeople get killed every two weeks in the square-mile areathat includes the project, according to police. Most of theshootings, like most of the other crimes, are committed bypeople younger than 20, police say, and the average age keepsdropping.   Leaders of the Edgewood Community Coalition, a nascentgroup struggling to restore order and hope to the area,explain the lethal gunplay as a product of poverty and pooreducation and lack of jobs and role models. But the sheernumber of bullets flying also seems linked to a pervasivedevaluation of human life.   &quot;Almost any night you hear the guns,&quot; says VirginiaMatthews, a coalition member who lives in one of a row ofmodest single-family houses across Edgewood Street from theproject. Hunched nervously on her sofa, the 81-year-oldretired school teacher says: &quot;The other night, I heard 13shots in a row. I sat here and counted them.&quot; Neighbors onboth sides have had bullets smash through their front doors.Shots shattered the upstairs bedroom window of a house up thestreet.   Within the Edgewood Terrace compound, teen-agers, mostlyboys, lounge in small groups, often attended by youngerhangers-on. &quot;Our biggest problem with the youth is absence ofsupervision,&quot; says Clifton Johnson, another coalition member.&quot;Either there's a single parent working, or the parents don'tcare, or they care but just can't control&quot; their children.The coalition is trying to launch an after-school program,but so far the teen-agers are staying away.   Jermaine Daniel and Judonne Cole were rising through theranks in this loosely organized army of young people.Jermaine, a gregarious, chubby-cheeked boy nicknamed &quot;Fats,&quot;lived with his mother, Diane, an unemployed secretary.Jermaine's father, Henry, is in the Lorton federal prison inVirginia, serving a 10-to-30 year term for manslaughter anddrug crimes. One of Jermaine's two older brothers is alsoserving time in Lorton. For at least a couple of years, DianeDaniel has traveled regularly to and from New York, leavingJermaine largely on his own, according to people who know thefamily. Ms. Daniel, who declined to be interviewed for thisarticle, was out of town when her son was killed.   Judonne, now being held in a juvenile jail, lived in thesame seven-story brown brick building with his grandmotherand two older brothers. Judonne's mother, a heavy drug user,according to people who know her, surrendered responsibilityfor the boys a few years ago. The grandmother, though praisedby neighbors as principled and well-meaning, by all accountscouldn't control her grandsons.   Judonne's brother, Tony, 17, says the slim, quiet boy &quot;wasalways happy-faced.&quot; Billy, a classmate of Jermaine andJudonne's at Langley Junior High School, says the two were&quot;best friends&quot; who &quot;did their schoolwork; you have to givethem that.&quot;   By the age of 12 or 13, though, Jermaine and Judonne werealso involved in selling drugs and even stealing cars, policesay. They were arrested on a number of occasions, usuallytogether. &quot;That's how you knew where they were,&quot; says apolice officer in the area. &quot;When one was locked up, theother one was, too.&quot;   A former Edgewood resident and convicted drug dealer whocalls himself &quot;Fish&quot; says boys like Jermaine and Judonnelearn by imitating their elders. A frequent visitor to hisold turf, Fish explains: &quot;Everybody wants to be presentable.White man got your sports jacket and tie. Kid here wants hisGuess jeans and his flashy coat.&quot; Fish adds: &quot;They can't getno jobs . . . so what else these boys going to do?&quot;   Getting arrested is an essential element of the outlawreputation at Edgewood. What's more, &quot;Everyone from Edgewoodgot to carry a gun to be a man,&quot; says Tim Edmonds, 20, wholives in another housing project nearby.   Most young people in the area say their friends acquireguns for protection from drug dealers, from drug customersand from the &quot;stick-up boys&quot; who prey on everyone else. Butteen-agers also carry weapons for style. The nine-millimetersemiautomatic pistol, often featured in such TV shows as&quot;Miami Vice,&quot; is the current fashion rage. Jermaine was seenon a couple of occasions with &quot;a nine.&quot; He is also said tohave carried a .357 magnum, a cousin of the cannon-like .44magnum made famous in Clint Eastwood's &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movies.   Movies and television help dissolve inhibitions aboutguns, says William, an 18-year-old senior at Duke EllingtonHigh School. &quot;There's no reality for these kids; everythingis fantasy, killing doesn't mean anything.&quot;   Washington has one of the toughest anti-handgun laws inthe country; it bans gun sales. But any Edgewood 14-year-oldcan get one. Thousands of guns are sold legally each year inMaryland, Virginia and West Virginia; many of them make theirway onto the underground market in Washington. Robberies ofout-of-state gun shops also help supply the capital,according to James Perry, a crack dealer-turned-youthcounselor who uses a wheelchair since getting shot threeyears ago.   Forty dollars buys a .22 caliber pistol in Edgewood. Anine-millimeter costs as little as $200. For short-termneeds, you can rent a .38 caliber revolver from Friday nightthrough Saturday for $40 to $60. Addicts who steal guns willtrade them for as little as a $20 vial of crack. Or you canborrow, says Mr. Perry: &quot;`Can I use your gun?' `Sure, bringit back in an hour.'&quot;   &quot;Kids say they need protection,&quot; he says. &quot;But if they'rearmed, as soon as they get into an argument -- boom] --they're going to use it.&quot; If someone has the reputation forcarrying a gun, he adds, that makes it more likely thatantagonists will pull theirs first.   Jermaine had a reputation for carrying a gun. He also hada talent for taunting, or &quot;dis'ing,&quot; short for disrespecting.Together, the two are a deadly combination. Among the youngerresidents of Edgewood Terrace, almost any provocation -- themildest dis'ing -- requires retaliation.   The confrontation between Jermaine and Judonne soundsalmost inevitable as retold by their friends and family.&quot;They both going out with the same girl,&quot; says Billy, theLangley Junior High classmate. &quot;Fats, he don't know. He findout and get mad. That start something. . . . Judonne, he justwant to end it.&quot;   The police, based on what they say were Judonne'sstatements after his arrest, give the following, slightlydifferent account:   Judonne got angry after he learned that Jermaine hadthreatened to slap the girlfriend. Once a confrontationseemed likely, Judonne went to his apartment and got his .45caliber Smith andamp; Wesson. He feared that Jermaine would havehis .357.   Judonne test-fired his own weapon outside his building.Then he went to meet Jermaine in the courtyard. Jermainequickly realized that Judonne was armed. As an audiencegathered, Jermaine teased Judonne, daring him to shoot. &quot;Youbetter kill me,&quot; he said several times.   Judonne fired, and fired twice more. He told police hemeant to shoot Jermaine in the legs, not the chest.   Judonne ran, but turned himself in three hours later. &quot;Ikilled my friend,&quot; he said.   Judonne's government-paid lawyer, Gretchen Franklin, saysshe will introduce &quot;exculpatory&quot; evidence at his trial, whichis scheduled to begin Thursday. At a preliminary juvenilecourt proceeding last month, she pleaded with the judge,&quot;This is a 14-year-old child we've got here.&quot; Next to her sata forlorn-looking boy dressed in jeans and a blue sweatshirt,staring at his sneakers.   Judonne's brother, Tony, discusses the shooting with atight, sardonic smile, his eyes hidden behind a pair ofwrap-around sunglasses. &quot;This wasn't barbaric,&quot; he insists.&quot;It wasn't intentionally loading up to go and shoot someone.&quot;   As Tony speaks, a uniformed patrolman sprints past,walkie-talkie squawking. He shouts to his partner: &quot;Let'sroll] Let's roll] Kid with a gun]&quot;   Young men standing in a nearby doorway, small boysclimbing on a twisted chain-link fence -- they all look up,but no one seems scared or dismayed. The spectators go backto their business as the cops turn the corner and disappear.</TEXT></DOC>
