The proposals, made to a cabinet-level task force, are aimed at enabling the troubled industry to restructure itself without further bankruptcies. The study group, headed by Bruce Smart, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for international trade, began meeting with industry executives after LTV Corp. filed for bankruptcy-law protection last July.    Administration sources said Mr. Smart is scheduled to deliver his report today to the president's Economic Policy Council. Sources, terming the report &quot;mostly informational,&quot; said the White House is unlikely to take any near-term action.    Though proposals vary from company to company, steelmakers are urging the government to develop a fund to offset the cost of closing a further 20 million to 30 million tons of steelmaking capacity. In addition, steelmakers are calling for tougher trade laws and enforcement. These measures include extension of voluntary import quotas after 1989 and action against non-participatory nations.    Several mechanisms are proposed for generating the fund, including a 10% surcharge on imports. Industry executives said the surcharge would generate between $800 million and $1 billion in annual revenue. Steelmakers have also suggested legislation enabling them to use the industry's hefty tax-loss benefits now -- instead of waiting to apply them against profits in future years.    Despite an industry consensus favoring government help to facilitate steel's restructuring, steelmakers disagree widely on several aspects of the proposed program, including just how the funds may be used. &quot;It will take a good measure of creativity to devise a solution that preserves the industry's competitive relationships,&quot; said Thomas C. Graham, vice chairman of USX Corp., the nation's No. 1 steelmaker.    Bethlehem Steel Corp., for instance, carrying substantial unfunded pension liabilities, has hired investment bankers to document its appeal for pension relief. On the other hand, Inland Steel Industries Inc., with a fully funded plan, hasn't any need for special help with its pensions.    At the heart of the industry's problem is the surfeit of domestic mills and the high exit costs, mainly pension expenses, that inhibit further capacity cutbacks. Economists figure the industry will have to lop off an additional 20 million to 30 million tons before steel prices stabilize. But producers argue there is little chance of that soon unless the administration steps in.    The administration's interest largely reflects deepening concern for the health of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government-backed agency that insures the pensions of about 38 million Americans with employer-paid premiums.    Increasingly, corporations complain that the pension agency has become a dumping ground for troubled companies' underfunded pension plans. The trend is particularly alarming in steel. LTV's bankruptcy-law filing, for instance, enabled it to shed $2.3 billion in unfunded liabilities.    To avert more bankruptcy-law filings -- and more stresses on the private pension system -- the Reagan administration began to review the industry's plight. &quot;It isn't at all clear when the administration will act, if at all,&quot; acknowledges one steelmaker's chief executive officer.    Industry sources said they expect the report to conclude that the industry, awash in over-capacity, must deal with its pension problem to avert more bankruptcies. But they added that the study probably will stop short of endorsing detailed mechanisms for reversing the industry's decline.    In addition to citing the prospects for more bankruptcy-law filings, steelmakers are renewing their attack on imports as a main cause for the industry's decline. &quot;The lack of trade law enforcement over the past five to 10 years has contributed to the problem, so we feel strongly that the government has some responsibility here,&quot; says Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem chairman.    Closing more domestic steel mills would be pointless without stiffer curbs on imported steel, argues USX's Mr. Graham, who is also chairman of the American Iron andamp; Steel Institute, the industry's trade group. If not, he contends, &quot;all the excess capacity in the world will pour in here.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
