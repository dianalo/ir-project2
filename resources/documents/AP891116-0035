(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tornado slammed into a shoppingdistrict, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing atleast 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in carsand homes, authorities said.   ``It's total destruction where the tornado hit. Cars are piledon top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used tobe,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director inMontgomery.   Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths,said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state EmergencyManagement Agency in Montgomery. Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado thatstruck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled withrush-hour traffic.   Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubblethrough the night for injured or dead.   ``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartmentcomplexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jenningsafter the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in thecity's south section.   ``It may be tomorrow before we have a final count,'' Gov. GuyHunt said at the state's disaster center in Montgomery.   The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with searchand rescue equipment.   Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, andCooper said police were unable to determine the extent of thedamaged area. Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plungingtemperatures.   ``We're even having a few snowflakes,'' said Cooper. Hightemperatures in Huntsville were expected to be in the 30s Thursday,he said.   Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, theWaterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes werereduced to rubble by the tornado.   ``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' newsphotographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty ofstaff and pupils when the tornado hit. Police reported one personkilled in a car outside the school.   Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Squareapartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College,which is located in a converted movie theater, and others inscattered areas.   ``Rescuers are digging in the rubble,'' state trooper W.L. Kellysaid. He said two people were killed when the twister hit housetrailers in rural areas east of Huntsville. The fifth death wasreported near the shopping district.   The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army'sRedstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the spaceagency or weapons testing center.   ``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,''Kelly said.   Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by thetornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting,reported widespread damage.   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, andit just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get holdof,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car whenthe twister struck.   ``It started picking cars up and pushing them around, ... someof them upside down, some of them just strewn around,'' he said.   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circusperformer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said.   ``All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were justpopping and snapping over the top of us ... it was as if you werelooking into an arc-welder, they were so bright,'' he said.   WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of abusiness collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area. Anearby shopping center also was damaged.   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors werehaving difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
