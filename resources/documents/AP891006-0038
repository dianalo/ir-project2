Rehnquist for bypassing the federal courts'policy-making body and sending Congress a plan that could lead toswifter executions for death row inmates.   The move also appears to have dismayed many of Rehnquist'scolleagues on the Judicial Conference, the 28 federal judges headedby Rehnquist who serve as a kind of board of directors for thefederal courts.   Fourteen of the judges wrote Congress to request hearings onwhatever recommendations the conference makes, according to today'seditions of The New York Times.   Rehnquist's move ``would essentially render the (U.S.) JudicialConference impotent,'' Leslie Harris of the American CivilLiberties Union told Legal Times, a Washington-based newspaper forlawyers.   In its Oct. 2 issue, the newspaper quoted opponents as sayingRehnquist's action may suggest federal judges are split over whatchanges, if any, are needed in handling death penalty appeals.   The 14 judges, including the chief judges of eight of the 13federal judicial circuits, this week wrote conference secretaryRalph Mecham asking him to ``transmit to the chairmen of the Senateand House Judiciary Committees a request that hearings be held sothat the recommendations of the Judicial Conference, which will beadopted at its next meeting, can be considered,'' according to TheNew York Times.   Mecham told the newspaper he had forwarded the letter.   A special committee appointed by Rehnquist issued a report lastmonth offering a plan to reform a system it said encourages endlesslegal maneuvering, years of delay and frenzied last-minute moves tostave off executions in the 37 states with death penalty laws.   The committee report was submitted to the Judicial Conference,but action on it _ and any recommendation to Congress _ waspostponed until the conference's next meeting, March 13.   The committee recommended that states enact laws to limit deathrow inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts.One round would challenge a verdict directly; a second would bebased on alleged violations of an inmate's rights.   The current system permits successive rounds of appeals in thefederal courts.   States that choose to adopt the new system, which would requirecongressional approval, would have to assure legal help to deathrow inmates at taxpayer expense throughout the appeals process.That is not the case now.   Rehnquist forwarded the report to the chairmen of the House andSenate judiciary committees, without any recommendation, on Sept.22 _ the day after it was made public.</TEXT></DOC>
