Another trader in New York said, &quot;It was just a debacle.&quot;    Analysts said the dollar's rebound stemmed from profit-taking in other currencies and from speculation that today's meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker could temporarily halt the dollar's decline.    The currency movement triggered massive long liquidation, or selling contracts to offset those bought earlier, metals traders said. Computer-guided technical selling later in the day accelerated the price plunge, traders said.    &quot;Many people were just bailing out,&quot; David Sobotka, chief bullion trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active month, plunged $15.10 an ounce to $408.20. Gold prices had risen in six of the past seven sessions, but yesterday's losses wiped out all those gains. The last time gold prices took a bigger fall was March 20, 1985, when they fell $15.20 an ounce.    March silver futures sank 19.7 cents an ounce to $5.515, and platinum for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange plummeted $25.20 an ounce to $519.50.    &quot;No one expected that type of collapse in that short a period of time,&quot; Frederick Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, said.    Other analysts said the markets' weakness portends further losses. The gold rally's screeching halt &quot;causes the market to lose more and more credibility, making a stronger case for a bear market,&quot; William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices dropped on speculation that Japan and West Germany might cut interest rates soon to help the dollar. Today's planned meeting between the U.S. treasury secretary and Japanese finance minister also sparked rumors of imminent action in support of the dollar. Alvaro Meneses, an analyst with Manfra, Tordella andamp; Brookes Inc. in New York, said the West German central bank may even cut rates before that country's general election Sunday.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: A stronger dollar put pressure on most grain futures prices. Soybean and corn futures were down as the dollar's gains limited overseas buying, analysts said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices were firmer, with the most strength in the more distant months. Expectations of a favorable cattle-on-feed inventory report boosted April and June contracts, analysts said. The government is due to issue the two-part report after the market closes Friday. Analysts predict that the report on activity in seven states during December will show that 5% to 8% more cattle were placed on feedlots than a year earlier, while 8% to 10% more were marketed. Analysts also expect the data to show that placements on feedlots in 13 states during the fourth quarter were down 3% to 4% from a year earlier, while marketings were up 4%. The number of cattle placed on feedlots should show a decline of 1% to 2% for the seven states in December and about 2% for the 13 states during the quarter, analysts say, and this decline in animals available for marketing should be a positive second-quarter factor.    COCOA: Futures prices eased on indications that talks on the International Cocoa Agreement's buffer stock may take longer than expected, analysts said. The March contract opened steady, then lost ground to close $19 a metric ton lower at $1,938. A news report said the talks are bogged down over whether to authorize the buffer-stock manager to buy cocoa from non-member nations and whether to pay varying prices for different types of cocoa. The West German representative was quoted as saying no agreement was likely this week. But Sandra Kaul, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said, &quot;Reports I've received indicate the talks are going quite well.&quot; A new cocoa agreement went into effect yesterday, but analysts generally agreed that until the buffer-stock question is settled, it is an agreement in name only.    ORANGE JUICE: Predictions that the season's coldest weather will hit Florida orange-growing areas this weekend triggered active buying of futures, but prices rose only moderately. The March contract rose 2.2 cents a pound to $1.2525. The weekend is &quot;some time away, and traders tended to be cautious,&quot; Judy Weissman, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, said. If the weather forecast doesn't change, &quot;it's likely the market will continue to advance during the rest of the week,&quot; she said. Ken Clark, a senior forecaster for Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa., said that although this weekend's weather in Florida will be the coldest of the season so far, &quot;We're not yet predicting a major freeze.&quot; But Peter Leavitt of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., said that because of recent record high temperatures in Florida, orange trees have new growths that haven't been hardened by cooler temperatures. This means &quot;low temperatures that are not normally regarded as damaging to citrus could cause problems,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
