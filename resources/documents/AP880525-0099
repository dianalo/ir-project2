Gorbachev, extollingadvancements in superpower relations but pledging ``to go stillfarther'' in the interests of freedom and peace.   ``We have many differences _ deep differences, moraldifferences,'' Reagan told a White House departure ceremony minutesbefore he left for the Moscow summit, which begins Sunday and endsfour days later.   ``But we are still fellow human beings. We can still worktogether to keep the peace. And in working with the Soviet Union,the United States can still remain true to its mission (of)expanding liberty throughout the world,'' Reagan said.   Several hundred people were escorted onto the South Lawn of theWhite House to witness Reagan's departure remarks. Under a steadyrain, Reagan spoke as an aide held a black umbrella over him. Firstlady Nancy Reagan stood next to the president, sheltered from therain by an umbrella held by a second aide.   But the umbrella failed to keep the president dry. His wife wasoverheard remarking to Reagan, ``Honey, you're just soaked.''   He answered, ``I know it.'' She then asked, ``Why didn't you puton a raincoat?'' His answer was not overheard.   A military band had played patriotic marches as the Reagansemerged from the Diplomatic Entrance. Among those in the largecrowd standing by were several members of the Cabinet and Sovietambassador Yuri Dubynin.   As the brief ceremony ended, the Navy's Blue Angels precisonflight team staged a low-altitude fly-by.   Before leaving for a stopover in Helsinki, Finland, thepresident asked for the prayers of Americans ``as I embark on thisgreat task.''   ``Since my first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, ... we have come along way,'' Reagan said. ``My task in the next week will be to gostill farther, farther in the interests of peace. Farther toward auniversal respect for fundamental human rights. Farther towardworld freedom. Farther toward a safer world for all people,''Reagan said.   Reagan was leaving without a ratified U.S.-Soviet treaty banningmedium-range nuclear missiles, the highlight of his last summit inDecember with Gorbachev.   The pact is still awaiting Senate approval and White House chiefof staff Howard Baker is staying behind in the hope the Senate mayact and the treaty can be rushed to Reagan before he meets withGorbachev.   Several of Reagan's own conservative colleagues have stalledaction on the pact, arguing it is one-sided and does not addressconcerns about potential Soviet cheating.   But Senate leaders moved Tuesday to halt debate.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Senate MajorityLeader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told Reagan on Tuesday that ``in alllikelihood, the Senate will be able to act on the treaty byFriday.''   The president, summing up his four-part agenda for the May29-June 2 talks with the Soviet general secretary, noted in hisdeparture remarks that he and Gorbachev have ``plenty of work'' todo.   ``I do not expect it to be easy,'' Reagan said.   _On arms control, Reagan lauded the pact banning medium-rangemissiles for reducing the level of superpower arsenals for thefirst time. Progress has been made on a second pact to slashstrategic weapons by half, he said, adding that he intended ``toresolve the issues that still stand in the way.''   Secretary of State George P. Shultz held out the hope Tuesdaythat the strategic arms treaty can be completed before Reaganleaves office in January.   _On human rights, Reagan lauded Soviet advancements such as theloosening of emigration restraints and the release of politicalprisoners, Reagan said he intended to ``see that the positivetrends ... continue and the reforms are made permanent.''   _On regional issues, Reagan noted that the two countries havesigned the Geneva accords outlining the withdrawal of Soviet troopsfrom Afghanistan and that the first withdrawals have begun. But hesaid he would be looking for Soviet actions to help advancenegotiations on problems in Angola and Namibia and ``to supportU.N. efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war.''   _On bilateral ties, Reagan pledged to extend the areas ofcooperation. ``This will include everything from practical mattersof nuclear safety to radio navigation and the protection of theglobal environment,'' he said.   Reagan said his goal throughout his meetings with Gorbachev,which began in Geneva in 1985, has been to establish ``a betterworking relationship with the Soviet Union, one no longer subjectto the dangerous highs and lows of the past, a working relationshipbased on realities, not merely on a seeming relaxation of tensions....''   ``In my talks with General Secretary Gorbachev next week, wewill be looking to the future, for there remains much to be done,''Reagan said.   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to sign some minor agreementson cultural programs, fishing, civilian nuclear reactor safety,transportation technologies and a packet of understandings on CoastGuard-maritime issues, according to Assistant Secretary of StateRozanne Ridgway.   The visit marks the first time the 77-year-old Reagan sets footin the nation he once derided as ``the Evil Empire.'' It also isthe first time in 14 years an American commander-in-chief hasvisited Moscow. The last trip was made by then-President Nixon inJune 1974.   Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Helsinki in the pre-dawn hoursof Thursday. He will remain there until Sunday morning, when heboards Air Force One for the 1{-hour trip to Moscow.   Almost immediately after his arrival, Reagan and Gorbachev arescheduled to begin their fourth summit in 30 months.   Shultz said Tuesday that the United States will make newproposals at the summit to help solve the problem of keeping trackof mobile missiles, one of the key obstacles to a new U.S.-Soviettreaty on strategic weapons.   The secretary said the administration would also pursue a systemfor sending observers to suspect sites with little advance warning.   In a speech broadcast in Europe on Tuesday, Reagan said he doesnot expect to achieve ``a quick, radical transformation of theSoviet system.''   ``There still remain profound political and moral differencesbetween the Soviet system and our own.''   The president said he hopes to reach an agreement on strategicnuclear weapons ``this year _ though it is the requirements of agood treaty and not some arbitrary deadline that will determine thetimetable.''   The president's remarks were broadcast overseas on the U.S.Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech wastaped Monday in the Oval Office.</TEXT></DOC>
