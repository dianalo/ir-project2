The RTP results showed the emitting phosphor wasprotected from collisional deactivation by the matrix and that the adsorbedchloroform minimally disrupted the phosphor adsorption interactions.In addition, at least two populations of phosphors were indicated. TheRTF data and RTP data showed that different interactions were occurringin the singlet state compared to the triplet state. A comparison of RTFintensity and TRP intensity as a function of chromatographic solventstrength indicated that the protonated forms of the nitrogen heterocyclesin their triplet states were interacting with the matrix more stronglythan the protonated forms of the nitrogen heterocycles in their singletstates.</TEXT></DOC>
