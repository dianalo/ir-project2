Senior officials, international lending organizations and others warn that the unemployed and underemployed are a potential threat to the nation's stability.    &quot;The question of manpower is one of the major problems we face and the challenge will be even bigger in the future,&quot; President Suharto said in his 1988 budget address early this year.    Returning to the issue later in his Independence Day speech, Mr. Suharto said all development policies &quot;are oriented toward expanding employment opportunities, especially for the young labor force whose numbers will increase.&quot;    Defense Minister Benny Murdani described the main security threat in the next five years as internal unrest resulting from rapid economic development.    In its last three annual reports on this country, the World Bank said unemployment, especially among relatively well-educated urban youth, could get out of hand unless the creation of new jobs keeps up with population growth. With 176 million people, this is the world's fifth most populous nation and four million more are added every year.    In a recent speech, Manpower Minister Cosmas Batubara said there are 1.5 million jobless and 7.1 million underemployed, which he defined as those working less than 15 hours a week. But the latest World Bank study counts those working less than 35 hours a week as underemployed and said their numbers were &quot;extensive.&quot;    Officially, the labor force numbers 67.5 million, but the figure is regarded as outdated by diplomats from two Western nations who specialize in economic matters.    One estimated the labor force at almost 76 million and growing at the rate of 4% every year. It will reach 81 million by 1990, he said. Both diplomats, who requested anonymity, said confidential reports by Indonesian agencies put the number of jobless at about 11 million, or 16% of the official labor-force number, with more than 30 million considered underemployed.    A U.S. Department of Labor report prepared by the U.S. Embassy here said the country &quot;continues to rely heavily on export of labor, tramsmigration and the capability of the informal sector to absorb surplus manpower to take up each year's slack in unemployment opportunities.&quot;    Transmigration -- the resettling of millions of people from overcrowded Java to outlying islands -- is designed to open economic opportunities and ease crowding.    Officials hope many more will join the estimated 90,000 employed on contract in various Middle East countries, most of them women working as domestic help.    More than 300,000 Indonesians are in neighboring Malaysia illegally, according to unofficial estimates, filling construction and plantation jobs shunned by more prosperous Malaysians.    &quot;Most forecasters believe that real gross domestic product must expand at a minimum of 5% per year in order for new job creation to match new entrants to the market, although other observers believe that real growth must be as high as 8%,&quot; the U.S. report said. </TEXT></DOC>
