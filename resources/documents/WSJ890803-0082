The measure, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act, was voted out of the panel after a final round of negotiations -- particularly between committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and the White House -- reached a compromise over some sticky issues.    The result, though scaled down from more-ambitious versions, &quot;is the most comprehensive civil rights legislation in 25 years,&quot; said Ralph Neas, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 180 groups lobbying for the bill.    The bill, which is supported by the White House, congressional leaders of both parties, and groups representing the disabled, is expected to pass easily.    Separately, the committee started a new round of legislative wrangling over a higher minimum wage, approving the same bill that President Bush vetoed in June. That bill called for an increase in the wage floor to $4.55 an hour by late 1991 from the current $3.35. Mr. Bush said he would accept only a bill boosting the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1991, coupled with a lower six-month training wage for newly hired workers.    The Democratic majority apparently wants to work for a compromise with the White House, however. Mr. Kennedy expressed new hope that there's a &quot;common ground&quot; between Congress and the administration over the contentious issue.    The Senate Democrats' plan is to accept on the Senate floor an increase to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1990, with the length of any training wage undecided. Later, the House Labor Committee would probably approve a bill boosting the wage to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1990. But panel leaders may then go along with stretching out that rise for another year, as the White House wants, but with a training wage of two or perhaps three months, essentially for a worker's first job.    The anti-bias bill generally seeks to extend to the handicapped the same kind of protection against employer and public-access discrimination already accorded by law to minorities, older persons and women. Current law provides narrower restrictions on discrimination against the handicapped, and is confined to companies and others who receive federal grants or contracts.    The bill will &quot;hopefully sweep away the barriers&quot; against the disabled, including many psychological barriers imposed by employers and others out of ignorance, Mr. Kennedy said in an interview. He and Sen. Thomas Harkin (D., Iowa), the bill's Senate sponsor, worked with Republican Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and White House officials including Chief of Staff John Sununu, to hammer out the compromise.    A handicapped person is defined as someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits his or her activities.    The legislation bans discrimination against handicapped individuals in such areas as hiring and working conditions. &quot;Reasonable&quot; accommodations would have to be made for the limitations of workers or applicants, unless they would mean an undue hardship for the employer. But employers would be allowed to refuse to hire an applicant or retain employees with a contagious disease that poses a health threat to other workers, or whose use of alcohol or illegal drugs affects their work.    For the first two years after enactment, companies with fewer than 25 employees would be exempt from the employment provisions, and ones with fewer than 15 would be exempt after that. Lawsuits by handicapped persons could only collect pay that the plaintiffs are due because of discrimination.    Under public-accommodations provisions, owners of theaters, restaurants and other public buildings would have more-stringent requirements to meet for new buildings or renovated old ones. These have sparked protests from small-business groups, especially, that the law would be costly.    They would have to provide access and take such measures as installing wheelchair ramps. No small-business exemptions are provided. Private lawsuits could be filed seeking court injunctions to compel compliance with the law, and the attorney general could seek fines of up to $100,000 for a &quot;pattern&quot; of violations. But jury trials or any punitive damages, included in an earlier version of the bill, wouldn't be allowed.    The measure also would require access for the handicapped to mass-transit buses, through means such as wheelchair lifts, and over-the-road buses, including toilet facilities for the handicapped, and certain access to telecommunications services. </TEXT></DOC>
