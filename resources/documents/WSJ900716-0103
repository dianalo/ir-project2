Despite voting to eliminate 100,000 active-duty troops,more than 42,000 civilian jobs and $10 billion of newhardware purchases in fiscal 1991, the committee postponedfinal decisions on how, or even whether, to proceed withmajor weapons programs.</LP><TEXT>   The bill, announced last Friday, delays full-scaledevelopment or procurement of the Air Force's C-17 trooptransport and Advanced Tactical Fighter, a fleet of newcarrier-based attack planes and superquiet attack submarinesenvisioned by the Navy, and the Army's proposed LHhelicopter.   Lawmakers said the cuts reflected a new &quot;fly before youbuy&quot; strategy intended to more thoroughly test equipmentbefore it enters full-blown production.   Significantly, though, none of these top-priority programs-- carrying a total price tag of about $200 billion by thelate 1990s -- were killed. Neither the lawmakers' commentsnor documents released by the panel indicate the committee'slong-term intentions involving those high-profile weapons.   Likewise, the panel sidestepped thorny questions aboutlong-term troop withdrawals from Europe, South Korea andelsewhere -- all of which are bound to be hotly debated asthe bill winds its way through Congress. The committee didmandate bringing home 50,000 American troops from Europe bythe end of 1991. But Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) said GOPopposition blocked his bid to lock in deeper troop cuts thereby 1995. &quot;We are going to revisit that again on the floor,&quot;he told reporters.   Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) described the committee'sspending plan as a &quot;manageable glide path toward a majorrestructuring of our military establishment and the way itdoes business.&quot; The committee cut $18 billion in spendingauthority from President Bush's defense budget for the fiscalyear starting Oct. 1. But critics in the House and even somemembers of his own committee are pushing for between $3billion and $6 billion in additional cuts.   The panel realized some relatively easy savings bycanceling more than a dozen smaller programs, including atroubled air-defense system for the Army and certain chemicalbombs and munitions. Many of the items already were targetedfor cuts by the Pentagon.   Other proposed terminations, though, are likely to end upin bitter floor fights. Proponents of the so-called NationalAerospace Plane, intended to take off from a regular airport,fly faster than any previous aircraft and go directly intoEarth's orbit, once again are expected to seek Vice PresidentQuayle's help to retain Pentagon funding for the ambitiousresearch project. The National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, which is funding part of the work, has arguedthat the project will die without hefty Pentagon support.   Lockheed Corp., the prime contractor for a proposedmultibillion-dollar, jam-resistant satellite communicationsnetwork slated for termination by the committee, is gearingup to try to save that program. Alan Chase, Lockheed's vicepresident for business development, said that companyofficials were &quot;dismayed, if not shocked&quot; by the panel's voteto cancel the Milstar program, which has been supported byboth the administration and Congress.   The company had been counting on Milstar to keep revenuestrong at a time when many of its major aircraft lines arewinding down. Although budget figures for Milstar remainclassified, it was expected to be the major factor in thegrowth of Lockheed's surveillance, verification andcommunications business. The company had projected revenue inthat segment of its operations to increase to $4.5 billionannually by the mid-1990s from $3.25 billion last year.   The panel's bill also includes:   -- About $3.7 billion, or $1 billion less than the WhiteHouse requested, for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Somelawmakers proposed using language that blasts theadministration's hefty SDI spending plans as &quot;thoroughlyunrealistic,&quot; rules out &quot;significant increases&quot; for SDI inthe foreseeable future, and urges the Pentagon &quot;to adjust itsplans appropriately.&quot; Sen. John Warner (R., Va.), the rankingGOP member of the committee, told reporters that thecommittee merely &quot;postponed the battle to the floor&quot; of theSenate.   -- A nonbinding timetable to slash nearly 500,000 of thecountry's 2.1 million active-duty troops over the next fiveyears, with the Army taking the biggest percentage cut. It isslated to shrink more than 30% by 1996 under the committee'sscenario. But lawmakers, as expected, rejected Pentagonproposals for comparable cuts in reserve forces; and theyadded nearly $880 million to the White House's request forequipment earmarked for reserve units.   -- A 25% cut in the military's intelligence-gatheringbudget over five years, starting with a 5% reduction infiscal 1992. As part of that effort, Sen. Warner said,lawmakers will study &quot;whether or not there are manyoverlapping and redundant&quot; operations that should beeliminated.   -- Reducing funding for the B-2 Stealth bomber to $3.75billion, or about $400 million less than the Pentagon wanted.The Air Force still would buy two of the radar-evading planesin 1991.   -- Eliminating all funds to deploy nuclear-tipped MXmissiles on specially equipped railroad cars, a decisionexpected to be opposed by many GOP lawmakers.   -- Adding more than $830 million to help clean uppollution from military facilities and, for the first time,focus the attention of Pentagon researchers on worldpollution problems.   ---   Rick Wartzman in Los Angeles contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
