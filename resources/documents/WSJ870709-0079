Guild members, who account for about 560 of the Post's estimated 600 newsroom employees, have been without a contract since July 9, 1986, when the prior three-year pact expired.    John B. Kuhns, the Post's vice president of personnel, said management made its &quot;last and best&quot; offer June 3, providing for average annual salary increases of 4% to 5%. The average salary of Post reporters exceeds $50,000 a year, Mr. Kuhns said.    The Guild hasn't responded in writing to management's last offer, Mr. Kuhns said. But union sources say the offer has been rejected orally as inadequate.    Still in dispute, Guild negotiators said, are certain pension-related issues and a &quot;no overtime&quot; clause that the Guild wants to eliminate on the ground that reporters and editors aren't professionals. </TEXT></DOC>
