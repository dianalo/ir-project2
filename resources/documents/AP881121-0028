Frank Parker, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for CivilRights, said the court's refusal last week to hear Louisiana'sappeal of a ruling that the Voting Rights Act applies to statejudicial elections ``gives the green light'' to lawsuits challengingthe election process for judges in six states.   The suits have been filed in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas,Illinois and Ohio.   The lawsuits represent a new wave in litigation under the 1965law, which has been used by legal activists during the past decadeto force hundreds of local governments and school boards across theSouth to abandon at-large elections of their members.   The demise of at-large elections has coincided with a hugeincrease in the number of black elected officials at the locallevel. Between 1977 and 1987, the number of blacks on countycommissions, school boards and city councils nationwide increasedfrom 3,515 to 5,490.   ``They're trying to accomplish exactly the same thing with thejudiciary that they've accomplished with legislative offices,'' saidDavid Boyd, an Alabama attorney hired to represent the state in alawsuit challenging the election method used for circuit court anddistrict court judges.   Parker said activists initially focused on removing barriers tothe election of blacks to legislative offices because that's wherepolicy is set and laws are enacted.   Now, he said, the challenges directed at state judicial systemsmay be even more important in ending racial discrimination.   ``In terms of the impact this litigation has, it's very high,''he said. ``Judges have the power to put people in jail for longperiods of time; they have the power to put people to death. Thebusiness of state courts ... is very critical to the lives ofminorities.''   The lawsuits contend that at-large elections of judges violatethe Voting Rights Act by diluting black voting strength and denyingblacks an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.   In an at-large judicial election, two or more judges are electedby all the voters of a jurisdiction created by the state. Thelawsuits contend that black voters have little chance to electjudges of their choice when they live in majority-whitejurisdictions, even though they may constitute a majority in aspecific section of the jurisdiction.   That argument already has prevailed in three states. In NorthCarolina, a federal lawsuit challenging the method of electingSuperior Court judges was withdrawn after the Democratic-controlledLegislature last year adopted a new judicial districting planacceptable to civil rights advocates.   In Mississippi, where the first lawsuit using the Voting RightsAct to challenge state court elections was filed in 1984, a federaljudge divided eight districts where state court judges were electedat-large into 22 single-member districts, including 14 that aremajority black. The first elections under the new plan will be heldin February.   In Louisiana, a federal judge ruled in favor of civil rightsactivists in a similar lawsuit and instructed the Legislature todevelop a new election plan for state trial court judges that doesnot violate the Voting Rights Act.   The Louisiana case that reached the Supreme Court last weekinvolved a challenge to the at-large election of two state SupremeCourt justices from a district made up of four parishes. Thelawsuit, still awaiting trial, asks for the creation of twosingle-member districts, with one being majority black.   Louisiana officials argued that the Voting Rights Act should notapply to judges because it only covers ``representatives'' of thepeople, namely members of the legislative and executive branches ofthe government.   The Supreme Court's decision not to hear Louisiana's appealleaves the issue of whether the Voting Rights Act applies tojudicial election without a final resolution for the time being.   But some lawyers who are using the voting law to challenge statejudge elections say the court's silence suggests that it believesthe law does apply, particularly since several state judicialsystems already are being revamped because of rulings based on thevoting law.   ``I think the court would have taken the first one it had if itdisagreed with (the lower court) because they wouldn't want a stateto go through the change and two years later say, `now it's time tolook at this,''' said Neal Bradley, an American Civil LibertiesUnion attorney who is representing the black voters in the Georgialawsuit.   Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers, however, said he sees nohidden meaning in the Supreme Court decision. He said the court'saction last week won't stop him from contending that the VotingRights Act does not apply to judicial elections in Georgia.</TEXT></DOC>
