The Census Bureau said that San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville,Fla., also moved up in the rankings of the country's 25 largestcities in a new report prepared for release today.   New York City ranked No. 1 in population in 1988 followed by LosAngeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, the same positionsthese cities held in 1986, the last time the bureau estimated citypopulations.   But San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth largestcity while San Jose passed San Francisco and Indianapolis to moveinto 12th place. In the other change in the top 25, Jacksonvillereplaced Washington, D.C., as the 16th largest city.   Since 1970, there have been major shifts in the ranking of themost populous cities, with many in the East and Midwest beingreplaced by cities in the South and West. Seven of the 10 largestcities in 1970 were in the North and East but by 1988 there wereonly four in these regions. Baltimore, Washington and Cleveland hadbeen replaced by San Diego, San Antonio and Phoenix.   Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lostpopulation from 1986 to 1988, including Houston, Dallas and Denver.Dallas' population loss dropped the city under 1 million, a levelDallas had reached for the first time in 1986.   The bureau's new estimates were prepared using procedures thatrely on measuring components of population change since 1986 suchas statistics on births and deaths and monitoring of federal incometax returns to make estimates of net migration into an area.   The bureau's population estimates cover inside the city limitsand do not include suburbs. Populations and rankings formetropolitan areas, including suburbs, can differ substantiallyfrom those for cities.   Following are the 1988 Census population estimates for thecountry's 25 largest cities, with each figure followed by the 1986estimate. The figures are in thousands:   New York: 7,353; 7,263   Los Angeles: 3,353; 3,259   Chicago: 2,978; 3,010   Houston: 1,698; 1,729   Philadelphia: 1,647; 1,643   San Diego, Calif.: 1,070; 1,015   Detroit: 1,036; 1,086   Dallas: 987; 1,004   San Antonio, Texas: 941; 914   Phoenix, Ariz.: 924; 894   Baltimore, Md.: 751; 753   San Jose, Calif.: 738; 712   San Francisco: 732; 749   Indianapolis: 727; 720   Memphis, Tenn.: 645; 653   Jacksonville, Fla.: 635; 610   Washington, D.C.: 617; 626   Milwaukee, Wis.: 599; 605   Boston: 578; 574   Columbus, Ohio: 570; 566   New Orleans: 532; 554   Cleveland, Ohio: 521; 536   El Paso, Texas: 511; 492   Seattle, Wash.: 502; 486   Denver, Colo.: 492; 505</TEXT></DOC>
