The Florida harvest was estimated at 129 million boxes, 8% more than last year's crop and unchanged from the Jan. 1 forecast. The department projected the 1986-87 Florida frozen concentrated orange juice yield at 1.46 gallons a box, compared with 1.38 gallons last year.    In separate reports, the department also raised its estimates on the Soviet Union's grain imports and U.S. wheat exports.    The Soviet import estimate for the 1986-87 marketing year was increased to 23 million tons, two million more than the department's previous estimate. Even at that level, the imports would be well below Soviet imports of 29.9 million tons in 1985-86 and would be the lowest since 1978-79.    The department said the outlook for U.S. grain exports has improved in the past month, with export sales picking up for wheat and barley and expected to do likewise for sorghum. Wheat exports for 1986-87 were forecast at 27.9 million metric tons, up 12% from last year and 5% above last month's prediction. </TEXT></DOC>
