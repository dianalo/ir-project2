Gillum, deputy inspector general of USDA.andM;Besides the GAO-IG audit, IG officials also participated in a task force ledby OMB to review FmHA's systems planning.andM;The OMB report last fall said FmHA's plans lacked clearly defined priorities,a detailed approach, an overall information architecture and adequatefinancial justification.andM;Gillum said he was concerned most by a handful of FmHA automationacquisitions.andP;  These buys included a $13.8 million relational databasemanagement system software producurement and a $32.5 million mini-computerpurchase, as well as the purchases of 1,500 micros worth $6.8 million and 480laptops worth $2.7 million.andM;He said these buys lacked adequate justification and analyses.andP;  &quot;We believethe lack of adherence to departmental and federal standards and requirements,and the absence of sufficient documentation to support the decisions made forthese procurements, were the primary reasons for the allegations received,&quot;Gillum said.andM;Further, Hecker said, FmHA's modernization program is not based on astrategic business plan that clearly articulates how the agency will operatein the future, nor does the agency have an information systems plan linkingspecific projects to a business plan.andM;&quot;Modernizing without a clear, future-oriented vision is risky,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;Basically, the agency is gambling that it can develop technology-basedsolutions that would allow the agency to respond to fundamentally new anddifferent ways of doing business.&quot;andM;Earlier EffortsandM;Ausman said FmHA's earlier upgrade efforts, although criticized by GAO,brought the agency a computer system that was &quot;almost a light-year advance.&quot;andO;But FmHA had to initiate the $520 million modernization program, she said,because as technology advanced some of the original equipment becameobsolete.andM;&quot;Our efforts to move FmHA fully into a modern technological environment havebeen substantial.andP;  This has been a major undertaking,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;We haverun into some problems, and no doubt we will encounter some more.andP;  We haveinvested a lot of resources, time and money into this endeavor, and we do nottake lightly the concerns raised.&quot;andM;A GAO report, ADP Modernization: Half-Billion Dollar FmHA Effort LacksAdequate Planning and Oversight, was issued at the hearing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
