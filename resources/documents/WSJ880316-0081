This morning, the Federal Reserve will report industrial production for February, and, more importantly, the Commerce Department tomorrow morning will report January's trade deficit. Although economists expect both reports to show little or no change from the previous month, the trade report often contains surprises that produce wild mood swings in all the financial markets.    Despite nervousness about how last October's stock market crash may affect the economy, Fed officials have predicted the nation will avert a recession this year. Last night, Manuel Johnson, the Fed's vice chairman, underscored this view in a speech here.    &quot;Although considerable uncertainty remains, the resiliency of the U.S. economy is becoming increasingly apparent as economic data become available for the first quarter,&quot; Mr. Johnson said at a meeting of the Money Marketeers of New York University. Recession fears &quot;seem to be fading, and it now appears that we have experienced only a moderate slowdown&quot; in economic growth from last year's fourth quarter. In that quarter, the economy expanded at a brisk 4 1/2% annual rate, after adjusting for inflation.    Mr. Johnson also emphasized the Fed's determination to be &quot;vigilant against a reacceleration of inflation.&quot; But he quickly added: &quot;I am reasonably optimistic about the inflation outlook.&quot; Wage increases have remained &quot;moderate,&quot; he said, &quot;and given the recent softness in oil prices, energy prices should put a damper&quot; on consumer and producer price increases.    The Fed official, as usual, declined to offer any clues to the Fed's credit policy plans or to make any interest-rate forecasts. However, he devoted much of his 17-page speech to reiterating his belief that the Fed should pay &quot;particular -- but not exclusive attention&quot; to three measures in assessing the stance of its policy. Those three, as previously reported, are commodity prices, foreign-exchange rates, and the difference between short and long-term interest rates.    During the question period, Mr. Johnson emphasized that the Fed's decision to monitor these three measures &quot;is not new.&quot; He said that these factors, taken together, have played important roles in Fed policy for a long time.    Several economists at last night's meeting interpreted Mr. Johnson's remarks as indicating no change in Fed policy in coming weeks. Some, though, said Mr. Johnson seemed much more concerned about the possibility of inflation than of recession.    &quot;It sounds like the Fed is convinced the economy is doing well and is just waiting for the potential for inflation to snap back,&quot; said Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.    While trading volume once again was very light, several large new debt issues hit the markets yesterday. Among the biggest were $400 million of notes and debentures by British Gas Finance Inc. and $200 million of 40-year bonds by Finland. British Gas Finance is a unit of British Gas PLC. Also, Continental Illinois Corp. sold $150 million of seven-year notes, and C.I.T. Group Holdings Inc., a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. sold $100 million of two-year notes.    In the Treasury bond market, traders said this was one of the quietest sessions in recent memory. The government's 30-year bonds wound up the day yielding 8.52%, unchanged from Monday, while the yield on 10-year notes declined to 8.29% from 8.30%. Bond prices moved in an exceptionally narrow range all day.    The industrial production report today is expected to show an increase of 0.1%, according to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. The trade report tomorrow is widely expected to show the deficit widened to about $13 billion from $12.2 billion in December.    &quot;Things really have been quiet lately,&quot; said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist and senior vice president at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago. He expects the trade report tomorrow to show a deficit of about $14 billion but says such an increase would be &quot;basically seasonal in nature, rather than an indication of a deterioration in the trade balance.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Kahan expects little progress this year on cutting the trade deficit. He predicts the deficit for the full year will total about $140 billion to $150 billion.    Traders are especially nervous about the economic reports this week because of widespread confusion about where the economy is heading. Until early this month, many forecasters contended the economy was heading for recession, which they said would pave the way for sharply lower interest rates. But confidence in that forecast began to evaporate on March 4 when the Labor Department reported a much larger increase in employment last month than anyone had expected.    Now the outlook appears more confused than ever. The consensus view is that the economy will continue muddling along with subpar growth, somewhere in a range of about 2% to 2 1/2%, after adjusting for inflation. Many analysts also expect interest rates to continue hovering close to current levels.    The Federal Reserve eased credit slightly earlier this year but isn't expected to make additional moves anytime soon. &quot;The Fed is in a holding path for the foreseeable future,&quot; said Albert A. Gross, chief economist and senior vice president, Refco Inc. &quot;I don't see any risk that the Fed will tighten in the next few months.&quot;    Some analysts, though, disagree strongly. They insist that the economy is picking up steam, that inflationary pressures will accelerate, and that the Fed will be forced to tighten credit later this year.    Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned yesterday that inflationary pressures would mount if the economy grew rapidly. His remarks were widely interpreted as another indication that the Fed will try to keep the economy from expanding much faster than the 2% to 2.5% growth rate predicted by Fed policy makers.    In the bond market yesterday, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due in 2017 were quoted late in the afternoon at 103 27/32, compared with 103 26/32 Monday. They ranged between 103 24/32 and 103 29/32, an exceptionally narrow band. The government's 8 1/8% notes due in 1998 rose slightly to 98 29/32 from 98 27/32.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term U.S. Government bonds rose 0.10 point to 1300.96. That followed a decline of 0.46 point Monday. The index yesterday hovered in a range between 1300.31 and 1302.35.    Rates inched lower on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate declined to 5.61% bid from an average rate of 5.65% set at Monday's auction, while the latest six-month bill rate dipped to 5.76% bid from the auction average of 5.78%. </TEXT></DOC>
