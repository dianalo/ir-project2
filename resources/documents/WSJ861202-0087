In its most recent talks on a national coal contract, the United Mine Workers fought for time off for new parents.    Last month, even the Teamsters union held a conference on women in the workplace. These unions have images -- if not membership rosters -- that are indelibly masculine. So why are they pushing issues that some consider women's concerns?    &quot;Let me tell you,&quot; says Clement Allen, a top Mine Workers official, &quot;I'm a fourth-generation coal miner and obviously a male, and I don't see the question of parental leave as a women's issue, and neither does this union. It's a family issue.&quot;    More and more, unions are bargaining, lobbying and going to court to press for such family-related goals as child care, maternity and parental leave, pay equity and flexible work arrangements. Bread-and-butter issues of wages, health and pension benefits and job security still are priorities. But unions are also responding to the new concerns of a work force in which, increasingly, both the husband and wife have jobs and in which, according to some surveys, women are even more interested than men in joining unions.    The new configuration of the work force &quot;is getting a higher priority now in the labor movement and in society,&quot; says Douglas Fraser, formerly a United Auto Workers president and currently a labor specialist at Columbia University.    Even critics sense a shift in direction. &quot;Things are changing a little,&quot; ventures Sylvia Hewlett, author of &quot;A Lesser Life,&quot; a controversial book published earlier this year about the dilemma of women, work and their families. In her book, she charged that most unions have a history of &quot;either ignoring or being hostile to women workers,&quot; but she describes the Teamsters conference on women -- where she was the keynote speaker -- as an &quot;interesting straw in the wind.&quot;    A recent AFL-CIO resolution urged affiliates to work for &quot;family-strengthening programs through the collective bargaining process.&quot; Still, some unions are divided on the merits of certain benefits such as part-time and work-at-home schemes because of fears that employers may take unfair advantage of them. And while some unions press hard for benefits, overall results are uncertain.    The Congressional Research Service, in a report last year on maternity benefits, concluded that &quot;actual union efforts in this area have not always been vigorous.&quot; It found that maternity-leave provisions were provided in about 36% of U.S. collective-bargaining agreements and cited evidence that &quot;the impact of unionization on maternity-leave benefits is quite small.&quot;    Ms. Hewlett observes: &quot;At the top, the unions are still male-dominated; it's hard for them to put these issues on the front burner.&quot;    Unions in the garment and services industries and in the public sector, where the concentration of women workers is high, generally place the most emphasis on the conflicting demands of work and family, and on putting women's wages on a par with men's. &quot;This is a major theme, and it's going to continue to be,&quot; says John Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, whose locals have negotiated pay-equity adjustments, child-care studies, parental leave and similar agreements in several locales.    Other unions with similar track records include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a major force in pay-equity battles, and the Newspaper Guild, which is pressing for four months' paid maternity or paternity leaves with additional unpaid time in its contracts with 210 newspapers, wire services and magazines. Parental leave, child care and pay equity &quot;are priority issues with our members,&quot; says Anna Padia, the Guild's human rights coordinator.    But now, even the heavy industrial unions are getting involved. The Steelworkers negotiated agreements with Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Inland Steel Co. that will establish joint union-management committees at each company to survey employees' child-care needs and explore options.    Marsha Zakowski of the union's civil rights department says changing workplace demographics accentuate the need. She notes, too, that the union negotiated the child-care agreement &quot;in hard times.&quot; Though some question labor's commitment to stick with such issues, even during economic downturns when companies are demanding wage-and-benefit givebacks, she says those are the times that membership pressure is the greatest because &quot;people need two wage-earners in the family.&quot;    The Mine Workers, too, negotiated their agreement at a time when the coal companies were pressing hard for concessions. Only a small portion of the union's members are women, yet the union received a number of resolutions from the rank-and-file proposing that parental leave be a contract issue in 1984 bargaining. The union won a joint labor-management committee to study the issue; union representatives have since recommended that a pilot leave program be set up at one of the coal mines.    Elsewhere, the Auto Workers won pilot child-care projects in national contract talks with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. in 1984. And the International Union of Electrical Workers negotiated a child-care service referral program in a contract with General Motors and unpaid child-care leave in agreements with Sperry Corp. (That company was merged with Burroughs Corp. earlier this year and renamed Unisys Corp.)    Beyond the bargaining table, labor has gone to Congress to press its agenda. Unions this year backed parental-leave, childcare and pay-equity legislation. The Mine Workers, for instance, joined other unions and groups in support of a bill requiring employers to give workers as many as 18 weeks of unpaid leave after the birth or adoption of a child and also for the serious illness of a dependent child or parent. Miners in isolated coal communities often must travel great distances if their children require medical care, the union's Mr. Allen said. The legislation never came to a vote.    Work-and-family issues also can be a potent organizing tool for unions. In the past 20 years, women have accounted for about half the total increase in union membership; today, about one out of every three union members is a woman, according to the AFL-CIO. But with the sweeping movement of women into the work force, many remain unorganized, particularly in the clerical field.    &quot;More and more of those we are trying to organize are women, and many are young women within the child-bearing age,&quot; says Gloria Johnson, director of the social action department of the IUE. </TEXT></DOC>
