MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the bland, bureaucratic shorthand of thegovernment memorandum, it sounds routine. Just another White Housemeeting. And by the way, the president of the United States chattedwith his senior advisers about risking impeachment.   That may sound like Richard M. Nixon and the Watergate WhiteHouse, but it wasn't. It was Ronald Reagan in 1984, on his way to a49-state re-election landslide. The question was whether theadministration should be secretly soliciting aid for the NicaraguanContras from other countries after Congress barred U.S. aid.   The story has been spread on the court record at the Iran-Contratrial of Oliver North, with the government attesting to itsaccuracy. There is no evidence in that record that any of thesenior officials on hand found it remarkable that a top aide to thepresident had told him he might be flirting with impeachment.   It does not seem to have alarmed the Reagan high command. Itcertainly didn't get in the way of the search for aid.   Since impeachment is the ultimate political punishment, the wordwould seem to be one that would get any president's attention.Nixon resigned rather than face an impeachment trial in the Senate.   This is not to suggest that Reagan policy on aid to the Contrasbears comparison with the Watergate and cover-up scandals thatdrove Nixon from office.   But it is striking that the risk of committing an impeachableoffense was cited by one of the official family, at a meetingattended by at least 10 other top administration officials _including George Bush _ and the matter apparently was treated asordinary business.   Bush, then vice president, is quoted in minutes of the meetingas having observed that the outside aid would be a problem only ifthe United States were to promise third countries something inexchange for their assistance to the Contras.   Less than a year later, Bush told the president of Honduras thatU.S. aid to that country was being expedited. The court documentsays the speeded-up aid was in exchange for Honduras' continuingsupport of the Contras, but is silent on whether Bush made thatpoint in his meeting with the foreign leader.   President Bush has refused to discuss those disclosures, sayingany comment from him would interfere with the North trial.   It was James A. Baker III, then the White House chief of staff,later Reagan's secretary of the treasury, now Bush's secretary ofstate, who raised the specter of impeachment.   Baker's concern seems to have raised no alarm at the meeting onJune 25, 1984, no suggestion that even coming close to impeachableconduct might not be a very good idea. The consensus was that Bakerwas wrong.   So they decided to get a second legal opinion.   According to the government's admission of facts at the Northtrial, Director of Central Intelligence William Casey told deputiesat the CIA and the State Department in mid-July it was time to getmoving on Contra aid from other countries ``since Attorney General(William French) Smith had recently concluded that raising thefunds in this manner would not be an impeachable offense, as hadbeen suggested at the National Security Planning Group meeting onJune 25, 1984.''   Minutes of the June 25 meeting were read into the North trialrecord on March 10, when former national security adviser RobertMacFarlane testified that Baker's warning had been discussed anddisputed, and that most of those present disagreed with it.   Whatever the merits of Baker's legal advice, the minutesindicate that Reagan recognized the political peril of promotingaid to the Contras by other governments in the face of thecongressional ban on U.S. military aid. He was quoted as sayingthat if word of the effort got out, ``We'll all be hanging by ourthumbs in front of the White House.''   All of that happened during the ``Rose Garden'' phase ofReagan's campaign for a second term. The public record of Reagan'sday that June 25 shows a meeting with members of his staff, ameeting with members of his campaign advisory committee and twoWhite House speeches.   At one of them, on the South Lawn, the president complainedabout critics of his economic policies. ``Every time I hear them,''he said, ``I remember Robert Frost saying, `The brain is awonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in themorning and doesn't stop until you get to the office.'''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
