This assessment in the Foreign Ministry's annual report,released just two weeks before a visit by President Bush,said Japanese are increasingly offended by U.S. demands tolower trade barriers. The report also noted growinganti-Japanese sentiment among Americans, citing in part thebig trade imbalance.   A major part of the alliance is the 1952 treaty allowingU.S. troops in Japan and calling for U.S. help in defense.Tokyo's official stance is for stronger ties to enhanceAsia-Pacific stability.   To improve young people's understanding of bilateralrelations before Mr. Bush's visit, the Foreign Ministry hasdistributed tens of thousands of pamphlets characterizing thefriction as squabbles and noting economic interdependence.                                                                                                          INDIA TO CUT ITS REGULATORS                                                                                                          Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao unveiled a 10%percent cut in senior government posts, the first salvoagainst the country's pervasive regulators since thesix-month-old minority government launched sweeping economicreforms. More than 1,000 jobs will be cut in agenciesregulating imports and exports, cement and technicaldevelopment. Mr. Rao said sacking functionaries was in linewith opening up India's economy and reducing administrativecontrols.                                                                                                          JAPAN TO TRIM AIDES' WORKWEEK                                                                                                          Japan plans to shorten the workweek for 1.2 millioncentral government employees to five days totaling 40 hours,possibly by the fiscal year ending March 31, 1993. A cabinetdecision could come tomorrow. Later, 3.3 million localgovernment workers would get a five-day week. All theseemployees -- 7% of Japan's total work force of 64.2 million-- now log 42 hours weekly and get six days off over fourweeks. Tokyo has said shorter shifts would benefit workers'life styles and the economy by allowing more leisure time forspending. In the year ended March 31, all Japanese workersaveraged 2,044 hours, which Tokyo plans to cut 12% to 1,800in about two years.                                                                                                          FINANCIAL TROUBLE IN MONGOLIA                                                                                                          Setting the stage for Mongolia's first major default sinceit began attracting Western loans and aid last year,Mongolbank International said it couldn't repay an $18million loan that was due Tuesday. The money was borrowedfrom the Singapore branch of the Moscow Narodny Bank to coverforeign-exchange losses. Mongolbank and the central bank arecaught up in a foreign-exchange scandal that may have costUlan Bator $82.4 million.                                                                                                          EXAM HELL LINKED TO DEPRESSION                                                                                                          One out of five Japanese junior high school students areaffected by some form of mental depression, agovernment-commissioned study showed. A Ministry of Healthand Welfare study team, which conducted the study of 543students, attributed the depression among 22% of them tostress stemming from family problems and intense competitionin school entrance examinations.   The survey also covered 1,041 elementary school pupils,13% of whom showed signs of depression. &quot;Japanese childrenare agonizing because of the so-called examination-hellphenomenon and intense competition for entering eliteeducational institutions,&quot; said Prof. Toyohisa Murata, anexpert on child psychology at Fukuoka University's medicalfaculty, who was a member of the study team.                                                                                                          BURMA THREATENS RICE MERCHANTS                                                                                                          Burma has threatened merchants with military trials ifthey force rice prices up, state radio said. Rice and cookingoil weren't reaching consumers because of unscrupulous statecooperatives that sell the items, Rangoon said. It blamedcorrupt public servants, greedy merchants and politicians forinstability of commodities prices. Separately, Burma fired 50government officials, including high-ranking fisheries aides,alleging bad management, nepotism and corruption, includingtaking bribes from foreign companies.                                                                                                          CURB ON FOREIGN MUSIC RENTALS                                                                                                          Japanese music rental stores agreed to stop rentingforeign records and compact disks until three months aftertheir release, starting next Wednesday.   The decision by the Japan Record Rental Commerce TradeAssociation board, came after it failed to secure a rentalaccord with international record companies. Japan's revisedcopyright law, which takes effect next week, allows foreignmusic firms to bar rentals as long as a year after release.Japanese firms already have this right but allow rentals assoon as a week after release in exchange for royalties.   Shops will continue renting music issued in 1991. Thetrade group's talks with U.S. and European firms are tocontinue.   Foreign CDs account for 30% of Japan's annual CD rentalmarket of about 80 billion yen ($631 million).
