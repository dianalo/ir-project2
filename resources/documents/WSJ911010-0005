Thespeculation is whether it will come in a week or in a month.   Seiji Adachi, an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research,expects the Bank of Japan will move shortly after the Groupof Seven meeting set to begin tomorrow in Thailand. Mr.Adachi, who is looking for a half-percentage-point cut, says&quot;unless there is a cutback now,&quot; the economy may stall. Theofficial discount rate is the fee the central bank charges onits loans to banks.</LP><TEXT>   But Hirofumi Adachi, no relation, an analyst at YamaichiResearch Institute of Securities andamp; Economics, predicts areduction early next month. If the central bank lowers thediscount rate next week, he argues, it may leave animpression that the bank yielded to U.S. pressure at the G-7meeting.   Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno yesterday poured coldwater on speculation about a coordinated rate cut by Japan,the U.S. and Germany. Mr. Mieno said each nation will set itsown monetary policy.   In July, the Bank of Japan lowered the discount rate to5.5% from 6%, reversing its two-year-old tight-money policy.Another discount-rate cut would mean lower lending rates forconsumers and would spur domestic demand.   The speculation over a rate cut occurs as economists andanalysts debate the strength of Japan's economy, which isstill growing but at a slower rate. Many say a further ratecutback is necessary to shore up the economy, particularly tohalt a slowdown in corporate capital spending.   If it cuts rates, the central bank will keep in mind theheavy criticism it has faced over its low-interest policy ofthe late 1980s, which spurred Japan's so-called economicbubble.</TEXT></DOC>
