Report: Rights Violations Continue in Chile</HEAD><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A United Nations report released Tuesday saidhuman rights violations including torture and abductions continuein Chile but the overall situation is improving.   The report presented to the 43-nation U.N. Human RightsCommission said that since February 1985 ``there have beenimportant changes which have improved the human rights situation ... but much still remains to be done.''   It said specific problems are the increasing scope of militarycourts and ``violent and criminal activities of private gangs andterrorists.''   Gen. Augusto Pinochet has headed Chile's military governmentsince the coup that ousted the elected government of MarxistPresident Salvador Allende in September 1973.   The report was prepared by Costa Rican jurist Fernando VolioJimenez under a mandate from the commission. Volio Jiminez visitedChile in December and met with government officials and humanrights activists.   He wrote that ``a state of violence affecting fundamental rightscontinues to exist in Chile, despite the government's generalattitude condemning such violations.''   The report said many citizens are victims of intimidation by``supposedly private individuals'' seeking to ``inspire terror incircles opposed to the political status quo.''   Such intimidation is ``generally the work of private gangs ...having the secret support of some public authority,'' it said.   Harassment, mainly of people who recently returned from exile,has become more ``articulate, blatant and general,'' the reportsaid.   It also said the government has taken measures to try to preventthe torture of detainees, but ``torture is still practicedalthough, according to non-governmental sources, this revoltingpractice may have declined in terms of numbers.''   The report noted an increase in the number of civilians tried inmilitary courts and the ``irregular conduct'' of those courts.   It listed five cases of ``involuntary disappearances'' in 1987,following a year when no cases were reported, and said therecurrence is ``an especially serious situation.''   On the positive side, Volio reported the government sinceFebruary 1985 had permitted the return of about 4,000 Chileans whowere in forced exile. It said that according to the government, 350Chileans are still living in forced exile but non-governmentalsources put the figure at 583.   The report cited the cases of nine people killed in 1985-86 thathave not been solved and said one investigating magistratecomplained about lack of police cooperation and said he hadreceived death threats.   ``This situation makes things look gloomy for the cause of humanrights,'' it added.</TEXT></DOC>
