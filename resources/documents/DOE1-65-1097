Despite the losses recorded bymost companies in the solar manufacturing field, optimism is very highand private investment in research and development and manufacturingcapacity is growing rapidly. Belief in the future profitability of theindusty largely due to a policy of accelerating the diffusion of solarheating and cooling as an aid towards energy self-sufficiency. Nineteenpolicy options have been considered at the federal level. The most importantimplemented to date have been grants and subsidies to solar builders,government procurement and support of a very active research and developmenteffort. In addition to this federal drive, all but three states havepassed or are considering supportive solar legislation. The government-subsidizedgrowth of the solar manufacturing industry in the USA has many implicationsfor Canada. At this stage the Canadian tariff is unlikely to protectthe home market, unless Canadian manufacturers have reached a similarstage of maturity. This is very improbable unless the industry receivescomparable federal and provincial support. A variety of policy optionsstill exist for the Canadian federal government. A critical first stepis the definition of primary goals. It is crucial to decide whether rapidsolar diffusion, or the development of a viable Canadian solar manufacturingindustry, is of paramount importance. Other policies can only logicallyfollow after this initial decision. 157 refs., 19 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
