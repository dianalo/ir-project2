More than 200days later both houses have passed so-called crime bills.These wouldn't cause criminals to lose any sleep, except amoment to bless the weak resolve of Washington.   There's no mystery about how to fight crime. True, we havemore people in jail than ever before. The more salient factis that it's also true that the chances of someone whocommits a felony getting caught, arrested, convicted andgoing to jail have never been so low. In some big cities,about one serious crime in 100 leads to anyone doing time.This is the leading result of the procedural-rightsrevolution started by the Warren Court, which so hamperslocal law enforcement that policing has been reduced to somuch triage.</LP><TEXT>   Crime is among the most serious worries for mostAmericans, especially in rougher neighborhoods. As a studentat an inner-city high school put it recently: &quot;We all live inNew Jack City.&quot; But liberals in Congress still salute whenthe ACLU lobbyist walks through the door. The House andSenate refused even to consider the leading Bush proposal.This was what former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh dubbedthe &quot;inclusionary rule,&quot; which would have begun to reversethe legal absurdity of excluding evidence.   Juries would have been able to see all evidence of a crimeinvolving a gun. Any law-enforcement agent who violated asearch-and-seizure rule would have been punished separately.This would be more effective than the Brady Bill's waitingperiod for handguns, which is futile because there is nonational registry of felons or the mentally ill whosupposedly would be stopped from buying guns. If Mr.Thornburgh wins the Senate election in Pennsylvania, maybehe'll introduce inclusionary-rule legislation.   The crime-bill debate became a competition between theHouse and Senate to see which one could water down more ofthe Bush bill. The House agreed to expand the good-faithexception to the exclusionary rule to warrantless searches,but the Senate refused. The Senate would speed up appealsfrom inmates facing death sentences, but the House would dragthe process out even longer by overturning a Supreme Courtcase that limited appeals to legal issues when the crime wascommitted. At least Congress dropped last year's veto-baitprovision, which would have created a racial quota on deathrow. The bill now goes to a House-Senate conference, whichcould still turn a weak bill into a pro-crime bill.   There are some provisions worth saving. One would turnnearly all crimes with guns into federal crimes. This wouldindeed clog federal courts, but might well also finallypersuade federal judges to reverse Miranda and the otherabsurdities that make criminal cases so hard to prosecute instate courts. Expanding the crimes that carry the deathpenalty could help, as would tougher penalties for sellingdrugs near public-housing projects.   Even if we get a crime bill this year, it's clear thatlittle will change. It will remain true that it was safer onthe front lines in the Persian Gulf War than it will be onthe front lines in Detroit, Los Angeles or Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
