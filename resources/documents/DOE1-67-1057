Rb-Sr age determinations on whole-rock and biotite samplesfrom the magnetite gabbro indicate an age of 2045+-47 Ma and confirmthe correlation of these rocks with upper zone lithologies elsewherein the Bushveld Complex. The initial /sup 87/Sr//sup 86/Sr ratio of theFF1/85 magnetite gabbro differs from that of the upper zone elsewhere,however, and is interpreted to indicate a lack of interaction betweenthe upper and main zone magmas after the former's emplacement. Isotopicstudies of the Nebo Granite, which overlies the basic rocks, show boththe Rb-Sr and Pb isotopic systems to have been disturbed. The natureof the disturbance is different from that observed elsewhere in the BushveldComplex acid rocks and is considered to be indirectly related to shearingand mylonitization which is prominent in the granite at certain levelsin the borehole. Localization of the magnetite gabbro within the NeboGranite in the Moloto area is interpreted to be result of diapirism afteremplacement and solidification of the Bushveld rocks while still in aplastic condition.</TEXT></DOC>
