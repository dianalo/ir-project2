The effect of filler on the relaxation behavior ofepoxy matrix has been analyzed. It was observed that there is an additionalpeak at the higher temperature side of the glass transition peak on thedamping-temperature curves of composites. The relative height index wasintroduced for evaluating the contributions of interface. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
