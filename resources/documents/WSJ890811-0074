The complaint, filed in Brooklyn federal court, seeks unspecified damages. The suit was filed by Martin Bergstein against Bolar; Robert Shulman, its president; Larry Raisfeld, a founder and secretary treasurer, and Jack Rivers, executive vice president. The proposed class includes those who purchased shares in Bolar, a maker of generic drugs, between Aug. 21, 1987, and Aug. 3, 1989.    The suit charges that Bolar and its officials failed to disclose that Bolar's application for Food and Drug Administration approval to make the generic version of SmithKline Beecham PLC's Dyazide brand blood-pressure medicine was &quot;fraudulent and questionable.&quot;    As reported, congressional investigators said they received information that suggests Bolar filled capsules with SmithKline Beecham's Dyazide to win U.S. approval of its own generic form of the drug. Bolar has denied the company passed off the brand-name drug as its own in testing procedures.    Bolar said it and the individual defendants believe the allegations in the suit are without merit, and that it intends to defend the action vigorously. </TEXT></DOC>
