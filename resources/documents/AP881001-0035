State Attorney General John Van de Kamp said at a newsconference Friday that the lawsuit was filed in San FranciscoSuperior Court against eight major retail chains, 25 manufacturersof 200 brand named tobacco products and the IngredientCommunication Council, a manufacturers and retailers group.   The lawsuit, filed in the first major enforcement under a statetoxics warning law, seeks civil penalties up to $2,500 a day perviolation and could reach ``millions if not hundreds of millions ofdollars,'' Van de Kamp said.   Resolution of this ``landmark'' case should set standards and``send out a warning'' for other products containing chemicalsidentified by state health authorities as known to cause cancer orbirth defects, Van de Kamp said.   The U.S. Surgeon General requires warnings about cancer-causingrisks on packages of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and chewingtobacco. But cigars, pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco requireno federal warnings.   Deputy Attorney General Edward Weil said most stores named inthe lawsuit recently began some form of warnings, but investigatorshave to determine if they are adequate.   Van de Kamp said warnings on individual products probably wouldbe easiest and most effective, but many manufacturers don't wantwarnings on goods shipped outside California and can't controldistribution to prevent that.   Some tobacco manufacturers sent retailers warning signs afterthe Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 wasapproved by voters, Weil said, but stores didn't post them. The lawis commonly known as Proposition 65.   Most of the warning effort until recently was an 8{-by-11-inchflyer from the manufacturers group, ICC, that is posted in stores.   The ICC, which includes 60 manufacturers, retailers andagricultural producers, provides the signs and maintains the 800number. It was sued for allegedly misleading consumers and othersinto believing that the phone service provides a legally adequatewarning.   The ICC said that since February it has run newspaperadvertisements and has 62,000 signs in stores.   Stores named in the lawsuit are Safeway, Ralph's, Lucky's, AlphaBeta, Vons, Albertson's, Raley's and Thrifty.   Manufacturers include: Culbro Corp., General Cigar, ConsolidatedCigar, American Tobacco, Brown andamp; Williamson Tobacco, RoyalFactories, Sutliff Tobacco, Pinkerton Tobaccco, Mandamp;N Cigar, UnitedStates Tobacco, Swedish Tobacco, Douwe Egberts, Lane Ltd., Larus andamp;Bros., Lorillard Inc., Havatampa, Phillies Cigar, Avanti Cigar,Benson Int., John Middleton Inc., JNO H.
