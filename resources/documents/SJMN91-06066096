However, the House wasexpected to easily approve the new version, because last year it passed theoriginal bill by a 33-10 vote. Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon is expected to signthe measure into law this month.;    The measure, while politicallysignificant, is unlikely to have much practical effect on the island's 3.6million inhabitants.;    In Puerto Rico, commonwealth business already isconducted in Spanish, and the measure allows U.S. government business,including that of federal courts, to continue to be conducted in English.;   For example, government employees will be allowed to use English intransactions with the federal government, and English translations of officialdocuments are to be made available on request.;    Yet the law cast a blow toadvocates for statehood for the U.S. commonwealth island, whose people haveU.S. citizenship but don't pay federal taxes and cannot vote in presidentialelections. They have a non-voting representative in Congress.;    Thegovernor's Popular Democratic Party, which favors keeping Puerto Rico's39-year commonwealth relationship with the United States, introduced themeasure, and the Senate vote split along party lines.;    Statehood advocatessaid the real purpose of the proposed law was to hurt Puerto Rico's chances ofbecoming the 51st state.;    Legislation now stalled in a U.S. Senatecommittee would allow Puerto Rico to hold a referendum this year on whether toremain a U.S. commonwealth, seek to become a state or form an independentnation.;    Some members of Congress have said they were concerned about thepossibility of a mainly Spanish-speaking state.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Juan, Puerto Rico  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  332  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066096,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
