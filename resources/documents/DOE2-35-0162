It is found thatthe nonlinear interaction between the m = 0 and m = 1 modes brings anonlinear oscillation immediately after the linear growth stage and subsequentlya nonlinear reconnection takes place. This nonlinear oscillation occursaround a helical equilibrium in close vicinity to the initial axisymmetricequilibrium. It should be noted that the slow nonlinear reconnectionoccurs after the nonlinear oscillation is completely or almost completelydamped out by the dissipation. The occurrence of this nonlinear reconnectionis owing to the reversal of the current induced by a largely deformedhelical flux function.</TEXT></DOC>
