AmeriTrust said the buy-back is part of a corporate recapitalization that might involve buying an additional two million shares in the open market. The company has about 42 million common outstanding.    Under the agreement, the investor group stands to make a profit of between $28 million and $60 million.    Less than two weeks ago, the group, led by Alfred Lerner, gained approval from the Federal Reserve Board to purchase as much as 24.9% of AmeriTrust.    The company, one of the country's strongest capitalized banks, would have made a handsome acquisition for an out-of-state bank seeking to enter the Ohio market because of its longstanding relationships with major companies in the area.    For the moment, at least, AmeriTrust is free to pursue expansion plans, particularly in Indiana, where last year it purchased a group of banks with assets totaling about $2 billion. &quot;We believe that our ability to make strategic decisions and to take corporate actions will be enhanced by the removal of the uncertainty,&quot; AmeriTrust said in a statement.    News of the action sent AmeriTrust's stock down $1.875 to close at $24.875 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    AmeriTrust said the agreement calls for Mr. Lerner's group to sell as much as 2.7 million shares on Sept. 30, 1988, and as much as its remaining 1.3 million shares on Oct. 1, 1989, at $27 a share, plus an inflation adjustment of $1 a share.    AmeriTrust said if Mr. Lerner's group sells off its shares before the agreement is completed, AmeriTrust intends to buy back as much as 6 million common shares as part of its recapitalization, subject to market conditions.    Mr. Lerner's group is prohibited from selling more than 400,000 AmeriTrust shares to any third-party group or person. AmeriTrust said the group agreed to pay it any amount it receives over $35 a share.    Mr. Lerner said his group purchased its AmeriTrust holdings at an average price of about $20 a share, and thus stands to make a profit of at least $28 million.    &quot;I said I was in this for investment purposes, and I'm pleased,&quot; said Mr. Lerner, chairman of both Equitable Bancorp., a Baltimore bank holding company, and Realty ReFund Trust, Cleveland, a real estate investment trust specializing in refinancing commercial buildings. He said talks between the two parties had gone on for a couple of days, including an all-night session that ended with the signing of the agreement an hour before the market opened yesterday.    In addition, AmeriTrust agreed to pay the group's costs of carrying the stake at the prime rate plus 0.5%, minus dividends paid to the group on its shares.    The company said it will pay for the stock buy-back by issuing about $150 million of mandatory convertible debt and preferred stock. As a result, its primary capital won't be reduced, AmeriTrust said. &quot;We are convinced that the net effect of this capital restructuring will be quite favorable,&quot; said Jerry V. Jarrett, chairman and chief executive officer of AmeriTrust.    AmeriTrust also said its management is considering taking actions aimed at enhancing shareholder value, including the sale and lease-back of principal properties that don't meet the company's strategic and financial objectives. Previously, the company said it was exploring the possibility of selling its 87% interest in Central Bancorp., Denver. </TEXT></DOC>
