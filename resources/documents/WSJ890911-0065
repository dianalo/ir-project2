Kiam </HL><DD> 09/11/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> EUROP LABOR TAXES </CO><TEXT>   In the year leading up to the opening of the London Stock Exchange, economists and financial reporters world-wide were bursting with stories about &quot;The Big Bang.&quot; It was hyped to the heavens.    In anticipation of the onslaught that would deliver fresh business and new clients, many American financial institutions opened up new offices or expanded existing operations in Britain. But the avalanche never got rolling; within a year, most businesses found themselves cutting back. The Big Bang had delivered a few tremors, but none were potent enough to register on the fiscal Richter scale.    Now, it seems we are being asked to hold our breath in anticipation of another momentous happening. By the end of 1992 we are slated to witness the birth of &quot;Fortress Europe&quot; -- a Europe made rapturous with the miracle of economic unity.    Just think of it: Project 1992 will deliver a commonwealth of nations without economic borders. In this single-market Utopia of 335 million consumers, people, capital, goods and services will move as freely as they do within the U.S. Companies will be able to compete in a free, open and equitable market; passports will be passe. American companies are already being warned to solidify their European presence now or miss out on the greatest thing since sliced bread.    Well, pardon me, folks, but I don't buy the whole loaf.    Yes, there is going to be a more closely knit European Community featuring fewer barriers on all aspects of living. But this is neither surprising nor new. The evolution toward this semi-unification has been going on for the past 40 years. There are, however, some walls that loom as obdurate as Stonehenge. Consider the many differing rules by which Europe's players are governed.    In Britain, my company -- Remington -- has seven accounts that make up 85% of our business. In Italy, however, no organization can own more than six retail stores, which means we have to deal with a plethora of mom-and-pop shops. This means our distribution network there is completely different from the one we use in Britain.    In Britain, sales representatives can be terminated with 90 days' notice. In Italy, the law doesn't let us dispose of reps so easily. They, in effect, own their territory. To fire a rep requires paying a penalty based on the rep's anticipated earnings over a long period of time. In France, anyone who gets fired must receive severance pay, an amount borne solely by the company. In Britain, when a worker is made &quot;redundant&quot; the government picks up part of the check.    Retirement and benefit programs also differ from country to country. Will these suddenly change in 1992. Hardly. There probably will be a long period of adjustment.    As Fortress Europe is being assembled, Spain and Portugal are joining the Common Market. These countries have a lower standard of living than do their new economic allies. How will their suddenly accessible low-cost labor pool affect the unemployment rate across Europe?    All European Community members have some form of taxation on goods and services, called value-added taxes, or &quot;VATs.&quot; These vary from country to country. For instance, Spain's VAT is about 12%, while Ireland's is 25%. The European Commission, the group in charge of planning the 1992 extravaganza, is trying to harmonize these figures. Some countries would be forced to raise their rates and others to lower theirs. This suggestion is causing quite a brouhaha. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is on record as being opposed to such mandatory changes; she is not about to give up her government's power of taxation.    Mrs. Thatcher is also determined to retain some border controls. She feels they are necessary to stop illegal immigration, the inflow of drugs, and the easy transit of terrorists. And she is voicing the concern of many European leaders on these delicate subjects.    The value of the various European currencies is another problem yet to be solved. Several members of the European Commission are pushing for a unified monetary system and a European central bank. Few European leaders are dancing in the streets over this suggestion. Mrs. Thatcher is diametrically opposed to any such changes.    And then there are product approval controls and stringency standards, which vary widely from country to country -- not to mention the approval procedures for pharmaceuticals, which also differ widely.    In America, managers are now hearing how &quot;you must be placed in Europe RIGHT NOW]&quot; What's the hurry? Fortress Europe should help facilitate the exchange of goods among its member nations, not make it tougher. Remington, like most U.S. companies, shouldn't have to open up a factory across the Atlantic in order to take advantage of this. Like most American companies, Remington can benefit by shipping to one European location, from which we will then distribute our products to other countries.    Some observers warn that a united Europe could slap heavy duties on goods coming in from outside their realm. I don't see this happening. If it did, I'm sure the U.S. would respond in kind. And since the U.S. is Fortress Europe's largest potential customer, a European-initiated duty war would be suicidal.    If there is a major, immediate impact, it will come in the number of mergers across national borders. We are already seeing signs of this. French companies acquiring British companies; British businesses acquiring German enterprises. With the lifting of various restrictions, these transactions are becoming more common; wider access certainly will be possible.    In today's global economy any American company that wants to be a player must have a finger in international marketplaces. But you don't have to catch the next Concorde to remain competitive.    Remington isn't doing anything differently to prepare for 1992. We have a base in Britain and do some assembling there. If we were to lose a duty war, we might have to see about establishing a manufacturing plant there as well. It would probably take only about six months to accomplish this. We'd have plenty of time, as would the rest of corporate America. Europe 1992 may serve very well as a symbol and an ideal; it remains to be seen how it will function in reality.    ---   Mr. Kiam is CEO of Remington Products. </TEXT></DOC>
