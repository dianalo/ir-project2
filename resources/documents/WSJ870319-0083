On Wall Street, senior partners at a number of firms this year raised their hourly rates to $350 from $300. Rates for the firms' less-experienced lawyers rose by an even larger percentage in many cases. Indeed, lawyers fresh out of school and now working at the big firms bill as much as $100 an hour, up about 12%.    Other large firms around the country are rushing to follow suit. Paul Hastings Janofsky andamp; Walker in Los Angeles, for instance, has increased some rates by as much as 19%. Billing rates are substantially lower outside New York, but the percentage increases in certain categories are bigger.    &quot;A lot of law firms are holding the lid on senior partners' rates, because that's the number most noticed by the clients,&quot; says Stephen Glasser, publisher of a legal newsletter, Of Counsel. &quot;But the firms are pushing through much larger increases in rates for junior partners and associates, which are not so obvious.&quot;    Law firms say they are raising rates partly to cover the cost of vastly higher salaries and sign-up bonuses for new recruits, who now command as much as $90,000 a year to start. Because most firms adhere to a lock-step compensation system, the increase in starting salaries has forced the firms to dole out raises for hundreds of other lawyers to preserve the salary differential. Overhead has soared as a result.    Other factors are at work, too. Fearful of raids by rivals that could cripple important departments, some firms are trying to buy the loyalty of key partners with hefty bonuses. Administrative and operating costs are rising sharply, especially for necessities such as computers and malpractice insurance.    And to serve clients with far-flung interests, many firms are moving to establish international practices. Opening offices in major cities around the country and overseas requires substantial capital.    But heavy demand for top firms' services is also allowing fees to rise. A huge increase in litigation and the recent wave of corporate restructurings has prompted firms to complain that they can't hire lawyers fast enough to keep up with the crush of work.    &quot;These are boom times for the legal community,&quot; says Ed Kaufman, a partner with Los Angeles-based Irell andamp; Manella, which posted revenue of $40 million last year, up 20% from 1985.    Mr. Kaufman notes a marked increase in demand for specialists in employment law in California, where scores of companies face wrongful-discharge lawsuits filed by former employees. Demand for the services of firms with expertise in environmental, patent and tax law is especially high, too.    Aside from grumbling, corporate clients are doing little to resist the rise in rates. Years ago, most companies established in-house legal departments to take care of routine legal matters. Nowadays, they seek outside counsel only for big lawsuits or highly specialized matters like bankruptcy law or tax law.    &quot;The billing rate is only half the equation,&quot; says Guy Zoghby, counsel for the information systems group at International Business Machines Corp. &quot;You have to consider the hours it takes to resolve the problem and the results you achieve. This is not a commodity we're talking about, and cheaper is not necessarily better.&quot;    Often, Mr. Zoghby points out, a company can save money on its legal bills by hiring a specialist who can dispense with the problem in far less time -- and with better results -- than a general practitioner.    Anyway, quibbling over fees in a crisis is rare because, as law firms happily point out, desperate clients usually don't study the bill. By hiring a law firm with a national reputation, &quot;the CEO can't blame me if we get clobbered in court,&quot; a corporate general counsel says. &quot;I hire the biggest name and pay them what they ask. I've got to protect myself.&quot;    Allen Cleveland, senior vice president and general counsel of Conoco Inc., says companies' in-house lawyers are under a lot of pressure to contain costs these days. &quot;But in a bet-the-company situation like Texaco-Pennzoil,&quot; he says, &quot;you're going to give everyone a blank check.&quot;    Among the most prominent names in high-stakes litigation is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom in New York. The 700-lawyer firm, which is highly respected for its expertise in takeover law, recently raised its rates as much as 25%. (See accompanying chart.)    Skadden notes that it hadn't raised rates in two years. But a spokesman also concedes that its hourly rates are merely &quot;a starting point.&quot; Skadden and many other big firms that specialize in large transactions frequently charge clients a premium for work on matters that are especially difficult or that require around-the-clock attention.    In such cases, it isn't unusual for clients to pay double or triple the regular hourly rate. Says Peter Mullen, a Skadden partner: &quot;There are some clients who want per-hour calculations, but not many. Most of them just say, 'I want results.'&quot;    Indeed, it is rumored that some firms in New York at times dispense entirely with lengthy bills and detailed per-hour calculations. Clients reportedly get a one-page bill on which is written a single line. It begins &quot;For Services Rendered&quot; and ends with a lot of zeros.    Only a handful of law firms can afford to be so arrogant. In fact, outside the ranks of the majors, many small and midsized law firms are now struggling to stay afloat. Over time, their market has eroded as corporate clients have taken routine matters in-house and assigned serious problems to big firms. But the smaller firms still face rising costs.    Several law firms have collapsed in recent months: Sage Gray Todd andamp; Sims, one of the oldest on Wall Street, and Memel, Jacobs andamp; Ellsworth in Los Angeles. Other firms have been forced to merge.    The increases in billing rates by the majors may further roil an already unstable market. Armed with additional capital, industry specialists say, the top-tier firms will be able to raid smaller rivals more easily, dangling big-money offers before the small firms' superstars.    Moreover, many expect the technological gap between the groups to continue to widen. Many major firms are investing heavily in state-of-the-art computer and telecommunications systems that enable them, for instance, to research legal issues faster and more completely. The financially strapped smaller firms are unable to invest in the technology that could make them more efficient and competitive.    &quot;You're seeing the emergence of the haves and the have-nots in the legal profession,&quot; says Ward Bower of the legal consulting firm Altman andamp; Weil in Haverford, Pa. &quot;The gap is growing every year.&quot;    ---               TIME IS MONEY    Hourly rates charged by New York-based    Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom:                              1987    1986    Senior partners           $350    $300    Junior partners            200     170    Senior associates          200     160    Junior associates           95      85</TEXT></DOC>
