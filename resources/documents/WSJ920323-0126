It's getting easier for the boss to lookover your shoulder.   Network-management programs now allow operators of mostoffice PC networks to peer into directories of files storedon individual PCs, letting them read, rewrite and deletefiles from PC hard disks. A new crop of these programs makethat far easier to do, and some will even allow managers tomonitor what's being typed on an employee's screen.   One such program is Proxy, coming in May from FunkSoftware of Cambridge, Mass. It lets managers see what'sbeing typed on the screens of as many as eight PCs at once.Client Server Technologies' LANlord and programs from XTree,Microcom and others will let managers seize control of PCsand run them remotely. To protect privacy, Proxy signalsusers that they're being monitored or seized, and it giveseach PC user the option of preventing unwanted spying.   Software makers say such network &quot;enforcer&quot; programs areunavoidable. &quot;If you're on a network, the computer isn't`personal' anymore; it becomes part of a broader society,&quot;says Russell Frye, president of Frye Computer Systems, whichmakes a network software package. For better or worse, toprevent viruses and ensure that computers are properly used,he says that &quot;networks need police.&quot;                                                                                                          Looking for a House   On a Computer Screen                                                                                                          HOUSE-HUNTING is going high-tech. Technologies such asartificial intelligence, digital color imaging and vastdatabases are being combined in new ways to make finding ahome far less painful.   One new approach has been taken by HomeView, Needham,Mass., which is building an image database of as many as30,000 homes for sale in the state, and has plans to enter 20more states within a year. Prospective buyers browse througha menu of choices, creating lists of homes based on criteriasuch as price range, school proximity or even being near agolf course. Then the computer gives a visual tour of theproperties, inside and out.   With successive requests, the computer refines homesearches, generating a custom color catalog of homes andnotifying the listing brokers, who give a portion of theircommission to HomeView.   Another innovation -- again, using existing technology innew ways -- is offered by Inpho of Cambridge, Mass. For aflat $5 charge, users can search a vast file of up-to-datepublic records to find the sale date and price of homes intheir area. Simply punch in an address on your phone, and asynthesized voice tells what your new neighbor actually paidfor that house. Previously, that data could be found only bysearching record books in county deed registries.   The service, available in Massachusetts, is scheduled tostart in Rhode Island and Connecticut by summer and shouldbecome more broadly available next year.                                                                                                          Soon, the 64-Bit Chip   Will Jog Huge Memories                                                                                                          FOR NOW, 32-bit chips such as Digital Equipment's VAX orIntel's 386 set the standard for handling quantities of data,but 64-bit chips are coming soon.   The 32-bit design lets the chip work with four billionpieces of data in memory at the same time, like a phonesystem that can reach four billion extensions at once. Butprogrammers working on ever more complex programs are runningout of room, fueling interest in 64-bit chips.   Analysts say that by vastly increasing &quot;directlyaddressable memory,&quot; the 64-bit chip will make suchleading-edge applications as computer visualization andartificial intelligence, which require huge amounts ofmemory, easier to develop and run.   That's because the 64-bit chip doesn't just double theaddress space, but boosts it exponentially, reaching a hugenumber of pieces of data-20 quintillion, or two followed by19 zeroes. &quot;I'll be dead before&quot; anyone has the money forthat much memory, says Richard Sites, co-designer ofDigital's new 64-bit chip.   Other 64-bit designs are on the way. MIPS Computer isbringing out one this year, and International BusinessMachines and others scramble to build their own.   Marc Schulman, analyst for UBS Securities, says that eachtime a transition to larger memory-address capability takesplace, &quot;a new wave of growth is unleashed&quot; in the industry.                                                                                                          New Device Could Lock   The Door on Hackers                                                                                                          THE VIRUS hysteria of recent weeks has given new urgencyto the efforts of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, NorthernTelecom and other makers of office phone systems to protecttheir products from unwanted intruders.   The potential for damage is significant: Criminal hackerscould plant damaging computer viruses, or more commonly,steal tens of thousands of dollars of phone service in aweekend.   Northern Telecom, the second-largest maker of phoneswitches, has just tested a device that could help close thedoor on hackersan electronic lock and key designed byGatekeeper of Dallas to protect key computer and office phonelines.   A researcher in Northern Telecom's Richardson, Texas, labsused sophisticated security software to attempt to crack thedevice, running two computers for five days. The unsuccessfuleffort led him to conclude it would take a hacker workingnonstop 188 days to break the more than one trillion codecombinations. &quot;Most hackers would give up,&quot; or the system'smanager would have discovered the attempt, he says.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          CHIPS based on MIPS Computer Systems Inc.'s 64-bit designbegan to be shipped in volume earlier this year, and computersystems based on the chip will be available this month.Yesterday's edition incorrectly indicated that chips based onMIPS's design weren't yet available.
