He also has a knack for choosing subjects with a broad appeal:What could be more universally interesting than a history of the idea ofhome?;    In &quot;Waiting for the Weekend,&quot; Rybczynski chooses an equallyuniversal subject: leisure. &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot; is about thearchitecture, metaphorically speaking, of our spare time. How did the weekoriginate, Rybczynski wonders, and how does it happen that we divide the weekinto weekdays and weekends? These are good questions, because, as Rybczynskipoints out, most of our measures of time correspond to some seasonal orastronomical variation. With one important exception. &quot;What does the weekmeasure?&quot; Rybczynski asks. &quot;Nothing. At least, nothing visible. No naturalphenomenon occurs every seven days -- nothing happens to the sun, the moon, orthe stars.&quot;;    But something does happen to us. We know so well what thesuccession of days in the week feels like that we are able to say, forinstance, on a Thursday, that it feels like a Friday. We live our lives on aweekly basis, far more than on a yearly or monthly basis. The five-day workweek and two-day weekend rhythm, whose history Rybczynski sets forth, hasgained a kind of primacy that feels completely natural, even though it isentirely man-made.;    &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot; is a book of historicaloddments, bits and pieces of history that swirl around Rybczynski'sfascination with leisure. Nearly all the bits and pieces are interesting. Itis interesting to learn that &quot;until the eighteenth century, Europeans andAmericans enjoyed more free time than they do today,&quot; interesting to learnabout all the calendars of all the cultures that parade by in this book,interesting to be reminded that the most mundane, almost unconscious elementsof our daily -- or weekly -- lives have a history that can be traced, ahistory connecting us with societies in the distant past about which most ofus know all too little.;    And yet &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot; is not verysatisfying to read. In &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;The Most Beautiful House in the World,&quot;Rybczynski may have been writing about ideas, but he was also writing aboutplaces. The very idea of place moves him -- he is an architect, after all --and that allows him to move the reader. But there are only two places of realnote in &quot;Waiting for the Weekend,&quot; Pliny the Younger's retreat at Laurentumand Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon. &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot; comes aliveonly when Rybczynski talks about Laurentum, one of the few places in the bookwhere one can actually feel the respite contained in the idea of leisure.&quot;From his couch,&quot; Rybczynski writes, &quot;Pliny could enjoy views on three sides:adjacent woods, neighboring villas, and the sea itself. Here, undisturbed bythe bustle of his household, he could retire to read and write, or indulge, ashe once wrote, in that indolent but agreeable condition of doing nothing.&quot; Bycontrast, Rybczynski's evocation of scenes and places from his own life seemsfaint.;    In &quot;Waiting for the Weekend,&quot; Rybczynski is a great summoner offacts. Those who like lots of information from all over the map will like thisbook. But it is one thing to array facts, and another to give them meaning. Hequotes widely, learnedly, from the literature of leisure -- some surprisingnames turn up -- but the book remains somewhat perfunctory. His facts, hisquotations, never resonate -- they don't add up. Rybczynski's ability inearlier books to make complex ideas sound self-evident often dwindles here torestating the obvious.;    Strange to say -- and it is a mark of this book'sfailure -- Rybczynski makes his subject less interesting than it might havebeen. He moves too quickly over too broad a geographical range and through toodeep an historical survey. He has too little to say about some of the mostinteresting forms of leisure, like gardening and reading -- which he discussesin absurdly little detail -- and hunting and fishing, which he does notdiscuss at all. He has nearly nothing to say about leisure in the lives ofwomen, who have never had much.;    What should have been a big, summer Sundayafternoon kind of book turns out in the end to be a little thin, a little tooTuesday or Wednesday.
