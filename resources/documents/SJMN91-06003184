Only 18 percentof men report exercising as often.;    That means a growing market of femaleconsumers. &quot;Right now I don't think there is any major athletic company thatis not sensitive to the fact that women are important to business,&quot; saidThomas Doyle, director of information and research for the association.;    Aswomen have taken a leadership role in activities such as aerobic dance andexercise walking, some women entrepreneurs have concentrated their efforts ondesigning and marketing athletic apparel for bodies like their own. Thesesmaller companies are successfully competing for their share of the market.;   &quot;There's a lot of good products out there,&quot; says Ellen Wessel, president ofMoving Comfort, a manufacturer of women's running apparel. &quot;There are just nota lot of companies making women their focus.&quot;;    In 1977, Wessel was amarathon runner logging 70 miles a week but was unable to find clothes thatfit. &quot;You go through a period of time thinking you're too fat, too thin, toothis or that instead of realizing the clothing is really the problem,&quot; Wesselrecalls.;    She ended up designing her own running clothes, and the styleswere so popular that she started a custom clothing business. With aprofessional seamstress as her partner, Wessel began making clothing forsporting goods chains such as Lady Foot Locker and Herman's World of SportingGoods.;    Last year the company, based in Springfield, Va., had sales of $5million. &quot;I guess we're just lucky to be part of the baby boom bulge. Werepresent a lot of people's lifestyles,&quot; said Wessel, who is 39.;    Anotherdesigner who was at the forefront of such lifestyle changes was Gilda Marx, amother and housewife who began teaching exercise classes from the patio of herSan Fernando Valley home in the '60s.;    Over the years the 54-year-old Marxhas taught her brand of aerobic exercise to celebrities including Jane Fonda,Richard Simmons, Barbra Streisand, Shirley MacLaine, Brooke Shields andMadonna.;    In 1977 Marx introduced the Flexatard, a four-way stretch knitgarment that molds to the body. It proved to be a flattering style for womenwith imperfect figures. &quot;I really tapped into the psychology of the market,knowing that if a person feels good and likes the way they look, they will bemuch more disciplined regarding the activity,&quot; Marx says.;    Gilda Marxapparel is sold in 5,000 retail outlets and had sales of $38 million lastyear. Her unitards and capri tights have provided inspiration for Donna Karan,who recently bought a half dozen unitards and $500 worth of capri leggings inMarx's New York showroom.;    Meanwhile, success in the competitive athleticmarket, which includes the likes of Nike, Reebok, Avia and Hind, also meanskeeping up with the latest fabric technologies.;    Marx recently introducedBreathables, a liner with a Coolmax panel developed by DuPont that wicksmoisture away from the skin. The material, incorporated into all of Marx'ssilhouettes, has been shown to be successful in helping prevent yeastinfections.;    Marx points to the Breathables line as an example of why it isimportant to have women designing for women. &quot;It is a sensitive conversation.Why would a man think about it? I, being one who wears tight-fitting clothingwhen I exercise, would think about it and want to help women with thisterrible problem.&quot;;    Likewise, some women become just a bit tongue-tiedtrying to describe to a 16-year-old boy at the sporting goods store what typeof support they need from a sports bra.;    &quot;I always thought a good pair ofshoes and a good bra are the two things women need most when they do any kindof athletics,&quot; said Hinda Miller, a former theatrical costume designer andpresident of JBI Inc., creators of the original Jogbra.;    Miller didn't havemuch trouble finding a pair of shoes, but she had a tough time finding a bra.In 1977, Miller and partner Lisa Lindahl created the first Jogbra by sewingtwo athletic supporters together.;    Today, the Jogbra is made of a stretchycotton-Lycra blend that fits over the head and has crossed straps in back toavoid slipping. Other features include no hooks and seams sewn to the outsideto avoid chafing.;    In July, the independent company, based in Williston,Vt., became a division of Playtex Apparel Inc. The Jogbra is available insporting goods stores, while an early version of the Jogbra is part of acostume display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JILL WENDHOLT SILVA, The Kansas City Star  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910103  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  910  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 3, 199100003184,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
