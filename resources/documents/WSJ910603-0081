Whizzing at 70 m.p.h. through the empty streets of thisnorthwest Alabama town, he scarcely slows down even after heenters Reynolds Metals Co.'s aluminum rolling plant here,where he is the manufacturing manager.</LP><TEXT>   The night superintendent is waiting with his report. Ahinge broke on the coating plant's truck door and a valveproblem threatens to shut down the hot line. The baler isdown and scrap is piling up outside. One furnace has stalled,and the bolts are disintegrating on another. On top of that,the production staff is bickering with maintenance andaccounting, the union has filed a grievance against aforeman, and a customer is coming for a tour.   To his business-school classmates now in marketing orfinance, Mr. Moore's job might seem like punishment. But notto Mr. Moore. &quot;I put up with the headaches, because when Iget home I can say, `We made something today,'&quot; says Mr.Moore, a warm, ebullient man of 38. &quot;You can't have a serviceeconomy without a manufacturing base -- you've got to makesomething to generate that dollar.&quot;   But his is a rare sentiment these days. Lured by highersalaries and comfortable offices, the best and brightestusually overlook manufacturing jobs.   &quot;The rewards and financial incentives do not exist forsomeone to stay within the manufacturing sector,&quot; says RobertJ. O'Meara, a consultant with A.T. Kearney Inc. who recentlyfinished a study on the subject with the National Associationof Manufacturers. &quot;Without these incentives, we run the riskof being manufacturing dinosaurs in the 21st century.&quot;   The study found that only 59% of American engineeringgraduates go into manufacturing, compared with over 70% inJapan. Perhaps with good reason. According to a survey bymanagement consultants Towers Perrin, a U.S. manufacturingmanager like Mr. Moore makes an average of $91,713 a year,while a top marketing executive in a similar-size operationearns an average of $229,678 and a controller $159,368. InJapan, the Kearney study found, the salaries among suchexecutives are roughly equivalent.   And because most manufacturers won't recruit managers withnon-technical backgrounds, only some 15% of all collegegraduates take manufacturing jobs, according to aNorthwestern University survey. &quot;Manufacturers are losing outon some excellent sources of talent,&quot; says Victor R.Lindquist, the school's dean of placement.   Even once inside manufacturing companies, those who chooseto work in production often find their paths blocked. Onlyfive of Reynolds Metals' 25 executive officers came from theplants, and all four of the chief executives in the company'shistory (three of them Reynolds family members) came fromsales backgrounds.   But Mr. Moore keeps trying. The son of a jet mechanic whogrew up in Atlanta and a small Virginia town, Herman W. MooreIII majored in industrial engineering at the University ofDayton. He worked in the plants as an engineer in Reynolds'smanagement training program before taking a staff job at theRichmond, Va., headquarters. While there, he took nightclasses at the University of Richmond's business school,earning his M.B.A. in 1982.   It wasn't any love of manufacturing that sent Mr. Mooreback to the plants -- he just figured it was the best way toclimb the corporate ladder. So in 1985, when a superintendentposition opened up at a reclamation plant in Muscle Shoals,Mr. Moore applied, over the objections of his wife, pregnantwith their second child. &quot;I told her we'd be in Alabama two,three maybe four years,&quot; recalls Mr. Moore, sturdily builtwith prematurely gray hair. In the early days after moving toMuscle Shoals, hours from the nearest cities of Birmingham orNashville, Mr. Moore often came home to find his wife cryingon the couch with their newborn son, (though she now likesthe area).   But for Mr. Moore, from the first, the plant held anappeal he never expected to find. &quot;I was full of admirationfor the hourly workers and foremen who were making thingshappen,&quot; he says. After years in stuffy conference rooms, Mr.Moore liked the unpretentious dress and the quick,no-nonsense meetings.   The admiration was mutual. The plant's scrap rate and itsoverall costs improved under Mr. Moore, and after a year, hewon a promotion to become manager of Southern ReclamationCo., Reynolds's newly opened plant for recycling cans.   There, Mr. Moore had a tougher task. The plant wasoperating at only 40% of capacity. Its costs weren'tcompetitive with rivals, and it wasn't getting much business.Mr. Moore lured top industrial engineers away from otherplants with better pay and promotions. He developed teams tocut costs and improve quality and safety, and petitionedheadquarters for a new $2.5 million de-lacquering machine.   The results came quickly. After two years the 60-workerplant was at 100% of capacity. It had increased itsefficiency by 35%.   After setting records for profit, shipments, recovery,energy conservation and productivity, the plant in 1989 wonthe Chairman's Award for Quality, Reynolds's top recognition.   By 1990, a triumphant Mr. Moore was ready to turn back toheadquarters. But headquarters wasn't ready for him. The onlyjobs he could get were the same staff jobs he had before. &quot;Isaw no movement in my division,&quot; he says. Instead, Reynoldsmade him the plant superintendent, second in command, at thenearby Alloys Plant.   Reynolds's largest plant, with revenue of over $1 billionand some 2,100 employees, Alloys makes aluminum sheet forcans, siding and appliances. It converts scrap and moltenaluminum into 15-ton, 26-inch-thick bars of aluminum ingot,and then rolls them through a series of presses that turnthem into coils of sheet that can be less than 1/100 inchthick.   Built in 1941 as part of the war effort, the Alloys plantis a living monument in a graveyard of manufacturingfailures. On either side of it are gray, hulking sisterplants that Reynolds closed in the 1980s. Weeds sproutthrough the vacant parking lot of the smelter that onceemployed 1,600 and the bar, rod and wire plant that kept 200workers busy. Both succumbed to high labor and energy costs;much of that production has been moved to Canada oreliminated.   But the Alloys plant was spared: Reynolds chose to pump itup with $430 million in the last three years for capitalimprovements, $125 million of which is going to a new &quot;casthouse&quot; that Mr. Moore is overseeing.   The new cast house, which uses tilting furnaces andelectromagnetic methods to stir and set the molten aluminum,raised capacity 30% while cutting costs 39%; it uses farfewer furnaces than the old house, and half as many workers.Since 1990, the plant has cut 105 jobs, and is planning tocut another 120 this year. Under Mr. Moore, the plant hasalso automated its process controls -- reducing the rate ofdefects by as much as two-thirds.   Mr. Moore says he is equally concerned with non-technicalimprovements. &quot;Before, a manufacturing manager wasresponsible for getting a pound out the door,&quot; he says. &quot;Nowyou have to get the pound out the door in a safe, quality,cost-effective and environmental manner.&quot; He must also woocustomers, hold his own at headquarters, and deal with 15separate unions (even though Alabama is a right-to-workstate, the Alloys plant has been a union shop since it openedin 1941). &quot;We're in it together,&quot; says Mr. Moore.   &quot;Herman's a new breed,&quot; says Wilt Wagner, a Reynolds vicepresident and Mr. Moore's boss. &quot;When he disagrees with me,I'm going to hear about it.&quot;   Before his first day on the job, Mr. Moore assembled hissuperintendents for a meeting to ask them about theirfamilies and their hobbies, and then took them golfing. Onthe job, he routinely visits the &quot;graveyard&quot; and weekendshifts, and knows workers in every department by name. &quot;Otherguys get high on the totem poll and don't come down here,&quot;says Ford McNatt, a 46-year veteran of the cast house, &quot;butHerman's all right. He gets out and rubs bellies with us.&quot;   When top executives from Richmond come to town, Mr. Moorehas the hourly workers make the presentations. He alsoinstituted regular tours of the plant for workers conductedby their peers so they could see how their efforts bear onthe final product. &quot;Nobody ever showed me that before,&quot; saidFrank Glover, 58, after completing his first tour in 39years.   Arriving by 6:45 on a typical morning, Mr. Moore offers aperfunctory wave to his colleagues in suits in the frontoffice, then hops onto his golf cart and heads to his office,which looks like a cheaply refurbished basement. He takes thenight supervisor's report, directs his assistant to puttogether a slide presentation, scans 40 of the latestproduction numbers on his computer, dons his safety clothesand dashes to the morning meeting at the cast house.   Mr. Moore listens to his day supervisors: Four ofyesterday's ingots came out cracked, but despite the start-upglitches, the cast house is three months ahead of schedule.So after a half-hour strategy meeting juggling productionschedules and coordinating his superintendents, he wheels bythe controller's office to check last month's performanceagainst his targets. He is responsible for 16 objectives,from scrap variance and overtime reduction to employeetraining and lost workday cases. He's ahead in shipments, but1% behind in inventory reduction, 2% behind on deliveryperformances, and 1% behind on returned goods.   No time for lunch, Mr. Moore takes a &quot;Sno-ball&quot; from thevending machine and turns his cart toward the weekly qualitymeeting. Two customers have reported record production, butanother complains that defective metal shut down its lines.Next, he's swinging through his office to check the pile ofphone messages, but without answering them he's off to theafternoon staff meeting (other days it's the weeklyproduction or safety meeting).   Inside, a blend of frenzied jargon: &quot;Change the two-Js . .. testing is holding up the MD301 . . . No. 5 is down . . . Ican't run it at 45% . . . we've got to hit that 80 million .. . we're running out of time here]&quot; But Mr. Moore (Herman toall in the plant) doesn't seem fazed. &quot;We'll keep smiling andget through 'em,&quot; he says in his soft Virginia drawl to endthe meeting. &quot;You've got to be able to sit back and laugh,&quot;says Mr. Moore, who takes inspiration from a Jimmy Buffettlyric, &quot;If we weren't all crazy we would go insane.&quot;   Next, he swings through the new cast house, making sure tochat with the department's union steward in anticipation ofnext week's annual union-management conference. Soon, he'soff to hear a presentation from a team of hourly workers thatwants the plant to use a new wooden guide on the slittingmachines. Some 28 teams came up with 264 such ideas lastyear.   It's late, but Mr. Moore wants to check in with thecoating workers (still cooling down from a recent labordispute), and to stop in the front office to see how theengineers are coming with his presentation for the customervisit and the Reynolds divisional meeting. Twelve hours afterhe arrived, he is heading home with his beeper and abriefcase full of reports to read after dinner. &quot;I think heborders on hyper,&quot; says his wife, Gail.   After hours, it's not always calm. Last month he wascalled in at 1 a.m after some workers were burned when amachine jammed. He was called back from out of town last yearwhen the hydraulic valves failed and shut down the entirerolling line. He has weathered a snowstorm that burst thepipes and a heat wave that saw the power company threaten tocut off the plant's power.   With such a pace, Mr. Moore says he hasn't had time tothink about how far he is past the four-year limit he put onstaying in operations. And he realizes it may be a lot longerstill before headquarters calls. &quot;Eventually, it would get towhere it bothers you,&quot; he says. But for now, he's satisfied.   &quot;I could be in finance and have a $125 million portfolioto hold, but here I have $125 million to build a plant andsee ingot coming out of it,&quot; he says. &quot;I can't save Americanmanufacturing, but at least I'm doing my part to make itpossible.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
