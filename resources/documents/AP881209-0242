On other markets, coffee, cattle, pork, energy andprecious-metals futures all gained; grains and soybeans were mixed;and stock-index futures retreated.   Sugar for delivery in March settled .55 cent higher at 11.86cents a pound, the highest daily settlement since Aug. 5, on rumorsthat the Brazilian Alcohol and Sugar Institute was preparing toannounce a diversion of substantially more sugar cane fromsugar-making to alcohol production.   Brazil has embraced the use of gasohol _ an automobile fuel madefrom gasoline and alcohol _ like no other country. A recent OPECagreement to limit crude-oil production has pushed oil and gasolineprices higher, which in turn has led to speculation that Brazil willrenew its efforts to encourage gasohol use, analysts said.   If the government-run Alcohol and Sugar Institute does indeedannounce a greater diversion of sugar cane to alcohol productionscheduled for release on Monday, ``obviously that would mean lesssugar would be available for exporting purposes,'' said ArthurStevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in NewYork.   Sugar prices had fallen earlier in the week on speculation thatBrazil would soon emerge as a large-volume seller of sugar on theworld market.   ``This has really turned that situation upside down,'' Stevensonsaid.   Brazilian concerns also fueled a strong rally in the coffeemarket. It's been a dry spring so far in Brazil, the world's largestcoffee producer, and fears of drought damage to the 1988-89Brazilian coffee crop have begun to surface.   Meanwhile, the weather in Columbia, the No. 2 coffee producer,has been extremely wet, hampering the harvest of the 1987-88 coffeecrop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.in New York.   Coffee settled .29 cent to 1.60 cent higher with March at $1.2727a pound.   Livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange on bullish signals from the cash markets,including the first signs of a significant drop in hog slaughterssince early 1987.   Hog kills for the day totaled 337,000 compared to 339,000 a yearago, and kills for the week totaled 1.881 million vs. 1.879 milliona year ago.   The current figures were closer to year-ago figures than themarket has seen in more than a year, and the weekly total was about3 percent below the previous week, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst inNew York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Pork futures traders have been expecting a slowdown in slaughtersfor some time, he said, adding: ``anyone with bullish aspirationshad to be licking their lips today.''   Live cattle settled .95 cent to 1.10 cents higher with Decemberat 71.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to 1.08 centshigher with January at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to1.13 cents higher with December at 41.60 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .85 cent to 1.23 cents higher with February at 43.25cents a pound.
