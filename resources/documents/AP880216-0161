Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak also said more than 200 Israelis had beeninjured, most of them lightly, since Arab riots began Dec. 8 in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said 53 Palestinians had beenkilled, but the United Nations puts the number at 54.   Barak and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin confirmed that somesoldiers used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians alive nearNablus in the West Bank. The general declared: ``This pattern ofbehavior ... is totally unacceptable under the standards of theIsraeli Defense Forces and any civilized norms. Whoever is foundresponsible for this event will be punished.''   Neighbors rescued the four Arabs shortly after they were buried.   Young Palestinians set fire to a bus Tuesday, burned tires andbuilt road blocks in the occupied territories and Arab eastJerusalem, where a general strike virtually closed down Arabcommunities and neighborhoods.   Riot police stopped a bus carrying Israeli Arab high schoolstudents from school in Haifa to their homes in Umm al Fahm andbeat several of them, the daily newspaper Al Hamishmar reported.   An official at Umm al Fahm confirmed the report to TheAssociated Press. Police declined comment.   Transport Minister Chaim Corfu appeared to suggest Israel bombeda ferry that was to carry Arab deportees from a Cyprus port toIsrael. If the Palestine Liberation Organization obtained anothervessel, he said, ``Its fate will be the same.''   ``We knew we wouldn't allow the boat to reach Israel,'' he saidon Israel radio. ``If we could prevent its departure, that wasobviously the right thing to do.''   In the West Bank, a soldier punched and shoved an Israelicameraman working for NBC News.   The soldier said he asked the cameraman, Ofir Moradov, to stopfilming a protest, but NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher saidMoradov did not hear the request. The army said the soldier wasconvicted of ``unbecoming conduct,'' but would not reveal his nameor the sentence.   Barak said soldiers had not choice but to use beatings in anattempt to curb the riots.   ``Whatever amount of force is needed ... is something that in myjudgment is forced upon us by the situation,'' he told a newsconference of foreign reporters.   ``We can't easily put the realities of life into a simple set oforders. The situation created during the control of a violent riotis much more complicated than it might seem.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on a visit to Italy: ``Wewant to put an end to the riots and restore normal life. On theother hand, we don't want to kill people. ... I hope in the nearweeks we will find the most right methods.''   ``We have to handle it in the most human limitations,'' he said,addressing a news conference in English. ``We have to defendourselves and at the same time continue our efforts for findingpeace.''   Rabin, questioned about the beating policy during debate inParliament, said the orders to use force were necessary and ``tothe best of my knowledge and judgment, are legal.''   He said the burial of the Arabs at Nablus ``will be treated withthe full heaviness of the law. It's not imaginable that such anincident would happen in the Israeli army.''   Barak said the army is succeeding in ``gradually (improving) thecaliber of behavior of our forces,'' but added: ``We areconfronting a new type of threat. We cannot afford to yield to it,and we are not going to.''   He said protesters are ``led by a nucleus of activists who enjoythe support and cooperation of the masses.''   ``The organization is on the local, sometimes regional, level,''he said, and the core consists of ``two or three thousandrelatively young people.''   The general, who directed military intelligence in 1983-86, saidhe sees no quick end to the disturbances. He attributed the riotsto ``decades of frustration on the personal, economic and politicallevels,'' not outside incitement.   Five people were wounded by gunfire and 12 injured by rubberbullets or beatings at the Fawwar refugee camp, where about 4,000Palestinians live near Hebron in the West Bank, said officials atHebron's Alia hospital. One described the wounds as ``moderate tolight.''   Israel radio said a riot started Tuesday evening and residentsstoned Israeli soldiers, who fired several shots and wounded oneprotester. The military command said it was checking the reports.   In Kabatiyeh, a West Bank village 35 miles north of Jerusalem,soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters and wounded two youngArabs in the legs, the Arab-run Palestine Press Service reported.It said another Palestinian was wounded during a protest in nearbyJenin.   Doctors at Jenin hospital confirmed treating three men forgunshot wounds.   Army officials reported a protester wounded at Kabatiyeh afterhe tried to wrest a gun from a soldier, but said they had noinformation about other shootings.</TEXT></DOC>
