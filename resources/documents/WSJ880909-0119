Last month, Union Pacific said it was taking bids for the refinery, whose daily output of about 100,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel and other products is sold mainly to independent marketers in California, Nevada and Arizona.    Drew Lewis, chairman of the transportation and natural-resources concern, said the sale was a &quot;very positive step. It gives us the latitude to redeploy some or all of these assets into businesses which align better with our strategic objectives.&quot;    Ultramar agreed to offer employment to all the 450 employees of the refinery on terms &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to those under which they have been employed by Union Pacific, an Ultramar spokesman said.    The British concern retails gasoline and diesel fuel through its Beacon Oil Co. unit in northern and central California, and is the dominant retailer of motor fuel in Quebec under the Ultramar name.    Ultramar said it will finance the acquisition through a combination of borrowings and a rights issue that will raise about #130 million ($221 million).    The British concern's decision to buy the Union Pacific refinery follows last month's purchase of North Sea-based Blackfriars Oil andamp; Gas Ltd. from Associated Newspapers Holdings PLC for #143 million.    &quot;This new addition gives us the balance we seek between upstream in the North Sea and Indonesia and downstream in Canada and California,&quot; Ultramar Chairman John Darby said in London.    The Wilmington refinery had operating profit of $32.2 million in 1987, up from $18.3 million in 1986. Revenue rose to $734.3 million last year from $666.9 million a year earlier.    The acquisition is conditional upon U.S. regulatory approval. The usual requirement to obtain approval of the Ultramar shareholders was waived by London's stock exchange because of the difficulty of convening an extraordinary general meeting amid the British postal strike, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
