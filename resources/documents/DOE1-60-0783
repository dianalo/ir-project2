These include the multiplicity of gene origins, withtheir corresponding different haplotypes and &quot;fellow-traveller&quot; genes;the presence of at least one (and probably many other) epistatic non-linkedgenes; and the vagaries of gene flow that mixed and rearranged the frequenciesof the original {beta}/sup S/ linked-haplotypes and other genes involved.This situation has created at least three layers of genetic variability,explaining the striking diversity in individual and geographically-specificphenotypic expression of sickle cell anemia.</TEXT></DOC>
