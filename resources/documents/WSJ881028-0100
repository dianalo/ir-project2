The Democratic contender will step up attacks on Bush's proposal to cut capital-gains taxes. Democrats chortle that Bush mistakenly claimed most of this cut would go to taxpayers making under $50,000; in fact, nearly 75% of the benefits would go to persons making over $200,000. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows the public, by 53% to 39%, disapproves of the state of the economy.    The poll shows that Dukakis has cut Bush's lead in half, mainly by appealing to blue-collar workers and Reagan Democrats sympathetic to the economic arguments, reversing Bush's lead with both. But social issues, especially crime, still hurt Dukakis. A New Jersey win is out of reach and the Democratic Senate seat is threatened.    One faint ray of hope for the dispirited Democrats: Quayle's standing, according to the Journal/NBC poll, continues to plummet.    BRADY'S BUNCH at Treasury bones up for after the election.    New Treasury Secretary Brady, who is likely to stay in a Bush term, holds brainstorming sessions to discuss future policies. Topics include taxes, the dollar, Third World debt and the deficit. Brady seeks ways to cut the deficit without raising taxes and wants modest changes in the administration's plan for handling debtor nations.    Despite Bush's jibes at Harvard's &quot;liberal boutique,&quot; Brady recruits two Harvard business professors from his stock-market task force. Colleagues say Brady is a fast learner, but some worry that he lacks Washington savvy. Referring to wily Richard Darman, the former deputy Treasury secretary, one agency veteran says what Brady needs &quot;is a Darman type.&quot;    HUSSEIN'S ENDORSEMENT adds a wild card to the Israeli elections.    One U.S. pollster in Israel says the Jordanian king's backing of Peres's peace plan helps the Labor candidate. But Shamir supporters charge blatant interference and hope for a backlash. U.S. analysts believe the race for prime minister is so close that a stalemate is likely, with neither candidate able to form a government. Israel's Arab voters could be a key for Peres.    U.S. officials steer clear of Israeli election politics but privately pull for a Peres win. They see it as the only hope to get peace talks started. One senior PLO official already has threatened violence if Shamir wins. Shamir vows, if elected, to build more Jewish settlements on the West Bank.    &quot;If Shamir wins, it will be a real heartburn for the next American president,&quot; warns Mideast expert Geoffrey Kemp of the Carnegie Endowment.    READ OUR LIPS: Would Bush agree to raising taxes? Robert Strauss, co-chairman of a bipartisan deficit panel, is cheered by a phone talk with Bush campaign chairman James Baker after Strauss's indiscreet remarks on the need for a tax increase. And Wall Streeters say Bush adviser Darman has privately suggested that Bush might accept higher taxes, although Darman denies it.    MUGGING MIKE: GOP efforts to paint Dukakis as weak on crime pay off handsomely. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows voters by 56% to 27% believe Bush would be tougher on crime. In August, before the Bush negative drive, the poll gave Dukakis a 41% to 36% edge on the crime issue.    SCANDAL REBOUND? San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros will resume campaigning to help Dukakis win Hispanic votes in Texas. The married mayor took himself off the campaign after disclosures that he had had an affair. Cisneros got a standing ovation at a Houston debate this week, and admirers hope his new nickname will be &quot;Teflon Henry.&quot;    BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: Bush, if elected president, is unlikely to be open with the media. As a candidate, he holds few press conferences and has rejected a Harvard study -- endorsed by Ford and Carter as well as by Dukakis -- calling for regular White House news conferences.    DEMOCRATS EXPECT to at least hold their own in state elections.    The party probably will score a net gain of two or three governorships, widening its 26-24 edge. Republicans face problems in Rhode Island with a scandal-tarred incumbent; in Utah, where the governor raised taxes; and with West Virginia Gov. Moore. The Democrats' best bet may be Indiana with Evan Bayh, son of the former senator. The GOP sees a win in Montana.    Democrats expect to do much better in the state legislatures than they did in 1984, when they lost more than 300 seats. But their 3-to-2 advantage may be trimmed. Major battles: in California, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. Both parties want to gain seats, to position themselves for the 1990 elections and post-census reapportionment.    The presidential race has little impact on the governorships, argues analyst Charles Cook: Most &quot;revolve around local issues, and the Democrats have better candidates this year.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: GOP Sen. Simpson charges that Dukakis's defense position &quot;has more loose ends than a $10 hairpiece.&quot; . . . More Bushspeak: The vice president tells a Detroit audience that America's freedom is &quot;the example to which the world expires.&quot; . . . Nixon's office mails out copies of an article by British historian Paul Johnson entitled, &quot;In Praise of Richard Nixon.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
