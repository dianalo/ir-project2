An unexpectedly grim employment report Friday increasedthe chances that the Fed will reduce rates by at least aquarter of a percentage point, or possibly even half apercentage point, over the next few weeks, analysts say. Somethink the Fed, eager to avoid a possible economic relapseduring an election year, might even cut rates as soon as thisweek.                                                                                                          &quot;The Fed will have to do something soon because there'ssuch widespread weakness in the economy,&quot; says DeborahJohnson, senior vice president at C.J. Lawrence Inc. &quot;Theemployment report was horrendous.&quot;   The Labor Department reported that 91,000 jobs vanished inJanuary and that the average work week fell. Prior to thereport, analysts were expecting an increase in non-farmpayroll jobs. The civilian unemployment rate remainedunchanged at 7.1%.   Some strategists contend that the Fed already has doneenough to revive the economy, and that additional rate cutscould even backfire by arousing inflation fears. Money-supplygrowth has surged lately, strengthening the position of thoseofficials within the Fed who favor a wait-and-see approach.And Fed officials may want to delay further action to seewhat kind of tax cut emerges from Congress.   But there have been enough false economic starts over thepast year that many economists believe the Fed won't take anychances this time around -- especially since a mistake couldcost the Republicans the White House. Also, even if theeconomy is starting to revive, most analysts think therecovery will be anemic.   The January employment report was &quot;depressing,&quot; saysRobert Brusca, senior vice president of Nikko Securities Co.International. He argues that the Fed hasn't cut rates nearlyenough to lift the economy out of its rut, and thus will trimrates soon, probably this week.   &quot;Typically, to end recessions, the Federal Reserve hasneeded to push the federal funds rate down below the rate ofinflation,&quot; Mr. Brusca says. He estimates inflation now isonly about 3%. &quot;So even though everyone's perception is thatshort-term interest rates are low, they're actually quitehigh&quot; when compared to inflation, he says.   Reflecting widespread speculation that the Fed will cutinterest rates soon, yields fell Friday on short-termTreasury bills and notes. The yield on two-year notes, whichstood at 5.03% late Thursday, tumbled to 4.91% late Friday.Long-term bond prices initially soared, and yields fell, onspeculation of an imminent Fed move to cut rates. But afterthe Fed did nothing, bond prices immediately nosedived.Longterm Treasury bonds ended the day only slightly above theprevious day's levels.   If the Fed cuts rates quickly, it could help the Treasuryreduce the government's borrowing costs. This week, theTreasury will sell three-year notes, 10-year notes and30-year bonds in three separate auctions, starting tomorrow,in the government's huge quarterly refunding. As of lateFriday, existing three-year notes yielded 5.36%, 10-yearnotes 7.17%, and 30-year bonds 7.76%.   Some strategists were less impressed by the grimemployment news than by anecdotal evidence that the economyis beginning to revive. Among these is Edward S. Hyman, ahighly regarded Wall Street economist who is president of ISIGroup Inc.   &quot;I'm switching my story; I think the economy is turning upand interest rates are going up over the next few months,&quot;Mr. Hyman says. He predicts long-term Treasury bond yields&quot;are going to go up to 8% and maybe higher in coming months.&quot;   But Mr. Hyman doesn't expect rates to remain that high forlong. &quot;I think the upturn in the economy will produce atemporary inflation scare&quot; that will lead to &quot;a sell-off inwhat will turn out to be a longterm bull market&quot; for bonds,he says. &quot;I'm still intrinsically bullish on bonds becauseinflation is still so low.&quot;   Asked what advice he would give investors thinking aboutbuying at this week's Treasury auctions, Mr. Hyman says:&quot;Don't. Wait a while longer before buying. There will bebetter opportunities&quot; in a few months.   Gary N. Coburn, senior managing director of the PutnamCos. in Boston, thinks the Fed will cut rates again, but notanytime soon. &quot;The Fed will take a wait-and-see approach&quot; toallow more time to evaluate whether previous rate cuts havebeen sufficient, he says.   However, Mr. Coburn says the Fed eventually will reducerates because &quot;the economy over the next several months isgoing to be very sluggish. The signs of recovery out thereare tenuous enough that they {Fed officials} will want tomake sure they get it {the economy} on track. We don't wantto have another false start.&quot;   Mr. Coburn also expects further declines in long-term bondyields. &quot;The market probably overreacted to a feeling thatthe recovery was going to be stronger, and I do not thinkthat will be the case,&quot; he says. Also, all the latest dataindicate inflation is &quot;very low. That's absolutely key&quot; tothe interest-rate outlook. &quot;In that environment, long-terminterest rates can come down,&quot; with Treasury bonds falling tothe 7.25% to 7.5% range.   Alan D. Levenson of the WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,argues that the Fed &quot;is likely&quot; to trim the federal fundsrate by a quarter of a percentage point early this week. Thefunds rate is what banks charge each other for overnightloans.   &quot;Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the centralbank will opt for a more aggressive&quot; move of half apercentage point, a WEFA report says. &quot;Such action wouldforce a further reduction in banks' prime lending rate, whichin turn would reduce consumer and business borrowing costsimmediately.&quot; The prime, or base, rate at major banks now is6.5%.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Short-term interest rates dropped in reaction to asurprisingly gloomy employment report and intense speculationthat the Federal Reserve will cut rates again soon.   But bond prices took an extraordinarily volatile ride.Treasury bond prices initially soared in reaction to theJanuary employment report, only to plummet later in the dayafter the Federal Reserve took no immediate action to cutrates.   At one stage early in the day, Treasury bonds were up by afull point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount, fromThursday's closing levels. Later, they were trading as muchas 3/8 point below Thursday's levels.   Late in the day, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondswere quoted at 102 22/ 32 to yield 7.76%, little changed fromThursday. Two-year notes rose to 99 29/32 to yield 4.91%,compared with 99 22/32 Thursday. Rates also fell onshort-term Treasury bills.   Early in the session, the Labor Department reported thatnon-farm payroll employment plummeted 91,000 in January, incontrast to the 33,000 increase projected on average byeconomists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Thenews, coupled with the drop in the average workweek, led toexpectations that the Fed would ease policy quickly.   But with federal funds changing hands at 3 13/16% Fridaymorning, well below the 4% target in place since lateDecember, the Fed moved to drain reserves from the bankingsystem by arranging matched sale-purchase agreements. Thatwas interpreted by traders as a clear signal that creditpolicy was unchanged, at least for the day.   Meanwhile, more big companies sold new debt issues to takeadvantage of lower rates. Among them were Mobil Corp. andRalston Purina Co. Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as muchas 3/8 lower amid lethargic trading.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
