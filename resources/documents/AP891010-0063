The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that DennisKohl's ouster from the program did not amount to illegaldiscrimination against the handicapped.   Aside from his retardation, Kohl is blind and an active carrierof the hepatitis B virus. According to court records, he frequentlyexhibits maladaptive behavior such as biting and scratching.   Hepatitis B is one cause of hepatitis, an infection thatprimarily affects the liver. Although the transmission of hepatitisB is not fully understood, most medical experts agree it istransmitted through body fluids.   Kohl lived at the Woodhaven Learning Center in Columbia, Mo.,for three months in 1984, until he was discharged. The center isrun in conjunction with the Woodhaven School, which provideseducational and vocational programs for handicapped people.   Kohl was dismissed from the Missouri programs because he is acarrier of a contagious disease.   Both the learning center and school receive federal funding,making them subject to a 1973 federal law protecting handicappedpeople from bias.   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Kohl'sdismissal was not a violation of the 1973 law.   The costs of inoculating all staff members and patients at thefacilities to protect them against catching hepatitis from Kohl aretoo high to be reasonable, the appeals court said.   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Kohl and his parentsargued that the appeals court's ruling conflicts with a 1987Supreme Court decision that people with contagious diseases areprotected by the 1973 law.   The justices two years ago said recipients of federal aid maynot discriminate against people with contagious diseases if thosepeople are ``otherwise qualified'' to work or take part in someprogram or activity.   The 1987 decision said, ``A person who poses a significant riskof communicating an infectious disease to others ... will not beotherwise qualified ... if reasonable accommodations will noteliminate that risk.''   Kohl's appeal said the 8th Circuit court ignored medicaljudgments about what represents ``reasonable accommodations'' inhis case.   ``In the face of a national AIDS epidemic and the hysteria ithas engendered, the 8th Circuit's misinterpretation of (the 1987high court ruling) erodes the substantive protections provided by(the 1973 law) to both contagious individuals and the publicitself,'' the appeal said.   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a deadly viraldisease that can kill its victims by destroying their immune systemand leaving them vulnerable to other diseases.   The case is Kohl vs. Woodhaven Learning Center, 89-240.</TEXT></DOC>
