(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A pet bull named Fernando wandered froma pasture and trapped five people in a convenience store for 45minutes, until a veterinarian shot him with a tranquilizer dart.   No one was injured in the escapade Wednesday, but it promptedthe owner of the 1,500-pound Jersey bull to make plans for his salenext week.   The 2-year-old bull hemmed in customers at the Country Market,charging the building, gasoline pumps and denting a pickup truck,said store manager Linda Eshuis.   ``It was as scared as it was angry,'' Trooper Ken Van Kootensaid.   Fernando broke through a barbed wire fence to escape the nearbypasture.   The pet's owner, Ishmael Gomberoff, was called to the store,along with veterinarian Gordon Plotts, who tranquilized the bull. Agroggy Fernando eventually followed his owner home.   Gomberoff was charged with allowing the bull on a right of way.   ``He's just a sweetheart,'' Wayne Davis, an employee ofGomberoff's, said. ``He's so tame when he's not around fillingstations.''</TEXT></DOC>
