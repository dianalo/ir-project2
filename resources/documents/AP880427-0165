The system is expected to provide clearer and more definedvision than can be produced by conventional eye treatment. It mayhelp an estimated 2.5 million people whose vision can't be improvedby other means.   The device will not restore sight to those who are completelyblind, or improve nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism,researchers at Johns Hopkins' Wilmer Eye Institute said at a newsconference to announce the project. But it will enhance what visionis left in people who suffer from degenerative eye disease, theysaid.   Wilmer and NASA's National Space Technology Laboratories willspend $5 million in the next five years to develop the system, saidRobert Massof, a Hopkins ophthalmology professor working on theproject.   Ray Gilbert, manager of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's technology applications engineering section, saidthe system comes from research that helped create space stations.   ``We can use that technology ... to enhance life on earth for aperson with low vision,'' Gilbert said.   ``It is recognizing an image through a software program andapplying those kinds of principles to the low-vision device,''Gilbert said.   The device would be used by people who have poor vision as aresult of diabetes, aging and other causes.   It would not only magnify and enhance images, but be able tozoom in on an object or distort it, to improve the sight of peoplewith tunnel vision, Massof said.   ``They will not look through the screens, but at the screens,''Massof said. ``For a long time the only thing that's been done forpeople with low vision is provide them with a magnifier. With thetechnology (available), we (believed) we could do more than simplyenlarge it.''   NASA scientists will adapt the technology for the glasses, whileresearchers at Wilmer will determine what the system has to do toalter a patient's vision, Massof said.   The device would resemble wrap-around sunglasses with smalllenses in the frames, connected by optical fibers to abattery-powered computer at the waist, Massof said.   The lenses would capture the field of vision, and images wouldbe conveyed to miniature solid-state television cameras in thewaist pack, he said. The images would be processed by the computerand displayed on the color television screens where the lenseswould be.   ``The breakthrough is the technology that made this allpossible,'' Massof said. ``We are not creating new components forthis.'' However the existing technology will have to beminiaturized and refined, he said, and researchers have set a goalof completing that work in five years.   About 11 million Americans have vision defects that cannot becorrected. The glasses could benefit about 2.5 million people whosuffer from severe, disabling impairment, or low vision, said Dr.Arnall Patz, director of the eye institute.   Those who would be helped by the glasses ``are still potentiallyproductive people. They can probably get around but are unable toread ... recognize faces, or things may be very reduced incontrast, so they look somewhat blank,'' Massof said.   ``For the patient who has reduction in sensitivity to contrasts_ where blacks and whites look gray _ we can sharpen up thecontrast and make blacks much blacker, whites much whiter,'' hesaid.   He could not say what it would cost, but said the eyeglassescould be assembled for less than $1,000. ``It will be of no valueunless it is made affordable for the person who is retired and on afixed income,'' he said.   Researchers hope it would qualify for insurance coverage as arehabilitative device, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
