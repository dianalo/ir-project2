RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court begins its new term muchwhere it left off last summer _ with the issue of abortion headingthe list of closely watched cases.   After a three-month recess, the justices return to the benchtoday to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legaland political disputes. None is likely to be more divisive, or abetter bellwether of the court's conservative course, than abortion.   The court will hear arguments in three abortion cases, probablyin December or January, that will determine whether it will expandthe new regulatory power it gave states last July.   Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe said the Julyruling ``began, in a very major way, the dismantling of Roe versusWade,'' the court's 1973 ruling that established a right toabortion.   ``The court may never say Roe versus Wade is overruled, but islikely to say, `Roe versus Wade ... never heard of it,''' Tribesaid.   Officials from Minnesota and Ohio are urging the justices toallow laws requiring young, unmarried girls to get parental consentbefore having abortions. In the third case, Illinois is seekingstricter control over clinics that perform the great majority ofabortions.   The state officials are not asking the court to overturn Roe vs.Wade, which legalized abortions nationwide.   The Bush administration, which urged the court last term toreverse the 1973 ruling, is taking a lower profile this time.   The Justice Department will not participate in oral arguments inany of the three cases, although it is expected to submit a legalbrief supporting Minnesota's parental consent law.   The abortion debate in America was recast dramatically by thecourt's July 3 ruling in a Missouri case cutting back abortionrights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain.   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said states may require doctors toadminister tests for determining whether a fetus is capable ofsurviving outside the womb.   It also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortionsin public hospitals.   Holding the balance of power in that case _ and perhaps for thefuture of abortion rights _ is Sandra Day O'Connor, the only femalejustice in the court's history.   In a separate concurring opinion in July, she said the Missouriregulations do not place an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right toan abortion. O'Connor said she was not prepared to decide thenwhether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.Kennedy and Byron R. White are ready to overturn Roe vs. Wade.Justice Antonin Scalia voted to do so.   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, ThurgoodMarshall and John Paul Stevens reaffirmed their support of the 1973holding.   The July ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the statelegislatures, where rejuvenated women's rights activists andanti-abortion forces are taking the battle.   But the Supreme Court remains an important arena for the fight.   In a free-speech case, the court today turned aside an appeal bythree people convicted of trespassing for handing out anti-abortionbooklets to students outside a Texas high school.   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distributionof the ``pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protectedby the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.   Here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docketthis term:   _The Illinois case, Turnock vs. Ragsdale, could be the mostimportant. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck downregulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics tobecome ``the functional equivalent of small hospitals.''   The clinics, where nearly all early abortions are performed,would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment andservices that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety.The cost of an abortion could rise by nearly $50.   The case could have broad significance if the court decides towater down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rightsestablished by Roe vs. Wade. That ruling generally prohibits statesfrom imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensiveor difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy.   _In Hodgson vs. Minnesota, the court will review a system thatrequires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receivenotification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion isperformed. Alternatively, the girl may bypass parental notificationby convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion forherself.   The system was in force for five years before a federal judgeruled it was unconstitutional. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals reversed the judge's ruling.   _The second parental notification case, Ohio vs. Akron Centerfor Reproductive Health, raises similar issues. An Ohio lawrequires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone toone parent 24 hours prior to the abortion, or by regular andcertified mail 48 hours in advance.   Alternatively, a judge would have up to 22 days to decidewhether to permit the minor's abortion.   The Ohio law, passed in 1985, never took effect before it wasstruck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The Supreme Court has allowed states to regulate abortions forunmarried minors more strictly than for adult women.   The justices, in a decision announced two months before Kennedyjoined the court, split 4-4 in 1987 over the validity of suchregulation by Illinois.</TEXT></DOC>
