Gaubert, a former savings and loan executive and Democratic fund-raiser, was acquitted of federal charges that he defrauded an Iowa thrift.    Mr. Gaubert, who headed Independent American Savings Association of Texas until his ouster by federal thrift regulators, was found innocent of mail fraud and making false statements on loan documents submitted to Capitol Savings andamp; Loan Association of Mount Pleasant, Iowa.    The acquittal Saturday was the first setback for federal prosecutors in the criminal cases arising from a real estate financing scheme that glutted the Dallas area in 1982 and 1983 with unsalable condominiums and overvalued land.    Mr. Gaubert had been indicted for his role in arranging $32 million in loans from Capitol Savings for the purchase of land for condominium development in southwest Dallas. Several of the people who guaranteed the loans later pleaded guilty to lying on financial statements, and one of the real estate appraisers who vouched for the value of the land pleaded guilty to conspiracy.    Mr. Gaubert's attorney, Abbe David Lowell, said Saturday that his client had been assisting Capitol Savings for more than a year on other loan difficulties.    &quot;Someone who has been helping a savings and loan for a year and a half doesn't wake up one day and decide he's going to defraud it,&quot; Mr. Lowell said.    Mr. Gaubert's three-week trial in Des Moines, Iowa, included testimony from Texas state treasurer Ann Richards, who appeared as a character witness for the defendant. Mrs. Richards said she knew Mr. Gaubert personally and in politics, where he has been active as a fund-raiser for such Democrats as House Speaker Jim Wright and former presidential candidate Richard Gephardt. </TEXT></DOC>
