The Monroe, Mich.-based company said it delayed the meeting, scheduled for Monday, after being informed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of a probe into the &quot;timing and substance&quot;of a $2.2 million addition to Peoples's loan-loss reserve, and a $4.5 million charge against the reserve for the fiscal year ended June 30. The provision for 1987 losses, totaling $6.6 million, was chiefly to cover bad loans in the bank's automobile portfolio.    A company spokesman said that at the end of fiscal 1987 the company's loan-loss reserve was about $2.8 million, up from $555,000 a year earlier.    A new date for the annual meeting hasn't been set. </TEXT></DOC>
