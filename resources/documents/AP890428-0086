Several thousand radical students clashed with riot police on atleast five campuses in Seoul after the government banned a march toPanmunjom border truce site 30 miles north of Seoul for talks withcommunist students.   Twenty student delegates were seized by police as they tried toget to the border to meet the North Korean student delegates todiscuss taking part in a youth festival in Pyongyang in July andother ways to reunite the two nations.   About 6,000 striking workers clashed with riot police in thesoutheastern industrial cities of Masan and Changwon, police said.Strikers in Changwon poured oil on some streets and set them ablazeand protesters in Masan pelted police with bits of scrap metal.   It was the fifth day of clashes in Changwon.   Riot police blocked 4,000 students trying to march out of SeoulNational University. Screaming students armed with metal and woodclubs attacked riot police with firebombs before troopers stormedonto the campus firing tear gas.   Black police vans armed with multiple tear gas launchers firedhundreds of the bombs as fighting flared around the sprawlingcampus. It was surrounded by 3,000 riot police in green combatfatigues and visored helmets.   Police officials said people were hurt, but they had no figures.   Students clashed with riot police on at least four other Seoulcampuses. About 700 students battled troopers with firebombs androcks for two hours at Yonsei University.   Student clashes also erupted in the southern port of Pusan andradicals seized a government prosecutors' office in Taegu,according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Student leaders lashed out at South Korean President Roh Tae-wooand the United States in rallies before the clashes, accusing themof perpetuating the division of the Korean peninsula. Speakerscalled for immediate unification with the communist north.   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo, who blocked our vital march to thenorth for talks with North Korean students. Let's raise a flag ofanti-facism and anti-Americanism and march to Pyongyang,'' a leadersaid at Seoul National University.   The government banned the march to Panmunjom on grounds it poseda threat to public safety and the government alone has authority todeal with the rival north.   Dissident leaders have said they will go ahead with plannedanti-government protests this weekend, including plans for a majorlabor rally in Seoul on Sunday to mark the international May Daylabor holiday. The government has banned all the demonstrations.   The radical students and allied dissident groups lack popularsupport because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat tothe Roh government.   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrestand a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay andimproved working conditions. Top opposition leaders Wednesdayappealed to radical students and workers to halt protests andwarned continued unrest could undermine democratic development inSouth Korea.   Also today, 3,400 police officers offered their resignations toprotest an alleged assault on a police superintendent by anopposition lawmaker.   National Police Director Jo Chong-suk said he ordered all theresignations returned, and government officials said his actionwould defuse the situation.   It arose after legislator Sim Wan-koo reportedly slappedSuperintendent Chung Moon-young in the face during a labor protestThursday in Changwon.
