Bahrain would receive 12 of the General Dynamics Corp.-built fighters, along with radars and laser equipment. The Defense Department also plans to sell Bahrain three types of U.S. missiles -- Sparrows, Sidewinders and Mavericks. The F-16s and related equipment would be the first of that kind sold to Bahrain. The total arms package is valued at $400 million.    Egypt would receive its third batch of 40 F-16s, along with radar and improved avionics for the planes. The sale is valued at $1.3 billion. The Mideast sales come as the Reagan administration seeks to improve relations among moderate states, which were alarmed by the U.S. weapons sales to Iran.    In addition, the Pentagon plans to sell South Korea $65 million of aircraft spare parts.    The foreign military sales are subject to congressional veto, but none is likely to meet much opposition. </TEXT></DOC>
