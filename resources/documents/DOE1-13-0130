<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0130 </DOCNO><TEXT>The high temperature reactor, because of its high temperature, can beintroduced in energy conversion processes, in particular in the refinementof fossil energy carriers into easily transportable and storagable andenvironmentally secondary energy carriers as for example methanol. Thedevelopment work has been concentrated on the application of processheat in the form of high temperature helium. The processes, consistingmainly of the respective heat consuming apparatus, are the following:the steam reforming process of methane, the intermediate heat exchangerand the gas generator of the steam coal gasification processes. In additionto that development work for the methanation process and for the hydrogasificationprocess has been done. A big part of the overall programme is concentratedto the materials development and qualification programme. The processeshave meanwhile reached the semi-technical respectively the pilot-plantscale.</TEXT></DOC>
