Now this South African capital city has proposedsister-city ties with Moscow.</LP><TEXT>   The move reflects domestic and international policychanges in both countries. After 35 years without diplomaticcontact, the two nations will soon open interest sectionsunder the auspices of the Austrian embassies in bothcapitals.   And with that comes the prospect of increased trade.Though Moscow and Pretoria discount the possibility, oneSoviet expert on South Africa has suggested the two countrieseven form a gold cartel. Both countries are rich with gold,diamonds and strategic minerals.   &quot;Naturally, of course, the interest offices will helppromote trade or contact, which will open the possibility offurther trade,&quot; predicts Kent Durr, South Africa's ministerof trade, industry and tourism.   Exports to the Soviet Union could include miningequipment, mineral-marketing techniques, and fruit andagricultural products. &quot;We're talking to them now aboutcertain fruit exports,&quot; Mr. Durr says. &quot;There have beenshipments there already.&quot;   The Soviets could provide South Africa withhigh-technology goods, particularly in ceramics andelectronics, says the minister. Other experts mention oil andnatural-gas as possible South African imports.   At a nongovernmental conference between Soviets and SouthAfricans last year, Yuri Skubco, then a research fellow atMoscow's Institute for African Studies, suggested such arelationship would make money for both nations.   &quot;The importance of gold shouldn't be underestimated, astogether South Africa and the Soviet Union produce more than80% of the world's supply,&quot; he said in a paper written forthe Moscow gathering. &quot;If we remember that the {Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries} could effectively controlthe oil market for some time while producing only a third ofthe world's supply, it could be reasonably supposed that theestablishment of normal links between Russia and South Africapromises the two countries great profits through theeffective control of gold, platinum and chromium, as wellother strategic goods.&quot;   The 80% figure may be about 30 percentage points too high,and several South Africans and Soviets simply reject thecartel notion. &quot;We're not interested in that sort of thing,&quot;scoffs Mr. Durr during an interview. &quot;We are responsibleinternational traders of longstanding. We're not seeking toemulate some sort of latter-day OPEC. It's not the sort ofthing we think should be encouraged.&quot;   The Soviet ambassador to neighboring Botswana agrees.&quot;It's a bit naive,&quot; he says of Mr. Skubco's idea. &quot;You cannotcontrol the price of gold because there are so manyproducers. . . . It's not possible and nobody wants it.&quot;   But Philip Nel, Soviet-studies director at South Africa'sUniversity of Stellenbosch, notes that a previous SouthAfrican cabinet member suggested a cartel and the thought waswidely discussed. &quot;It is an idea that has a long history,&quot; hesays.   The South African gold mining industry is undergoing afinancial crisis. Clive Knobbs, Chamber of Mines president,said recently that 1990 profits fell 23% from a year earlier.Mr. Knobbs said the survival of many South African gold minesis threatened by the squeeze between stagnant world pricesand increasing costs.   Since last July, the Soviets have been participating inthe international diamond cartel controlled by South Africa'sDe Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. De Beers lent the Soviets $1billion in exchange for five years' marketing rights to theirdiamonds. The Soviet Union had been part of the cartel untilit quit to protest the 1960 Sharpville massacre, in which 69black protesters were killed by South African securityforces. Moscow then worked with -- but outside -- the cartelby selling diamonds through a third party at cartel prices.   Diplomatic relations have been severed since 1956; theinterest sections don't formally represent their restoration.But the strength of the growing relationship is demonstratedby the decision to house the sections in separate buildingsand not in the sponsoring embassies, as is the usualpractice.   The improved relations flow directly from diminishedSoviet involvement in regional conflicts around South Africa,and the dismantling of apartheid, says Foreign Minister R.F.&quot;Pik&quot; Botha. Soviet spokesmen insist no substantial increasein trade is imminent because of sanctions still in forceagainst South Africa, but Mr. Botha says in a telephoneinterview that he does &quot;not believe the Soviet Union will beinhibited by sanctions, because they have never passed a lawagainst us.&quot;   The anti-apartheid African National Congress, recipient ofmuch aid from the Soviet Union, objected to the interestsections as premature. The Soviets no longer supply the ANCwith weapons, but they are working to transform the ANC armyfrom guerrillas to a conventional force, says StanleyMabizela, deputy ANC international affairs director.   Mr. Mabizela says the rapprochement is &quot;an important breakfrom isolation&quot; for South Africa's minority white government.He calls the interest-section agreement &quot;a big victory forthem, a big victory particularly over the ANC, because theANC and the Soviets have always claimed such closeness.&quot;   Vasili Solodovnikov, a former Soviet ambassador to Zambia,acknowledges that even during the years of estrangement hiscountry traded discreetly with South Africa. Once considereda prime organizer of the &quot;total onslaught,&quot; Mr. Solodovnikovvisited here as part of a nongovernmental delegation thismonth. He announced a May seminar in Moscow on trade andeconomic ties between the two countries.   Trade Minister Durr led government and business leaders tothe Soviet Union last August, the first visit there by aSouth African minister. In November, a Soviet economicdelegation, including a Council of Ministers member and thedeputy finance minister, met with President F.W. de Klerk andbusiness leaders in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
