SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.said Wednesday he never has seen President Reagan make a policydecision based on astrology or due to the influence of first ladyNancy Reagan.   Baker, in a brief exchange with reporters, took issue with hispredecessor, Donald T. Regan, who claimed in his book ``For theRecord'' that astrological forecasts were used by the first lady todetermine White House events and that she played a key role inousting numerous administration officials.   ``I am with the president every day, most of the day _ and I cantell you first-hand, I've never seen any decision, certainly nopolicy decision, that has ever been affected either by the firstlady's input or by astrology,'' Baker said.   At a brief news conference on Tuesday the president said he didnot use astrology to ``guide my life,'' but he sidestepped thequestion of whether he believed in it or not.   ``I don't know enough about it to say, is there something toit,'' the president said.   Regan's book also painted a picture of an incurious, passivechief executive manipulated by a strong-willed wife andmedia-conscious staff.   Baker acknowledged that the president does have ``a greatrespect for the first lady's judgment _ she has good judgment, shehas good instincts and intuition.''   But the chief of staff argued that Regan overplayed thepassivity of the president.   ``Ronald Reagan is president of the United States, and I cantell you that after a year and a half on this job, he is president,he knows he's president, he acts like a president, he likes beingpresident and he's a good president,'' Baker said.   While not mentioning Regan's name directly, Baker said tell-allbooks should not be written. He indirectly criticized the formerchief of staff for breaching a code of confidentiality that shouldaccompany such high-level positions.   He added that he doesn't intend to write a book.   ``I don't think you ought to write those books. I think when youtake a job like this that there's at least an implied commitmentthat you're not going to write books like that,'' Baker said,adding, ``If you're in daily, intimate contact with the presidentin a decision-making process, I think there's an obligation totreat that discreetly and confidentially.''   Baker was asked to succeed Regan in the aftermath of therevelations of the Iran-Contra arms and money affair. In his book,Regan contends Mrs. Reagan took part in the effort to drive himfrom the White House and discusses how he resigned in a huff afterhe learned in a news report that Baker had been named to the post.</TEXT></DOC>
