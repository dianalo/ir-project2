Environmental policy, Bush said, ``cannot be driven by theextreme.''   The president's defense came as three senators chastized hisadministration for not endorsing a resolution sought by manyEuropean countries at a global warming conference in theNetherlands. The resolution calls for specific curbs on``greenhouse'' gases by the end of the century.   The White House issued a statement later Tuesday saying that theUnited States had agreed on a compromise declaration at theNetherlands conference that says global warming pollutants shouldbe stabilized ``as soon as possible.''   According to administration sources, U.S. negotiators felt theycould accept that wording because it doesn't tie any nation tospecific levels of pollution reduction nor stabilize levels by aspecific year.   The revised declaration notes only that ``in the view of manyindustrialized nations'' _ but not necessarily all nations _ carbondioxide emissions should be stabilized by 2000, said one U.S.official, asking that he not be identified.   ``We're not willing to agree to a set time. We did not sign onto anything mentioning the year 2000,'' said deputy presidentialpress secretary Stephen Hart.   Originally, many of the conference participants had soughtcommitments to freeze greenhouse gas emissions at present levels by2000, a position the Bush administration has rejected. Thatprompted sharp criticism from some members of Congress andenvironmentalists.   ``President Bush promised to confront the greenhouse effect. Nowwhat we're seeing is the whitewash effect,'' Sen. Albert Gore,D-Tenn., said in remarks on the Senate floor.   Bush also was criticized by Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.   ``The president of the United States, who wants to be theenvironmental president, promised to lead us on this issue (ofglobal warming),'' Becker said. ``But he's leading us in the wrongdirection _ backward.''   Bush, asked about the issue at a White House news conference,defended his strategy of moving slowly in making a commitment tospecific reductions in greenhouse gases.   The U.S. scientific community, he said, ``is in the lead'' infocusing on the question of what effect pollutants, primarily fromthe burning of fossil fuels, will have on world temperatures overthe next 50 years.   ``But you can't take a policy and drive it to the extreme andsay to every country around the world (that) you aren't going togrow (economically) at all,'' the president said.   The administration has been divided for months on howaggressively it should pursue specific commitments to gettingworldwide reductions in global warming pollutants, especiallycarbon dioxide, of which the United States is the largest source.   A major concern among some presidential advisers has been overcost.   Significant reductions of greenhouse pollutants will requirecurbing the use of fossil fuels, meaning more fuel-efficientautomobiles and increased energy conservation, according to theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   ``We believe in a reduction of carbon dioxide. But we're notprepared to say by what time and by what level,'' EPA AdministratorWilliam Reilly, head of the U.S. delegation in the Netherlands,said as the conference opened Monday.   Reilly has said repeatedly that the United States believes it'stoo early to commit to specific curbs of greenhouse gases and thatsuch matters are best worked out by the International Panel onClimate Change in a series of meeting beginning in February.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, on Tuesdaycompared Bush's attitude toward dealing with global warming withformer President Reagan's eight-year opposition to dealing withacid rain. Conceding pollution curbs could be costly, Mitchell saidthat ``delay has a cost of its own.''   Gore and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., two of the Senate'sstrongest advocates for immediate action to combat global warming,accused Bush of reneging on a campaign promise to address the issuepromptly.   Wirth said the administration ``is clearly out of themainstream'' on global warming and has has demonstrated at theNetherlands conference that it's ``not a leader but a delinquentpartner.''   ``The overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that we arechanging our atmosphere, the world is getting warmer and we oughtto move now,'' Wirth said. ``It is not a question of if the globeis warming, but how much and how fast.''   Nicholas Fedoruk, a spokesman for Washington-based EnvironmentalAction Foundation, said the United States is the largestcontributor to the release of global warming gases ``and should beleading efforts to solve the problem.''   ``Instead, this country allied itself with some of the world'sbiggest polluters to stymie meaningful action,'' Fedoruk said.</TEXT></DOC>
