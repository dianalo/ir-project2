Introduction </ITAG>A. ITC Recommendation In its twenty-second report to the EPA Administrator, the ITC designatedHDI for health effects testing, including chronic toxicity, oncogenicity,and reproductive and developmental effects. The rationale behind this designationis discussed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 20, 1988 (53 FR 18196). Based on an ongoingcarcinogenicity study being conducted in one rodent species, the ITC recommendedthat chronic toxicity studies with carcinogenicity as an endpoint be conductedin another species in accordance with accepted guidelines. B. Test Rule Development Under TSCA Detailed discussions of the TSCA section 4 findings (section 4(a)(1) (A)and (B)) were provided in EPA's first and second proposed test rules whichwere published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510), and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300). EPA has evaluated the ITC's testing recommendations for HDI, relying heavilyon the Information Review (Ref. 1) developed by the ITC in support of theirfindings, as well as the supplemental information developed by EPA (seeUnit IX. of this preamble). Based upon EPA's evaluation of this information,EPA is proposing health effects and chemical fate testing for HDI underTSCA section 4(a)(1)(B). This action completes EPA's statutory responseto the ITC. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Chemical Profile and Health Effects  </ITAG>The HDI chemical profile, a review of published studies, and an analysisof the health effects, including acute toxicity, subchornic toxicity, chronictoxicity, oncogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive effects, developmentaltoxicity, and neurotoxicity, and an analysis of metabolism and pharmacokinetisof HDI are described in the ITC's Information Review (Ref. 1), the HDItechnical support document prepared by the Syracuse Research Corporation(Ref. 2), and in the ITC Report published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 18201).  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Findings  </ITAG>Under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B), EPA finds that HDI is produced in substantialquantities, that there is or may be substantial human exposure to HDI fromits manufacture, processing, and use, and that insufficient data and experienceexist to reasonably determine or predict: (1) The oncogenic, genotoxic,reproductive, developmental, and neurotoxic effects of human exposure toHDI resulting from its manufacture, processing, and use; (2) The absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion of HDI in the body as a resultof dermal, oral, and inhalation exposure from HDI manufacture, processing,and use; and (3) the chemical fate of HDI in the atmosphere resulting fromHDI manufature, processing, and use. EPA also finds that the testing programproposed in this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice is necessary to, and will develop suchdata.  A. Substantial Production  The public portion of the TSCA section 8(b) Inventory data base lists U.S.production of HDI as 1 to 10 million pounds in 1977 (Ref. 1). Mobay reported1981 production at 9 to 11 million pounds, and has estimated its 1987 productionin the area of 11 million pounds (Ref. 1). The actual production and importvolumes for 1987 have been submitted as confidential business information.EPA finds that this annual production volume is ``substantial'' as thatterm is used in section 4(a)(1)(B) of TSCA.  B. Substantial Human Exposure  EPA finds that the production and uses of HDI-containing resins and trimersin polyurethane paint systems results in potential exposure to substantialnumbers of workers. HDI is used in the manufacture of higher molecularweight biuret polyisocyanate resins and trimer polyisocyantate resins usedin polyurethane paint systems. The greatest potential for occupationalexposures to HDI is in coating application operations, with an estimated153,000 autobody repair workers having a potential for some exposure toHDI biuret and trimer-containing paints (Ref. 1). Potential exposures toworkers supporting EPA's finding are described in the Information Review(Ref. 1). EPA believes that potential exposure of 153,000 workers as wellas exposures listed in Reference 1 is ``substantial'' as that term is usedin section 4(a)(1)(B) of TSCA.  C. Insufficiency of Data  On the basis of its review of data, EPA finds that existing data are insufficientor unavailable to reasonably determine or predict oncogenic, genotoxic,reproductive, developmental, and neurotoxic effects on human exposure toHDI resulting from its manufacture, processing, and use.  EPA has reviewed all of the available studies on the carcinogenicity ofHDI and has found no current completed studies on the carcinogenicity ofHDI in laboratory animals in the available literature, therefore thereis insufficient information to predict the carcinogenic potential of HDI.EPA recognizes that HDI is currently undergoing testing in a 2-year ratinhalation toxicity/oncogenicity study (Ref. 5). EPA is, however, proposingthat a bioassay be conducted according to TSCA test guidelines. Shouldthis study (scheduled for completion in mid-1989) be completed, reviewedand found acceptable by EPA prior to promulgation of the final test rule,this test standard will not be finalized.  EPA has reviewed all of the available studies and found them insufficientto reasonably predict the mutagenic potential of HDI. There were no studieson the reproductive or developmental toxicology of HDI in laboratory animalsin the available literature, therefore assessment of the fetotoxic potentialcan not be done. There were no studies on the neurotoxic potential of HDIlaboratory animals in the available literature, therefore neurotoxic assessmentcannot be done. (Ref. 2).  EPA has recently received data on the subchronic toxicity of HDI (Ref.6). These data have been reviewed by EPA and found to be adequate. ThereforeEPA is not proposing subchronic testing of HDI.  EPA also finds that there are insufficient data to reasonably predict andcompare the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of HDIin the body as a result of dermal, oral, and inhalation exposure due toHDI manufacture, prosessing, and use. Data on the pharmacokinetics of HDIwere not located in the available literature, therefore the absorption,distribution, metabolism and excretion of HDI cannot be determined. (Ref.2).EPA finds that available data are insufficient to reasonably determineor predict the rate of hydrolysis of HDI by water vapor in the gas phase.Identifying the rate of hydrolysis of HDI is necessary to determine theavailability of HDI for absorption to humans. (Ref. 2). D. Testing is Necessary EPA believes that the testing of HDI for effects noted in Unit III.C. willbe relevant to a determination of whether HDI manufacture, processing anduse does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human healthand the environment. EPA believes that the testing proposed in this proposedtest rule will provide data sufficient to make such a determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. Proposed testing and Test Standards EPA is proposing that testing be conducted in accordance with specifictest guidelines set forth in 40 CFR Parts 795 and 798. All persons conductingtests would conduct tests in accordance with the TSCA Good Laboratory Practice(GLP) Standards (40 CFR 792). The specific tests EPA is proposing are setforth in proposed andSection; 799.2145 and are identified in the table inUnit IV.D. of this preamble. The tiered testing schemes for mutagenicity are discussed in detail inthe final test rule for the C<T2>9</T2> aromatic hydrocarbon fraction (50 FR 20662; May 17, 1985). Modificationsto the MVSL including the option of substitution the MBSL for the MVSLand the MBSL test procedures were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51847) andare incorporated into this proposed rule. EPA believes that pharmacokinetics testing is necessary to reduce uncertaintiesassociated with the extrapolation of toxicity test data from high to lowdoses, from species to species, and from one route of exposure to another.However, EPA is currently reviewing its pharmacokinetics testing guidelineand will propose a specific test in a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. To assess the chemical fate of HDI in the atmosphere, EPA is proposinghydrolysis testing. In the absence of an existing standard testing protocolfor testing gas-phase hydrolysis rates of diisocyanates in the atmosphere,EPA is proposing that the determination of the rate of hydrolysis of HDIin air be conducted in accordance with Holdren et al. (Ref. 4). B. Test Substance EPA is proposing that HDI of at least 98 percent purity be used as thetest substance. EPA has specified a relatively pure substance for testingbecause EPA is interested in evaluating the effects attributable to HDIitself. EPA believes that this grade of HDI is readily available for testingpurposes. C. Persons required to test Because EPA has found that there are insufficient data and experience toreasonably determine or predict the effects on human health of the manufacture,processing, and use of HDI, EPA is proposing that persons who manufactureand/or process, or who intend to manufacture and/or process HDI, otherthan as an impurity, at any time from the effective date of the final testrule to the end of the reimbursement period be subject to the testing requirementsin this proposed rule. This period is defined in 40 CFR 791.3(h). WhileEPA has not identified any byproduct manufacturers of HDI, such personswould be covered by the requirements of this test rule. Manufactures, including importers potentially subject to the final ruleshould consult the procedures in 40 CFR Part 790. Processors subject tothe final rule, unless they are also manufacturers, would not be requiredto submit letters of intent or exemption applications, but should consult40 CFR Part 790 for additional details. EPA is not proposing to require the submission of equivalence data as acondition for exemption from the proposed testing for HDI because EPA isinterested in evaluating the effects attributable to HDI itself and hasspecified a relatively pure substance for testing. D. Reporting Requirements As required in 40 CFR 799.10, all data developed under the final rule wouldbe reported in accordance with its TSCA GLP Standards which appear in 40CFR Part 792. In addition 40 CFR Part 790 requires test sponsors to submitindividual study plans at least 45 days prior to the initation of eachstudy. As required by section 4(b)(1)(C) of TSCA, EPA is proposing specific reportingrequirements for each of the proposed tests for HDI shown in the followingtable. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table_Proposed Testing, Test Standards, and Reporting Requirementsfor HDI </T4><H1>Test </H1><H1>Test standard (40 CFR citation) </H1><H1>Reporting deadline for final report \1\ </H1><H1>Interim (6-month) reports required</H1> Chronic toxicity: <ITAG tagnum="3">1.

Issues for Comment</ITAG>1. This proposed rule specifies TSCA test guidelines as the test standardsfor health effects testing of HDI. EPA is soliciting comments as to whetherthese test guidelines are appropriate and adequate to characterize thehealth effects of HDI. EPA specifically requests comments on whether EPA'sproposed combined chronic toxicity/oncogenicity (40 CFR 798.3320) guidelineis appropriate and should be required in place of the oncogenicity guideline(40 CFR 798.3300). The provisions of this guideline are designed primarilyfor use with the rat as the test species. The use of this combined guidelinewould reflect EPA's concern for long-term low-dose chronic effects of HDIthat may not be adequately characterized by subchronic testing alone. Oncogenicitytesting in a second species would also be required.2. EPA requests comments on the potential for HDI to hydrolyze in the atmosphere.Based on the data reported by Holdren et al. (Ref. 4) for toluene diisocyanate(TDI), EPA believes that the hydrolysis rate of HDI in the gas phase withlow to moderate humidity (7 to 70 percent) will be slow relative to thehydrolysis rate in an aqueous phase. EPA solicits comments on the use ofthe method reported by Holdren (Ref. 4) to assess the hydrolysis rate ina gas phase with moderate to high humidity (70 to 100 percent).3. EPA requests comments on the route of exposure for testing. EPA is proposingthat most of the tests be conducted by inhalation because it is the mostrelevant route for human exposure to HDI. However, because of technicalproblems associated with certain TSCA test guidelines (i.e., reproductiveeffects and developmental toxicity), and the desire to choose a route ofadministration and vehicle that will assure that the dose is received bythe target tissues, EPA is proposing exposure by gavage for reproductiveeffects and developmental toxicity. EPA requests comments on this approachand also on the route of exposure for the mutagenicity screens. In additionshould the inhalation route of entry be selected for the developmentaltoxicity study after the completion of the pharmacokinetics study if thepharmacokinetics study reveals significant metabolic differences betweeninhalation and gavage exposures? EPA also requests comments on an appropriatevehicle (e.g. corn oil) for the gavage studies.4. EPA requests comments on the adequacy of the genetic toxicity testingscheme, in particular the use of bone marrow assays for a highly reactivesubstance such as HDI. Would cytogenetic assays such as those involvingperipheral blood lymphocytes or lung cells following <T3>in vivo</T3> exposures be useful or be in a sufficient stage of developmentand validation to provide useful information?5. Diisocyanates are known to be highly reactive biologically, with HDIknown to be a respiratory and dermal irritant and sensitizer. EPA requestscomments on the role these properties will pay in selecting an appropriateanimal model for testing, and what additional testing may be needed toassess these effects in humans.6. EPA requests comments on the reporting requirements (schedules) forthe cited guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Economic Analysis of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>To assess the potential economic impact of this rule, EPA has preparedan economic analysis that evaluates the potential for significant economicimpacts on the industry as a result of the proposed testing. (Ref. 3)Total testing costs for the proposed testing of HDI are estimated to rangefrom $2.3 to 3.3 million. To predict the financial decisionmaking practicesof manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualized costsare compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period to finance the testing expenditurein the first year.The annualized test costs, using a 7 percent cost of capital over a periodof 15 years, range from $251,700 to $362,000. The production volume andprice information have been claimed confidential and are contained in theeconomic analysis which is being treated as CBI.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel</ITAG>As required by section 4(b)(1) of TSCA, EPA has conducted a study to assessthe availability of test facilities and personnel to handle the additionaldemand for testing services created by section 4 test rules and found thatthere will be available test facilities and personnel to perform the testingspecified in this proposed rule. Copies of the study, Chemical TestingIndustry: Profile of Toxicological Testing, can be obtained through theNational Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,VA 22161 (PB 82-140773). A copy of this study is contained in the rulemakingrecord for this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Public Meeting</ITAG>If persons indicate to EPA that they wish to present oral comments on thisproposed rule to EPA officials who are directly responsible for developingthe rule and supporting analyses, EPA will hold a public meeting afterthe close of the public comment period in Washington, DC. Persons who wishto attend or to present comments at the meeting should call the TSCA AssistanceOffice (TAO): (202) 554-1404 by July 3, 1989. No meeting will be held unlessmembers of the public indicate that they wish to make oral presentations.While the meeting will be open to the public, active participation willbe limited to those persons who arranged to present comments and to designatedEPA participants. Attendees should call the TAO before making travel plansto verify whether a meeting will be held.Should a meeting be held, EPA will transcribe the meeting and include thewritten transcript in the rulemaking record. Participants are invited,but not required, to submit copies of their statements prior to or on theday of the meeting. All such written materials will become part of EPA'srecord for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="85">IX. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information</ITAG>Any person who submits comments which the person claims as ConfidentialBusiness Information (CBI) must mark the comments as confidential. Commentsnot claimed as confidential at time of submission will be placed in thepublic file. Any comments marked confidential will be treated in accordancewith the procedures in 40 CFR Part 2. EPA requests that any person submittingconfidential comments prepare and submit a sanitized version of the commentswhich EPA can place in the public file.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket number OPTS-42107).This record contains the basic information considered by EPA in developingthis proposal and appropriate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices. EPA will supplement this record withadditional relevant information, as necessary.CBI, while part of the record, is not available for public review.

Other Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this proposed test rule would not be major becauseit does not meet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order;i.e., it would not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100million, would not cause a major increase in prices, and would not havea significant adverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterprisesto compete with foreign enterprises. This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written commentsfrom OMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included inthe rulemaking record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>Pub. L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), EPA is certifyingthat this test rule, if promulgated, would not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small businesses because: (1) They would notbe expected to perform testing themselves, or to participate in the organizationof the testing effort; (2) they would experience only very minor costs,if any, in securing exemption from testing requirements; and (3) they areunlikely to be affected by reimbursement requirements. C. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisproposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0033. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 1027 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The total publicreporting burden is estimated to be 17,454 hours for all responses. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 799 </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Testing, Laboratories,Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, Incorporation by reference.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 2, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles Elkins, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances.</ITAG>Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR Part 799 be amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 799_[AMENDED] </ITAG>a.
