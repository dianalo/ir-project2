But some GOP political advisers say Mr. Baker can be more help to his longtime friend by staying where he is.    As the administration's top economic-policy maker, Mr. Baker is in a position to help keep the economy on track and to calm still-shaky financial markets. That's important to Mr. Bush, who is campaigning largely on the successes of the Reagan economic program.    Moreover, if Mr. Baker leaves, the administration will be hard-pressed to find a successor who can both win congressional confirmation and reassure financial markets. &quot;I think, frankly, it's to Mr. Bush's advantage to have Jim Baker at Treasury,&quot; says Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation.    Some Democrats even contend that Mr. Baker's government post gives the Bush presidential campaign an unfair advantage. &quot;Baker can influence the Federal Reserve System, he can influence exchange rates, he can do a lot of things to patch up the economy through November,&quot; says House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho (D., Calif.) &quot;But you have to question whether or not he's going to be making decisions in the long-term interest of the country or in the short-term interest of Mr. Bush.&quot;    The power of the government to manipulate the economy isn't as great as it once was. In 1972, a combination of accelerated government spending and loose monetary policy helped spur the economy and assure President Nixon's re-election. But things have changed since then. Huge budget deficits have ruled out increased government spending to win votes. And shakiness in financial markets makes it difficult to follow an election-year strategy of easing monetary policy and cutting interest rates.    &quot;The financial markets nowadays determine interest rates every bit as much, if not more so, than the Federal Reserve,&quot; says one administration official. As a result, Secretary Baker has felt compelled to support the Fed's moves in the past few months to push up short-term interest rates and head off inflationary fears in the markets.    But while his ability to stimulate the economy is limited, Treasury Secretary Baker does play an important role in keeping financial markets calm, and that could prove important to Vice President Bush. A repeat of last October's stock market crash would be devastating to the GOP campaign.    &quot;One thing that could knock this current economy off its relatively stable course is a lot of turbulence in the currency markets,&quot; says Robert Hormats, a vice president at Goldman Sachs. &quot;If Baker leaves, there's bound to be a temporary period of uncertainty, and that will disturb the markets.&quot; Economist Allen Sinai agrees. &quot;Baker's departure would add another margin of uncertainty to markets that are already nervous and uncertain.&quot;    If Mr. Baker did leave, he would try to find a successor &quot;in whom the markets would likely have confidence,&quot; says one administration official. But that won't be easy.    Mr. Baker's deputy, Peter McPherson, has proven a disappointment to the Treasury secretary and his top aides, officials say. Many of them question whether he has the judgment to run the department with a steady hand. Treasury Undersecretary George Gould is a more respected official who spent a career in the New York financial markets. But Mr. Baker may find it awkward to bypass his deputy and annoint the undersecretary as his successor. Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead also has been mentioned as a possible successor, but it isn't clear he'd be Mr. Baker's choice.    Any of these officials, having been confirmed for their present posts, could take over immediately as acting secretary. Turning to an outsider to fill the post, however, could prove difficult, as he would have to be confirmed by the Democratic Senate before assuming the secretary's duties. One possibility: a senator or former senator who could quickly win Senate approval.    Mr. Baker's dilemma, which probably will be resolved within the next two months, is an unusual one. Unlike most past Treasury secretaries, who have had backgrounds in finance, Mr. Baker came to the post in 1985 after spending years in politics. He ran Gerald Ford's campaign for the presidency in 1976, headed up Mr. Bush's unsuccessful effort to win the GOP nomination in 1980, and then helped manage Ronald Reagan's successful campaign after the GOP convention.    &quot;I don't know anyone else who has directed political campaigns for the presidency and who has also been Treasury secretary,&quot; says Democratic lawyer Robert Strauss, a close friend of Mr. Baker. &quot;He's one of those fellows who has good judgment on substantive issues, and also has great political skills.&quot;    Since assuming the Treasury post, Mr. Baker has tried to shake the perception that he is merely another Washington &quot;pol.&quot; His skill in shepherding the tax-overhaul bill through Congress and in engineering a major change in international economic policies has earned him considerable respect.    Mr. Baker tries to play down his involvement with the Bush campaign. After combing old calendars, his staff says he has attended only nine formal campaign meetings or events since 1985. And they say he refuses to meet with outsiders who want to talk about the campaign. They also argue that Mr. Baker isn't as political as some prior Treasury secretaries, and quickly point to John Connally, who headed Richard Nixon's Treasury Department during the 1972 re-election campaign.    Nevertheless, the Treasury secretary's importance as an adviser to the vice president can hardly be overstated. Mr. Bush calls him regularly, often at home in the evening. &quot;Jim Baker,&quot; says one Bush staffer, &quot;talks to the vice president frequently.&quot; And other members of the campaign staff also take advantage of his expertise and advice on a wide range of issues, calling him or paying visits to his office.    Indeed, questions about Mr. Baker's role in the campaign have become almost an obsession among Bush staffers. &quot;I talk to a lot of people in the field, and I can tell you this question is immobilizing the whole campaign,&quot; says GOP consultant Donald Devine. &quot;You can't leave an organization floundering around without the question resolved who's going to lead it.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: John Connally&quot; -- WSJ June 1, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
