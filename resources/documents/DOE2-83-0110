Imagesare recorded digitally or are digitized from a photograph, and then thesedata are Fourier transformed and treated. The low- and high-frequencysignals are removed, and a variety of circular and elliptical (anisotropic)apertures or screens are applied to explore and highlight features ofspecial interest. A minicomputer can be used to perform such image processingrapidly, interactively, and with high precision. Elliptical filters areof special interest for the examination of linear or planar featuressuch as the distribution of stacking faults or the presence and distributionof superstructures. Some superstructures themselves contain defects,and these can similarly be highlighted and examined. The uses of processingfor examining HRTEM images of layering in a complex sheet silicate mineraland dislocation cores in grossular garnet are illustrated.</TEXT></DOC>
