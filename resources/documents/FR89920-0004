(This is not a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> HUD published a proposed rule entitled``Deregulation of Loan Origination Fee and Mortgagor Income Requirements''on April 29, 1988 (53 FR 15408). This rule makes final that proposal withrevisions and changes as indicated below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Origination Fee </ITAG>Under its current regulations, HUD places specific limits on the amounta mortgagee may collect from a mortgagor to compensate the mortgagee forexpenses incurred in originating and closing a loan (see 24 CFR 203.27and 234.48). Generally, the charge may not exceed one percent of the originalprincipal amount of the mortgage. (For new construction involving constructionadvances, that charge may be increased to a maximum of two and a half percentof the original principal amount of the mortgage to compensate the mortgageefor necessary inspections and administrative costs connected with makingconstruction advances. For mortgages on properties requiring repair orrehabilitation, mortgagor charges may be assessed at a maximum of two andone half percent of the portion of the mortgage attributable to the repairor rehabilitation, plus 1 percent on the balance of the mortgage.) The proposed rule would have removed, as a general matter, these specificlimitations on the amounts mortgagees may charge for originating and closinga loan. The Commissioner would have, however, continued to set limits onthe amount of such fees that could be included in the insured mortgage.The Department has not included the provisions to deregulate loan originationfees in this final rule. For fixed rate mortgages, data available to theDepartment suggests that, while the loan origination fee cap may be setbelow the cost of providing loan origination services, the shortfall iseasily recovered by charging higher interest rates. As a consequence, theloan origination fee cap does not appear to cause significant inefficienciesin the fixed rate loan market. The Department, however, will undertakea study of the efficiency consequences of continuing to cap loan originationfees for adjustable rate mortgages. The Department intends to completethis study by June 1990, and, if the loan origination fee cap for adjustablerate mortgages is found to cause economic inefficiency, will finalize theremoval of the fee cap for these mortgages. Public comments both against and in favor of eliminating the loan originationfee cap were received on the proposed rule. Favorable comments suggestedthe loan origination fee cap was unnecessary in the highly competitivemortgage loan market and should be removed. While the Department cannotdisagree with this comment, it also notes that apparently the loan originationfee cap on fixed rate mortgages does not keep mortgagees from recoveringloan origination costs and does not appear to cause significant inefficienciesin loan origination, as indicated above. The commenters opposed to thederegulation of the fee cap generally stated the concern that deregulationwould lead to higher loan origination costs for mortgagors. The Department'sdata for fixed rate mortgages, however, suggests otherwise. Since a shortfallin mortgage origination costs can easily be recovered through adjustmentsto the mortgage loan interest rate, mortgagors are currently bearing loanorigination costs (directly through loan origination fees and indirectlythrough mortgage interest rates) at the competitive level set in the marketplace.Therefore, the elimination of the loan origination fee cap would be expectedto cause no change in the total origination cost for mortgagors. The proposed origination fee provision is not included in this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mortgagor Income </ITAG>In addition to limiting origination fees, current regulations also providespecific guidelines for determining the adequacy of a mortgagor's incometo meet the periodic payments required by the mortgage. The mortgagor'sincome is considered adequate if the total prospective housing expensedoes not exceed 35 percent of the mortgagor's ``net effective income''and if the total prospective housing expense and other recurring chargesdo not exceed 50 percent of the mortgagor's net effective income (see 24CFR 203.33, 213.518 and 234.48). Exceptions to the above guidelines arepermitted where certain favorable compensating factors, specified by theFHA Commissioner, are present. (In fact, these 35/50 ratios were increasedby administrative directive in April, 1982 to 38/53.) As originally proposed, the final rule removes these specific guidelinesfrom the regulatory text and provides a more flexible and realistic standard.The new standard (in conformity with general industry practice), wouldsubstitute the concept of gross income rather than the artificial concept``net effective income'' currently used. This change should not, as a practicalmatter, have a significant impact on prospective mortgagors. In reviewing the process of changing to gross income HUD also consideredwhether it should continue to include anticipated monthly maintenance andrepairs and heat and utility costs as part of the housing expense in theanalysis. We initially concluded in the proposed rule that monthly estimatesfor maintenance and repairs often did not reflect the actual amounts expendedfor these items. And, although heat and utility estimates could be moreaccurately projected, we opted to use a monthly housing expense which includedonly the principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) and related costssuch as MIP and homeowner or condominium fees where applicable. This isthe approach used by conventional lenders. In response to extensive criticism in the public comments with respectto HUD's proposal to delete heat and utility costs as a criterion determiningincome eligibility, HUD has revised its policy with respect to this itemand will permit the mortgagor qualifying ratios to be increased up to 2percent for homes considered to be energy efficient. The local HUD FieldOffices will determine the energy efficiency standards that must be metto be eligible for an increase in the ratios. In place of the rather intricate definitions and concepts which apply underthe existing regulations (see HUD Handbook 4155.1 Rev.), the followingconcepts, now prevalent in the conventional mortgage market, will be usedin administrative instructions to implement this new regulatory approach.Unless otherwise indicated, the concepts are the same as those originallyset forth in the proposed rule.<T3>Effective Income </T3>will mean allowable gross income from all sources.A Federal tax liability calculation will no longer be required. <T3>Total Housing Expense </T3>will mean the sum total of principal, interest,real estate taxes, and hazard insurance (PITI). (Note: Monthly MIP andhomeowner association/condo fees must be added, when applicable.) Maintenanceand repairs will no longer be used in this calculation. Heat and utilitieswill be treated in a manner different from the proposed rule, as indicatedabove. <T3>Recurring Charges </T3>will continue to mean any debt that does notmature in six months or is classed as continuous, <T3>e.g., </T3>automobile loans, child support, child care, etc. It willno longer include such things as state and local taxes, retirement or socialsecurity. <T3>Fixed Payment </T3>will mean the sum total of the housing expense plusthe recurring charges. <T3>Residual Income </T3>will mean effective income minus fixed payment.<T3>Housing Ratio </T3>will mean housing expense divided by effective income.The recommended guideline HUD anticipates using is 29 percent. <T3>Fixed Payment Ratio </T3>will mean fixed payment divided by effectiveincome. The recommended guideline HUD anticipates using is 41 percent.This represents an increase from 38 percent in the proposed rule. Thisincrease in the ratio is based upon additional analysis indicating that38 percent was too low and that 41 percent would make HUD consistent withthe Veterans Adminstration. In essence, the significant change this rule would make in the existingregulation would be to shift from use of a ``net effective income'' conceptto use of a ``gross income'' concept in determining adequacy of a mortgagor'sincome. The impact of such a shift on applicant mortgagors would be negligiblebut the gain in FHA processing efficiency and accuracy could be significant.HUD will retain authority to adjust the guideline income and fixed paymentratios by administrative instructions to meet the demands of the housingmarket (see Mortgagee Letter (82-10)). The 29 and 41 percent ratios cited above were arrived at after reprocessingapproximately 200 previously processed and approved HUD cases. The former38 and 53 percent ratios generally equated to these proposed ratios. Provision is made in the rule that determinations of adequacy of mortgagorincome shall be made in a uniform manner without regard to race, color,religion, sex, national origin, familial status, handicap, marital status,source of income of the mortgagor or location of the property. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>Thirty three written comments were received from the public on the proposedrule. There were three comments from members of Congress, eight from regionalor local trade associations, seven from national trade or other organizations,eight from state or local energy-related governmental agencies, four fromindividuals and three from individual businesses. The issues raised bythe commenters fell into three major catagories. I. Removal of Current Limits on Loan Origination Fees For the reasons stated earlier in this preamble, this final rule does notcontain the proposal to remove current limits on loan origination fees.The comments received on this proposed rule are indicated in this preamble'searlier discussion of the proposal. II. Revision of Mortgagor Income Requirements-Qualifying Ratios Thirteen commenters addressed this issue. Three commenters were opposedto the revision_ten were in favor of it. Many commenters added specificrecommendations concerning the qualifying ratios that should be applied.The rule removes current specific guidelines from the regulatory text andprovides a more flexible and realistic standard. The new standard (in conformitywith general industry practice), would substitute the concept of grossincome rather than the concept of ``net effective income'' currently used.Guideline income and fixed payment ratios will be set by HUD in administrativeinstructions. The following response by a national housing organization is typical ofthose who oppose the proposal, mainly on the ground that the qualifyingratios to be used by HUD are improper.<ITAG tagnum="21">As described in the proposed rule, qualifying ratios would be basedon gross income rather than ``net-effective'' income, and the definitionof housing expense would be that used by conventional lenders (principal,interest, taxes and insurances). The measure of total fixed payments wouldalso be adjusted to that used by conventional lenders by dropping socialsecurity, and state and local taxes. This approach, while consistent withstreamlining efforts we support, does not offer an advantage to homebuyerssince the method currently used by FHA to determine housing expense issensitive to local conditions such as energy costs and taxes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, our major objection is to the proposed upper limit ratioof 38 percent. Our analysis of a sample of FHA cases actually approvedindicates that a literal application of the proposed 29-38% would haveresulted in disapproving almost half of all cases. In all but one case,exceeding the fixed payment ratio would have been the cause. This analysisalso indicates that current underwriting ratios (38-53%) were routinelyexceeded in order to qualify a buyer. In fact, the fixed payment ratio(53%) is so restrictive that it would, if strictly applied, disqualifymost buyers with typical monthly obligations such as a car payment or childsupport. HUD has had to rely heavily on compensating factors to qualifyborrowers under the current ratio system. The implication of this analysisis that unless HUD is prepared to exceed its proposed ratios in a significantnumber of cases, a large fraction of borrowers who would have been acceptedfor insurance under current practices will be excluded from participationin the program. It was the [national housing organization's] understandingthat HUD's goal was to streamline processing without excluding any borrowerwho would qualify under current requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A system that is designed to rely on exceptions to make it work reasonablyis inefficient and potentially damaging. It would seem more appropriateto set the ratios at a level that permits borrowers to qualify withouthaving to rely routinely on compensating factors, a process that subjectsan underwriter to being second guessed in the event a loan goes into default.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We strongly urge the Department to consider a fixed payment ratioof 42 percent. HUD previously concluded that 42 percent was a level whichwas comparable to HUD's current 53 percent ratio. We see no evidence tosuggest that lowering this ratio to 38 percent represents either good policyor sound program administration.</ITAG>With respect to the fixed payment ratio of 38 percent set forth in thepreamble to the proposed rule, this has been increased to 41 percent inthis final rule. With respect the earlier comment urging that the ``neteffective income'' concept is more sensitive to local needs, we believethat the special provisions set forth in the Preamble to this final rulewith respect to heat and energy costs go a considerable way toward meetingthis concern. III. Proposal not to Include Energy Expenses in Estimates of Monthly HousingExpense Fourteen commenters, mainly State or local energy offices, or regionalassociations, objected strongly to this proposal. The preamble to the proposed rule noted that HUD was reconsidering itspolicy of including anticipated monthly maintenance and repairs and heatand utility costs as part of its the housing expense analysis. It concludedthat monthly estimates for maintenance and repairs often did not reflectthe actual amounts expended for these items. Although heat and utilityestimates can be more accurately projected, HUD was opting for using amonthly housing expense estimate which included only the principal, interest,taxes and insurance (PITI) and related costs such as MIP and homeowneror condominium fees where applicable. It noted that this is the approachused by conventional lenders and invited the views of the public on thisdecision, stating that it would give careful consideration to such viewsin developing a final rule.Typical of the objections are those raised by a state Energy office.<ITAG tagnum="21">We feel as though HUD will be doing a disservice to both taxpayersand mortgagors by deleting utility costs as a criterion for determiningincome eligibility. In Arkansas, it is not uncommon for utility costs toequal or exceed the principal and interests on mortgages. A number of lendinginstitutions have recognized this fact and make efforts to consider theenergy efficiency of houses in their income eligibility requirements. Thedebt-to-income ratio can be adjusted to the benefit of the mortgagor ifhe/she is purchasing an energy efficient house. Failure to consider energycosts should only serve to increase the number of failed mortgages.</ITAG>As noted earlier, largely in response to these comments HUD has revisedits initial policy to permit the mortgagor qualifying ratios to be increasedup to 2 percent for homes considered to be energy efficient. The localHUD Field Offices will determine the energy efficiency standards that mustbe met to be eligible for an increase in the ratios.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Requirements </ITAG>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theUndersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities, since, in general,it would not significantly change mortgagor eligibility or FHA insurancebenefits, but instead would increase the efficiency of mortgage insuranceapplication processing. This rule was listed as item H-18-87 [Sequence Number 953] in the Department'sSemiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708,16728) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours (7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays) in the Officeof the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Room 10276, Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,DC 20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the proposed rule indicatesthat it does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. The home mortgage insurance programs affected by the rule are listed inthe Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under program numbers 14.108Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance; 14.117 Mortgage Insurance_Homes; 14.119Mortgage Insurance_Homes for Disaster Victims; 14.120 Mortgage Insurance_Homes for Low and Moderate Income Families; 14.121 Mortgage Insurance_Homesin Outlying Areas; 14.122 Mortgage Insurance_Homes in Urban Renewal Areas;14.123 Mortgage Insurance_Housing in Older, Declining Areas; 14.130 MortgageInsurance_Purchase by Homeowners of Fee Simple Title from Lesssors; 14.133Mortgage Insurance_Purchase of Units in Condominiums; 14.140 Mortgage Insurance_SpecialCredit Risks; 14.159 Section 245 Graduated Payment Mortgage Program; 14.161Single Family Home Mortgage Coinsurance; 14.165 Mortgage Insurance_Homes_MilitaryImpacted Areas; 14.166 Mortgage Insurance_Homes for Members of the ArmedServices; 14.172 Mortgage Insurance_Growing Equity Mortgages; 14.175 AdjustableRate Mortgages. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12612, Federalism </ITAG>The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>has determined that the policies contained in thisrule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their politicalsubdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and theStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to reviewunder the Order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to mortgagorsand lenders and do not impinge upon the relationship between the Federalgovernment and State and local governments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12606, The Family </ITAG>The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family, </T3>has determined that this rule does not have potentialfor significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. The rule involvesrationalizing income requirements for mortgage loans insured by the Department.No substantive changes are made in these requirements however, so any effecton the family would likely be indirect and insignificant. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>24 CFR Part 203 Mortgage insurance; Home improvement; Loan programs; Housing and communitydevelopment; Solar energy. 24 CFR Part 213 Mortgage insurance; Cooperatives. 24 CFR Part 234 Condominiums, mortgage insurance; Homeownership; Projects; Units.Accordingly, 24 CFR parts 203, 213, and 234 are amended to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 203_MUTUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND REHABILITATION LOANS </ITAG>1.
