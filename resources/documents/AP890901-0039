SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A collection of federal agencies is beginning adecade-long, multimillion dollar investigation into changes faced byPlanet Earth.   ``Evidence is increasing on the scientific table that change isoccurring,'' said Bob Corell of the National Science Foundation,adding that both natural and human-induced changes could have abroad impact on the future.   A host of agencies have joined in the 2-year-old federalCommittee on Earth Science to set up the research ``to monitor,understand and, ultimately, predict global change,'' said RobertPost of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.   ``Global change is a large, complex scientific problem and itstill is not largely understood,'' committee Chairman Dallas Peck,head of the U.S. Geological Survey, said at a Thursday newsconference.   ``There is a shared, common purpose _ to go understand globalchange,'' said NASA's Dixon Butler.   Peck described the coming fiscal year as largely a planningperiod to be used setting up research programs likely to last adecade or more.   The atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority, withMichael Hall of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationexplaining that clouds are a major factor in the feared rise inglobal temperatures. Their effect is not well understood, he said.   The widely discussed threat of global warming, however, is onlypart of the overall research effort that includes studies of threatsto the earth's protective ozone layer, possible changes in theoceans and atmosphere, air pollution and acid rain.   The most attention has been paid recently to the reports ofwarmer temperatures, with some scientists concerned that the carbondioxide and other gases added to the atmosphere by human activitieswill increase temperatures and cause disruptive climate change.   This so-called greenhouse effect is disputed by other scientists,however, and evidence is lacking on both sides. That is an area theresearchers hope to tackle early.   Funds totaling $191.5 million for fiscal 1990 are included in thebudgets of various departments to get the program under way.   The seven major areas of research set forth in the committee planare:   _Climate and hydrologic systems. The role of clouds is the firstitem on the agenda, followed by research in ocean circulation, linksbetween the air, land and water and their interactions.   _Biogeochemical dynamics, such things as the relationship betweenliving organisms and the water and atmosphere. For example, treestake carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen, andcutting down trees will reduce that activity.   _Ecological systems and dynamics, which covers how people, plantsand animals would react to climate change and how their reactionsmight in turn affect other processes.   _Earth system history will look into what has happened to theland, air and water when climate has changed in the past.   _Human interactions will examine population growth anddevelopment, energy and land use and industrial production and howthose activities affect the earth.   _Solid earth research will include research on coastal erosion,volcanoes and their effect on climate, permafrost, the sea floor andother areas.   _Solar influences studies will include monitoring the incomingradiation from the sun, the amount reflected into space and how thatenergy affects the earth and its climate.   In addition to the Geological Survey, Science Foundation, Officeof Technology Policy, NASA and NOAA, other agencies participating inthe program are the State Department, Environmental ProtectionAgency, Departments of Transportation, Agriculture and Defense,Council on Environmental Quality.</TEXT></DOC>
