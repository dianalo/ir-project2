Peter Coleridge, 44, and Omar Traboulsi, 31, were seizedThursday night, Oxfam spokesman John Magrath said in Oxford,England. Coleridge is the organization's Middle East coordinatorand Traboulsi is its Lebanon representative, he said.   ``We've had conflicting reports as to whether they are stillbeing held or not,'' Magrath said.   No one claimed responsibility for the abductions, which broughtthe number of foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanonto 24.   There were no eyewitnesses confirming the abduction, saidNissrine Rawda, an official at Oxfam's Beirut office.   Oxfam is a British charity that aids refugees and poor peoplearound the world.   Ms. Rawda said Coleridge went to Sidon Thursday accompanied byat least two local Oxfam staff members and had been expected backin Beirut later today. Sidon is 25 miles south of Beirut.   She said Coleridge arrived in Lebanon two days ago on his firstvisit in three years to inspect Oxfam's operations. He lives inOxford with his wife and two daughters.   Magrath said he could not give any other details of theabduction. A police spokesman said Lebanese authorities had noinformation about a missing Briton.   ``We have ideas about who might have done it, but we don't wantto speculate,'' Magrath said.   ``The people we work with on the ground have told us not topanic. We know they're making contacts in Sidon to find out exactlywhat's happened and see that Peter and Omar are released.''   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station earlierreported in Beirut that Coleridge and Trabousli were missingshortly after their arrival in Sidon.   A British embassy official termed the report at that time ``afalse alarm.''   Sidon is Lebanon's third largest city with a predominantly SunniMoslem population of about 250,000.   On Wednesday, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants released aWest German captive, Ralph Schray, 30, in Beirut five weeks afterhe was kidnapped.   Two U.N. Relief and Works agency officials, Jan Stening, 44, ofSweden and William Jorgensen, 58, of Norway, were kidnapped nearSidon Feb. 5, apparently by Palestinians acting independently ofguerrilla groups.   Their abductors handed the two over to the Palestine LiberationOrganization on Tuesday after 25 days in captivity.   Twenty-two other foreigners are missing and believed kidnappedin Lebanon. They include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, threeBritons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and twounidentified men.   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seizedMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
