(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A millionaire stock trader chargedwith intending to shoot financier Ivan Boesky has been ordered heldwithout bail by a judge who rejected arguments that jail would harmthe trader's mental health.   John A. Mulheren, 38, of Rumson appeared Tuesday before U.S.Magistrate John C. Manna to face two charges of attempting totamper with a federal witness. He was transferred to a federalprison in New York City.   The magistrate scheduled a Friday bail hearing over theobjections of Mulheren's attorney, Peter Bennett, who said hisclient suffered manic-depression.   ``A manic-depressive such as my client back on lithium for thelast five days is not a risk to himself or others,'' Bennett toldthe judge. ``Jail is detrimental to his condition. He's far betteroff in a private care clinic.''   Bennett said Mulheren was on a ``manic-crash'' the dayauthorities allege he intended to shoot Boesky.   Authorities contend Mulheren pulled out of his riverfront estateFeb. 18 with a high-powered assault rifle and Army fatigues in theback seat of his car after police had confiscated three otherweapons from him.   He intended to shoot Boesky, 50, of New York and Boesky's formerchief stock trader, Michael Davidoff, 43, of Manalapan Township,according to a New Jersey complaint.   Before the federal hearing Tuesday, state Superior Court JudgeAlvin Y. Milberg released Mulheren from the county jail where hewas being held on the state charges.   Mulheren was arrested immediately afterward by four U.S.marshals, flanked by an investigator from the U.S. attorney'soffice in the southern district of New York and a federal attorneyfrom New Jersey, authorities said.   Mulheren had been held in the county jail in lieu of $17,500bail on two weapons charges that carry a total maximum of 15 yearsin prison.   Bennett told the magistrate that Mulheren was not bailed out ofthe county jail for 12 days because his manic-depressive conditionprecluded him from cooperating with attorneys on a defense. Bennettasked that bail be set at Tuesday's hearing.   However, Manna ruled in favor of Terrence Flynn, an assistantU.S. attorney who said he needed more time to prepare his case.   Boesky, once a close friend of Mulheren's, and Davidoff pleadedguilty last year to a single count of securities fraud and havecooperated with the government's continuing investigation ofinsider trading on Wall Street.   Boesky paid a fine of $100 million to the Securities andExchange Commission to settle civil charges of insider trading, andwill begin serving a three-year prison term March 24. Davidofffaces a five-year term when sentenced.   Mulheren is a friend of rock star Bruce Springsteen. The singer,also of Rumson, visited Mulheren in the county jail Saturday duringa break in his national concert tour, Monmouth County SheriffWilliam M. Lanzaro confirmed Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
