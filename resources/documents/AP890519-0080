Cools' parents were in Sidon to try to gain their son's release.He was kidnapped May 21, 1988. The 32-year-old doctor was workingfor the Norwegian humanitarian agency, Norwac, when he disappearedafter leaving his base in the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp.   ``We appeal to the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples and groupsto release Jan,'' Paul Cools told a news conference. His wife,Louisa, fought back tears as she addressed the captors: ``We wantto ask you to give us at least a sign of Jan.''   A previously unknown group calling itself Soldiers of Justiceclaimed it kidnapped Cools, and it branded him a spy.   Also today, Beirut's Ash-Shiraa magazine said the ``file of theforeign hostages held in Lebanon is now in the hands of AhmadKhomeini,'' son of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran.   In a brief, unattributed report, the magazine said AhmadKhomeini ``has recently summoned several officials of Hezbollah todiscuss this issue.'' It said Khomeini had taken charge of thehostage issue from Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani andAyatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, who was forced to resign lastmonth because of his criticism of Khomeini's policies.   The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God, isbelieved to be the umbrella for pro-Iranian factions that hold mostof the 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Two West German relief workers also reportedly were kidnapped inSidon on Tuesday, but no group has claimed to hold them.</TEXT></DOC>
