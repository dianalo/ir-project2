Recall that Congress, overcoming various laws of the natural political order, recently voted to delegate the closing of costly and redundant military bases to an independent commission. Senator Alan Dixon now has taken aim at the fact that the bill exempts overseas bases. &quot;I find it ludicrous and beyond belief,&quot; the Senator thunders, &quot;that the Department of Defense is trying to tell us . . . not one could be closed.&quot; Expect more such caterwauling as the dreadful day of closedown approaches. </TEXT></DOC>
