U S West said it received a letter from the department'sbureau of export licensing saying it would oppose export byany country of sophisticated telecommunications technology tothe Soviets. Specifically, it cited equipment withtransmission speeds of 140-megabits-per-second or higher. TheU S West fiber project's speed would be 565 megabits persecond, three times slower than state-of-the-arttelecommunications technology in use in the U.S. today.</LP><TEXT>   U S West said it is pursuing a 30-day review, and isconcerned that its partners in the trans-Soviet project orother foreign companies that have fiber-optic technologycould go forward on their own. The department, however,expressed confidence that no country would ship such gearwithout U.S. approval.   The Commerce Department rejection comes on the eve of theParis meeting of the Coordinating Committee for MultilateralSecurity Controls, the 17-nation committee that setsguidelines on what technologies can be shipped to the SovietUnion and other communist countries.   Earlier this month, the U.S. signaled that it would pushto allow exports of certain telecommunications equipment toEastern Europe, a move applauded by Westerntelecommunications companies, which generally view EasternEurope and the Soviet Union as sizable, if not rich, markets.Phone companies and equipment makers are eager to get theirfoot in the door, anticipating a more robust market for phoneequipment and service as more Western companies set upbusiness in the Soviet bloc.   Meantime, the Soviet Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications, concerned about its outmodedcommunications networks, has encouraged Western projects. TheU S West fiber pipeline was to have two parts: a fiber linkacross Siberia connecting Europe and the Pacific Rim, and anintra-U.S.S.R. network. U S West was joined in the Sovietfiber project by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunicationsas well as Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan, SocietaFinanziaria Telefonica of Italy, British TelecommunicationsPLC, and other phone companies in Australia, Denmark and WestGermany.   In a recent interview, U S West Chairman Jack MacAllistersaid the project had enthusiastic support within the SovietUnion and among businesses in Europe and the Pacific Rim.Laird Walker, who heads the company's Washington office, saidyesterday that the project &quot;represents an importanttelecommunications link that will further open Soviet societyand enhance world communications.&quot; The company apparentlyfaces an uphill battle convincing the Commerce Department ofthat.</TEXT></DOC>
