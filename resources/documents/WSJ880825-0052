What they do remember -- and will probably never forget -- is Black Monday.    That, in a nutshell, largely explains the market's current malaise. Stock prices are relatively attractive, the economy is still healthy, and corporate profits are booming. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains 26% below its year-ago peak of 2722.42. And even though it rose sharply yesterday, no one expects it to make up the lost ground any time soon.    Why the malaise? Investors are suffering from high anxiety about the market's ability to function. They fear that stock prices are responding less to economic fundamentals and traditional capital-raising than to the vagaries of automated trading mechanisms and arcane institutional strategies.    &quot;October is absolutely in the back of everyone's mind, day in and day out,&quot; says Robert F. Rittereiser, who headed E.F. Hutton Group until American Express's Shearson Lehman unit took it over in the wake of the crash. Confidence will remain low, he adds, because &quot;people saw how fragile the system was.&quot;    Last summer, as the bull market hit its five-year peak after advancing 250%, its benefits were clearly being bestowed unevenly. Powerful institutions, brokers and takeover specialists all reaped huge gains, fees and commissions. Employees with pension funds indirectly profited. Yet plant closings, layoffs and corporate restructurings eliminated millions of jobs beyond Wall Street. And although many small investors went along on the market's ride, others bought real estate or bond funds -- or didn't play at all.    Also uneven was the impact of the market's 23% crash Oct. 19. The most visible casualties have been on Wall Street, where 15,000 jobs have been lost. Stock and bond offerings have been shelved, and some corporate buy-out plans have been scrapped. Yet the economy hasn't fallen into recession. Unemployment dropped to a 14-year low in June. Inflation has so far remained largely in check. Corporate earnings are strong, theoretically providing some attractive investment opportunities -- at least by ordinary measures.    But these are anything but ordinary times on Wall Street. The stomach-wrenching crash is still traumatizing large and small investors alike, even those who survived without major damage.    Many institutions are pursuing alternative investments to stocks while sitting on huge cash hoards. The giant Dreyfus Fund, for example, has 60% of its assets in cash, up from a more normal 10% and an unusually high 40% on Black Monday.    Trying to reduce risk, big investors are increasingly relying on asset-allocation formulas -- formulas that call for taking profits if stocks rise relatively modestly. And short-term trading professionals also have become enthusiastic again about a &quot;buy-write&quot; stock-and-options strategy. Both maneuvers tend to hold down the market's potential gains. Thus, with institutions still dominating trading, the Dow has been wandering aimlessly for months in a band roughly between 1900 and 2150 on generally slack trading volume.    Individuals also are holding back from the market, worried about being trampled in another selling stampede that would hurt the little guy more than the big institutions. &quot;Individual investors who thought their stock was as good as cash found they couldn't even reach their brokers on Black Monday, or if they could, they couldn't get their stock sold,&quot; says Robert S. Pirie, the president of Rothschild Inc. &quot;All that anxiety out there isn't over the value of stocks; it's about the soundness of the marketplace,&quot; the investment banker adds.    How investors are dealing with that anxiety varies widely. William H. McGill, a retired auto executive, took a fearsome financial licking on Black Monday. Yet he kept playing the market -- albeit far more conservatively -- and now has finally about recovered his losses.    But Fred McIntyre, a railroad worker in Omaha, Neb., vows that he will &quot;never invest in the market again for the rest of my life.&quot; With good reason. As Black Monday dawned, he held in his brokerage account a handsome nest egg of more than four times his $30,000-a-year pay. The next day, all of it was gone, and he owed his broker more than $300,000 to boot.    Nonetheless, some sun does shine on Wall Street.    Surveys of some of the 100,000 members of the American Association of Individual Investors suggest that they are tiptoeing cautiously toward buying more stock again. And though still largely on the sidelines, many big institutions are clearly growing itchy to re-employ idled assets on the New York Stock Exchange. Some have been quietly buying growth stocks in the over-the-counter market, which has turned in a respectable 14% year-to-date gain, far exceeding the Dow's advance.    Corporate profits, a traditional engine of stock prices, rose sharply in the second quarter from a year earlier. Although worry about future earnings may be depressing stock prices, the profit surge to date, as well as lower stock prices, has helped: Stocks are selling at an average of about 14 times annual earnings, down from 22 times earnings a year ago.    Moreover, the economy shows scant evidence of repeating the post-1929 slide into the Depression. The current 70-month recovery appears to be slowing with age, but economists still haven't sighted its end. The Dow, which for months after Black Monday had eerily retraced its 1929 path, has held since June to higher ground in relation to 1929, and the gap between the industrial average then and now continues to widen.    However, the search for parallels provides both fascination and concern. The recent rise in interest rates sparked reminders of the 1931 rate increases, which undermined efforts to halt the economic slump. &quot;We're all saying it won't happen again, but, meanwhile, the Fed has tightened a little bit, and it may tighten again,&quot; comments Howard Stein, who runs Dreyfus Corp., the mutual-fund company.    Such fears may be weighing on small investors as well. Despite allotting more of their portfolios to stocks, members of the American Association of Individual Investors, weekly opinion samplings indicate, have been less bullish about the stock market's prospects lately than at about any other time since the crash. According to William Anderson, a financial analyst at the association, the percentage of members professing to be bullish skidded from 45% at the end of June to just 16% a month later. In the week ended Aug. 12, the figure was still an alarmingly low 19%.    That gloom contrasts sharply with the ebullience generated during the market's five-year bull run, which began with the pressure to reinvest gushers of new capital produced by the double-digit bond yields of the early 1980s. The pressure strengthened the hands of Wall Street's traders, who, armed with computers, were producing huge profits for their firms. By 1984, traders and their short-term trading mentality were in control or close to it at most major Wall Street houses.    Takeover arbitrage soon was joined at center stage by more-complex trading-based investment strategies -- notably stock-index arbitrage and portfolio insurance. These two strategies linked the stock, futures and options markets and helped drive up the prices of all three.    Eventually, the market got so high that many investors grew nervous. Then, just before Labor Day last year, the brand-new Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, raised interest rates. And through September and into October, uneasiness grew about the danger of a sell-off triggered by portfolio insurers trying to curb their losses in a declining market. By Oct. 19, the Dow industrials had plunged 17% from their peak, with just over half of that drop coming in a vicious three-day sell-off sparked by a disappointing balance-of-trade report on Oct. 14. Eventually, that plunge paled beside the crash, which drove the Dow down 508 points, almost 23% -- and which so battered some investors that nearly all investors are still on edge.    Until Black Monday, Fred McIntyre had accumulated about $120,000 in his account at a Wall Street firm -- about half in municipal bonds and the rest in the options market. The 46-year-old railroad repairman had made most of the money selling options based on the Standard andamp; Poor's 100-stock index. Selling both puts and calls, he was betting, against both the bulls and the bears, that the market would trade in a range between the strike prices of the two options until they expired. If the options expire worthless, the sellers get all the money the buyers paid for the options.    But Mr. McIntyre's strategy backfired on Oct. 19. The puts -- the buyers' bets that the market would drop -- soared in value, sticking Mr. McIntyre with a loss of well over $400,000. That far outstripped the comparative pittance he got by selling the then-worthless calls. His brokerage account was left with a $330,000 deficit.    Last month, Mr. McIntyre's broker offered a &quot;pretty liberal&quot; settlement, under which Mr. McIntyre can't publicly identify the securities firm or discuss the terms. Now that his stock-playing days are over, he says, he is trying to rebuild his family's nest egg by playing state lotteries.    Options also hurt Bill McGill, a retired Chrysler Corp. management auditor living in Pittsburgh. His investments prior to Black Monday included sales of put options. These positions, which forced him to buy stocks at previously agreed prices that suddenly were far above market levels, hit him with $44,000 of losses last October. But aided by securities profits taken the previous spring, he had the cash to buy some of the bargains created by the crash. Today, he says, he has clawed his way back to &quot;even or maybe even a bit ahead.&quot;    But he hasn't tried any more option plays. Instead, he makes short-term investments in common stocks. For example, 200 shares of Caterpillar bought Oct. 20 at $38 apiece were sold six weeks later at $53, and 100 Federal National Mortgage Corp. shares bought at $33 in late October were sold last March at $45.    Yves F.M. Hentic, a veteran Wall Street trader specializing in arbitrage and other short-term plays, has changed his act since Black Monday, too. &quot;There's nothing like losing $1 million to focus your attention on risk,&quot; he says. (In an earlier underwriting venture, a small securities that Mr. Hentic controlled went out of business because of insufficient capital.)    In contrast to his once-huge plunges in a single investment, Mr. Hentic and many other professional traders have turned to buy-write strategies. Under such strategies, a stock is purchased when the Dow industrials sink close to the bottom of their trading range, and the shares, options against them or both are sold as the Dow rises toward the top of the band. The buying helps ignite rallies when the Dow is down near 1900, and the selling helps quench them when it moves toward its 1988 high of 2158.61. And this conservative strategy can be repeated over and over.    &quot;Nobody's betting the ranch on anything these days,&quot; Mr. Hentic says, &quot;and you couldn't if you wanted to.&quot; He notes that his few recent attempts at big stock-option trades have fizzled because he couldn't find anyone to take the opposite side of the transaction.    &quot;These days, if you try to do anything in size, people get nervous and the liquidity dries up instantly,&quot; Mr. Hentic says, adding, &quot;I'm just about back to where I was before the crash now, but it's been a very tough grind. This market is still a very sick puppy.&quot;    For Howard Stein, even a highly conservative 40% cash position last October wasn't conservative enough to fully protect the Dreyfus Fund on Black Monday. But while the $2.25 billion mutual fund outperformed many equity funds and has bounced back from the losses 10 months ago, Mr. Stein feels uncomfortable. He cites a jumble of nagging concerns, including the paucity of money flowing back into the stock market, companies' eagerness to buy back their stock rather than invest in their businesses, and speculators' search for quick profits through takeovers.    &quot;It's the kind of environment where we should be trying to protect people's investments,&quot; Mr. Stein says.    Thus, in addition to raising Dreyfus Fund's cash holdings to 60%, Mr. Stein is digging harder for investments. He thinks that he has found some in Texas. For example, the fund has bought about $25 million in securities of First City Bancorp of Houston, which was rescued last April through a federally assisted bailout led by A. Robert Abboud. Dreyfus Corp., the fund's parent, has also turned its eyes to Texas, taking a stake in a company shopping for oil and gas leases and in another looking to buy real estate.    Other institutions are looking outside the stock market. The Rockefeller Foundation, which has $1.7 billion in assets, allotted $10 million last year to investing in securities of troubled companies. Last spring, it doubled that allotment.    Believing that the post-crash potential for stock gains is eroding with time, Jack R. Meyer, who runs the foundation's investments, also reduced its holdings of U.S. equities this month to 52% from 55%. That move, along with cutbacks in foreign stocks and real estate, has raised its cash to about 14% of assets from the usual 5%. Other large investors say they are searching for investment opportunities in Latin America and putting more money into venture-capital and takeover funds.    Though still involving only small fraction of the institutions' total assets, such maneuvers worry the stock exchanges because they limit stock purchases. That's hardly a new worry for the exchanges, but the crash spotlighted the risks of stock ownership.    However, there's another side to Black Monday: It put the Big Board on center stage, like it or not, and, surprisingly, the exchange seemed to like it.    Although the exchange never tried to trumpet exactly how much its leadership and market makers did to soften the crash, its large, slick public-relations department successfully portrayed Chairman John Phelan to Washington and the public as the spokesman of the stock market. But that has boomeranged, to some extent. Much of the investor and regulatory concern about the health of the market since the crash has focused on the Big Board, while other markets whose performance during the crash was far worse -- notably the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock market -- have faced much less heat.    Responding to the continuing concern, the Big Board recently promised to speed orders of small investors, in preference to big traders, when the Dow moves 25 points in a day. In addition, the exchange said it would adopt &quot;shock absorbers&quot; in conjunction with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to slow the impact of program trading affecting both Big Board stocks and Chicago Merc futures on the Sandamp;P 500 index. Government agencies, however, haven't made any major regulatory changes, although the Brady commission, the presidential panel that studied the market crash, advocated quick regulatory and structural changes to prevent a recurrence.    But the exchange's biggest problem, critics contend, is its market makers. These &quot;specialists&quot; aren't sufficiently capitalized or willing to spend enough of their money to keep trading smooth, critics say. Although the exchange strongly defends its specialists' performance on Black Monday, it agrees that they need more capital.    Mr. Rittereiser, the former E.F. Hutton chief, isn't surprised that the specialists were overwhelmed, and he doubts that they ever could have enough capital, given the deluge of selling that portfolio insurance can generate. He suggests that the exchange should be able to tap pension funds and other institutions, many of which might be willing to buy heavily in a slump if the mechanisms were in place.    Yet the experience of Hutton, his own former firm, seems to argue against such an approach -- unless the buying power was overwhelming. He says that Hutton continued to buy stock from its clients on Black Monday until its inventory swelled to three or four times its usual level. Then, he says, the firm threw in the towel and tried to curb its own losses. The damage drove the 83-year-old firm into the arms of Shearson Lehman in a matter of weeks.    And Mr. Rittereiser wonders how far Wall Street firms will go in risking their own money for clients in another Black Monday. &quot;What has changed to make anyone so brave to step up there the next time?&quot; he asks.    As for the market outlook, Mr. Rittereiser voices the widespread sentiment that cautious investors will get out of rising markets faster than they would have before Black Monday and that bearish worries will continue to be magnified. &quot;That's unfortunate because the economy is in pretty decent shape,&quot; he says. &quot;The tail is going to wag the dog for some time to come.&quot;    ---                The Difference a Year Has Made                    Brokerage Stocks Fell            Percent change from 8/25/87 to 8/24/88            Morgan Stanley                  - 3.5%            First Boston                     -11.3%            Shearson Lehman Hutton          -21.0%            Salomon Inc.                    -35.1%            Merrill Lynch                   -36.1%            A.
