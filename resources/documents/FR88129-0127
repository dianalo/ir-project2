Under this program, awards are made to institutions of higher education,public and private agencies and organizations_including Indian tribes_andtribal organizations, in affiliation with universities. NIDRR can makeawards for up to sixty months. On October 7, 1987 NIDRR published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 37574) for public comment twelve proposedpriorities for RRTCs in fiscal year 1988. That notice included proposedpriorities in areas of psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation research,such as employability development, supported work, rehabilitation, communityintegration for individuals with developmental disabilities, rehabilitationof special populations and elderly disabled persons, research on familieswith disabled members, and research to make housing more accesssible, thatNIDRR intends to approach through RRTCs in fiscal year 1988. The noticerequesting transmittal of the applications for these priority Centers waspublished with the Notice of Proposed Priorities, and the closing datefor receipt of applications was December 15, 1987. This notice does notsolicit additional applications, nor will NIDRR accept applications transmittedafter December 15, 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>NIDRR received 34 letters of comment from the public. A discussion of therequests for substantive changes and clarifications follows, with generalcomments first, and then comments on each individual priority. Study Institute's and State-of-the-Art Studies <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters questioned the purpose or meaningof ``state-of-the-art'' study. One other commenter suggested that eachCenter should conduct an annual institute on rehabilitation issues, leadingto a publication, as is required in some of the vocational priorities.<T3>Discussion: </T3>NIDRR intends this to mean that the RRTC should conducta review of the state-of-the-art, either by a conference, an expert review,or some other means proposed by the applicant. NIDRR is not requiring thatevery Center conduct an ambitious study institute each year because ofthe fact that work in some of the priority areas will be quite new andthe constituencies for the institutes not yet well-defined. This is nottrue in the vocational area where there is a tradition and an expectationthat such institutes will occur. However, the Secretary notes that theconduct of study institutes is one means by which a Center can conductsome of its dissemination activities. <T3>Changes: </T3>The phrase, ``Conduct * * * a state-of-the-art study''has been modified to read, ``a study of the state-of-the-art'' to reflectmore clearly NIDRR's intent. Inclusion of Long-Term Mentally Ill Individuals <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter remarked that there should be prioritiesfor research on persons disabled by chronic mental illness, and suggestedthat priorities of supported employment, facilities improvement, rehabilitationinformation systems management, and community integration of elderly personswith mental retardation should include focus on persons with mental illness.<T3>Discussion: </T3>NIDRR currently supports four RRTCs dealing specificallywith issues of mental illness. In addition, NIDRR recently funded a priorityproject to evaluate models of supported employment for this population.The Secretary will not require these currently announced Centers to focuson problems of persons with mental illness. However, the supported employmentand the facilities improvement Centers are encouraged to assess extendingthese programs to new populations, including those with mental illness.NIDRR intends to continue research related to this important target populationoutside these priorities. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Rehabilitation Information Management<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters suggested that NIDRR establish apriority for improving management generally in the state rehabilitationagency system. These commenters suggested that issues such as ``organizationalculture'', staff training, planning and evaluation, and other traditionalmanagement issues should not be neglected. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the general management issuesare important ones, and also that there are interesting theoretical modelsfor increasing productivity in public agencies that could be worthwhilesubjects of further exploration. However, the Secretary wants to avoidthe dilution of effort and instead to focus on the solution to discretebut important problems in management. Therefore, the decision was madeto focus this RRTC for this time period on improving the manangement ofinformation in rehabilitation agencies. Certain issues of planning andevaluation, staff development, and organizational cultures may be touchedupon in the context of improving information management, thereby developingmodels that might be adapted to a broader range of issues. NIDRR also urgesapplicants to approach these issues in investigator-initiated competitionsin the Field-Initiated Research and Innovation Grant programs. <T3>Changes: None.</T3>Enhancing Employability <T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that this priority containstwo very different issues in the employability development process. Oneissue focuses on the disabled person and his or her abilities, limitations,needs, and aspirations. The other issue focuses on the needs of the rehabilitationprofessional, the employer, and others for training, support, and programmodels. The commenter suggested that these two separate aspects of theproblem should be isolated and two separate priorities announced. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that these are different issuesand that they traditionally have been approached by different groups ofresearchers, usually in isolation. For this reason, this Center prioritywas designed to include comprehensive, multifaceted, interdisciplinary,and synergistic research and training in this area. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Rehabilitation of Native Americans <T3>Comments:</T3> NIDRR received a number of comments concerning the priorityfor a Center in rehabilitation of American Indians with disabilities. Thefirst of these was that the Center's scope should be expanded by changingthe target population to Native Americans. Some commenters objected to the priority's requirement that there be afocus on developing models to improve employment of Native Americans withdisabilities on and adjacent to reservations, on the grounds that the economiesin these areas are too limited to afford employment opportunities to Indianswith disabilities. Others urged that the priority should focus on culturallysensitive, comprehensive approaches to rehabilitation, including issuesof substance abuse and self-esteem. Some commenters stated that the priorityignored the needs of specific subpopulations, including youthful and elderlypopulation groups and urban Indians. A number of commenters urged that NIDRR require the RRTC to work on issuesof prevention and restoration. Finally, some commenters stated that therecent Congressionally-mandated study, entitled ``A Study of the SpecialProblems and Needs of American Indians with Handicaps Both On and Off theReservation'', prepared by the two existing RRTCs on Native Americans obviatesthe need for further studies of the specific rehabilitation problems ofNative Americans with disabilities. <T3>Discussion:</T3> NIDRR chose to use the term ``American Indians'' becausethat was the focus of the Congressional mandate for a study. However, theSecretary agrees to the use of a more inclusive designation for the Center.The Secretary recognizes that the economies on and adjacent to many Indianreservations are depressed, and that employment opportunities are scarce.This is the very reason that an RRTC must analyze the precise nature ofthose labor markets <T3>in order to develop models for increasing employment.</T3> The Secretaryand NIDRR believe that employment is a critical component of independentliving and are committed to developing employment options for all personswith disabilities who want to work. The Center is supposed to develop andtest culturally sensitive models to enhance employment within the contextof the area economies. This may be a difficult task, but it is one thatis crucial to the independence and dignity of many individuals with disabilities.The Center is not precluded from developing employability enhancement modelsfor urban Indians, but it is not required to do so, nor is it requiredto conduct analyses of urban labor markets. In fact, the study referencedabove included a number of ``Recommendations for Improving the Status ofAmerican Indians with Disabilities''. Among those related to employment(see page 18 of the Executive Summary) was to ``* * * facilitate the developmentof jobs for American Indian people with disabilities within the existingjob market, particularly on and adjacent to reservations''. NIDRR provides support to studies of rehabilitation for all age groups.Each applicant for the Center grant may select any age group or groupsas the focus of this research, and may include special research or disseminationprojects that serve either very young or elderly Native Americans. NIDRR realizes that the problems of Native Americans with disabilitiesare extremely complex, and are compounded by factors in the external community,including economic limitations and service delivery problems, as well asby attitudinal and cultural issues, language and geographic barriers, substanceabuse, learned dependency, and other factors. The RRTC will approach anddevelop potential solutions to only a fraction of those issued during thisfive-year period. However, the priority as announced both implies and explicitlystates that the RRTC is expected to develop culturally relevant modelsfor employability development, for general service delivery, for training,and for information dissemination. The priority has been amended slightlyto emphasize this fact. Although NIDRR recognizes the importance of both primary and secondaryprevention of disability, it does not require that this be a focus of thisRRTC. The Public Health Service is generally charged with the responsibilityfor prevention. NIDRR does not believe its resources for this RRTC shouldbe widely diverted from the needs of Native Americans who do have disabilities,and therefore has not made this a focus of this Center. Finally, the Secretary does not believe that the recent above-referencedstudy meets all the needs for additional information on the incidence,prevalence, etiology, distribution, and impact of disability on NativeAmericans, or of the need for information on service use and availability.The study used only secondary data, which are not ideal for providing thelevel of detail and specificity needed for this purpose. The priority envisionedthat there will be primary data collection and analysis relating to subsamplesof the population. Indeed the study itself, in its recommendation to ``Improvethe Data Available on American Indians Who Are Disabled'' (see page 19of the Executive Summary), indicated eleven areas in need of future research.Many of these were relevant to this priority, including further analysisof mental retardation as a disabling condition among American Indians,an assessment of the needs of reservation Indians within the context oflocal communities, and an investigation of the status of disabled urbanIndians to assess their integration into the community, access to services,employment, and other issues. <T3>Changes:</T3> The name of the Center has been changed to include NativeAmericans rather than only American Indians. The specific requirementsfor employment studies and service delivery studies have been altered slightlyto make explicit the emphasis on developing culturally relevant servicemodels for Native Americans. Access to Community Living Environments<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter suggested that NIDRR specify the NationalAdvisory Committee for this Center must include a representative of a StateVocational Rehabilitation agency. A second commenter suggested that thethird paragraph be amended to include reference to accessible adaptableenvironments. Several commenters suggested that the priority should includeresearch on supportive services for independent living, since service issuesare often a major barrier to access to community living.<T3>Discussion: </T3>NIDRR agrees that the National Advisory Committeefor the Center should include a representative of a State rehabilitationagency and has so specified in the final priority. The word ``adaptable''may help to clarify the intent of the Center, and thus the statement hasbeen amended to refer to environments that are adaptable as well as accessible.However, the Secretary does not agree that research into the issues ofcommunity support services should be a specific requirement for this Center.The Secretary does not want to dilute the focus of the Center, in lightof the fact that NIDRR supports other research on community support systems.For that reason, the priority states that the Center must coordinate withother Centers and projects in relevant areas.<T3>Changes: </T3>The priority has been changed to require that a representativeof a State rehabilitation agency be included on the National Advisory Committee.The word ``adaptable'' has been inserted in the third paragraph of thepriority.Rehabilitation of Elderly Persons With Disabilities<T3>Comments: </T3>Two commenters suggested that as the population of personswho become disabled after they are older greatly exceeds that with pregeriatriconset of disability, the Center should focus on the former population.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary realizes the increasing incidence ofdisability as the population ages. However, the elderly population withmild to moderate impairments and disabling conditions is also served bya number of generic service agencies and other agencies that focus specificallyon problems of aging persons. The population of those with pergeriatriconset of disability, especially those living outside of institutions, isincreasing at a faster rate than the general aging population. This populationincludes many who have had long-term rehabilitation needs and services,and often their needs are not addressed by service systems not relatedto rehabilitation and disability. It is important to begin analyzing theneeds of this population and planning to meet those needs in order to avoidunnecessary institutionalization.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.New Directions for Rehabilitation Facilities<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that NIDRR clarify that the RRTCon new directions for rehabilitation facilities would assist those facilitiesto serve individuals with profound mental retardation as one of the newpopulation groups.<T3>Discussion: </T3>It is NIDRR's intention that this group be taken intoconsideration as a target population. Thus the priority has been changedto indicate that persons with profound mental retardation comprise oneof the emerging population groups that should be served by facilities incommunity settings, with the expectation that the RRTC in this area willincorporate this group into its scope of work.NIDRR supports a program of Rehabilitation Research and Training Centersto conduct programmatic, multidisciplinary, and synergistic research, training,and information dissemination in designated areas of high priority. Thefollowing final funding priorities represent priorities for research ina variety of rehabilitation areas that the Secretary intends to supportthrough the RRTC program in the coming year.These final priorities were established on the basis of NIDRR initial planningand public comments received during the comment period. The publicationof these final priorities does not bind the Federal Government to fundprojects in any of these areas. Funding of particular projects dependson the availability of funds and on the quality of the applications thatare received.The priorities represent areas in which NIDRR intends to support researchand related activities through grants or cooperative agreements for oneor more Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers. Rehabilitation Researchand Training Centers have been established to conduct coordinated and advancedprograms of rehabilitation research and to provide training to rehabilitationpersonnel engaged in research or the provision of services. RRTCs mustbe operated in collaboration with institutions of higher education andmust be associated with rehabilitation service programs. Each Center conductsa synergistic program of research, evaluation, and training activitiesfocused on a particular rehabilitation problem area. Each Center is encouragedto develop practical applications for all of its research findings as wellas for related findings of other studies. Centers generally disseminateand encourage the utilization of new rehabilitation knowledge through suchmeans as writing and publishing undergraduate and graduate texts and curriculaand publishing findings in professional journals. All materials that theCenters develop for dissemination and training must be appropriately accessibleto individuals with a range of handicapping conditions. RRTCs also conductprograms of in-service training for rehabilitation practitioners, educationat the pre-doctoral and post-doctoral levels, and continuing education.Each RRTC will conduct an interdisciplinary program of training in rehabilitationresearch, including training in research methodology and applied researchexperience, that will contribute to the number of qualified researchersworking in the area of rehabilitation research. Centers will also conductstudies of the state-of-the-art in relevant aspects of their priority areas.Each RRTC will also provide training to individuals with disabilities andtheir families in managing and coping with disabilities.NIDRR will conduct, not laer than three years after the establishment ofany RRTC, one or more reviews of the activities and achievements of theCenter, to include review by peers. Continued funding depends at all timeson satisfactory performance and accomplishment. (See 34 CFR 75.253). EachCenter will be expected to provide appropriate attendees for a generalgrants management meeting in Washington, D.C., to be arranged by NIDRRshortly after the Center grant has been awarded.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Priorities (12)</ITAG>New Directions for Rehabilitation FacilitiesThere are approximately 5,500 rehabilitation facilities in the United States.Facilities have traditionally served as settings for vocational trainingand evaluation, medical rehabilitation, and long-term employment for individualswith disabilities. State vocational rehabilitation agencies often use contractsand service agreements with facilities for the purchase of vocational rehabilitationservices. The Federal Government has provided fiscal incentives for facilityexpansion and guidelines for the purchase of facility-based services byagencies using Federal grant monies. Rehabilitation services are rapidlyshifting from providing evaluation and training in facilities toward providingthese services in regular integrated job sites. State rehabilitation agenciesmay use vendor payments or grant arrangements to obtain transitional employmentservices that provide training and follow-along services in competitivejob sites. Rehabilitation facilities are the most frequent suppliers ofthese transitional services. At the same time, facilities are also establishingprograms for public schools, for post-employment and job retention services,and to train nondisabled persons.However, many facilities face significant challenges in expanding theirexpertise and redirecting their services. They are particularly likelyto have difficulties organizing programs and services for ``new'' groupssuch as persons with traumatic brain injuries, severe learning disabilities,profound mental retardation, and chronic mental illness in community-basedsettings.A critical element of any Center to be funded in response to this prioritywill be the involvement of disabled individuals in the planning, implementation,and review of the Center's activities, and specifically in the processof selecting work sites and consumer-oriented performance criteria.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Develop and evaluate model transitional employment programs, orprogram components, that assist vocationally limited disabled individualsto acquire and maintain competitive employment;andbullet; Identify, assess, and disseminate new models of enclave and subcontractarrangements that can provide employment for small groups of disabled personsin integrated work settings;andbullet; Develop, based on studies of the direct placement of disabledindividuals in competitive jobs, improved techniques and related servicesto assist disabled individuals to obtain and maintain employment;andbullet; Develop and disseminate new models that facilities can use toprovide supportive networks for disabled persons in competitive employment;andbullet; Develop research-based training programs to train staff of rehabilitationfacilities to provide services in regular employment settings;andbullet; Develop procedures to assess the needs of disabled youth exitingpublic schools, to enable communities to develop responsive employmentprograms;andbullet; Assist facilities that have limited data gathering and researchcapacities to develop appropriate data and information systems and to participatein research efforts to improve their community-based employment programs;andbullet; Identify and evaluate new technologies such as laser discs, computers,and robotics and provide guidelines and training for the use of such innovationsby community employment programs to increase their effectiveness and efficiencyin assisting disabled individuals to gain and maintain employment;andbullet; Assess the employment-related needs of special populations ofdisabled individuals and identify methods by which such groups may be servedmore effectively by community-based employment services programs;andbullet; Organize and direct an annual study institute on a rehabilitationtopic, publish the results in a resource manual, and distribute the manualto State vocational rehabilitation programs; and professionals.Enhancing Employability of Individuals With HandicapsApproximately thirteen million people between sixteen and sixty-four yearsof age are work-disabled. Of the disabled population not employed, (9.5million) an estimated 8.7 million are not seeking employment. Disabledpersons, particularly persons with severe disabilities, are far more likelythan nondisabled persons to be out of work. Persons with disabilities whoare employed tend to work fewer hours, fewer weeks in the year, and earnless than nondisabled persons. A research and training effort is neededto develop capabilities at the national, state, and local levels to enhanceemployment potentials for all persons with disabilities.Research at this Center will be concerned with both the enhancement ofindividual employability and the enhancement of job opportunities. Servicesto individuals typically include skills training, employment readinesstraining, and job placement. Services to employers may include increasingawareness of disability, job development, technical assistance on job modifications,and other disability services. The Center will address employability problemsof disabled individuals in preparing for, obtaining, maintaining, and advancingin employment. This area of research will focus on career preparation,career initiation, and career enhancement for disabled individuals. Theobjective of this research will be the development of techniques wherebydisabled individuals can improve their work-related skills and generalemployability.A second emphasis of the research and training activities will be the developmentof more and better employment opportunities, primarily through enhancingemployer knowledge of disability, and assisting employers to locate andhire qualified disabled workers. The Center will conduct research whichwill improve work settings and employer practices for workers who experiencethe onset of disabilities while employed. The RRTC will assist rehabilitationservice delivery systems to adapt to the changing employability needs ofpersons with disabilities, whether by restructuring services programs,retraining staff, or adopting new service techniques.NIDRR intends to establish one or more Centers that will be national resourcesfor research and training to assist rehabilitation facilities to establishexemplary community-based employment programs. A critical element of anyCenter to be supported in response to this priority will be the involvementof individuals with disabilities in the planning, conduct, and review ofthe research and related activities.An absolute priority is announced for one or more RRTCs to:andbullet; Develop research and training models to enhance the capabilitiesof disabled individuals to develop rehabilitation plans, select careergoals, and match personal abilities and expectations to available vocationalopportunities;andbullet; Conduct research and training to improve the use of vocationalevaluations and assessments, and develop reliable and valid assessmentmeasures that will optimize personal choice and the range of employmentopportunities for disabled individuals;andbullet; Develop strategies and techniques that will enable special andvocational education and vocational rehabilitation agencies to work togetherto assist both employers and disabled youth in the transition from schoolto work;andbullet; Develop technical assistance and training to enable rehabilitationagencies, business and labor associations, and consumer groups to assistemployers to hire, retain, or return to work persons with disabilities;andbullet; Investigate the efficacy of a system to facilitate contacts betweendisabled people seeking jobs and disabled persons who are employed in orderto increase the likelihood that the former will obtain and maintain employment;andbullet; Develop and test new approaches for consumer organizations andindependent living programs to enhance employment of persons with disabilities;andbullet; Implement and expand computer-assisted vocational rehabilitationtechniques to improve the access of rehabilitation counselors to currentjob data and expedite employment;andbullet; Organize and direct an annual study institute on a rehabilitationtopic, publish the results, and distribute the manual to state vocationalrehabilitation agencies; andandbullet; Conduct at least one study of the state-of-the-art to identifycurrent knowledge and recommend future research, and organize researchand training conferences and short-term institutes to disseminate the resultsof Center projects to rehabilitation consumers and professionals.Improving Supported Employment Outcomes for Developmentally and Other SeverelyDisabled IndividualsDuring the past several years, Federal legislation and various employmentprograms for developmentally and other severely disabled individuals haveincorporated the concept of supported employment (Developmental DisabilitiesAct of 1984, Pub. L. 98-527, the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendmentsof 1986, Pub. L. 99-457, and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986,Pub. L. 99-506). Supported employment is defined as, ``competitive workin integrated work settings for individuals with severe handicaps for whomcompetitive employment has not traditionally occurred, or for individualsfor whom competitive employment has been interrupted or intermittent asa result of a severe disability, and who, because of their handicaps, needongoing support services to perform such work.'' There is now substantialagreement on many of the issues involved in the administration of supportedemployment programs, including training needs for direct service and leadershippersonnel, standards for performance, and measures for the evaluation ofoutcomes. Preliminary indications from studies of exemplary programs illustratethat these programs can provide significant benefits for program participantsat reasonable costs. Other studies have evaluated the role of specificcomponents of supported work, such as paid work in jobs with nondisabledcoworkers, behavioral techniques to teach job duties, and the involvementof parents and advocates. The rapid growth in the number and size of supportedemployment programs has exceeded the capacity of the resource base of trainedpersonnel and established program operating procedures to meet the needsof those persons with more severe disabilities who require ongoing supportto maintain regular employment.Recent research efforts have examined strategies for interagency coordinationto promote long-term support for persons with severe disabilities who areemployed. Current activities focus on technical assistance, developmentof information systems, and networks to share information among supportedemployment programs.The success of supported employment with developmentally and severely disabledpersons has led to replications and expansions to other disability groups.Consequently, NIDRR anticipates there will be a variety of supported employmentresearch and service activities taking place during the period of performanceof this RRTC. Although the RRTC to be established under this priority willfocus primarily on developmentally disabled persons, the Center will beencouraged to identify methods, techniques and models of value for otherefforts in supported employment.A critical element of any Center to be funded in response to this prioritywill be the involvement of disabled individuals in the planning, implementation,and review of the Center's activities, and specifically in the processof selecting work sites and consumer-oriented performance criteria. TheCenter will be an essential component of a national information systemon supported employment. It will be expected to share reports, researchfindings, and program models with other programs on supported employmentindentified by NIDRR.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Analyze vocational assessment techniques, training methods, placementstrategies, integration with nondisabled persons, followup and employerassistance, and techniques of imparting job-related social skills, in orderto improve supported employment for persons with developmental and othersevere disabilities;andbullet; Identify costs and benefits of alternative supported employmentmodels, including time-limited and long-term support programs, for variouspopulations of disabled persons, in order to provide better estimates forplanning supported employment opportunities;andbullet; Develop new, and validate existing, approaches to enhancing productivity,wages and benefits, job security, job advancement, and career transitionsto increase employment satisfaction for employees and employers in supportedwork settings;andbullet; Develop and provide training to severely disabled persons, familymembers, counselors, and peers, to increased their awareness of supportedwork and to integrate supported employment with other major componentsof independent living, including transportation, recreation, and residingin the community;andbullet; Analyze and organize training on regulations, employer incentives,standards, contracts, job agreements, economic development factors, andrelated issues to increase organizational capacities;andbullet; Identify best practices and most effective methods including staffingrequirements for large organizations to set up small supported employmentunits in dispersed locations;andbullet; Conduct research on transition from school to supported employmentto improve linkages among programs and to identify issues, methods, andmodels for both school and adult programs;andbullet; Develop technical assistance and training to ensure that developmentallyand other severely disabled youth exiting public school programs will havewell-defined pathways for entry into supported employment;andbullet; Analyze long-term funding options for supported employment forindividuals who have exhausted the time-limited services provided by thevocational rehabilitation system;andbullet; Analyze the relationship of supported employment to eligibilityfor income and health insurance benefits in order to inform prospectiveemployers and disabled individuals on financial consequences of supportedwork;andbullet; Conduct at least one comprehensive study of the state-of-the-artin an important area of supported employment, and serve as a national resourceto disseminate information on supported employment programs;andbullet; Provide opportunities for professional development through thetemporary exchange of staff with other RRTCs, Federal, State, or localagencies, private industry, or other relevant organizations;andbullet; Identify and assess methods to use technology to improve supportedemployment; andandbullet; Develop, evaluate, and disseminate materials to provide information,technical assistance, and motivation for supported employment programs,using various media and assuring that all materials are accessible to variouspersons with disabilities, and are distributed to businesses that may beinterested in supported employment programs.Improving the Management of Rehabilitation Information SystemsAccess to specialized information is an essential element of all rehabilitationactivities. Major strides in research and training on such severe, butlow-incidence, disabilities as spina bifida, spinal cord injury, and deaf-blindnesshave come through the establishment of specialized information systemsand data linkages among programs. Independent living and vocational andother rehabilitation programs generate and use large amounts of information.Eligibility determinations, case management requirements, organizationalstructures, decisions of rehabilitation professionals and clients, andclient or program evaluations all require complex information systems.In addition, broad and rapid dissemination of new knowledge requires centraldata depositories with access through on-line data retrieval at the pointof use. The implementation and improvement of rehabilitation informationsystems have substantial program implications; these systems generate needsfor staff competent in the use of computers, for interagency and intra-agencycoordinating agreements, and for continuous review and revision of thesystem. Rehabilitation agencies are increasingly using information technologyand various databases in all aspects of their rehabilitation programs.As a result of past research and development efforts in this area, severalsignificant rehabilitation information bases and automated informationsystems are in place or under development, including Spinal Cord InjuryData Systems, Traumatic Brain Injury Systems, Independent Living Systems,the State-Federal Vocational Rehabilitation System, and the databases onthe demographics of disability.At this time, it is important to assure that current and future databasesare properly integrated, maintained, and used to enhance rehabilitationpractices and results. A Center working in this area must identify modellinkages and other arrangements through which the operators of these informationsystems can cooperate on mutual program goals; develop and test methodsto use specific information system components in planning, delivering,and evaluating rehabilitation services; and provide training and informationexchange to improve the managment of rehabilitation information systems.A critical element of any Center to be funded in response to this prioritywill be the involvement of disabled individuals in the planning, implementation,and review of the Center's activities, and specifically in the processof increasing consumer access to information on rehabilitation programprocesses and outcomes.An absolute priority is anounced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Develop specific procedures and methods to enhance access to,and effective use of, disability-related information systems by rehabilitationagencies, consumers, and related organizations;andbullet; Identify program needs, including staffing, system design, andorganizational development components, and develop training programs topromote improved rehabilitation information management;andbullet; Evaluate existing computer programs, and develop new programswhere needed, to improve rehabilitation use of information systems in suchareas as functional assessment, development of service plans, case management,and evaluation of rehabilitation processes and outcomes;andbullet; Provide technical assistance to professional and consumer groupson issues related to rehabilitation information systems, with particularattention to availability of resources, avoidance of duplication of datacomponents, methods of data analysis, and cooperation among informationsources; andbullet; Facilitate communication between research and model demonstrationsystems and rehabilitation service delivery agencies on issues in the managementof service programs;andbullet; Conduct conferences, presentations, short-term institutes, andother training activities to facilitate linkages among rehabilitation informationsystems, particularly those organized as a result of research support fromNIDRR; and andbullet; Organize at least two national conferences on the state-of-the-artin information management for rehabilitation research and service deliveryduring the period of the project. Improving Community Integration for Persons with Mental Retardation A basic tenet of the concept of community integration of people with mentalretardation is that they live and work in non-restrictive community environments.The expressed preferences of disabled individuals and their families favormaximum community integration, living in typical residences, working inregular jobs, and using community facilities for daily living activitiesand recreation. Most States have closed institutions, or parts of institutions,where people with mental retardation had resided in the past. These institutionsnow have discharged their clients into a variety of community settings.One of the major challenges to successful deinstitutionalization is thatof developing local community capacity to provide appropriate options inresidences, work, education, and recreation for individuals with mentalretardation. It is important to support rather than supplant families sothat citizens with disabilities are not forced into institutions or otherout-of-home settings. Results of previous research indicate that small-scale,normalized living arrangements are most effective in promoting successfulintegration into the community for most disabled populations. Social relationships and support systems are an integral part of successfulintegration into community living. People with disabilities need opportunitiesand social skills to interact with a range of nondisabled persons in thecommunity, including family members, neighbors, merchants and providersof community services, and other participants in job, school, or recreationalsettings. The involvement of parents and consumers in all aspects of thedesign, operation, and monitoring of community services to persons withmental retardation has increased the sensitivity of service providers.A program of coordinated, interdisciplinary research and training is neededto develop and disseminate rehabilitation approaches that improve the socialand community living skills of persons with mental retardation; enhancethe available residential options; and increase the capacities of consumers,parents, and professionals to operate a program of community integrationthat is guided by the needs and preferences of individuals with mentalretardation and their families. A critical element of any Center to besupported in response to this priority will be the involvement of disabledpersons and their families in the design, implementation, and evaluationof Center activities. A Center in this area must serve as a national resource for informationon the community integration of persons with mental retardation and maintaina database on the results of research in this area. The Center must alsomake a particular effort to establish linkages with other RRTCs on communityintegration, mental retardation, and independent living; national disabilityorganizations; parent training projects; University Affiliated Facilities;and Developmental Disability Councils. An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to: andbullet; Identify existing housing options and document best practicesto enable persons with mental retardation to reside with their families,in foster-care homes, or in other small-scale residences, and develop guidelinesfor effectively matching the living arrangements to the needs of the individual;andbullet; Identify options for long-term financing of housing accommodations,recreational opportunities, health services, respite care, and other supportneeded by mentally retarded persons and their families, and develop anddisseminate information on these options; andbullet; Develop and evaluate new options for living arrangements, recreationalactivities, health services, and other community programs and servicesthat will improve the integration of persons with mental retardation intotheir communities; andbullet; Develop and evaluate strategies that will train families and serviceproviders to help persons with mental retardation establish and maintainsupportive social relationships in the community;andbullet; Develop and evaluate strategies to train persons with mental retardationto determine their own vocational, recreational, housing, and independentliving choices, and to train service providers to respond in positive waysto the choices made by persons with mental retardation; and andbullet; Conduct at least one conference on the state-of-the-art in improvingthe community integration of persons with mental retardation in order todisseminate the research findings and to provide guidance for future research.Access to Community Living EnvironmentsProviding appropriate housing for severely disabled people is a major undertakinginvolving a complex array of individuals with various types and degreesof disability and housing needs on the one hand, and a variety of housingtypes and options, design challenges, financial issues, technology requirements,and statutory and administrative authorities on the other. It is an area in which millions of dollars are spent annually, researchis minimal, and useful information is difficult to find. These problemsextend beyond housing alone to encompass recreational, educational, vocational,commercial, and transportation barriers that are encountered in the courseof daily living. An immediate objective is to make better use of the information that isavailable, including research data, models of accessible housing, and standardsand guidelines that have been developed for housing construction. Overthe longer term, it is important to develop better housing designs, basedon field and laboratory research, and tested by disabled persons in regularuse. One prerequisite to improving housing design in a permanent and comprehensiveway is to make those who design, build, adapt, maintain, manage, and financehousing more aware of the potential for creating more accessible adaptableenvironments. A convergence of knowledge from the fields of architecture, engineering,construction, rehabilitation, independent living, and related areas isrequired to create appropriate housing, recreational facilities, and otherenvironments in which disabled persons can live independently. The knowledgebase must include information about modifications to existing structuresand equipment, as well as design concepts that can be used to build facilitiesto benefit all citizens. The knowledge base must be developed from theresults of research, needs assessments, and analysis of the physical capabilitiesof individuals with disabilities. A Center to be funded in response to this priority must maintain liaisonwith the Accessibility Subcommittee of the Interagency Committee on HandicappedResearch and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board,as well as with NIDRR-supported research projects and Centers in such areasas housing, independent living, and community integration. A critical elementof any Center to be funded under this priority will be the involvementof individuals with disabilities and their families in the planning, conduct,and review of the research and related activities. The Center must forma National Advisory Committee composed of individuals with disabilitiesand representatives of disability-focused organizations, state rehabilitationagencies, architects, designers, engineers, planners, builders, manufacturers,and housing providers to provide input on needs and to facilitate the evaluationand dissemination of Center products. An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to: andbullet; Analyze legal, regulatory, commercial, and financial disincentivesto the development of suitable living environments of severely disabledpersons and develop strategies to address those problems;andbullet; Develop recommendations for housing adaptations appropriate forpersons with hearing and vision impairments;andbullet; Develop models of accessible environments and provide for theirevaluation by disabled individuals; andbullet; Develop, acquire, and maintain both graphic and text databasesand serve as a national resource for information on standards, design criteria,plans, building products, costs, funding sources, and performance evaluationsof accessible housing, providing information and referral; andbullet; Conduct training programs to increase awareness of the conceptsof accessibility and availability of adaptive environmental design forthe full range of audiences concerned with accessible housing; andbullet; Promote the concepts of accessible housing and universal adaptabledesign, including ideas from abroad, among schools of architecture andurban planning; and andbullet; Conduct at least one state-of-the-art study on a significant aspectof accessibility. Improving the Community Integration of Elderly Persons With Mental Retardationand Other Developmental DisabilitiesDemographers and gerontologists estimate that the population of personsover sixty-five years of age in the United States will grow from 27 millionin 1983 to 67 million in 2040. In addition, they estimate that by the year2040, twelve percent of the population will be over seventy-five yearsof age. The population of elderly persons with mental retardation and otherdevelopmental disabilities is of particular concern to NIDRR. There maybe more than 150,000 persons over sixty years of age who have mental retardationand other developmental disabilities, and predictions are that this numberwill approach 600,000 within forty years. A review of the relevant current literature reveals that services to thisspecific aging population, and consequently the research and training tosupport such services, are very sparse. One reason for this is that neitherthe public nor private sectors has addressed adequately the needs of theelderly population in general or the problems of this subpopulation inparticular. Although some programs have been adopted in an effort to assistelderly citizens to improve their lives, it is difficult for individualswith mental retardation and other developmental disabilities to use thegeneric service systems.Only in the last twenty years has living outside of institutions, in normalcommunity settings, been a viable option for older persons with mentalretardation. Thus, any existing data about the effects of aging with mentalretardation and other developmental disabilities are based on individualsresiding in institutions. These data are inadequate to assess the needsof this aging subpopulation living in regular community settings. A thirdreason for the dearth of programs is that funds for services and researchin the area of mental retardation and other developmental disabilitieshave been directed toward children and young people. Recent legislationpertaining to persons with these disabilities did not anticipate that improvedhealth care, the growth of early intervention programs, improved livingarrangements, and improved community-based resources would result in significantlyextended lifespans for this population. There has been no organized planningto meet the current and future needs of this aging population.Older people with and without developmental disabilities share many needsthat are not now being met in their communities, and which frequently leadunnecessarily to institutionalization. Both groups require improved homecare and supportive living arrangements, and often need mental health services,nutritional guidance, recreational and transportation services, legal assistance,and opportunities to socialize, as well.A program of coordinated, interdisciplinary research and training is neededto develop and disseminate rehabilitation approaches to maintaining physical,psychological, family, and vocational functioning for aging persons whohave mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. A criticalelement of any Center to be funded under this priority will be the involvementof individuals with developmental disabilities and their families in theplanning, conduct, and review of the research and related activities.A Center in this area must serve as a national resource for informationon aging persons who have mental retardation and other developmental disabilities,and maintain information on the results of research in this area. The Centeralso must make particular effort to establish linkages with other Researchand Training Centers focusing on community integration, mental retardation,and independent living; Centers on Aging and University Affiliated Facilities;and organizations representing disabled individuals and their families.This Center must also disseminate its research findings to a broad targetaudience of service providers, including health care professionals, socialworkers and gerontologists, attorneys and insurance carriers, rehabilitationprofessionals, and others.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Analyze existing services for noninstitutionalized mentally retardedand other developmentally disabled aging persons, identify those genericservices that may be appropriate for this population and barriers to theuse of those services, and develop strategies for more effective collaborationbetween Developmental Disabilities service agencies and those responsiblefor services to elderly persons;andbullet; Develop and evaluate programs that will enable families and othercaregivers to detect declines in behavioral and functional levels of agingpersons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities, withparticular attention to persons with Down Syndrome, and to intercede tomaintain maximum functional ability;andbullet; Investigate the reactions of this population to transitional periods,such as deaths of family and friends, retirement, change in residence,and changes in physical and mental functioning, and develop effective counselingtechniques matched to individual needs;andbullet; Develop and evaluate innovative models using long-term fundingstreams for small-scale community living arrangements that will allow olderpeople with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities toremain in nonrestrictive settings after their families and other primarycaregivers may be unable to care for them;andbullet; Develop and evaluate innovative strategies to provide familiesand other full-time caregivers with needed respite and support, in orderto prevent institutionalization;andbullet; Develop and evaluate materials to increase the awareness of individualsproviding services to the general aging population about the needs of individualswith developmental disabilities;andbullet; Conduct at least one study of the state-of-the-art in improvingthe functioning of aging persons who have developmental disabilities, tofocus attention on the research findings and to provide guidance for futureresearch.Improving the Functioning of Families Whose Members Have DisabilitiesMany of the recently acquired characteristics of American families_singleparents, two working parents, geographic mobility, separation from theextended family, economic pressures, lack of leisure time, and increasedstress_have particularly severe consequences for families with disabledmembers. Families with disabled members have the additional pressures ofidentifying, accessing, arranging, managing, and financing a wide rangeof medical, educational, rehabilitative, employment, recreation, transportation,and housing services. Families with disabled children, parents, or grandparentsmust also attend to the social and emotional needs of all members of thefamily.Despite the magnitude of these challenges, there are many special needsfamilies who have learned to master these complex tasks and at the sametime to assist other disabled persons, raise other children, and engagein a variety of community and leisure time activities. There remain manyother special needs families who have not been successful in attainingtheir goals of creating a balanced and rewarding family life.The current literature, including a report from an NIDRR-sponsored conferenceon special needs families, indicates that one cause of inadequate familycoping may be that family members, and the professionals on whom they rely,expect disability to have a negative impact on family functioning. Thisexpectation may become a self-fulfilling prophecy which diminishes theself-esteem of the disabled person and adds unnecessary stress to the familyunit. Professionals working with special needs families often approachthem from a perspective of pathology, which again may undermine the abilityof these families to cope constructively. The end product may be a familywith low expectations, lacking a support system, unable to cope, and regardinginstitutionalization of the disabled member as the only viable option.The attitudes of society in general also affect the functioning of a familyunit and the member who is disabled. Too often, society in general tendsto have negative conceptions and low expectations concerning persons withdisabilities. People often regard disabled persons as incapable of makingdecisions or as not sharing wishes, values, and goals typical of the broadersociety. They are often unaware of the positive contributions that disabledindividuals make to their families and to society as a whole. These negativebiases make it very difficult for families to find integrated schools,housing, worksites, and recreation programs, or to assist all members ofthe family to achieve maximum levels of functioning.A program of coordinated, interdisciplinary research and training is neededto develop and disseminate rehabilitation strategies and information toassist families with disabled members to improve their coping skills, attitudes,and general knowledge about services. The Center must include researchand training to address the needs of families whose disabled members areof various ages and have various family roles, including children disabledat birth or who incur disability later, and parents who incur disabilityas well as disabled persons who become parents. A critical element of anyCenter funded under this priority will be the involvement of individualswith disabilities and their close relatives in the planning, conduct, andreview of the Center's program. These programs must be open to the involvementof diverse groups, such as single parents, members of ethnic and racialminorities, and traditionally underserved families such as those whosemembers have mental health impairments or are dependent on respirators.A Center in this area must serve as a national resource for informationon families whose members have disabilities and maintain a database onthe results of research in this area. The Center must also make particulareffort to establish linkages with other NIDRR-supported RRTCs, organizationsrepresenting disabled members and their families, independent living centers,and other agencies serving disabled people. The Center must conduct trainingand other activities to disseminate the results of its research to a widerange of target audiences, including disabled individuals and their families,health care professionals, educators, rehabilitation service providers,communications media, and those who provide social and community servicesto the general population.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Study successful family coping and develop and evaluate individualizedinterventions that could assist families to improve their functioning;andbullet; Conduct research and training to enable families and their disabledmembers to become involved in the development, provision, and evaluationof integrated, age-appropriate, community-based services;andbullet; Assess the impact of the attitudes of disabled individuals, themembers of their families, and the general public on the functioning ofthe family unit;andbullet; Evaluate the impact of the availability/unavailability of supportservices on family functioning, and the disincentives to raising childrenand maintaining adults at home;andbullet; Develop and disseminate criteria to match disabled individualsand foster-care families, in order to promote maintenance in lease restrictiveenvironments; andandbullet; Conduct at least two studies of the state-of-the-art in improvingfunctioning in special needs families in order to focus attention on theCenter's findings and to provide guidance for future research.Rehabilitation of Economically Disadvantaged Individuals with DisabilitiesWhile the demographic data are inadequate to make precise comparisons ofthe amount of disability in economically disadvantaged populations, includingminorities, one general finding is that the incidence and prevalence ofdisability is greater in those populations. Furthermore, there is evidencethat economically disadvantaged individuals are less likely than otherdisabled individuals to use vocational rehabilitation services. Indicationsare that the distribution of rehabilitation facilities and trained personneldoes not meet the needs of economically disadvantaged individuals withdisabilities, and there are few models of effective rehabilitation servicedelivery for these special populations.Different cultures have different attitudes toward disability and differentexpectations for rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. There aredifferences in the structure and functioning of disadvantaged Asian, Black,Hispanic, and white families. Support systems that often assist middle-classdisabled individuals during rehabilitation may be quite different in disadvantagedcommunities. The willingness of the poor disabled individual to seek andaccept rehabilitation differs as a function of the mores of his/her culture.Despite some efforts, the rehabilitation community has conducted insufficientresearch to illuminate and address effectively the rehabilitation needsof disabled economically disadvantaged individuals. There are many psychological,social, and financial barriers to the optimal rehabilitation of disadvantagedindividuals. There are insufficient trained personnel working with thesepopulations; and there is a lack of research on effective rehabilitationtechniques and technology applicable to the special problems of disadvantageddisabled individuals.NIDRR intends to initiate a program of coordinated, interdisciplinary researchand training to develop and disseminate behavioral, medical, and technologicalrehabilitation approaches to maximizing functional capacity of disadvantagedindividuals with disabilities. This Center will serve as a national informationresource on issues relating to rehabilitation of economically disadvantagedand create an accessible data base for clinicians, researchers and disabledindividuals. The Center will provide, prior to the end of its period ofperformance, documentation of one or more rehabilitation techniques suitablefor consideration for an NIDRR-sponsored consensus conference.A critical element of any Center to be funded under this priority willbe the involvement of economically disadvantaged individuals, with disabilitiesand their families in the planning, conduct, and review of the researchand related activities. Universities and affiliated organizations withparticular familiarity with problems of disabled disadvantaged and minorityindividuals, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, areencouraged to submit applications under this priority.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Conduct research on the incidence and prevalence of disabilitiesamong economically disadvantaged populations, including minorities, toprovide an information base for developing services for those populations;andbullet; Identify the factors contributing to unemployment among disabledeconomically disadvantaged individuals and develop model programs to increasethe rate of employment;andbullet; Assess the availability of various technological aids and devicescurrently commercially available for the purpose of improving the accessof economically disadvantaged to appropriate technology;andbullet; Conduct research on attitudinal barriers to the rehabilitationof disadvantaged individuals in order to improve rehabilitation servicesavailable for these populations;andbullet; Identify and develop formal and informal support systems thatassist economically disadvantaged disabled individuals to obtain rehabilitationservices and disseminate information on ways to develop optimal systems;andandbullet; Conduct a conference on the state-of-the-art in rehabilitationtechniques that are effective in addressing the special problems of economicallydisadvantaged individuals with disabilities.Rehabilitation of Older Persons With DisabilitiesOlder persons who experienced onset of disability early in life, as wellas persons who incurred their disability after they became elderly, havevery specific rehabilitation problems that need to be addressed throughresearch. At least eighty percent of individuals over sixty-five yearsof age have one or more identifiable chronic diseases. The most commonof these include arthritis, reported in more than forty percent of olderpeople; impaired vision or hearing (twenty to thirty percent); diabetes(ten to fifteen percent); chronic heart conditions (fifteen to twenty percent);or a diminution of mental function (five percent or more). These conditionsoften lead to functional losses that interfere with the ordinary activitiesof daily living. About one-fifth of persons over seventy years of age reportthat they need the help of another person for at least some part of everyday; this figure rises to forty percent for persons over the age of eighty.The number of older Americans with pre-geriatric onset of disability isincreasing, and their number is likely to continue to increase as the lifeexpectancies of disabled persons rise.There are many psychological, social and financial barriers to the optimalrehabilitation of older disabled individuals. The wide range of individualdifferences within categories of disabling conditions makes the developmentof individualized treatment a difficult challenge for professionals, disabledindividuals, and society. Presently, financial assistance programs facilitateinstitutionalization of elderly persons with disabilities, there is a lackof well-trained personnel to work in the rehabilitation of older disabledpersons, and there is a paucity of research on effective rehabilitationtechniques and technology applicable to elderly disabled individuals. Olderdisabled individuals and their families, as well as those who provide servicesto them, are expressing a growing preference for the development of optionsfor older disabled persons to participate in the full range of communityactivities as an alternative to segregated services or institutions. Atpresent, there are insufficient models for rehabilitation services to promotemaximum independence and community-based services for older persons withdisabilities.A special emphasis of this project will be the physical and psychosocialfunctioning of persons with pre-geriatric onset of physical disability,such as persons with spinal cord injury, post-polio syndrome, and cerebralpalsy. It is of critical importance to determine their unique rehabilitationneeds in order to formulate optimum strategies for supporting individualswith these disabilities in the community. A comparative analysis shouldbe performed on support systems needed by aging persons with both pre-and post-geriatric onset of disability. A program of coordinated, interdisciplinary research and training is neededto develop and disseminate behavioral, medical, and technological rehabilitationapproaches to maximizing the functional capacity of elderly individualswith disabilities. The Center must have a national scope, and must involveall investigators in the development of training programs that will beprovided at various sites throughout the country. A critical element ofany Center to be funded under this priority will be the involvement ofolder individuals with disabilities and their families in the planning,conduct, and review of the research and related activities. The Centerwill provide, prior to the end of its period of performance, documentationof one or more rehabilitation techniques suitable for consideration foran NIDRR sponsored consensus conference.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to: andbullet; Investigate alternative methods of financing home support andcommunity services for disabled elderly individuals in rehabilitation programsto prevent premature placement of those individuals in domiciliary care;andbullet; Assess the effectiveness of existing rehabilitation techniquesand technology in reducing such secondary complications as pressure ulcers,incontinence, depression, and memory loss among older persons; andbullet; Conduct research comparing older disabled individuals with a pre-geriatriconset of disability and individuals who become disabled late in life inorder to develop effective rehabilitation programs for both groups; andbullet; Identify, develop, and test models that integrate long-term carefacilities for older disabled individuals into community environments toimprove existing facilities and develop options for new, integrated communitycare facilities;andbullet; Assess the availability and effectiveness of various commerciallyavailable technological aids and devices in improving the rehabilitationof older disabled individuals;andbullet; Study the special rehabilitation and socio-economic problems ofindividuals with early onset of physical disabilities, such as spinal cordinjury, post-polio syndrome and cerebral palsy;andbullet; Determine the impact, if any, of Independent Living services inproviding older severely disabled individuals with the least restrictiveenvironment and the maximum level of independence within their community;andbullet; Develop public education materials outlining strategies for reducingsecondary complications of disability; andbullet; Conduct research on attitudinal barriers to the rehabilitationof older disabled individuals and disseminate information to reduce thosebarriers;andbullet; Identify and develop formal and informal support systems to assistolder disabled individuals to obtain and use rehabilitation services anddisseminate information to develop effective models; and andbullet; Conduct one study of the state-of-the-art in rehabilitation andcommunity integration techniques that are effective for older individualswho were disabled early in life and one such study on techniques appropriateto the needs of older persons who become disabled. Improving Rehabilitation of Native Americans Native Americans are often isolated from rehabilitation services by linguistic,attitudinal, cultural, and geographic barriers which may not be evidenteither to the person who is disabled or to the service provider. The NativeAmerican population with disabilities may require specialized rehabilitationservices and a unique service delivery system to meet certain needs thatoften differ from those of other populations. Information presently available on the incidence and prevalence of disabilityamong Native Americans is based upon secondary analysis of data on thegeneral population. The representation of Native Americans in any generalsample is inadequate to reflect accurately the presence and distributionof specific types of disabling conditions among that subgroup. There isnot sufficient data on the employment histories or patterns of serviceuse in this population to plan appropriate rehabilitation services forNative Americans. However, it is known that there is a high rate of disablingconditions among American Indians and that the distribution is differentfrom that in the general population, and that disabled Native Americansare less likely than other disabled people to receive effective rehabilitationservices. A Center to address these problems must involve Native Americans with disabilitiesin various capacities in all facets of the development and operation ofthe Center, and applicants must include evidence of involvement of disabledNative Americans in policymaking and administration of the RRTC. The Centeralso must form linkages with the various service delivery systems servingNative Americans, both on and off reservations. These systems should includeFederal, State, regional, tribal, local, and private agencies in orderto demonstrate methods for disseminating findings and for utilizing existingresources to improve service delivery. Such a Center must provide training to rehabilitation service providers,researchers, and managers to increase their awareness of the unique rehabilitationneeds of Native Americans and of innovative approaches to meet these needs.This training should involve collaborative sponsorship with other RehabilitationResearch and Training Centers, as well as with public, private, and tribalrehabilitation, health, and human services agencies.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to: andbullet; Survey Native American populations to determine the incidence,prevalence, and demographic distribution of disability among American Indiansand/or Native Americans, estimate levels of employment and unemploymentfor Indians with disabilities, and identify patterns of service use; andbullet; Analyze labor market conditions on and around Indian reservationsand develop culturally sensitive model employability development programsthat take into account these labor market conditions; andbullet; Develop and evaluate culturally sensitive methods for assessingrehabilitation needs of Native Americans, and develop and test appropriatemodels to meet some of those needs;andbullet; Develop methods to evaluate attitudinal barriers to service deliveryas a basis for designating improved models of rehabilitation service delivery;andbullet; Identify the rehabilitation training needs and provide trainingto rehabilitation service providers, researchers, managers, policymakers,and Native Americans with disabilities; andbullet; Design appropriate models for career development, job enhancement,and job retention in order to improve employment opportunities and rehabilitationoutcomes;andbullet; Develop and dissiminate culturally relevant informational materialsto increase use of rehabilitation services by Native Americans;andbullet; Develop strategies to ensure optimal use of available rehabilitativetechnology by Native Americans; andandbullet; Conduct at least one study of the state-of-the-art in some significantaspect for improving rehabilitation services to Native Americans with disabilities.Mental Health Rehabilitation of Individuals With DeafnessAn estimated fourteen million Americans, or 66 in every 1000, have signficanthearing impairment. At least two million_9 in 1000_are profoundly deaf.About half a million persons became deaf before they reached age nineteen,that is, before they had established vocations. About 200,000 persons,one of every thousand Americans, became deaf before the age of three, thatis, before they developed effective language. This last group, the prelinguallydeaf, though a small minority, requires separate attention from those deafenedafter the acquisition of language. This segment of the population presentsa major challenge to public and private mental health rehabilitation efforts.Few skilled professionals and service programs are available to providetimely, expert mental health rehabilitation interventions. For many, satisfactoryadjustment is further complicated by the presence of additional disabilities,lower levels of educational attainment, underemployment, and reduced earnings.Research in this area is needed to identify the characteristics of effectivecounseling strategies and interventions matched to the characteristicsof deaf individuals; to refine the quantative and qualitative methods forassessing psychological, social, and emotional adjustment and performance;and to develop models for effective delivery of coordinated programs ofmental health rehabilitation services.A critical element of any Center to be supported under this priority willbe the involvement of individuals who are deaf in the planning, conduct,and review of all Center activities. All assessment instruments, trainingmaterials and courses, databases, and technical assistance developed bythe Center must be provided in formats that are fully accessible to individualswith various types of hearing impairments. This Center will develop a nationaldata base in this field of activity and serve as a central repository ofinformation on mental health illness of individuals with deafness.An absolute priority is announced for an RRTC to:andbullet; Investigate the causes of abnormal social, emotional, linguistic,and cognitive development of people with deafness or severe hearing impairment;andbullet; Develop assessment techniques, rehabilitation interventions, andtraining approaches, including interpreter training, to benefit this population;andbullet; Develop models for clinical interventions and service deliveryto improve the availability and effectiveness of mental health rehabilitationservices for individuals with deafness;andbullet; Develop and evaluate models of technical assistance to state rehabilitationagencies to improve the development and implementation of mental healthrehabilitation services for deaf individuals;andbullet; Provide advanced training in research for professional practitionersin mental health rehabilitation of persons who are deaf and hearing impaired,with an emphasis on recruiting individuals with deafness for that training;andbullet; Explore and develop suitable visual media, appropriately captioned,to enhance the dissemination of new knowledge in this area to appropriateaudiences;andbullet; Serve as a resource for information on mental health and deafnessand maintain a database on the results of research in this area; andandbullet; Conduct at least one study of the state-of-the art in a significantaspect of mental health rehabilitation of individuals with deafness.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No. 84.133B, National Instituteon Disability and Rehabilitation Research)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Program Authority: </T4>29 U.S.C. 762.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
