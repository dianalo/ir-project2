(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leonardo da Vinci long ago drew aflying machine powered by a man cranking levers that could take offvertically and hover above the Earth.   Five centuries and thousands of inventors later, da Vinci'sdream of a human-powered helicopter was realized this month bystudents at California Polytechnic State University, San LuisObispo.   The Dec. 10 flight of the Da Vinci III, powered by an Olympicbicyclist, lasted just a few seconds and got the craft only a fewinches off the ground.   Even so, it was the first ever flight by a human-poweredhelicopter and was hailed as a historic aviation achievement.   As a result, the Cal Poly students are spending Christmas breakraising money and designing the Da Vinci IV.   ``Until this point, nobody had ever broken the pull of theEarth. This is a great leap forward,'' said Mark Paris, spokesmanfor the American Helicopter Society in Alexandria, Va., anorganization of engineers.   The 97-pound Da Vinci III, completely designed and built byundergraduate engineering students, officially flew for 6.8seconds, rising eight inches off a gym floor on this campus halfwaybetween Los Angeles and San Francisco.   The Dec. 10 flight, made before an official from the NationalAeronautic Association and a cheering crowd, and two Novemberpractice flights left the inventors feeling like Orville and WilburWright must have felt at Kitty Hawk.   ``I was very surprised,'' said Neal Saiki, a 23-year-old seniorand the guiding force of the project since 1987. ``The time itfirst took off, I wasn't really expecting it, to tell you thetruth. Then it was just all kinds of emotions going through me.''   The project has been in the works off and on since 1980, withmuch of the work done in a cluttered workshop. The whole projecthas cost about $100,000, money donated from aerospace companies andprivate contributors.   It has taken several versions of the helicopter, hundreds ofhours behind a computer, scores of crashes and other mishaps, andlots of old-fashioned head scratching before the students came upwith a workable design.   In the end, they found they didn't so much have to refinehelicopter technology as virtually reinvent the machine. What theyhave created is a craft that looks more like a spinning wing than ahelicopter.   The Da Vinci III has a 100-foot rotor made of carbon graphitefiber (the stuff in expensive golf clubs), heavy-duty foam and acovering similar to the plastic that dry cleaners put aroundclothes.   The pilot sits in a contraption made of lightweight metal andbalsa wood that hangs from the rotor on a swivel. Bicycle pedals,rather than the levers in da Vinci's design, operate the Cal Polyhelicopter.   Even at top speed, the rotor moves slowly, taking about sixseconds for one rotation.   One key change from earlier helicopters was having the rotorsupport a dangling driver, instead of the driver's compartmentpropping up the rotor. The change shaved 35 pounds off previousdesigns.   ``Even though this seems like an obvious solution, it took yearsto come up with it,'' said Saiki.   The students hope to save more weight in the next design. Saikisaid, ``We'd like to have someone other that Greg McNeil be able todrive this thing.''   McNeil is a Cal Poly student and member of the U.S. Olympiccycling team who had to pedal as if it were the final lap for thegold medal before the helicopter got off the ground.   Even a new and improved human helicopter, the students and theirfaculty adviser concede, will have few if any practicalapplications. But that doesn't seem to bother them as they go backto the drawing board.   ``Saying this isn't practical is like telling the WrightBrothers, `Sure, you flew, but you didn't make it to Europe,'''said the adviser, engineering professor Bill Patterson. ``Justproving the skeptics wrong was enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
