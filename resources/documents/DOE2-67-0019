Tables VII-1, VII-2, and VII-3, which provide resourcedata for the United States and the world as a whole, are abstracted belowwith minor modifications to assure comparability. The United States isendowed with roughly one-fifth of the world's proved reserves of conventionalfossil fuels and nearly 9% of the uranium in the free world. It is particularlyfortunate in having vast amounts of coal, oil shale, and peat. Althoughthese underutilized resources present difficult economic and environmentalchallenges with regards to extraction and ease of use, a serious effortshould be made to use them to a much greater extent to reduce our dependenceon imported oil and insure abundant sources of energy for the future.</TEXT></DOC>
