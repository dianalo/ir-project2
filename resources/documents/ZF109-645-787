(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LOW-COST OPTIONS FOR EASY WORD PROCESSING With full-featured word processing,you can't lose by heading straight to the top and using WordPerfect,Microsoft Word, or any other professional-level package.andP;  But beyond the dinof power users who clamor for more functionality, there exists a less vocalcrowd that will gladly settle for less word processing power at a morereasonable price.andP;  If you're part of this group, there are plenty of packagesto choose from.andM;These low- to midrange word processors maintain their market niches byaddressing users who are convinced they'd never use high-end features, and byopting for less you may actually end up with more.andP;  How?andP;  If your wordprocessing requirements are modest, you can use one of the many low-endintegrated packages available today: Microsoft Works, Lotus Development'sLotus Works (formerly AlphaWorks), or Software Publishing Corp.'s PFS:FirstChoice.andP;  (Microsoft Works and AlphaWorks were Editor's Choices when we lastlooked at low-end integrated packages in our December 26, 1989, article&quot;Integrated Software Gets It Together.&quot;)  Packages like these have all theword-processing functionality that many users will ever need, and includedatabases, spreadsheets, graphing, communications, and desktop utilities aswell.andM;These programs, along with two midrange word processors, Symantec's Qandamp;A Writeand QuickSoft's popular PC-Write, generally skimp in places you won't mind.andO;They can be installed on a 3.5-inch floppy disk for laptop use (whereintegrated packages are especially popular), and can import/export ASCII textfrom and to high-end programs if you opt to upgrade later.andP;  You shouldscrutinize each package to see what is and what isn't included, because withcareful research you can't lose.andM;LOTUS WORKSandM;Alpha Software's AlphaWorks, sold to Lotus Development Corp. and renamedLotus Works, packs a lot into a $195 integrated package.andP;  Its word processingmodule is no exception.andP;  You can work on nine files at once and switchbetween two displayed windows with a hotkey.andM;Once you enter a &quot;Words service,&quot; you can begin typing immediately orretrieve a file using a pull-down menu.andP;  Text formatting options areversatile for an integrated word processor.andP;  You can select from eight rulersettings that include line spacing (whole lines only), tabs, and left andright margins that can be placed anywhere in your document as often as youneed.andP;  Text can also be indented, although special formatting such as hangingindents and spacing other than single, double, and triple are not available.andM;While it won't accept downloadable fonts, Lotus Works can make use ofwhatever resident fonts or enhancements your dot matrix or laser printeroffers.andP;  Using the Epson printer driver, the program comes up with normal,italic, bold, bold italic, and super- and subscripts.andP;  You can edit thedriver from the Words service or add escape codes through the AWCONFIG.EXEprogram.andM;You can block by word, sentence, line, or paragraph, or point-to-point, butnot backward from your starting point.andP;  You won't see italicized texton-screen; screen fonts are a high-end feature you won't see in any of theseprograms.andP;  Lotus Works displays all enhancements as different colors you setin AWCONFIG.EXE.andM;There's plenty more in Lotus Works, including keyboard macros, intuitiveCtrl-key shortcuts, a 100,000-word spell-checker with flexible options,mail-merge, context-sensitive help, and data import from the database andspreadsheet modules.andP;  For the price, it's a winner.andM;MICROSOFT WORKSandM;Microsoft Corp. is confident about Microsoft Works, its Windows-orientedintegrated package, which is a steal at $149.andP;  Frequent bundling arrangementswith PS/2s and other vendors' PCs, plus a wealth of features that includeon-line tutorials, make the product a real contender in the home andsmall-business PC market.andM;Mouse- or keyboard-driven pull-down menus with hotkeys and dialog boxes,familiar to any Microsoft Windows user, are augmented by an assortment ofCtrl-key combinations.andP;  For the most part, they're easy to remember, and theyhelp in text formatting and cursor positioning.andP;  All fonts and typeenhancements available from your printer can be selected through the Formatmenu.andP;  Hitting Ctrl-Space shuts off the enhancement.andM;Search-and-replace functions in Works help you find both text strings andformatting characters like tabs and hard carriage returns, but not fonts orenhancements.andP;  This capability places the program between PFS:First Choiceand Qandamp;A Write.andP;  You can set line spacing in inches or centimeters, arefreshing switch from the typical single or double spacing in most low-endword processors.andP;  Special characters such as nonbreaking hyphens and spaces,date, time, and filename can be inserted into documents as well.andP;  Smoothmail-merge from the database module lets you print form letters and mailinglabels.andP;  Other handy features include the insertion of spreadsheets andgraphs, an undo function, macros, a calculator, special formatting, and theability to display eight files on the screen at once.andM;File conversion, largely through ASCII or IBM DCA format, includesimport/export from and to Microsoft Word.andP;  Packages such as PFS:First Choiceoffer more options here, but Microsoft Works remains an excellent integratedchoice with a versatile word processor as one component.andM;PC-WRITEandM;Among the programs discussed here, Quicksoft's PC-Write holds the distinctionof being the most powerful as well as the least expensive at $129.andP;  Butthere's a catch: This word processing package presents a formidable challengefor those users who wish to tap all it has to offer.andM;PC-Write requires plenty of homework before you can do more than save,retrieve, or print a file.andP;  (An update, due out next summer, will featurepull-down menus, mouse support, and a thesaurus.)andP;  The package uses virtuallyevery imaginable combination of Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and function keys plusseveral Ctrl-letter commands.andP;  The top line of your working screen isreversed for a program and file status line; the next two display Lotus-stylemenu/submenu choices and either a ruler line or a terse explanation of themenu choice you've highlighted.andM;General editing is a bit awkward because of the program's break from standardkeys many of us have come to expect in a word processor.andP;  F1 summons help,but Scroll Lock toggles from Overstrike to Insert modes, and you hit both F1and F3 to save a file.andP;  However, you can redefine the program's keys to yourheart's content.andM;If your printer supports them, drivers for more than 700 models are included,and you can use up to 22 fonts per document.andP;  PC-Write also features macros,undelete, search-and-replace, mail-merge, spell-checking, automatic saves,versatile column creation and editing, and box drawing.andP;  Some of theprogram's more-innovative features include character transposing for thefumble-fingered, a Repeat Last Keystroke command, and a Shorthand featurethat lets you type in an abbreviation for commonly used words.andP;  More than 45customizable help screens on a variety of topics will help you through allthese options.andM;There's a wealth of quiet power in PC-Write, enough even for many powerusers, but like many higher-end packages, it requires a learning investmenton your part.andM;PFS:FIRST CHOICEandM;You get a taste of many features in Software Publishing Corp.'s $159PFS:First Choice, and if your needs are modest, you may never go away hungry.andO;First Choice's word processing module offers less functionality overall thanthe other two integrated packages reviewed here and certainly less than Qandamp;AWrite and PC-Write.andP;  Don't write off this easy-to-use program, though; themarket leader of integrated programs has much to offer the word processingbeginner or light user.andM;First Choice's working screen resembles a piece of paper with a thin bordersurrounding your text and space skipped to where printing begins abouthalfway down the screen.andP;  Your working area is also filled with spaces evenbefore you enter text (an approach shared by Qandamp;A Write and PC-Write), whichcan be annoying if youhre accustomed to quick cursor travel around thescreen.andM;You can work on only one file at a time in First Choice, but the clipboardfunction lets you cut and paste to other modules.andP;  formatting, accomplishedthrough either hotkeys or the pulldown menus (keyboard- or mouse-controlled)seems sparse at first but is adequate.andM;All enhanced text is highlighted in the same color, which makes for sometricky editing.andP;  You can double up on formatting the same block of text byseparately adding both bold and italics for bold italics.andP;  You can also setenhancements and fonts by sending control codes to your dot matrix or laserprinter.andM;PFS:First Choice offers a no-frills search-and-replace function, and thespell-checker is fine for most tasks.andP;  You can also use personal dictionariesof up to 2,000 words.andP;  File conversion to and from Microsoft Word (Version 3only), WordPerfect (4.1 and 4.2), and other text-only word processors comesin hand.andP;  Text and command macros, mail-merge (using the database), and quickblock operations add to the options of this program's limited but capableword processing module.andP;  PostScript support is a major enhancement in Version3.1, priced at $169 and scheduled to have shipped this fall.andM;Qandamp;A WRITEandM;The standalone, enhanced version of Qandamp;A's word processing module, Qandamp;A Write1.01 from Symantec Corp., provides plenty of functionality for $199.andP;  Smoothintegration with Lotus 1-2-3, font and laser printer (including PostScript)support, and impressive mail-merge capabilities are only part of the picture.andM;Qandamp;A Write does a good job of addressing the new user while keepingmore-experienced users happy and productive.andP;  The only exception is thepage-like, space-filled screen, similar to that of PFS:First Choice, whichstarts a file and is designed to keep new users comfortable.andP;  First, you'reoffered the default directory to call up a file, but you can edit right overit to get to the path and/or file you want.andM;It is in its function-key selections that Qandamp;A Write is unlike the majority oflow-end word processors.andP;  The program allows up to nine font assignments,plus any combination of enhancements your printer will allow.andP;  It permitssome of the most sophisticated search-and-replace parameters you'll see.andO;(&quot;T.. e..&quot; refers to two consecutive words, the first beginning with &quot;T,&quot; thesecond with &quot;e,&quot; as in &quot;The end.&quot;)  It additionally features integrated cardfiles allowing up to 1,000 entries that can be mail-merged into documents,line drawing, columns (up to eight per document), Intel EMS AboveBoardsupport, import/export of Lotus 1-2-3 and ASCII files (including print-timeinclusion of graphs), and embedded printer-control strings.andM;However, you won't find a thesaurus (a $49.95 option) or full word processingconversion in Qandamp;A Write.andP;  The latter comes in the form of the $29.95 Document Conversion Utility and offers direct import from Microsoft Word,WordPerfect, XyWrite, MultiMate, and several other word processors.andO;Apparently, Symantec is counting on users to find the program a bargain evenwithout these extras.andP;  For the most part, you'll agree.andM;Lotus Works, Version 2.0 Lotus Development Corp., 55 Cambridge Pkwy.,andO;Cambridge, MA 02142; (617) 577-8500.andM;List Price: $195.andM;Requires: 512K RAM, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;Microsoft Works, Version 2.00 Microsoft Corp., 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA98052-6399;
