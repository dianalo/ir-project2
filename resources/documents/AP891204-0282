Kenneth Richardson, a 37-year HughesAircraft Co. veteran, was named president and chief operatingofficer of the company Monday and said he was confident Hughes'diversification away from military work will go well.   ``We're not abandoning the defense sector. We regard that as ourduty to the nation. But we feel that in the future most of thegrowth and opportunity are outside defense,'' said Richardson.   Richardson replaces Donald H. White, who retired Dec. 1.   Like all military contractors, Hughes was looking at cuts inreal defense spending even before the recent avalanche of change inEastern Europe.   The satellites and defense electronics company responded bymoving into such areas as telecommunications and simulation andtraining systems for commercial airlines. It recently won a $325million contract to modernize Canada's air-traffic control system,and is bidding on a $210 million contract to modernize dataprocessing for the Bureau of Land Management.   ``I'm an upbeat, positive sort of fellow and I think thecompany's future is very good,'' said Richardson.   Richardson, 58, joined the company in 1952 as a design engineer.He worked on fighter weapons systems, the Phoenix missile programand the F-A-18 radar program. He most recently served as executivevice president for operations after vice presidencies in the radarsystems and missiles groups.   He becomes president as Hughes, a General Motors Corp. unit,finishes a six-month streamlining that includes layoffs of 8percent, or 6,000, of its 75,000 workers, another response totighter defense budgets.   Richardson said the downsizing had met its objective of reducingthe company to the proper size for the next two or three years. Hesaid it was impossible to tell whether more layoffs would be neededlater given current uncertainties.   If the government decides to cut the number of militarypersonnel while upgrading technology, ``We obviously arewell-poised,'' Richardson said.   ``We're usually, though not always in the forefront in defenseelectronics,'' Richardson said. ``And many of the technologies wedeveloped for defense are easily adaptable to non-governmentsectors.''</TEXT></DOC>
