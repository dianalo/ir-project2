The Turin-based auto maker -- Italy's largest private-sector industrial concern -- said consolidated sales rose 30%, to 38.100 trillion lire ($31.08 billion) from 29.337 trillion lire.    The revenue increase, which was in line with expectations, was in part a result of last year's acquisition of Alfa Romeo S.p.A. The consolidation of Ford U.K., bought by a Fiat unit, was among other factors contributing to the rise.    Final results won't be released until May, but analysts generally expect 1987 net income to exceed the 2.162 trillion lire of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
