Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 millionfrom cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteedstudent loan program, would go to expand existing programs fordisadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.   The proposed budget does not incorporate any of the educationspending ideas set forth during President-elect Bush's campaign.They included a $500 million merit schools program for schoolsserving disadvantaged children and a $50 million infusion for amagnet schools program designed to encourage parental choice.   But Bush, who pledged during the campaign to be ``the educationpresident,'' is expected to rework the budget in the weeks followinghis Jan. 20 inauguration. The education community asserted last weekthat he needs to request an extra $2.5 billion for fiscal 1990 inorder to begin to fulfill his pledge.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said last month that ``I didthe best I could'' to secure the best possible budget for hisdepartment.   The document does not contain specific new initiatives reflectinghis own priorities _ cutting illiteracy and the dropout rate _ butthat could come later. Cavazos has said that after Bush takes over,``We will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''   Among the programs on the chopping block under the Reagan planare the Women's Educational Equity Act research program, whichofficials complain has outlived its purpose, and a two-year dropoutprevention demonstration project due to expire.   Also suggested for extinction are programs the administrationconsiders duplicative, and programs officials say should be financedby the private sector. The latter include impact aid to schooldistricts serving areas with tax-exempt federal installations; StarSchools, which would put satellite technology in schools; and anumber of scholarship and fellowship programs.   The largest dollar increase under the Reagan plan _ and one ofthe only boosts higher than the anticipated 3.4 percent inflationrate _ would go to Pell grants, the chief federal assistance programfor low-income post-secondary students.   Current budget authority for the program is nearly $4.5 billion.That would rise by $256 million under the Reagan plan _ a 5.7percent hike. The maximum grant amount of $2,300 would stay the sameand the number of students receiving aid would rise 46,000 to 3.1million.   Reagan would increase outlays for Chapter 1, the major federalprogram for low-achieving children in poor neighborhoods, from thecurrent $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in fiscal 1990. Most of theextra money would be for grants funneled to areas with the highestconcentrations of needy students.   The Reagan budget would hike spending authority for vocationaland bilingual education programs by about 3.4 percent. Spendingauthority for vocational education would rise to $949 million whilebilingual would increase to $157 million. Outlays are anticipated tobe slightly less.   The administration is hoping to save $212 million on theguaranteed student loan program by reducing special allowancepayments used as an incentive to lenders to participate, and byreducing guaranteed reinsurance to lenders and state guarantoragencies from 100 percent to 90 percent on the dollar. Congresswould have to approve both moves.   The entitlement program currently costs the government about $3.2billion in interest and default payments. Officials expect loanvolume to rise from $11.5 billion this year to $12.5 billion infiscal 1990, adding another 278,000 students to the 4 million-plusalready participating in the program.</TEXT></DOC>
