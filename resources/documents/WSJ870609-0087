Shares in the engineering and construction company jumped sharply following announcement of the $43-a-share proposal to take the company private, indicating some investors may expect a higher bid.    Research-Cottrell said it accepted the bid after hiring First Boston Corp. to advise it in connection with several previously undisclosed acquisition bids. All of the final bids were presented to directors last Friday. The company declined to provide details on the other proposals.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Research-Cottrell quickly rose $6.125 on heavy volume before settling at $44, up $5.125 for the day and $1 above the offer price. In an interview, Jeremiah P. Cronin, chief financial and administrative officer, said the company didn't know why the shares were trading above the price of the offer. At $43 a share, the buyout group's bid is more than twice the company's book value of $20.09 at the end of the fiscal year Oct. 31.    Last year, net income totaled $14.2 million, or $2.23 a share, compared with a loss of $22.3 million a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $396.2 million from $392.5 million. For the six months ended April 30, net income fell 9.9% to $6.4 million, or 97 cents a share, on $179.9 million in sales, from year-earlier net of $7.1 million, or $1.07 a share, on $189.1 million in sales.    &quot;We don't know of any (other) offer&quot; that may be forthcoming, Mr. Cronin said, adding, &quot;we have a signed merger agreement and a financing commitment.&quot; The executive said the company apparently had become attractive to the bidders because of its successful efforts at diversifying away from its stagnant core business -- supplying pollution-control equipment to utilities.    Under the agreement, a company formed by the buying group, R-C Acquisition Inc., will begin probably this week a tender offer for the company's 6.8 million shares, including shares available through exercise of options.    The tender offer is expected to be contingent on purchasing at least two-thirds of the Research-Cottrell shares, to be followed by a merger under which remaining shares would be purchased for $43 each.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will raise financing for the transaction through a private placement of debt and securities, and will provide interim financing if necessary, Research-Cottrell said.    Mr. Cronin of Research-Cottrell said that after the buyout, the company doesn't expect to sell any assets to repay debt incurred in the transaction. The buyout group has invited the company's present management to acquire a stake in the company following the purchase.    But the current trading price could interfere with the purchase.&quot;Obviously, Wall Street is looking for a higher bid,&quot; said Jeffrey Berg, an analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates. Before the buyout offer, the analyst had valued the company at $40 to $50 a share. &quot;If nothing else, the group that has the agreement might have to raise its bid,&quot; Mr. Berg said, adding that &quot;no one is going to tender at $43 with the stock trading where it is.&quot; Andrew Silver of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. said he believes the $43 a share is a full price, especially in light of the bid evaluating First Boston did for the company.    The analysts said several factors explain the interest in Research-Cottrell. It has about $65 million in cash on its balance sheet, and will receive another $60 million over the next two years as final payments from previous contracts.    They applauded the company's efforts to diversify into the waste water treatment and resource recovery business, although they noted those businesses are highly competitive. </TEXT></DOC>
