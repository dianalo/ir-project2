The East German legislature accepted responsibility Thursday forthe Nazi atrocities during World War II and sought assurances offorgiveness from Israel, the Soviet Union and Jews around the world.   ``I'm one who believes in forgiveness,'' Bush told reportersaboard Air Force One just before takeoff for Bermuda and hisone-day meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.``It's a good day for forgiveness for those of us who have faith.''   In a statement received in Washington, the Simon WiesenthalCenter of Los Angeles said the president's remark was ``morallywrong and politically dangerous'' because ``the generation ofGermans who perpetrated the Holocaust can never be forgiven fortheir heinous crimes.''   ``Indeed, the only people who could have granted themforgiveness perished in the gas chambers,'' the center said in astatement.   ``While the Jewish people do not hold those individuals bornafter the Holocaust to be responsible for the crimes of theirforefathers, nonetheless the legacy of Auschwitz must bepermanently embedded into the conscience of the German nation,''the statement said.   The center is a private group devoted to education about theNazi murder of 6 million Jews and the capture of Nazi war criminals.   Bush noted the start of the Easter weekend _ he attended asunrise Good Friday church service before leaving Washington.   Asked about the service, Bush joked with reporters: ``We prayedfor you.''   He turned more solemn when asked about East Germany and theHolocaust.   ``For our family, Easter is a very special time of year. Andit's a time to take stock and to be glad,'' Bush said.   ``I'm a Christian,'' he said, ``and I think that forgiveness issomething that I feel very strongly about.''   But while Bush advocated forgiveness he said the world shouldnot forget the Holocaust. ``You learn from history, what not to dowrong, how to conduct oneself,'' he said.   Bush said his feelings about forgiveness were a ``personalobservation. It's not a statement for our country.''   In its statement, the East German parliament said, ``Nationalismand racial madness led to genocide, particularly of the Jews in allEuropean countries, of the people of the Soviet Union, the Polishpeople and the Gypsy people. Parliament ... admits jointresponsibility on behalf of the people for the humiliation,expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and children.''</TEXT></DOC>
