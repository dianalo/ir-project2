Abbas Hamadi, 29, was sentenced to 13 years in prison afterbeing found guilty on all charges of kidnapping, coercion andpossession of explosives.   ``It is totally reprehensible to rob two innocent people oftheir freedom and make them fear for their lives,'' Chief JudgeArend said in explaining the sentence he and his four colleaguesmeted out to Hamadi.   The 13-year term was 18 months longer than the prosecutionrequested. The maximum allowed was 15 years.   Hamadi, who is bearded and wore a sport coat and open-neckedshirt, slumped into his chair after hearing the verdict andremained silent. More than 100 spectators, most of them reporters,were in the room.   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987,and Abbas 13 days later, both with explosives in their possession.Mohammed Hamadi is accused in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWAjetliner to Beirut in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39Americans were held hostage for 17 days.   Both Hamadis were living in West Germany at the time of theirarrests. After Mohammed Hamadi was jailed, but while his brotherwas free, two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut: Rudolf Cordeson Jan. 17 and Alfred Schmidt on Jan. 20.   Schmidt was released in September, but Cordes remains a hostage.   Arend said the evidence proved Abbas Hamadi was among radicalShiite Moslems who plotted the kidnappings to try to block MohammedHamadi's extradition to the United States. West Germany has refusedextradition and assigned Mohammed Hamadi's case to juvenile courtfor trial.   In Washington, deputy State Department spokeswoman PhyllisOakley said: ``We commend today's action by the West German court,which sends a clear signal to terrorists.''   Defense lawyer Eckart Hild said he would appeal and toldreporters: ``I do not find this judgment at all convincing.'' AbbasHamadi denied involvement in the kidnappings but admitted storingexplosives near his home in Saarland state for his younger brother.   The chief judge said in court: ``After the arrest of MohammedHamadi, the group in Beirut considered whether to attack the WestGerman Embassy in Lebanon, hijack a German airliner or kidnap aGerman citizen,'' and decided on kidnapping.   An older Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi, also was among theplotters, Arend said. He is security chief in Beirut for Hezbollah(Party of God), a Shiite Moslem group allied with Iran.   In the 3{-month trial of Abbas Hamadi, the court heard tappedtelephone conversations between him and Lebanese friends in WestGermany indicating he was among the plotters. A compelling piece ofevidence was a letter Schmidt sent to his mother from captivitythat bore Hamadi's fingerprints.   ``There is no doubt the fingerprints are those of AbbasHamadi,'' Arend said.   He said evidence showed the defendant acted as an interpreterduring questioning of the hostaged soon after their abductions.Abbas Hamadi has spent several years in West Germany and is fluentin the language, but was in Beirut when Schmidt and Cordes werekidnapped.   Abbas Hamadi threatened Schmidt at one point while holding a gunand also struck him with his hand, Arend said.   ``The accused demanded that Schmidt hand over the addresses ofother Germans in Beirut,'' which indicating the kidnappers wereseeking more victims, the judge declared.   Schmidt testified at the trial that he and Cordes were chainedto a wall for four months.   ``Animals should not be treated the way the hostages have beentreated,'' Arend said, looking directly at Hamadi.   He said Hezbollah planned to take the explosives stored nearAbbas Hamadi's home to France for terrorist acts. The judge did notelaborate.   According to Arend, evidence showed Abbas Hamadi also was guiltyof coercion. That charge stemmed from the kidnappers' threat tokill their hostages if Mohammed Hamadi was given to the UnitedStates.   West Germany rejected the extradition request last year and saidhe would be tried here.   No trial date has been set for Mohammed Hamadi, whose case wasturned over to juvenile court. Prosecutors' files show he now is23, but judicial officials say there is some question about his ageat the time the hijacking was planned.</TEXT></DOC>
