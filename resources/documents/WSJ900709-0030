Until recently, pro-Israel forces routinely opposed mostarms sales to Arab governments, or at least sought to havethem scaled back. But pro-Israel activists now say they mustchoose more selectively which battles to fight. They say therefusal by Israel's right-wing government to pursue its ownMideast peace plan, and increasing resentment among lawmakersabout strong-arm tactics by pro-Israel lobbyists, havepoisoned the atmosphere.</LP><TEXT>   This new hesitancy sometimes produces confusion. Indeed,during the past few weeks, the vaunted pro-Israel politicalmachine has seemed to be in disarray.   The Israeli Embassy, for instance, waited several weeksafter the Saudi sale was announced before even statingforcefully that the arms package would threaten Israel'ssecurity. The major pro-Israel lobbying group, Aipac, takingits cue from the embassy's initial reticence, decided itwouldn't fight the sale.   One congressman who opposed the arms package was told bymore than 30 congressional offices there was no reason tojoin the fight if Aipac was silent. In the end, the proposedHouse resolution to block the sale had only 10 sponsors.   Aipac says it didn't put up a fight because the armswouldn't jeopardize Israel's security. It took a similarapproach last fall, when the administration proposed a tanksale to Saudi Arabia. An official says the group is &quot;keepingits powder dry&quot; to wage a big battle against an expectedattempt by the Saudis to make a major purchase of fighteraircraft. &quot;You can't ask Congress to go to the mat for everyweapon {sale},&quot; the official says. &quot;You've got to have astrategy.&quot;   But an Israeli official offers a different view: &quot;A lot ofpeople realize that we now have a limited amount of politicalcapital in this town.&quot;   The pending Saudi arms package includes about 1,100light-armored vehicles, improvements for Awacs electronicsurveillance aircraft and 2,000 TOW anti-tank missiles.Israeli officials say the first two items, which make up thebulk of the sale, wouldn't pose a military threat to Israel.But the TOW missiles are designed to penetrate a type ofarmor used on Israeli tanks.   At the behest of pro-Israel legislators, House ForeignAffairs Chairman Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.), and Rep. LeeHamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the panel's Mideastsubcommittee, spoke to Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger about removing the TOWs from the package. But theeffort failed, as the pro-Israel forces had little leverage.   That's especially surprising in view of the fact that theadministration's reasons for arms sales to the Saudis havebeen very disjointed recently. Last year, the administrationtold Congress that Saudi Arabia needed tanks because of athreat from Iraq. In a hearing last month, the administrationsaid Saudi Arabia needed the latest arms package because itfaces &quot;a significant threat from Iran.&quot; But duringquestioning at the hearing, an administration official said&quot;Iran has taken a beating in the {Iran-Iraq} war and is notat this point an overwhelming military threat.&quot;   Congressional resentment has been growing againstpro-Israel forces for some time. The Israel lobby engenderedconsiderable congressional ire earlier this year by pushing apurely symbolic, nonbinding resolution declaring thatJerusalem is Israel's capital. Lawmakers adopted itoverwhelmingly, but, concedes an Israeli official, &quot;Probablya lot of good will for Israel was wasted in the process.&quot;   Congress also resented a secret effort by Israel'sgovernment earlier this year to help finance the takeover ofa building by Jewish hard-liners in the Old Christian quarterof East Jerusalem. As a slap on the wrist, the House added$1.8 million -- the amount secretly provided for the takeover-- to a fee charged Israel for a U.S. loan guarantee. Whenthe fee was added, even pro-Israel House members didn'tobject.   &quot;We're all learning there's a bottom to the well,&quot; says anIsraeli official. &quot;People won't be pressed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
