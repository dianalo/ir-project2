(See Docket R-0643,published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.) The Board is issuing, for a 60-day public commentperiod, proposed amendments to Regulation CC designed to alleviate theoperational difficulties and additional risks resulting from this finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation CC defines bank to include all depository institutions,including commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.A depositary bank is defined as the first bank to which a check is transferred.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>As adopted in May 1988, Regulation CC provided that checks written on anaccount at one bank but payable through another bank were to be consideredlocal or nonlocal under Regulation CC and the Expedited Funds AvailabilityAct (``Act'') based on the location of the bank designated as the payablethrough bank. This treatment of ``bank payable through checks'' was consistentwith the scheme set forth in the Act to permit banks to place longer holdson checks that must be sent to nonlocal banks for collection because suchchecks generally take longer to collect and return than checks sent tolocal banks for collection and, therefore, could pose greater risks fordepositary banks.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, treating the payable through bank as the payingbank would facilitate the handling of these checks by depositary banksbecause it would permit them to use automated equipment to read the routingnumber of the payable through bank encoded on a check, which indicatesthe check processing region where the payable through bank is located,and to assign availability for the check on the basis of that number.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under the regulation, depositary banks may differentiatefunds availability based on whether the check is written on a local ornonlocal paying bank. A local paying bank is one located in the same checkprocessing region as the depositary bank. As of September 1, 1988, depositarybanks must make the proceeds of local checks available for withdrawal notlater than three business days following deposit; nonlocal checks mustbe made available for withdrawal not later than seven business days followingdeposit. On September 1, 1990, these schedules are reduced to two and fivebusiness days for local and nonlocal checks, respectively.Shortly after the Board adopted Regulation CC defining the payable throughbank as the paying bank and thus allowing bank payable through checks tobe treated as local or nonlocal according to the location of the payablethrough bank, the Credit Union National Association (``CUNA'') and oneof its member credit unions brought suit asserting that this rule was contraryto the provisions of the Act, and that such checks, in particular creditunion share drafts, should be treated as local or nonlocal on the basisof the location of the bank on which they are written, rather than thelocation of the payable through bank. CUNA believed that the treatmentof bank payable through checks adopted by the Board would have an adverseeffect on the acceptability of these checks as a form of payment becausemost credit union payable through checks would be treated as nonlocal,even though they would generally be deposited in a bank local to the creditunion. CUNA argued that if these checks were generally treated as nonlocal,a large number of credit unions that offer payable through share draftaccounts would be disadvantaged.On July 28, 1988, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbiaruled that under the language of the Act, bank payable through checks shouldbe treated as local or nonlocal on the basis of the location of the creditunion rather than the location of the payable through bank. On August 18,1988, the Board adopted interim amendments to Regulation CC to implementthe court's decision and requested comment on the interim rule pendingconsideration of a longer term response to the court's interpretation ofthe Act. 53 FR 31290 (August 18, 1988). The interim rule applied the court'sdecision to all bank payable through checks rather than only those writtenon credit unions.The Board received 155 comments on the interim rule. (A summary of thecomments appears below.) The overwhelming majority of the commenters (144)objected to the treatment of bank payable through checks as local or nonlocalon the basis of the location of the bank on which they are written, becausethis rule creates operational difficulties and increased risks for depositarybanks. Many of the commenters suggested various means of addressing theseoperational problems and risks.The Board has adopted the interim rule, with minor technical changes, andis also proposing for comment amendments to Regulation CC designed to alleviatethe operational difficulties and increased risks resulting from the interimrule. These proposed amendments are based on specific suggestions of thecommenters and on subsequent discussions with industry representativesand the Industry Return Item Advisory Group, which includes representativesof commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.The Board is issuing these proposals for comment to gain further informationconcerning whether the proposals are necessary to facilitate compliancewith the revised regulation and to improve the check system by speedingthe collection and return of payable through checks, and whether they imposeundue burdens on the banks on which bank payable through checks are written.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Although bank payable through checks represent only two to three percentof the approximately 47 billion checks written each year, they are sufficientlyprevalent to create substantial operational problems for banks in complyingwith the Act, as interpreted by the court, and Regulation CC, as amendedby the interim rule, and to increase the risk of check fraud for depositarybanks. Available data indicate that the two largest payable through processorshandle approximately 700 million bank payable through checks each year.Although the majority of bank payable through checks are written on themore than 4,000 credit unions that use such checks, they are also usedby some savings and loan associations and commercial banks. The Board hasidentified at least 65 banks across the country that serve as payable throughbanks and believes that others exist that have not yet been identified.Ordinarily, many banks that provide different availability for local andnonlocal checks identify the checks as local or nonlocal based on the routingnumber in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (``MICR'') line on thebottom of the checks. This routing number is either entered into the bank'scomputer system by the teller at the time the transaction is made (on-lineprocessing) or read from the check using automated equipment during subsequentprocessing (batch processing). The first four digits of the nine-digitrouting number are used to identify the Federal Reserve check processingregion to which the check is sent for payment and thus permit the bankto readily identify whether a check is local or nonlocal. In the case ofa bank payable through check, however, the routing number cannot be usedto determine whether the check is local or nonlocal because it identifiesthe payable through bank rather than the bank on which the check is written.Accordingly, in order to determine whether a check is local or nonlocal,depositary banks must first determine whether it is a payable through check.Generally, there are two ways to identify these checks. First, they canbe identified by visual inspection by the teller at the time that the checksare received for deposit. This procedure is labor intensive, and thereforecostly, and prone to the high level of errors associated with manual processing.Once a check is identified as a payable through check, it may still bedifficult to determine whether the check is local or nonlocal because somebank payable through checks do not contain on the face of the check thelocation of the bank on which they are written. Even if this informationis included on the face of the check, the local/nonlocal determinationmay be difficult to make due to the information's placement on the checkor its type size. In addition, in cases where the location is clearly identifiable,it may be a difficult task to determine whether the bank on which the checkis written is in the same check processing region as the depositary bank,because most check processing regions contain only portions of states.The depositary bank may need to refer to a list of cities and towns inits check processing region to determine if the bank payable through checkis local for purposes of Regulation CC.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Listings of cities and states in individual Federal Reservecheck processing regions are available upon request from local FederalReserve Bank offices.The second way to identify bank payable through checks is to program acheck reader-sorter to outsort all checks bearing the routing number ofthe payable through banks and either to assign those checks local availability,even when they are not payable by a local bank, or to inspect them visuallyto determine whether they should be assigned local or nonlocal availability.Although many bank payable through checks bear routing numbers that areused almost exclusively for such checks, others bear routing numbers thatare also used for significant numbers of non-payable through checks. Inaddition, some payable through banks serve banks in a number of FederalReserve check processing regions. Treating all checks bearing the routingnumber of a payable through bank as local also results in giving localavailability to an unknown number of checks that may be treated as nonlocal.In addition, it creates an incentive for banks to act as payable throughbanks so that their checks may be considered local by banks that use thisapproach to comply. Further, as noted above, it is difficult to identifyall banks that serve as payable through banks. A bank may begin or ceaseacting as a payable through bank at any time. Any listing of payable throughbank routing numbers is likely to omit certain payable through banks, thuscausing banks relying on that list to violate the Act by giving nonlocalavailability to checks that should receive local availability under theAct. Finally, commenters indicated that if a bank wishes to inspect bankpayable through checks visually once they have been identified in orderto determine whether they are local or nonlocal, that process will be costlyand error-prone and may delay the collection of those checks.In addition to the operating problems caused by bank payable through checks,these checks are attractive vehicles for check fraud. The time that ittakes bank payable through checks to travel to and from the depositarybanks is a function of its location in relation to the payable throughbank, not the bank on which the check is written.\4\<NOTE/> Consequently, it generally takes longer for checks that aresent to a nonlocal payable through bank to be collected and returned thanit does for checks that are sent to a local bank. In the case of many depositarybanks, these collection and return times will regularly exceed the availabilityschedules in the Act for local checks. Persons wishing to commit checkfraud on those depositary banks would be able to rely on the fact thatthe bank must make the proceeds of the checks available for withdrawalbefore it had an opportunity to learn that the checks had been dishonored.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Chase Manhattan, one of the two major national payablethrough processors, stated in its comments: ``* * * if the payor bank decidesnot to pay a draft, the time that it takes the draft to travel to the depositarybank is a function of its location in relation to the payable through bank,not the payor bank. Therefore, when a payable through bank returns a draftreceived from a nonlocal depositary bank, it must be afforded the benefitof the longer return time for nonlocal items nowithstanding that the payorbank may be in the same check processing region as the depositary bank.''Under the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Board has the authorityto adopt regulations to address these problems. Although the language ofthe Act governing the availability of checks in sufficiently specific forthe court to conclude that the Act requires local availability for bankpayable through checks written on local banks but payable through nonlocalbanks, the Act gives the Board general authority to regulate the checkcollection system. Section 609(c)(1) of the Act provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT SYSTEM_In order to carry out the provisionsof this title, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shallhave the responsibility to regulate_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Any aspect of the payment system, including the receipt, payment,collection, or clearing of checks; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Any related function of the payment system with respect to checks.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This authority is extremely broad and, together with section 609(a)of the Act, which authorizes the Board to prescribe rules to facilitatecompliance with the Act, gives the Board the authority to adopt reasonablechanges to the way that checks are handled, provided that those changesfurther the purposes of the Act, such as by expediting the collection andreturn of checks or facilitating compliance with the availability schedules.The Board believes that there are a number of approaches to dealing withthe operational and risk problems associated with bank payable throughchecks, including: (1) Requiring such checks to be presentable locallyand to bear a local routing number in the MICR line; (2) requiring suchchecks to be conspicuously labeled as payable through checks, specifyingthe name and location of the payable through bank and the name, location,and nine-digit routing number of the bank on which the check is written;(3) authorizing collecting banks to present such checks directly to thebank on which they are written; and (4) shifting to the bank on which thecheck is written the risks of loss due to the time required for the returnof such checks from nonlocal payable through banks.1. <T3>Require bank payable through checks to be presentable locally and beara local routing number in the MICR line.</T3> Eighty-nine commenters expressedconcern about the operational problems posed by the court ruling and interimamendments. A number of these commenters suggested that the Board requirecredit unions to encode their own routing numbers on their checks, or thatof a local payable through bank. This would permit depositary banks todetermine whether any check is local or nonlocal through the use of automatedequipment, because the routing number encoded on the check would indicatethe check processing region of the bank on which the check is written.Therefore, this approach would effectively remove the operational difficultiesin assigning appropriate availability to these checks.In addition, this proposal would address the concerns expressed by 111commenters the potential risk of additional losses and increased exposureto fraud for depositary banks as a result of the revised rule definingthe bank on which the payable through check is written as the paying bankfor determining funds availability. The proposal would eliminate the likelihoodthat these checks would become attractive vehicles for check fraud becausea bank payable through check with a local routing number could be presentedto the local address associated with the routing number, maintaining aclear link between the time it takes to collect and return the check andthe time within which the depositary bank must make the funds availableto the depositor.This proposal would require the reissuance of payable through checks encodedwith routing numbers not associated with the same check processing regionas the bank on which the checks are written and may also require a bankto change its payable through check processor. The cost of reissuing checksand converting to a different processor depends, in part, on the lead timebetween the adoption of the proposal in final form and the effective dateof this requirement. These costs would have to be weighed against the coststo the banking industry in general of identifying bank payable throughchecks by other means and the risks arising from the use of nonlocal payablethrough banks for these checks.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ One industry consultant indicated that ``on average, 80to 85% of [credit union] members will reorder [share drafts] in a nineto twelve month period.'' (July 13, 1988, affidavit of David McCurrach,President of McCurrach andamp; Company.) Dearborn Federal Credit Union, ina June 16, 1988 affidavit, noted that, if it were to convert to local processing,it must either incur the costs of reprinting share drafts for all of thecredit union's members (estimated at $7 per member), or incur the costof operating a full-scale dual processing system for one year while somemembers are converting to new share drafts and others are using up theirold payable through share drafts.When some credit unions began offering share draft accounts to their membersin the mid-1970s, they used payable through banks exclusively to processchecks written on those accounts (predominantly two national payable throughprocessors), in part due to competitive concerns with having local banksprocessing their checks. With the enactment of the Monetary Control Actof 1980, credit unions were able to obtain their own routing numbers, andthus had greater processing options. In addition, other service providersbegan offering share draft processing services to credit unions, includingcorrespondent banks, corporate credit unions, state credit union leagues,credit union service organizations, regional data processors, and servicebureaus.According to CUNA, the current trend is for credit unions to shift to localprocessors or in-house processing. CUNA reports that six percent of creditunions now process in-house, while 25 percent use local processors in anintercept arrangement, rather than a payable through arrangement. (In anintercept arrangement, the credit union uses its own routing number onits checks, rather than the routing number of the processor.) The remaining69 percent of credit unions use a payable through bank for processing,a small portion of which use a local payable through bank.The proposed requirement would not necessarily preclude nonlocal processingof payable through checks. Currently, arrangements exist whereby payablethrough checks are delivered to a local presentment point and subsequentlytransported to the nonlocal processing site. For example, some corporatecredit unions serve market areas that encompass multiple check processingregions, and thereby provide services to members located in one or morenonlocal check processing regions. Such arrangements tend to be regionalrather than national in scope due to transportation times necessary tomove the payable through checks from the presentment point to the processingsite. Thus, this proposal might cause a shift from national payable throughprocessing to regional or in-house processing. On the other hand, nationalpayable through processors could develop regional operations in order tocontinue to provide services to banks that issue payable through checks.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Traveler's Express, one of the two major national payablethrough processors, has established three regional processing centers inthe past four years, and has stated that it plans to establish additionalregional processing sites in the future, in order to retain credit unioncustomers that are seeking local processing.The Board considered, as an alternative to this proposal, a proposal torequire payable through checks to be identified as such in the MICR lineof the check. There is only one field in the MICR line (position 44) thatsuch information can be contained. Because this field is also used to identifychecks, including payable through checks, for other purposes (e.g., toidentify the check as eligible for truncation), and because the industryis interested in reserving the use of this field for a number of otherpurposes, this alternative is not attractive. Moreover, this approach wouldonly indicate to the depositary bank whether the check is a payable throughcheck; it would not provide sufficient information to determine, in anautomated environment, whether a payable through check is local or nonlocal.The Board is publishing for comment a proposed amendment to RegulationCC to require bank payable through checks to bear a routing number in theMICR line that is associated with the same check processing region as thelocation of the bank on which the check is written, and to require a presentmentpoint for such checks in that check processing region. This requirementwould be effective one year following adoption of the amendment. The Boardspecifically requests comment on the cost savings to depositary banks andthe costs to banks using such checks so that the benefits and costs ofthis proposal can be more fully assessed.2. <T3>Require bank payable through checks to be conspicuously labeled withthe name, location, and nine-digit routing number of the bank on whichthe check is written and the legend ``payable through'' followed by thename and location of the payable through bank. </T3>In order for banksto be able to separate payable through checks from other check depositsand determine by visual inspection the appropriate hold, rather than relyon the routing number encoded on the check to determine availability, certaininformation pertaining to the payable through bank and the bank on whichthe check is written must be included on the check. Commenters indicatedthat information on the face of the check indicating the name and locationof the credit union and the legend ``payable through'' followed by thename and location of the payable through bank is crucial to the visualidentification of these checks, although it would not permit their identificationby automated equipment. In addition, 10 commenters indicated that the assignmentof availability to these checks would be facilitated by requiring the routingnumber of the bank on which they are written to be included on the faceof the check. Furthermore, CUNA stated in its submissions to the courtthat printing the name, address, and first four digits of the routing numberof the bank by which the check is payable on the face of the check wouldbe a reasonable way to help depositary banks determine whether a payablethrough check is local or nonlocal.Inclusion of the routing number on the face of the check would permit bankpersonnel to assign availability to these checks without the need to referto a list of cities and towns in the depositary bank's Federal Reservecheck processing region to determine if the location of the bank on whichthe check is written is local for purposes of Regulation CC.\7\<NOTE/> The need for the routing number of the bank on which thecheck is written to be printed on the face of bank payable through checkswould be eliminated if the Board adopts the requirement that all bank payablethrough checks bear a local routing number in the MICR line. The otherrequired information would still be needed, even if the first proposalwere adopted. For example, the name and location of the payable throughbank may be needed in those cases where the routing number on the checkcannot be properly read.\8\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the name of the payable through bank and someindication that the check is payable through that bank appears to be requiredby current law.\9\<NOTE/> The requirement that specified information be printed onthe face of the check would not address the potential risks of bank payablethrough checks becoming attractive vehicles for fraud. If this proposalwere adopted, the bank on which the payable through checks are writtenmay incur costs to reissue its checks, if the checks currently do not containthe required information. Unlike the first proposal, however, this proposalwould not require any bank to move its payable through check processingto a different bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ An ancillary benefit to requiring that the nine-digitrouting number of the bank on which the check is written be printed onthe face of the check is that it would provide information needed to establisharrangements for automated clearinghouse transfers to or from an accountat the bank on which the check is written so that the ACH transfers wouldbe sent to the bank on which the check is written rather than to the payablethrough bank, which generally rejects the transfer. The bank routing numberand account number information that is necessary to establish an ACH transferarrangement is often obtained from a voided check supplied by the bankcustomer. If this information is obtained from a bank payable through check,the routing number does not identify the bank to which the ACH transfershould be directed, resulting in problems for the payable through bank,the customer, the originator of the payment, and the bank to which theACH transfer should be directed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Federal Reserve Operating Circular on the Collectionof Cash Items and Returned Checks states that banks should not send toa Reserve Bank for forward collection a check that ``does not state onits face the name and city and state address of the paying bank associatedwith the routing number on the item''. (Paragraph 7(e).)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See U.C.C. andSection; 3-120, <T3>Engine Parts, Inc. v. Citizens Bank of Clovis, </T3>92 N.M. 37, 582P.2d 809, 23 UCC Rep. Serv. 1248 (1978), and <T3>Phelon v. University National Bank,</T3> 85 Ill. App. 2d 56, 229 N.E.2d 372, 4 UCC Rep. Serv. 635 (1967).The Board is publishing for comment an amendment to Regulation CC thatwould require bank payable through checks to conspicuously state the nameand location of the payable through bank and the bank on which they arewritten, as well as the routing number of the bank on which they are written,and the legend ``payable through'' on the face of the check. If adopted,this requirement would be effective one year following adoption of theamendment. The Board specifically requests comment on the cost savingsand operational benefits to depositary banks and the costs to banks usingsuch checks that would result from the adoption of this proposal.3. <T3>Authorize direct presentment. </T3>Currently, the law is unclear asto whether a bank payable through check can be presented directly to thebank on which it is written or whether such checks must be presented tothe payable through bank. In its Share Draft Operating Manual publishedin 1983, ICU Services, a CUNA affiliate, states ``the credit union managementhas the right to refuse to accept a payable through share draft which ispresented directly to the credit union.'' On the other hand, the AmericanBankers Association (``ABA'') commented that, while old case law and Article3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (``U.C.C.'') might suggest that a payorbank may properly refuse direct presentment of payable through checks,``it can be argued that present section 4-204(2) of the UCC (which overridesArticle 3 of the UCC in the event of a conflict of provisions) alreadyauthorizes collecting banks to send items directly to the payor bank.''The ABA also commented that even if some depository institutions assertthat they are ``nonbank payors'' in order to avoid direct presentment underU.C.C. 4-204(2)(a), the Board has the power to promulgate regulations permittingdirect presentment under U.C.C. 4-204(2)(c) and section 609(c)(1) of theExpedited Funds Availability Act. Expressly permitting such checks to be presented directly to the bank onwhich they are written would enable banks to have such checks collectedand returned locally, and thus would avoid the delays in collection andreturn that occur when the depository bank sends the checks to nonlocalpayable through banks. Although direct presentment of bank payable throughchecks would not alleviate the operational burdens of identifying thesechecks and assigning them the appropriate availability, it may reduce thelikelihood that they would become attractive vehicles for check fraud becausedepositors could not rely on the longer collection and return time fornonlocal checks. If this proposal is adopted, the Federal Reserve Banks may consider expandingtheir fine sort check collection service to facilities direct presentmentof payable through checks to the bank on which the checks are written.Under this service, collecting banks that want the Federal Reserve Bankto present payable through checks directly to the bank on which they arewritten, rather than to the payable through bank, would be required tofine sort these checks according to the routing number of the bank on whichthe checks are written. The extent to which a rule expressly permitting direct presentment of thesechecks to the bank on which they are written could impose burdens on suchbanks is not clear. The banks generally already receive direct presentmentof some checks over the counter for their customers. Further, the extentto which the volume of checks presented directly would increase is unknown.The presentment of a significant number of such checks may cause operationalburdens for these banks because they are generally not equipped to processlarge volumes of checks. The need for this rule would be diminished ifbank payable through checks were required to have a local routing numberin the MIRC line, and a corresponding local presentment point. The Board is publishing for comment an amendment to Regulation CC thatwould authorize direct presentment of bank payable through checks. TheBoard specifically requests comment on the cost and operational burdenof this proposal on banks that use payable through checks, the potentialcost savings to depositary banks, and the appropriate lead time for implementationof the proposal, if it is adopted. 4. <T3>Shift risk of loss to bank on which check is written. </T3>One hundredeleven commenters expressed concern regarding the potential risks of lossesand increased exposure to fraud for depositary banks as a result of therevised rule defining the bank on which the payable through check is writtenas the paying bank for determining funds availability. Commenters argued that checks considered local for determining availabilityshould also be considered local for determining whether the checks arereturned expeditiously so that the risks to depositary banks would notbe increased by the revised rule. These commenters suggested that the reviseddefinition of paying bank also be applied to the expeditious return rulesin Subpart C of the regulation. The effect of the revision suggested by the commenters can also be achievedby requiring that the bank on which a payable through check is writtenbear any losses incurred by the depositary bank due to return of a checkfrom a nonlocal payable through bank in a time longer than would have beenrequired for return of the check if it had been presented directly to thebank on which it was written. This rule would not address the operationaldifficulties in identifying these checks and would not protect the depositarybank from risks due to any longer time required to present such checksto a nonlocal payable through bank. On the other hand, the burden thatthis rule would place on banks on which such checks are written would beminimal and would be limited to losses for which they were responsiblebecause of the location and return procedures of the payable through bankthat they selected. The need for such a rule would be eliminated if bankpayable through checks were required to have a local routing number inthe MICR line and would be diminished if direct presentment of payablethrough checks were authorized. The Board is publishing for comment an amendment to Regulation CC thatwould place the risk of loss for return of bank payable through checksfrom nonlocal payable through banks on the banks on which such checks arewritten, to the extent that the return from the nonlocal payable throughbank took longer than would have been required if the check had been returnedexpeditiously by the bank on which it is written. The Board requests commentas to whether this allocated liability should be computed solely underthe two-day/four-day test in andSection; 229.30(a)(1) of Regulation CC orwhether it is possible to also compute such liability under the forwardcollection test in andSection; 229.30(a)(2). The Board also requests commenton the appropriate lead time for implementation of this proposal if itis adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Proposals</ITAG>These proposed amendments address many of the operational and risk concernsraised by the commenters in response to the revised rule adopted by theBoard to treat bank payable through checks as local or nonlocal based onthe location of the bank on which they are written rather than the locationof the bank through which they are payable. The Board is publishing forpublic comment, the following proposed amendments to Regulation CC, todetermine whether they would facilitate compliance with Regulation CC andimprove the check system by speeding the collection and return of payablethrough checks, and whether they would impose undue burdens on the bankson which payable through checks are written.1. Require bank payable through checks to be presentable locally and tobear a local routing number in the MICR line (See proposed regulatory language_amendmentsto andSection; 229.36(b), (f) (Alternative 1), and (g) (Alternative 1); 2. Require bank payable through checks to be conspicuously labeled withthe name, location, and nine-digit routing number of the bank on whichthe check is written and the legend ``payable through'' followed by thename and location of the payable through bank (See proposed regulatorylanguage_amendment to andSection; 229.36(g) (Alternative 2).

In addition, elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Board is proposingfor comment several other technical amendments to Regulation CC relatingto payable through checks (see Docket R-0649).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>The Board received a total of 155 comments on the interim rule. The followingtable reflects these comments by category of respondent:<ITAG tagnum="38">Commercial Banks and Bank Holding Companies \1\ </ITAG>.....129<ITAG tagnum="38">Credit Unions </ITAG>.....3<ITAG tagnum="38">Savings and Loan Associations </ITAG>.....12<ITAG tagnum="38">Trade Associations </ITAG>.....8<ITAG tagnum="38">Individuals </ITAG>.....3<ITAG tagnum="20">______</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">\1\ Identical comments submitted by three employees of the same bankare counted as one comment.</ITAG>A total of 144 commenters opposed the definition of paying bank as interpretedby the court decision. Fifty-three percent of the commenters urged theBoard to appeal the court ruling. Ten commenters suggested that the Boardshould request that Congress amend the law. Five commenters concurred withthe revisions made in the interim rule. The majority of the commentersdiscussed the operational concerns and the increased risk of fraud losscaused by the court ruling. They indicated the need for longer term initiativesaimed at easing the operational burden of identifying payable through draftsand minimizing the risk of fraud losses for depositary banks.<T3>Operational concerns. </T3>A total of 89 commenters expressed concernabout the operational problems caused by the ruling. Banks will no longerbe able to rely on the routing number to determine whether a bank payablethrough check is local or nonlocal. Commenters stated that they will haveoperational difficulties in assigning availability to payable through checks.They expressed concern that depositary banks will have to revert to a complexmanual process in order to distinguish share drafts payable by local creditunions from other checks for the purpose of determining availability. Personnelwill have to be trained to inspect each check visually to determine whetherthe check is local or nonlocal. Individual handling and visual inspectionwill create a larger probability of error and possibly cause delays incollection and return. Commenters were also concerned that tellers wouldhave difficulty determining the availability of payable through checksbased on the geographic location of the credit union, because most checkprocessing regions contain only portions of certain states. Reference toa detailed listing of cities and towns in the depositary bank's check processingregion would often be required to determine accurately whether a creditunion is local or nonlocal to the depositary bank.Commenters stated that determination of holds on a manual, rather thanautomated, basis would increase the expense of processing deposits andwould decrease the efficiency of the processing, contrary to Congress'expressed intent in the Act that the Board takes steps to improve the checksystem. Camden National Bank, Camden, Maine, commented, ``we are no longerin the Stone Age of check processing where an individual examines eachitem and sorts it. We are a small bank; however we do our own check processingand handle an average of 25,000 checks for deposit nightly.'' The HuntingtonNational Bank, Huntington, Ohio, stated, ``we process 20 million itemsper month on the basis of the routing transit number; the time and expenseof sorting through these items by hand would be prohibitive.'' The commentersstated that the burden of identifying a local or nonlocal check has beenplaced on the depositary bank without a standard industry identificationprocedure. The majority of the commenters believe that the routing numbershould continue to be the controlling determination for availability. Theyreferred to the routing number method as efficient and proven.Some commenters proposed initiatives to ease the operational burdens createdby the interim rule. A few commenters requested that the Board developan alternative method of identifying checks as local or nonlocal in anautomated check processing environment. One commenter suggested that thecredit union should be required to encode a character in the MICR lineto identify the check as a payable through check.Ten commenters suggested that the credit union should have its own routingnumber printed on the face of the check. Commenters also recommended that,at a minimum, the credit unions should identify their checks as payablethrough and include their own name and address and the name of the payablethrough bank on the face of the check.A number of commenters suggested that a list should be developed of thecredit unions that use nonlocal payable through banks. Another alternativesuggested was a list of routing numbers for all payable through banks ineach Federal Reserve district.Fifteen commenters recommended that the Board should allow depositary banksto require the use of a special deposit slip for payable through checksthat are to be treated as local items. They noted that Regulation CC currentlyrequires special deposit slips for certain next-day items and suggestedthat the same rules apply to payable through checks. The special depositslips would make these items more easily identifiable for tellers.<T3>Risk of fraud loss</T3>. One hundred eleven commenters expressed concernregarding the potential risk of losses and increased exposure to fraudfor depositary banks. They stated that the interim rule will expose depositarybanks that accept share drafts for deposit that are payable by a localcredit union but payable through a nonlocal bank to additional risk becausesuch share drafts would not have to be returned as expeditiously as localchecks would normally be returned. The commenters indicated that most sharedrafts payable through a nonlocal bank would not be received by the depositarybank before funds must be made available under the local availability schedule.Home Loan Savings Bank, Fort Wayne, Indiana, commented that ``in the past,we have on many occasions, experienced inordinate delays of from 12 to18 days in the return of local credit union share drafts payable throughdistant nonlocal banks.''Commenters argued that checks considered local for the purposes of determiningavailability should also be considered local for determining whether thechecks are returned expeditiously. They recommended that the revised definitionof paying bank be applied to the rules of Subpart C, in particular theexpeditious return rules, as well as the availability rules of SubpartB. They noted that this would also reestablish the clear connection betweenthe availability requirements and the time required for a check to be clearedand returned. Commenters also suggested that the credit union on whichthe check is written should be responsible for any losses incurred. AmericanBankers Association, Washington, DC, stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">To relieve the unfair risk imposed on banks in this situation, westrongly recommend that the Board extend the revised definition of payingbank to Subpart C relating to the collection of checks. The expeditiousreturn standard should be determined by the location of the payor banksince that location determines whether a local or nonlocal check fundsavailability schedule applies.</ITAG>Thirty-five commenters stated that the interim rule promotes delayed disbursement.They noted that the revised definition of paying bank is inconsistent withthe Federal Reserve Board's proposal to restrict remote disbursement ofteller's checks and the Board's overall efforts to discourage delayed disbursement.Eight commenters recommended that the final rule authorize direct presentmentto credit unions that use payable through checks. They indicated that,under direct presentment, depositary banks would have the option of collectingpayable through checks locally in those cases where local availabilitymust be provided, and thus would generally learn if a check has not beenpaid prior to the time funds must be made available for withdrawal.Twenty-five commenters favored requiring a credit union to use a localpayable through bank. They noted that this requirement would reduce therisks to the depositary bank by maintaining the clear link between thetime it takes to collect and return a check and the time within which thedepositary bank must make the funds available to the depositor. They statedthat if the credit unions want their checks to be treated as local theyshould be willing to use a local payable through bank. They also notedthat this proposal would eliminate the operational problems created bythe interim rule, by enabling depositary banks to rely on the routing numberencoded on the check to determine availability.<T3>Miscellaneous issues</T3>. Twenty commenters discussed the additionaldisclosure requirements, with the majority of the commenters opposing themdue to the added cost to the depositary bank, which would be passed onto bank customers. These commenters also indicated that these extra noticeswould create additional confusion to their customers. Further, some commentersindicated that it was operationally difficult to provide the added disclosuresto their customers because of printing backlogs and quarterly versus monthlystatements. The American Bankers Association indicated that the proposeddisclosure requirement was generally an appropriate solution, but suggestedadditional language that would be applicable to those depositary banksthat give availability of funds for all checks within the local schedule.Finally, some commenters supported the time frame for disseminating thedisclosures.Eight commenters generally favored the bona fide error proposal, but mostasked that additional clarification be provided in andSection; 229.21(c).Some commenters requested that ``safe harbor'' procedures for determiningwhether a check is local or nonlocal be identified or examples given withrespect to the type of procedure that would be considered reasonable. Further,other commenters believed the provision offered only limited protectionand suggested additional language so that depositary banks relying on thelist of routing numbers of payable through banks compiled by the FederalReserve would not be liable for related mistakes.One commenter indicated that it will maintain records of any losses incurredas a result of the payable through amendment and suggested that the FederalReserve and other banks monitor these matters carefully, so that appropriateaction can be taken if losses reach an unacceptable level.One commenter indicated that the interim amendment was not clear as towhat type of checks, other than credit union share drafts, were coveredby the amendment, and requested that a more precise identification be given.One commenter was not in favor of the technical revisions to RegulationCC that were made to conform other provisions of the regulation to thepayable through amendment. This commenter requested that the Federal Reserveretain or modify in different ways the provisions that contained referencesto the use of the routing number versus the actual location of the bankoffering payable through checks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (12 U.S.C. 601-612) requires an agency topublish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with any notice of proposedrulemaking. Two of the requirements of an initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis (12 U.S.C. 603(b)), a description of the reasons why action bythe agency is being considered and a statement of the objectives of, andlegal basis for, the proposed rule, are contained in the supplementarymaterial above. The proposed rules require no additional reporting or record-keepingrequirements nor are there relevant federal rules that duplicate, overlap,or conflict with the proposed rule.Another requirement for the initial regulatory flexibility analysis isa description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of smallentities to which the proposed rule will apply. The above supplementarymaterial contains the Board's best estimates of the number of institutionsthat use payable through checks and that would therefore be affected bythe proposed rules. Many of the affected institutions would be small entities,generally credit unions, however the Board does not have information onthe sizes of all of the affected entities.The Board has included in its proposal several alternative rules and isrequesting comment on the cost and risk associated with each alternativefor all affected entities, both large and small. The Board has not, however,proposed an exemption from coverage for small institutions that use payablethrough checks. The purpose of the proposed rules is to alleviate the operationaldifficulties and risk associated with the acceptance of payable throughchecks by depositary banks. This purpose would be defeated if the rulesdid not apply to small institutions that use payable through checks becausethe operational and risk problems for their checks would remain.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229</ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR Part 229 is proposed tobe amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 229_AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND COLLECTION OF CHECKS</ITAG>1.
