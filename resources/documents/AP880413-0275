Vice Chairman Harold Poling was Ford's top earner for 1987 withcompensation of $10.8 million, including $8,060,272 from exerciseof stock options, cash bonuses of $2 million plus salary andbenefits totaling $808,697, according to a proxy statement mailedTuesday to Ford shareholders.   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen received the largest cash bonusfor 1987 _ $2.8 million _ in addition to $929,934 in salary andbenefits, Ford disclosed.   Ford said it awarded $247.9 million in cash bonuses to 5,166executives, or an average of nearly $48,000 each. Ford willdistribute half of each bonus Friday and half in January unless anexecutive has the payments deferred.   In 1986, Ford awarded 5,528 executives $164.3 million in bonuses.   Petersen said that while the increase in bonuses appeared to belarge, the nation's second-largest automaker believed they werewarranted by the company's record profits in 1987.   But in a written statement, United Auto Workers union PresidentOwen Bieber and Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who directs theunion's Ford department, said the bonuses ``send the wrong messageto workers and consumers.''   ``When it comes to executive compensation, Ford's behavior showsthe same greedy, shortsighted instincts that almost all Americancorporations exhibit,'' they stated.   ``We just don't believe that Mr. Petersen or anyone else isworth over 100 times as much as a UAW production worker is worth toFord.''   Ford earned a company record $4.6 billion last year, boostingits 1986 earnings by 41 percent and out-performing industry-leaderGeneral Motors Corp. for the second consecutive year.   Last month, Ford distributed profit-sharing checks amounting toa record $636 million to more than 156,000 hourly and salariedworkers in the United States, making for an average check of justmore than $4,000 each.   GM announced Feb. 9 that although its profits rose 20.6 percentto $3.56 billion in 1987, it earned too little on its U.S.automaking business to trigger profit-sharing payments to workers.   But GM said it would give stock valued at $184.6 million toabout 5,000 of its top executives.   Chrysler Corp., the nation's third-largest car maker, isexpected to issue its proxy statement next week. Chrysler, whichdoes not have a profit-sharing plan in its union contract, posted a7.1 percent decline in its 1987 profit, to $1.29 billion.   Petersen, Poling and 42 other Ford executives received cashbonuses totaling $29.9 million for 1987 in addition to salaries andbenefits amounting to $12.9 million. That compares with 45 topexecutives receiving $19.5 million in bonuses and $11.3 million insalaries and benefits in 1986.   In 1986, Petersen received a $1.3 million cash bonus in additionto $660,772 in salary and benefits. Poling got a $1.1 million bonusand earned $531,327 in salary and benefits.   The proxy statement was issued in advance of Ford's May 12annual meeting in Detroit.</TEXT></DOC>
