Todd (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AIG FREST </CO><IN> TNM RFD </IN><DATELINE> HONG KONG  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American International Group Inc., a big U.S. insurance holding company, has formed a Hong Kong-based venture to introduce half a dozen American fast-food franchises throughout Asia.    The move reflects continuing efforts of U.S. institutional money managers to diversify away from the stock and bond markets since last year's crash. The AIG effort also is the first time an American institutional investor has moved into the overseas franchise market -- fast-growing but not consistently successful for U.S. players.    The AIG majority-owned company, Franchise Investment Corp. Asia, has secured agreements to represent a group of U.S. franchisers successful in their domestic market niches. Lee Montgomery, the unit's Hong Kong-based executive director, identified only Round Table Pizza, the biggest pizza franchise on the American West Coast. Round Table already has separate franchise operations in Taiwan and Japan. He declined to specify others, saying their names hadn't been registered as trademarks yet in Asia.    Included are well-known frozen-yogurt and roast-beef sandwich chains, as well as a lesser-known company that sells low-cholesterol chicken and Mexican food.    In the Asian nations it wants to enter, Franchise Investment seeks co-investors with a track record in franchise management. Mr. Montgomery said the AIG unit will manage the investment side, and local partners will operate the restaurants.    He said the total amount eventually committed is &quot;unlimited,&quot; but added that it probably would exceed $100 million. &quot;If it's successful as it goes along,&quot; he said, &quot;we'll commit what's necessary.&quot;    The investment represents a modest commitment for AIG, a New York-based international insurer with insurance and trading interests throughout the region. In the third quarter, AIG's profit rose 4.7% to $273.9 million from $261.6 million a year earlier as revenue climbed 21% to $3.36 billion from $2.78 billion.    The AIG venture is looking for partners in nearly every country in the Asia-Pacific region, if to a lesser extent in Japan, where many of the franchises are now represented. Partners are being sought even in Papua-New Guinea, Guam and Fiji. Mr. Montgomery said the company is talking with potential partners in Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. &quot;No one has signed on yet. Discussions are under way,&quot; he said.    Herman Van Velzer, vice president at the AIG unit, said the company's formation is consistent with the perception among American institutional investors of &quot;a compelling need to diversify.&quot;    Since last year's crash, big U.S. institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds have moved part of their portfolios into investment vehicles they once avoided. Real estate, limited partnerships, commodities pools and venture-capital funds have drawn interest.    Franchising is one of the latest avenues. The first limited partnership aimed at funneling U.S. institutional money into franchises -- the $35 million, Denver-based Walden Banking Partners Ltd. -- was formed last month. International licensing of U.S. franchise concerns is fast-growing. According to the Washington-based International Franchise Association, the number of overseas outlets grew 250% in the past 10 years and the trend is continuing. </TEXT></DOC>
