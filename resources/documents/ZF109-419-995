Earlier this year this companywas absorbed by Hong Kong Telecom and became Hong Kong Telecom International.andM;In 1970 the first local satellite ground station was commissioned and rapidlyexpanded, but submarine cable remained important and in 1977 the OLUHO cablelinking Osaka in Japan, Luzon in the Philippines and Hong Kong was broughtinto service.andP;  The development of optical fibre technology led to arevolution in local communications during the '80s, with more than 50 percentof telephone lines being converted to digital optical operation by the end ofthe decade.andP;  By 1991, every telephone line in Hong Kong will be digital.andM;The explosion in use of telecommunications revealed various shortcomings inexisting systems.andP;  The restricted bandwidth and the delay inherent insatellite communications could drastically slow down or degradetransmissions.andM;The GDH overcomes these and other difficulties.andP;  The delay is eliminated bythe terrestrial nature of the link, since it obviates the signal's journeyout into space and back, while the vastly improved bandwidth available withfibre means it is now possible to send highly detailed designs and drawingsin full colour around the world in microseconds, instead of despatching themon a journey of hours or days by courier.andM;But not all the benefit will go to corporate users.andP;  Hong Kong has one of thehighest international call rates in the world.andP;  On average, Americans makethree international calls per year.andP;  The figure for Hong Kong is 20 calls inthe same period, and growing.andP;  The new cable link will make it even easier totalk to and hear Aunty Flo in Yonkers.andM;(Norman Wingrove/19900711)</TEXT></DOC>
