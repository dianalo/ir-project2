Voicedata integration.andP;  One pair of wires will carry andswitch voice, data, fax, image and video with equal grace.andM;If the technologies come together, the reasoning went, so will theirmanagement and their purchasing.andP;  One guy will buy all.andP;  Therefore, one guy(IBM) must provide all.andM;In fact, the technologies came together.andP;  It was called T-1.andM;But the managements never came together.andP;  The data and voice disciplines aredifferent.andP;  One deals with computer companies.andP;  One deals with telephonecompanies.andP;  They're different.andP;  Oh so different !andP;  The 1990s came along.andP;  Andwith them nine billion 800 IN-WATS calls a year.andP;  We Americans are calling800 fines to buy things, to check where our things are, to figure how toinstall our things, to find where to send our broken things.andM;For most companies, the phone has become their most importantcustomer-pleasing tool.andP;  Saving telecom money - for example by &quot;integrating&quot;voice and data - now takes second place to spending money to pleasecustomers.andM;Studies show companies who spend more on the phone have happier customers.andO;just as years ago, studies showed that companies spending more on dataprocessing grew faster than their more frugal brothers.andM;IBM now discovers that booming 800 IN-WAIN calls mean booming computer sales.andO;IBM's fastest-growing business today helps people sitting before screensanswering inbound 800 calls from customers.andM;1990s: IBM reinterprets  integration.&quot; Now it means that a phone call and ascreen-fill of information about that phone call arrive simultaneously at thephone answerer's desk:andM;&quot;Good afternoon, Mr Smith.andP;  How are you enjoying the hydraulic presses wesent you last week?andM;You'd like to speak with the technical expert on the presses? Allow me totransfer you (and my screen of information about you and your presses) to JoeSchroggs, our head technician.&quot;andM;&quot;Integration&quot; is moving phone calls and customer information simultaneouslyand with equal ease.andM;&quot;Isn't it sad?&quot; I said to IBM, Just as you figured out what you need ROLMfor, you're now selling it?&quot;andM;&quot;Oh no,&quot; my IBM man answered.andP;  &quot;Now we know what integration is.andP;  Owning ROLMis irrelevant.andP;  ROLM is Northern Telecom, Siemens, ATandamp;T and Mitel.andP;  ROLM issimply another switch to control on the path to pleasing the customer.andM;And that's why we have CallPath, the hottest thing at ICA.&quot;andM;My IBM man is right.andP;  The more switches CallPath can control, the more usefulIBM's customer-pleasing concept becomes.andP;  And right now, customer-pleasing isabout the most important thing going in the telephone business.andP;  It changesour ideas of what a telephone switch is.andP;  It is a customer pleasing device,pure and simple.andP;  But it's halfway useless unless it's combined withreal-time customer database information.andM;1995: 10,000 florists in the US own Meridian Norstars.andP;  A satellite messagefrom FTD central beams down one night.andP;  That next morning, the screens onNorstar phones show a drawing, a description and pricing of the day's bouquetspecial.andP;  The calls come in.andP;  &quot;Let me tell you today's special.andP;  &quot; The scriptis on the Norstar screen.andP;  Punch the orders in on the touch-sensitive Norstarscreen.andP;  Just like they do at the local McDonalds.andP;  Except the flowers aredelivered 2,500 miles away.andP;  Telecom, networking, databases, higher sales andhappier customers.andM;The scene repeats at other businesses throughout the day.andM;Automatic Number Identification (ANI) helps identify the callers.andP;  Voiceprocessing and prompting identifies others.andP;  The key: The telephone call isalways associated with a &quot;face&quot; a view into a computer database of buyinghabits.&quot;andM;Skip back 20 years: I meet a top IBM marketer.andP;  I ask him why IBM is sosuccessful selling so many computers? For IBM had once said the world'scomputing needs could be met with a handful of machines !andP;  He explained: Eachyear IBM educated&quot; 100,000 VIP businessmen.andP;  IBM had them for a day.andP;  How toeducate them? There were two alternatives.andP;  Teach them how computers worked.andO;Or what computers could do.andM;If you were IBM which would you opt for? How computers worked? Or whatcomputers could do?andM;If you opted for &quot;What they could do,&quot;  you'd be wrong.andP;  If you taught peoplewhat computers could do, that's all they'd think computers could ever do.andM;If you taught executives &quot;How computers worked,&quot; you'd never stop theexecutives.andP;  Their brains would think of millions of problems they couldsolve with this wondrous new tool called a computer.andM;IBM reasoned - and they were right - that no matter how creative they (IBM)could be, their creativity would never match the creativity of theircustomers.andP;  There were more customers.andP;  And they were more motivated.andP;  And itwas their problems !andP;  IBM didn't think of Lotus.andP;  Or dBASE.andP;  Or WordPerfect.andO;Or voice processing.andP;  Or auto attendants.andP;  Or call accounting.andP;  Or mostthings you can now do with an IBM computer.andM;Now switch to the telephone industry.andP;  The phone instrument is the mostubiquitous computer terminal in the world.andP;  The phone switch is a computer.andO;What can you do with them? Just what they (the manufacturers) ten you.andP;  Nomore.andP;  No less.andM;Virtually every time I've suggested something I'd like to do withTELECONNECT's PBX, they tell me, That's only you.andP;  You're a nut.andP;  No one elsewould want it.&quot; And I admit, I've not checked to see if 25,000 others wouldalso like it.andP;  They tell me if that were &quot;in demand,&quot; the switch makers wouldknow of it and have it in their next software release.andM;But they never do.andP;  Which is one reason TELECONNECT's local area network(LAN) now has lots of telephony features - like directories and messaging,etc.andP;  I can program my LAN and make it do what I want it to do.andM;Maybe one day I'll be able to get into my PBX and also make it do what I wantit to do...andP;  Or maybe, I'll buy that software from someone else.andM;The Good News is the telephone switch is opening up, albeit slowly.andP;  (See ourPBX Roundup this month.) As it opens, a Golden Telecom Age dawns.andP;  Telephonesbecome like computers.andP;  Open.andP;  Free.andP;  Programmable.andP;  One day I'll slidesomeone else's board into my PBX bus.andM;I crave the excitement of young companies peddling crazy ideas I can do withour telephone switch.andP;  I crave the excitement of 60,000 frenetic, excitedpeople.andP;  Assembling their next telecom opportunity.andP;  Searching for their nextminion.andP;  I rue the utter boredom of ICA with its 7,000 vendors and 1,200users.andM;I need your help.andP;  You must hammer on the telephone manufacturers.andP;  Thisrevolutionary&quot; concept of opening their phones is not going to erode theirmargins.andP;  (There are some left to erode?) And that they can trust outsidersto write software for their machines.andP;  After all, DEC, Hewlett Packard,Apple, IBM and ATandamp;T all trust outsiders to write software for theircomputers.andM;Here are some objections I've gotten from manufacturers and responses.andP;  Backme up, please.andM;As to what telephones may look like in 10 years? I don't have that crystalball.andP;  All I do know is that our end-customers will be a lot happier.andP;  Andhappier customers buy a lot more.andM;Locked UpandM;Bicyclists have long considered Kryptonite locks to be the very best.andP;  Foryears Kryptonite insured any bike secured with the lock theft (up to acertain dollar amount).andP;  They still have the guarantee - but it is not validin New york City! There are simply too many bicycle thefts there  actuallyhere, for us).andM;Now we hear (in Newsweek) that anti-abortion protesters are using KryptoniteandM;locks  to  attach themselves to clinics, cars and other things to keep policefrom breaking uP their protests.andM;Kryptonite has advised the police departments that have asked that the bestway to bust the lock is to have a locksmith drill out the cylinders or usejaws of Life cutters (used to free auto wreck victims).andP;  Yeesh! Maybe theycan get a few NYC bicycle thieves to help them out.andM;The Big BoxandM;The Walk-Through Computer which opened at Boston's Computer Museum this Juneis big.andP;  Really big.andM;* It is two stories tall.andM;* Its keyboard keys are one foot across.andM;* It has disks that are six feet wide.andM;* It holds the world's biggest microchip - seven and a half feet square.andM;* It has a trackball  like a mouse that stays still) that is 10 feet by sevenfeet.andM;* It took three years to complete.andM;* It took two months just to create the motherboard.andM;* It cost  1.2 Tnillion dollars to build.andM;* Museum visitors can use an actual computer program using the computer'strackball, keyboard and screen.andM;* An Apple Macintosh actually does the computing for the program.andM;* The exhibit's special effects are controlled by a DEC computer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
