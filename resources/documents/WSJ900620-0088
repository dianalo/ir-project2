Such a move by the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics andsemiconductor company would greatly expand cellular telephonecoverage, which currently excludes rural areas withoutground-based switching systems.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're talking about a major change in the technology,&quot;said John Pemberton, a mobile communications analyst atGartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm.   Mr. Pemberton said he believes Motorola plans a &quot;hybrid&quot;system that would use both the ground-based system and whathe calls the &quot;sky system.&quot; As the user left an area coveredby the ground system, the satellite system would take over.   A Motorola spokesman said the company plans to announceTuesday a &quot;global communications system.&quot; He wouldn'telaborate, except to say that the announcement will be madeat New York's Hayden Planetarium.   Space News, a trade publication in Springfield, Va.,reported in its June 4-10 edition that industry officialstold it that Motorola &quot;intends to launch a constellation ofdozens of small satellites that would expand vastly itsability to provide continuous mobile telephone service&quot; inthe U.S. and abroad.   Mr. Pemberton of Gartner Group said he expects Motorola toeventually launch as many as 60 to 70 small satellites over anumber of years beginning as early as 1992, at a potentialcost of $1 billion. He said 15 to 22 satellites would beenough to get full coverage of the U.S., and additional onescould be used to expand capacity.   The Motorola spokesman said some of the information in theSpace News story was incorrect. He also said numbersdescribing the size of the communications system have beenwrong, but wouldn't elaborate further.   Besides catapulting Motorola into a business dominated byphone companies, a move into satellite transmission ofcellular calls could lead to new equipment sales forMotorola. Blanketing the U.S. or other nations with coveragewould open markets not currently served by cellular systems.   Motorola already is the world's biggest supplier ofcellular phone systems and mobile and portable phones. Itcites analysts' predictions that the world cellular marketwill jump to 100 million subscribers by the year 2000 fromabout 7 million last year.   Thomas Kurlak, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch andamp;Co., says Motorola now derives 55% of its operating incomefrom its cellular businesses. Mr. Kurlak said a move byMotorola into satellite communications could make it &quot;a new,massive provider&quot; of telephone service over the next 10 to 20years.   Analysts said Motorola could seek partners to help financesuch an effort. Because they could otherwise lose business toa satellite system, analysts said the &quot;Baby Bell&quot; regionalphone companies would be ideal candidates for such apartnership.   Dow Jones Professional Investors Report said yesterdaythat speculation of a possible launch services contract fromMotorola was behind recent surge in the stock of OrbitalSciences Corp., It said Orbital wouldn't comment.</TEXT></DOC>
