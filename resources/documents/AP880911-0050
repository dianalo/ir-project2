As lawmakers resume amending their all-inclusive drug fightingbill on Wednesday, they also must decide whether to retain aseven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers, along with anoptional police background check.   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., will try to eliminate the guncontrol language from the 375-page bill that would add some $2billion to the nation's $3.9 billion war on drugs.   His proposed substitute would establish a system for gun sellersto run a check by phone or other means, to determine if a purchaseris a convicted felon.   Congress also is wrestling with a number of other domestic andforeign issues this week: abortion, insider trading, job leave,sanctions against South Africa, child care, welfare reform andtextile import curbs.   The House drug bill likely will receive a final vote Thursday orFriday. Last week, those favoring the harshest possible penalties,won amendment battles that attached provisions for a federal deathpenalty, denial of government benefits for twice convicted drugusers, and court admission of evidence seized illegally by policeacting in ``good faith.''   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh, interviewed Sunday onNBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said he supports the change inevidence rules because ``time and again, because of some technicalshortcoming _ the failure to dot an `i' or cross a `t,' animportant drug kingpin or other criminal can be turned loose.''   He said he also supports provisions affecting governmentbenefits, but opposes a change that would authorize the CIA toconduct covert operations against drug operations overseas.   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Narcotics, said on the same show the death penalty wasmorally wrong and would not deter ``bums that are dealing indrugs'' who attach little value to human life.   He said it also would make it more difficult to obtainextraditions of drug suspects from countries opposed to the deathpenalty.   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, expressing his personal opinion,told reporter last week he supports the handgun waiting period.   ``I can't see that it's an infringement on the rights of anylaw-abiding citizen to have a simple waiting period,'' he said.   ``If you've got to have a gun right this minute, you've got tohave some violent intent. A responsible person wouldn't mindwaiting seven days.''   The National Rifle Association has told lawmakers that criminalswould obtain guns regardless of the waiting period, and that onlylaw-abiding citizens would suffer from the delay.   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., will propose civil penalties of upto $10,000 per violation against those found to be in possession ofsmall ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and othercontrolled substances.   Proof of guilt for a civil offense only requires ``clear andconvincing evidence,'' while a criminal conviction demands proof ofguilt ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''   Conflicting amendments will be offered that could affect thedrivers' licenses of anyone convicted of drug offenses, includingpossession.   Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., would provide up to $125million over three years to states with drug enforcement programsthat include license suspension or revocation for convicted drugoffenders.   McCollum will counter with a plan to require withholding aportion of U.S. highway money from states failing to enactsuspension or revocation provisions.   The Senate must decide what to do with a $140 billion socialprograms spending bill that has but one area of disagreementbetween the two houses _ abortion.   Senators previously passed the legislation with an expansion ofthe Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incestvictims. The House last Friday refused to accept that provision ofthe Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services spending bill.   The Senate is expected to give final approval and send the Housea bill that would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at1987 levels and allow 1 percent annual growth thereafter. It wouldbar increases in non-rubber footwear import levels.   Proponents say the measure, which President Reagan is expectedto veto, would save jobs in the import-ravaged textile and apparelindustries. Critics contend the industry is no longer suffering.   In the House, passage is expected for an insider trading measurewhich, for the first time, would make it possible for securitiesfirms to be fined for violations committed by their employees. Italso would increase prison terms and fines.   Some key measures won't reach the House floor this week.Supporters of a bill to guarantee unpaid, job-protected leave fornew parents have postponed a planned vote this week as theycontinue to negotiate compromises.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled a Wednesdayvote on House-passed legislation to impose harsh new sanctions onSouth Africa, including a cut off of virtually all U.S. investmentin the country because of its apartheid policy.</TEXT></DOC>
