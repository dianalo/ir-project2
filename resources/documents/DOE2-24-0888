<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0888 </DOCNO><TEXT>It is shown within the random-phase approximation that through exchangingthe amplitude fluctuations, an attractive interaction is induced betweenthe holes doped in the commensurate spin-density-wave background. Withoutincluding the polaronic effects, such an effective interaction is shownto lead to a d-wave superconducting condensation of the doped holes,instead of the s-wave pairing concluded by Schrieffer, Wen, and Zhang[Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 944 (1988)] in a similar approach. The superconductingorder parameter as a function of the doping concentration has been calculatedalso.</TEXT></DOC>
