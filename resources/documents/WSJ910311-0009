An advisory committee to the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration recommended that the agency approve Merck'sprescription drug Zocor based on a review of safety andeffectiveness studies conducted by the company. Zocor, alsoknown by the generic name simvastatin, is chemically similarto Merck's popular cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor, whichhas been available since 1987 and generated about $760million in world-wide sales last year.</LP><TEXT>   Zocor has been available outside the U.S. since 1988, andMerck sells it now in about 20 countries. The drug had salesof about $290 million in 1990, according to Ronald Nordmann,an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. Research indicates thatMevacor and Zocor are strikingly similar; both can reduceblood-cholesterol levels about 21% to 33%. A Merck spokesmansaid, however, that many patients may need only take oneZocor pill daily, while patients often must take two to fourMevacor tablets a day.   Analysts believe Merck will expand the use ofcholesterol-lowering medicines by marketing two separateproducts to doctors. Mevacor and Zocor are part of arelatively new class of medicines that includes another drug,Pravachol, that was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.Pravachol also received a positive recommendation from an FDAadvisory committee last year. Both Zocor and Pravachol areexpected to be approved by the FDA later this year.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Merckclosed at $105.625, up $1.375.   Separately, Merck said it filed a shelf registration withthe Securities and Exchange Commission under which it couldissue up to $500 million in debt securities. Proceeds fromthe sale of the securities would be used for generalcorporate purposes, including the reduction of short-termdebt. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. assigned its preliminarytriple-A rating to Merck's shelf registration. It alsoaffirmed the company's triple-A senior debt and A-1-pluscommercial paper ratings. About $380 million in long-termdebt is affected.</TEXT></DOC>
