Consider Campeau Corp. The big Toronto-based retailer, scrapingto make payments on a mountain of borrowed money, has been forced toput its crown jewel, the Bloomingdale's chain, on the block.   Then there's Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven conveniencestore chain, purveyor of items ranging from milk to magazines toSlurpees slush-ice drinks.   Revenue projections it issued when the founding family took theDallas company private two years ago soured, and the price of $1.5billion in Southland junk bonds plunged in recent weeks as investorsfretted about the company's ability to pay its debt.   Another recent victim of excessive borrowing is ResortsInternational Inc., the hotel-casino company controlled byentertainer-turned-investor Merv Griffin. Resorts late last monthstopped paying interest to bondholders after reporting asecond-quarter loss and lower revenues.   The chief culprit in all three cases was overestimatedprojections of what is known as cash flow, composed of profit plusbookkeeping charges such as depreciation. Many financial analystsregard cash flow as the most important measurement of a company'shealth.   The dealmakers expected the well-known retail operations ofCampeau and Southland and the cash-cow casinos of Resorts to churnout enough money to keep up with huge debt-service payments.   It didn't work out that way.   The Campeau, Southland and Resorts transactions were based on``outrageously optimistic assumptions,'' said Roger E. Brinner,chief economist at the economic consulting firm DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.   ``Just like Reagan and Congress they assumed growth would solveall problems,'' he said. ``Maybe these people are just guilty of aprivate-sector version of Reaganomics.''   A slump in the apparel industry hurt Campeau, which sold billionsof dollars worth of junk bonds as it laid out more than $12 billionto buy Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores over the pastfew years. Some analysts believe Campeau paid too much for thechains.   At Southland, 7-Eleven sales didn't meet expectations after the$4.9 billion leveraged buyout, despite a belief that conveniencestores are steady cash generators.   ``The profit margins are thin, and slight (revenue) deviationsmean big hits to the bottom line,'' said Carol Palmer, an industryanalyst at the Chicago investment firm Duff andamp; Phelps Inc.   As for Griffin, he told bondholders in a recent letter thatResorts' cash flow was lower than expected, ``in part because weunderestimated the time and capital expenditures it would take toturn around the company's operations to generate increased profits.''   Griffin sold $325 million in notes to buy Resorts from developerDonald J. Trump last year, a debt that was piled on top of existingResorts bonds totaling about $600 million.   Resorts faces payments of more than $130 million this year ininterest and principal, but its operations are not likely togenerate that much, analysts say. In 1988, the company's cash flowwas only $60.2 million. Resorts plans to release a restructuringplan to its debtholders soon.   The troubles at these three companies once again highlight thehuge amount of debt involved in corporate restructurings andtakeovers. Some say they may lead to more caution by the banks andjunk-bond financiers that bankroll these deals.   ``People are becoming conditioned to these high debt levels,''said Ms. Palmer. However, she said, if one of the high-profile,highly leveraged deals of recent years goes bad, ``I think theconfidence would be shaken very badly.''   Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in LosAngeles, said a consumer spending slowdown is causing the cashcrunches at these and other consumer-industry companies.   Consumer spending was strong a few years ago when these takeoversand buyouts were put together, Jordan said. But since then it haslagged, due partly to the 1986 federal tax revisions and concernabout an economic slowdown. Such a reversal was inevitable, he said.   ``You can't tell that to the kind of people that put these dealstogether. They simply extrapolate the recent past forever,'' he said.   The problems at these highly leveraged companies, which developeddespite a reasonably strong economy, are a sign of things to come,said Brinner and Jordan.   ``It is a tip of an iceberg, but I don't think it's about to sinkour economy,'' Brinner said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, Sept. 18</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
