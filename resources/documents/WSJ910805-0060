Did Saddam Hussein fire a Stealth Scud at CapitolHill that no one noticed?   OK, we gest, but a fit of common sense has nonethelessgripped the world's greatest deliberative body. The bill,crafted by Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner,revives valuable defense programs that only a year ago seemeddoomed. The lessons of the Gulf War seem to have persuaded atleast one branch of Congress that the world remains adangerous place.</LP><TEXT>   We've long felt the B-2 and missile defenses exploitedAmerica's comparative advantage in high-technology. Withweapons proliferating like rabbits, the U.S. can onlymaintain military pre-eminence by investing in advancedsystems of the sort that routed Baghdad. If the U.S. is goingto cut defense spending by 25% by 1995, to the lowest levelsince 1939, then we ought to get the biggest bang for thebuck.   The Senate bill buys four more B-2s in Fiscal Year 1992,with the eventual goal of buying the 75 requested by the AirForce. The 57-42 vote, three more favorable votes than a yearago, owes something to the performance of the B-2's cousin,the F-117 stealth fighter, in the Gulf War. Representing only2.5% of the planes, the F-117 attacked 31% of the targets inthe Gulf War's first 24 hours.   This year, too, the Air Force finally got around to makingthe B-2's case as a non-nuclear bomber. A plane that can fly10,000 miles on a single refueling and carry 80 weapons at atime is perfect for deterring the Saddam-like tyrants of thepost-Cold War era. The B-2's nuclear mission -- hunting downSoviet mobile missiles after Armageddon -- never did makemuch sense to us.   Maybe even the Air Force is beginning to understand howabsurd its faith in mutual assured destruction (MAD) hasbeen. MAD is the wacky theory that we are all perfectly safeif everyone can blow everyone else up with nuclear weapons.Armed with non-nuclear cruise missiles, the B-2 can deliverthe more accurate, less destructive weapons that killcombatants but spare civilians. It can project U.S. poweraround the world without needing a base on foreign soil.   Speaking of MAD, it suffered a symbolic death with alandmark 60-39 Senate vote to deploy a limited anti-missiledefense for the first time by 1996. The Warner-Nunn MissileDefense Act of 1991 also urges President Bush to renegotiatethe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, with a goal ofdeploying a nation-wide defense.   The Gulf War's Patriots have miraculously changed minds.Alabama Democrat Howell Heflin, who only last year voted tocripple defenses, said last week that, &quot;I know in my heart Iwould rather have America face her future with a policy ofdefense rather than one of mutually assured destruction.&quot;   Tim Wirth, the Colorado liberal, made the sensible pointthat &quot;the fact that we could retaliate is not relevant whenwe are dealing with an irrational or crazy individual.&quot;Another convert from MAD.   Senator Nunn noted that &quot;people are saying the SovietUnion is no threat these days, at least not in the sense ofan accidental launch.&quot; Sorry, Mr. Nunn said, quoting severalSoviet sources about their concern over control of nuclearweapons amid the turmoil of the ongoing breakup of theLeninist empire.   Try as he might, however, Mr. Nunn couldn't persuadesenators mentioned as likely Democratic presidentialcandidates. Tom Harkin, Al Gore, Jay Rockefeller and BillBradley all voted the straight MAD line. We can't wait tohear how they explain in a presidential debate that Americansdon't need to be defended against the Scud missiles of thefuture.   The Senate vote sets up a House-Senate conference that inessence features Nunn-Bush against the House Democratic left.Wisconsin's Les Aspin, the House Armed Services chairman,took the advice of the legendary military strategist,California Representative Ron Dellums, and gutted bothmissile defenses and the B-2. He used that money to buytanks, reserve units, National Guard armories and other porkfor his Members.   Mr. Bush has promised a veto if the final bill doesn'tlook much like the Senate version, and we hope he standsfirm. The Gulf crisis and victory changed the politics ofdefense, and rebutted the critics of the 1980s who saidhigh-tech weapons would never work. Now's the time to sendthe critics running like the Iraqi army.</TEXT></DOC>
