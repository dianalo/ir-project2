Each knife section has a cutting edge. In orderto achieve less wear of the stepped knife with an equally good cut andlow cutting force, it is proposed that the stepped knife should havetwo cutting edges, which are separated by a step. This forms two knifesections above one another. The lower knife section has its cutting edgeopposite the cutting edge of the upper knife section and back by theheight of the step, which corresponds to at least the width of the compressedfuel element bundle. The upper cutting edge is higher or longer thanthe lower cutting edge. Due to this configuration, the two knife sectionsseparated by a step do not act at the same time, but in sequence.</TEXT></DOC>
