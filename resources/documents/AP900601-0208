BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If an employee buyout can solve an airline's woes,striking Greyhound drivers think the same strategy could rescue theonly nationwide bus company from the brink of bankruptcy.   A financial advisor hired by the drivers has asked to meet withGreyhound Lines Inc. to discuss a possible employee buyout.   The advisor, Brian Freeman, isn't new to the idea. He is advisingUAL Corp. employees on their effort to complete a proposed $4.54billion buyout of the parent of United Airlines.   In a letter dated May 29 to Greyhound management and creditors,Freeman said he believed ``100 percent employee ownership of alltransportation operating and related assets, together with asignificant creditor restructuring'' is the best solution to thecompany's troubles.   Freeman said Thursday a price for a Greyhound buyout had not beendetermined and no financing had been arranged, although he saidmoney ``should be available.''   He said the union also is willing to discuss other alternatives.   ``Within the short-term, I intend to make a specific proposal,and begin to press aggressively toward a resolution,'' Freeman wroteon behalf of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.   ``Please advise me immediately whether you wish to explore mutualproblem solving. Otherwise I will proceed on my own,'' Freemanwrote. ``I intend to place my client in a position so that, eithercooperatively or independently, it can make a specific proposal andpress forward within the next several weeks.''   Greyhound's initial response wasn't positive.   ``We are surprised the group that has brought about the company'scurrent financial crisis through an unprecedented wave of violencenow proposes to profit from its own criminal activity by buying thecompany,'' said executive vice president P. Anthony Lannie.   Greyhound has reported more than two dozen incidents of violencesince its drivers went on strike on March 2.   The company has been operating reduced schedules since the strikebegan, using newly hired drivers and about 500 union members whocrossed picket lines.   Although the company claims the strike is ``irrelevant'' becauseit has enough drivers to operate, the strike has drained its cashand left it in danger of having to file for bankruptcy protection.   Greyhound already has missed more than $14 million in interestand lease payments since the end of April and faces an additional$2.5 million payment on Friday.   Unless those payments are met soon, creditors could force thecompany into involuntary bankruptcy, although Greyhound likely wouldfile for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federalbankruptcy laws before that happened.   The company's debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout threeyears ago led by Chairman Fred G. Currey that took the companyprivate.   Currey and other investors paid $270 million for the busoperations of Greyhound Corp., since renamed Greyhound Dial Corp. Afew months they paid an additional $80 million for Dallas-basedTrailways Lines Inc., then the nation's largest operator ofTrailways buses.   Greyhound has proposed to repurchase most of its $225 million injunk bond debt at a steep discount to enable the company to avoidbankruptcy.   The repurchase is tied to Greyhound obtaining as much as $150million in new financing, however, a task some analysts doubt can beaccomplished in light of Greyhound's labor troubles and the state ofthe financial markets.   Further clouding Greyhound's future is a finding by the NationalLabor Relations Board that the company engaged in unfair laborpractices by implementing its contract proposal immediately afterthe strike began.   An administrative law judge will hear arguments in the case inMilwaukee on Sept. 17, beginning a process that could take years toend, and result in the bus company being forced to pay about $10million a month in back wages.   Greyhound says it is confident it will win once the case gets incourt.</TEXT></DOC>
