The state Supreme Court decided this week that Thomas,Mann andamp; Gossett, a defunct Chattanooga law firm, must payDonald H. Spiegel his share of profits and other income.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling marks the third time a state supreme court hashad to decide on what is becoming an increasingly importantissue to law firms as growing numbers of lawyers move fromfirm to firm. The ruling, along with those by the high courtsof New York and Iowa, could force many law firms to redraftpartnership and employment agreements that include provisionsdesigned to prevent lawyers from establishing competingpractices.   At issue in the case was a provision in Thomas Mann'semployment agreement barring employees who leave the law firmand continue to practice law from collecting any portion oftheir &quot;deferred compensation&quot; for services rendered beforetheir withdrawal.   Mr. Spiegel, now in private practice in Chattanooga, leftthe firm in 1986 to take a job as an in-house counsel at alocal real estate company. He filed the suit after ThomasMann turned down his request for payment. Both the trialcourt and appeals court ruled in favor of the law firm.   But the high court overturned the lower court decisionsand ruled that the agreement wasn't enforceable. The courtwrote that the provision violated the state's rules ofprofessional conduct because it created a financialdisincentive to leave the firm, thus unfairly restricting Mr.Spiegel's right to practice law and the public's right tohave access to any counsel.   Thomas O. Helton, a Chattanooga lawyer representing thelaw firm, said that Mr. Spiegel understood the terms of theagreement and had been a party to it for five years. And hesaid that the ruling allows Mr. Spiegel to &quot;double dip&quot; bybenefiting from the income he receives from his new positionwhile still collecting profits from his former law firm.   James C. Lee, the Chattanooga lawyer representing Mr.Spiegel, said he could not comment on the decision becausethe litigation is pending. A trial court must still determinehow much Mr. Spiegel is owed and from whom he can collect nowthat the firm has disbanded.   Stephen Gillers, a professor of ethics at New YorkUniversity's law school who represented a law firm in asimilar case, said that despite the rulings, law firms maystill be able to keep departing lawyers from collecting anyprofits. He said that an appeals court in New York ruledearlier this year that an agreement is valid as long as alllawyers who leave the firm receive the same treatmentregardless of the circumstances of their departure.   ---   PRIVACY OF CORDLESS PHONE conversations isn't protected inConnecticut.   Superior Court Judge Richard O'Connell of Hartford, Conn.,issued the ruling this week, denying a motion to throw out asevidence the recorded conversations of two defendantsindicted on drug charges. Judge O'Connell said the state'sconstitution and wiretap laws don't prohibit the police fromeavesdropping on cordless phone conversations.   Assistant State's Attorney Bernadette Conway, who arguedthat the recorded conversations should be admitted asevidence, said five states and three federal appeals courtshave ruled that the federal and state laws againstunauthorized wiretapping don't apply to cordless phones.   New York, Ms. Conway said, is the exception. A stateappellate court in Manhattan ruled last year that New York'seavesdropping law prohibits the government from intentionallylistening in on such conversations.   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear anappeal of a lower court's ruling that citizens have no rightto expect that their conversations on cordless phones will beprivate.   In the Connecticut case, a couple, William and MaryMcVeigh of Cromwell, were arrested last year after policerecorded them allegedly negotiating deals to sell cocaine.The McVeighs' attorney, Brian M. O'Connell, couldn't bereached for comment.   ---   JUDGE DECLINES to apply New York state labor law toexecutive pay.   A federal judge refused to modify an arbitration award inthe case of William Nicoletti. Mr. Nicoletti took his formeremployer, E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., to arbitration seeking $1million in unpaid 1987 bonuses, plus attorney's fees.Arbitrators last December awarded $200,000 to Mr. Nicoletti,a former Hutton senior vice president, but gave him nothingfor attorney's fees. Mr. Nicoletti claimed that New Yorklabor law required that he also be awarded attorney's fees inthe case because it involved a wage dispute.   Hutton, which was acquired by American Express Co. in1988, argued that the state law didn't apply to Mr. Nicolettibecause he was a high-ranking executive, and because the lawapplies to wages rather than bonuses.   U.S. Judge Louis Stanton, in district court in Manhattan,upheld the arbitration award, finding that New York statecourts have reached conflicting conclusions on whether thelaw applies to executives. New York state's highest courthasn't ever ruled on the issue, Judge Stanton said. He saidthe award couldn't be modified unless arbitrators clearlyacted in disregard of the state law.   ---   LINE-ITEM VETO in Wisconsin is upheld by appeals court.   The federal appeals court in Chicago ruled that theallocation of powers between the branches of state governmentmust be left to politics -- not the federal judiciary.   &quot;The Constitution does not prescribe the balance of powersamong the branches of state government,&quot; the Seventh CircuitU.S. Court of Appeals wrote.   The opinion affirmed the dismissal of a suit filed by twoWisconsin state legislators, who claimed that the governor'suse of the line-item veto violates the constitutionalguarantee of republican government. Though many states allowline-item vetoes of some kind, Wisconsin is unique in that itallows the governor not only to delete particularappropriations, or line items, but to delete phrases, wordsor digits in a bill -- thus, in effect, creating newlegislation.   The appellate court wrote that while Wisconsin's partialveto provision may be &quot;quirky,&quot; it isn't unconstitutional.   ---   ASPARAGUS SEEDS are at heart of dispute betweenuniversity, plant nursery.   In 1984, Rutgers University, of New Brunswick, N.J.,developed a new asparagus seed, dubbed the Jersey Giant, andlicensed the rights to reproduce and sell such seeds toNourse Farms Inc., a commercial nursery based in Whately,Mass.   But last year, the university discovered that Noursesomehow had allowed certain asparagus plants to becomecontaminated with less valuable strains, Rutgers says. Theuniversity has filed suit in Newark, N.J., claiming Noursefailed to maintain &quot;the integrity of the all-male characterof the asparagus hybrids&quot; by allowing a &quot;gross contaminationwith females.&quot; In the world of plants, males arepollen-producing, females are seed-producing.   The Jersey Giant is well known in the asparagus industryfor its high yields, its longevity and its superiorresistance to disease. The university claims it will take atleast two years to develop plants that can produce theall-male seeds. In its suit, the university is seeking thetermination of its contract with Nourse as well asunspecified damages.   Timothy Nourse, president of Nourse, said, &quot;We followedthe university's prescription for propagating the plants. . .. No one knows how the plants were contaminated.&quot;   Seed litigation is a fast-growing area of the law, largelybecause companies and universities are spending millions ofdollars yearly on biotechnology to create superior seedvarieties. Such varieties can dramatically increase the yieldper acre of vegetable crops and thus lower the cost ofvegetables for consumers.</TEXT></DOC>
