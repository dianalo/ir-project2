The guerrillas say they hold out little hope for an outrightmilitary victory.   They now talk of compromise in their campaign for an independentnation in the former Spanish colony in northwest Africa.Nevertheless, refugees remain keyed up for war in teeming Polisariocamps near the Algerian border where military training begins inprimary school and their slogan, ``The Entire Nation orMartyrdom,'' is everywhere.   They have been fighting for independence since 1976 when Spainrelinquished what then was the Spanish Sahara to joint Moroccan andMauritanian control.   Mauritania withdrew from the conflict in 1979 but Moroccomaintained the fight to hold its sovereignty over the territory,which is about the size of Colorado and is rich in phosphates andpossibly potash and iron ore.   Morocco began building its defensive wall of rock and sand in1980. Now completed, it is studded with concrete bunkers andU.S.-made sensors to detect infiltrators.   Almost all of Morocco's 100,000-man army is deployed along thewall, and guerrilla attacks behind it have virtually stopped.   Talking to visiting Western reporters in their camp at Akuadim,the guerrillas acknowledged that their ``liberation struggle'' hasdegenerated into a series of brief hit-and-run assaults on Moroccandefenses.   Bachir Sayed, a member of Polisario's seven-member ExecutiveCommittee, told the visitors: ``We don't want to defeat Morocco. Wewant to create a different situation ... that will bring(Morocco's) King Hassan II to the bargaining table.''   The guerrillas suffered a serious blow in May when Algeria,which has supported the Polisario Front, restored the diplomaticrelations it broke with Morocco over the issue.   Algerian officials now are hinting that Polisario might acceptsome kind of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, but theguerrillas have not acknowledged this is their intent.   Their main sanctuary now is in the stark, hilly desert aroundthe oasis of Tindouf inside Algeria.   The last Algerian checkpoint is three miles outside Tindouf.After that are camps for more than 100,000 refugees, followed alongthe road by miles of sand and shrub. The comes the ``battle zone''that stretches across Algeria's border into a no man's land leadingto the Moroccan wall.   Polisario has built hospitals and military schools in the zone,but the guerrillas say they intend to abandon the area wheneverthey ``return'' to the Moroccan-held phosphate mines and fishingports on the Atlantic coast.   When Spanish colonial rule ended, the territory's populationcomprised 80,000 tribal nomads roaming the desert with camels andgoats.   Polisario claims to have 16,000 heavily armed guerrillasoperating in the desert. Moroccan officers estimate guerrillastrength at fewer than 4,000.   Abba Deddi, a 23-year-old Polisario guerrilla said he could notimagine being anything in life but a soldier.   ``I want to remain a soldier even after the liberation, to fightagainst any new colonialist attempts,'' he said.   Out in the battle zone, a five-hour drive from Tindouf across afeatureless desert, a group of uniformed guerrillas played cards ona blanket, surrounded by empty artillery shells scattered on thesand. They were desert men, ranging from 18-year-old recruits toveterans of the Spanish Foreign Legion.   Artillery fire thudded in the distance as the Moroccansresponded to an attack on the wall by another Polisario unit.   The firing stopped abruptly.   ``That's all,'' said Omar Mohammed, the unit commander. ``Wegive them 10 minutes every two or three hours. It keeps them ontheir toes.''   Mohammed said his forces frequently cross the Moroccan wallafter disabling its radar system. The Moroccans claim not a singleattack has even reached the wall's outer defenses since last summer.   ``We have the advantage of knowing the desert and of speed,''Mohammed said. ``We dismantle the mines, cut the barbed wire, crossin, capture weapons, take prisoners and retreat.''   Omar Khatry, director of a Polisario military training school,said the wall ``built up Moroccan confidence and stopped ourattacks somewhat.'' He claimed, however, that new tactics enabledthe guerrillas to ``develop a full war of attrition'' but didn'telaborate.   In an effort to assure an ever-increasing Saharan population,Polisario war widows are required to remarry after a four-monthwaiting period.   ``I have to continue having children,'' said one recent bride,Ghaluha el-Salma, whose husband died in the Polisario ranks andleft her with a daughter.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs July 5</NOTE></DOC>
