Irwin, 408pages, $49.50) is not your standard textbook on the &quot;Historyof Economic Thought from Aristotle to Zeuthen.&quot; This is acollection of informal, personal, sometimes playful butalways solidly based, variations on themes suggested by nameslike Smith, Bentham, Marshall and Mill, or subjects likemercantilism or laissez-faire. Viner had read more of whathad been written about and around economics in the past 2,000years than anyone else, and he had read it carefully.Although at one point he calls scholarship &quot;drudgery,&quot; it isclear that he loved it. The writers he discusses were aliveto Viner, and he makes them alive to us.</LP><TEXT>   Mainly, I suppose, what makes their age-old andstill-continuing debates seem vivid is not only the wisdombut also the amount of folly, prejudice and self-interest inthem. Friedrich List, one of the fathers of protectionism,for example, said that countries of the torrid zone shouldnot engage in manufacturing because they had &quot;received noinvitation to that vocation from nature.&quot; St. Augustinederived his warning to Christians not to engage in trade froma mistaken translation of the Psalms.   Half the fun of reading this book is Viner's collection ofunfamiliar quotations. Here is my favorite, from Marshall:&quot;Patience in bearing other people's sufferings is as clear aduty as patience in bearing one's own, but it may be carriedtoo far.&quot; Viner also quotes Napoleon, who is on record sayingthat if an empire were made of granite the ideas ofeconomists, if listened to, would suffice to reduce it todust.   Beneath the fun courses a serious subject: economicfreedom, which has been the concern of most of thenontechnical writing about economics for centuries andremains so today. Viner understood as well as anyone ever hadthat economic freedom is the basic principle for theefficient organization of an economy. He accepted thefree-market case, in general, and not reluctantly but withenthusiasm, writing to a friend, &quot;I would not trade the freemarket system for any alternative I have ever heard of.&quot; Buthe did not find in the literature, and did not accept, theidea that being &quot;for freedom&quot; answered all the policyquestions that have to be answered.   He argues that the case for free, or unregulated, marketson the grounds of economic efficiency depended on theexistence of conditions that might not exist. He refersrepeatedly to Adam Smith's defense of particular liberties,rather than of liberty in general, and Smith's objections toparticular kinds of government interventions, especiallyintervention in foreign trade, rather than to intervention ingeneral. He criticizes Hayek for defining &quot;freedom&quot; as only&quot;freedom from subjection to the will of others and not asfreedom to do anything in particular.&quot; He calls attention towriters who explain that the choice between private andpublic action properly depends on the relative qualities ofprivate and public institutions, which differ at differenttimes and places. And he makes clear that there is more tolife than economic efficiency. Other values must be takeninto account.   A clear statement of his position came in a speechdelivered in 1959:   &quot;A prettier Utopia to me would be a society with ascompletely free and competitive a market as was attainable inthe setting of a welfare state in which mass poverty had beeneliminated, the business cycle tamed, and opportunity made asequal as was consistent with the survival of privateproperty, the family, and biological differences, as betweenmen, in capacities and motivations . . . I would not make aplea for it {this Utopia}, however, by appeal to `generalprinciples,' nor would I make any claim that any others arebound by logical considerations to accept it as their ownUtopia.&quot;   The per capita national income of the U.S. has increased80% since Viner described his utopia. Freedom, in the senseof &quot;freedom to,&quot; has increased; poverty has declined and sohas inequality of opportunity. Where Viner would place hispriorities today we cannot know. But as a former student I amconfident that my old professor would not give me a failinggrade for believing, as I do, that emphasis should now beplaced on positive government measures to reduce poverty andincrease equality of opportunity further. He would want toconsider the probable effectiveness of the specific measuresproposed and their probable cost in other values. But hewould not deny the importance of the goals or reject themeasures because they involved government action, includinggovernment spending.   ---   A former chairman of the president's Council of EconomicAdvisers, Mr. Stein is a senior fellow of the AmericanEnterprise Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
