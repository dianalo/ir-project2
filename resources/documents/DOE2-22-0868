Passengertransports, included cars and buses, trains, and aircraft; goods transportsincluded trucks, trains, and coastal cargo boats. In passenger traffic,electric trains have both the lowest energy consumption and lowest exhaustemissions compared to any other type of vehicle, regardless of the methodof electricity production. Goods transported by rail are accompaniedby lower exhaust emissions than other types of vehicles regardless ofthe method of electricity production. On condition that energy from hydroelectricsources is used, goods transported by rail also have the lowest energyconsumption.</TEXT></DOC>
