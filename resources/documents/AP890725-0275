A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast calling fornormal temperatures and normal rainfall in the Midwest early nextweek also prompted selling, analysts said.   ``We are in the throes of a weather market, which is usual forthis time of year,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in NewYork with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop-condition report,issued late Monday, showed overall improvement in the corn andsoybean fields, especially in Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota, wheredry weather had stressed the crops.   Last week's soaking rains in the Corn Belt have been replaced bywarm, humid weather, but conditions are neither hot enough nor dryenough to threaten crops, Spilka said.   The wheat market generally followed corn and soybean futureslower, he said.   At the close, wheat was 3\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher withSeptember at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3\ cents lowerwith September at $2.29\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ centhigher with September at $1.43 a bushel; soybeans were 6 centslower to \ cent higher with August at $6.62 a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
