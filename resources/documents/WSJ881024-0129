The bill would increase penalties for insider trading, make companies potentially liable for insider trading by their employees and provide for the payment of bounties to informants in such cases. The House adopted it, 410-0, last month, and the Senate passed it by a voice vote early Saturday. President Reagan is expected to sign it into law.    &quot;This legislation provides a tighter and tougher legal framework to combat insider trading,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey, chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee and the chief author of the bill. After years of insider-trading scandals, the Massachusetts Democrat said, the legislation should help restore investor confidence in the securities markets.    Initial reaction by securities industry leaders to Senate approval of the legislation was generally positive.    The measure, among other things, would double the maximum prison sentence for insider trading to 10 years and increase the maximum criminal fine to $1 million from $100,000 for individuals and to $2.5 million from $500,000 for corporations and partnerships.    It also would empower the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek civil fines against securities firms for failing to properly supervise employees who engage in insider trading.    Currently, the SEC can only require a firm to give up any profits from an employee's illicit trading, bar miscreants from the securities industry and seek injunctions against further violations. But under Mr. Markey's bill, firms that &quot;knowingly and recklessly&quot; fail to prevent insider trading could be held liable for treble damages for employees' violations.    The legislation would codify a right of insider-trading victims to take legal action against the alleged wrongdoers. To do so, such victims would have to have been &quot;contemporaneous traders&quot; who were in the market at the time of the illegal trading.    In addition, the bill would overturn a court ruling that denied this right of private action in cases where the victim's suit was based on the SEC's misappropriation-of-information theory. That holds that it is illegal to trade on material, nonpublic information that has been misappropriated or obtained in breach of fiduciary duty.    Under the bill, the SEC would be free to set up a bounty program to reward informants whose assistance leads to insider-trading penalties. They could collect as much as 10% of the fine imposed or the settlement reached. The program would be patterned after the Internal Revenue Service's successful bounty system for catching income-tax evaders.    It doesn't appear that the legislation would apply to current investigations or to pending cases, including insider-trading and stock manipulation allegations against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;The intent was to make the statute prospective, not retroactive,&quot; said Lawrence Sidman, chief counsel of the House Finance subcommittee. &quot;That means it applies only to actions that occur after enactment.&quot;    The legislation also would empower the SEC to investigate securities-law violations on behalf of foreign governments. This would enable SEC staffers who receive such assistance from Canadian and other foreign officials to reciprocate.    Under the bill, a special commission of experts would conduct a comprehensive study of the securities markets, including the extent of insider trading and gaps in market surveillance. It would be modeled on a major study in 1963 that resulted in sweeping regulatory changes.    At the urging of Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the measure didn't include a statutory definition of insider trading. He prefers to rely on the existing body of common law stemming from court cases rather than risk creating legislative loopholes for inside traders to exploit.    Senior securities industry officials reacted positively to news of Senate approval of the bill. &quot;I think the bill is generally the right thing,&quot; said Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association. The SIA testified extensively during the preparation of the legislation, Mr. O'Brien said.    &quot;We're very much in favor of rooting out insider trading,&quot; he added. &quot;The penalties {in the new bill} are high, but those with nothing to fear have nothing to worry about.&quot;    Mr. O'Brien said that while the SIA is generally in favor of the legislation, it does have a couple of reservations: &quot;We don't like the bounty elements.&quot; The industry &quot;should and can rely on compliance within firms,&quot; he said. The SIA also would like a more precise definition of insider trading, Mr. O'Brien said.    &quot;The thrust of the bill is constructive. The definition of proper enforcement of securities law within a firm needs to be spelled out,&quot; said George Ball, chairman and chief executive officer of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., who stressed that his views were a first reaction and that the securities industry has yet to examine the measure in detail.    Mr. Ball said the bill was a step in the right direction if it encourages firms to be more vigilant, and particularly if it helps restore &quot;public confidence in the probity of markets.&quot;    But Mr. Ball said it would be &quot;unfortunate&quot; if lawmakers, regulators and the securities industry became obsessed with securities abuses, and he warned against the dangers of &quot;witch-hunting.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
