The quotas are proving hard to monitor and may be much too rigid for today's markets.    The ministers will search for ways of better tracking production by the 13 member nations. The current system, in effect since Jan. 1, has suffered because some nations simply aren't cooperating with the Dutch accounting firm hired to audit production levels. &quot;It's a farce,&quot; said one individual in OPEC.    The ministers will also consider a more sophisticated, market-related method of controlling production. Such an approach might involve quarterly -- perhaps even monthly -- changes in quotas to allow for seasonal or other swings in oil demand.    However, the only official action available to the group -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Indonesia, Algeria and Nigeria -- is to make recommendations. Or, they can call an emergency conference of all 13 OPEC nations, but that isn't likely. When Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and president of OPEC, reluctantly agreed two weeks ago to convene the price panel together amid deterioration in world oil prices, he said the intent was only to review the market and discuss the production audits.    Oil prices have stabilized since then. Yesterday, in fact, U.S. crude-oil futures staged a surprise rally, erasing the week's earlier losses.    Still, some of the oil ministers on the committee concede they won't be able to accomplish much this weekend to impress world oil markets further. &quot;Why are you going to Vienna?&quot; one of the ministers asked a reporter earlier this week. &quot;Nothing is going to happen.&quot;    Nevertheless, recommendations by this influential group could set the stage for further deliberations and possible action by the full ministerial conference at OPEC's next regular meeting, scheduled to begin June 8.    More important, meaningful recommendations might help draw non-OPEC oil exporters into an effort to prop up world oil prices. Seven non-OPEC producers, led by Egypt and Mexico, have held meetings of their own recently, indicating they would consider some voluntary reductions in their output -- but only if OPEC demonstrated commitment to doing the same.    Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, will come here today from Mexico, and is scheduled to hold talks with Britain's energy minister, Cecil Parkinson, in London next Wednesday. And Nigeria's Mr. Lukman arrived here last night from London after consultations there with several officials.    Even Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates that state's oil industry, flew to London last Monday for a 2 1/2-hour talk with Mr. Lukman. &quot;We've established a dialogue,&quot; Mr. Hance said in Austin, Texas. He declined to be more specific on how Texas -- with two million barrels a day of oil output, or more than most OPEC nations -- could help. &quot;I'm working on it,&quot; he said, &quot;but I would rather not talk about it.&quot;    The OPEC ministers hope to have audited reports of production for the entire first quarter available for their meeting. But Mr. Lukman confirmed last night that only January and February audits are available. The January audit, as previously reported, will show that the 12 members with quotas produced within their limits that month. War-torn Iraq's production is excluded.    But some of the figures are guesses. Iran, for instance, gave the auditors production figures, but wouldn't let them inspect tanker loadings. &quot;Nobody's taking the audit very seriously,&quot; said an OPEC official. As a result, the committee of ministers will have to decide whether they should continue the auditors -- and, if so, how to bring the uncooperative members into line.    The OPEC members generally have stayed within their quotas this year, according to reliable estimates by outsiders. Petro-Logistics of Geneva estimates March output at 17.6 million barrels a day. With Iraq's 2.5 million barrels a day excluded, that puts March production precisely on target at 15.1 million barrels a day for the 12 others.    Averaged over a year, this should match OPEC's production with demand for its oil. However, Europe experienced a mild winter, and non-OPEC production is running at capacity. Thus, OPEC output through the first quarter was at least 500,000 barrels a day too high, even though individual countries kept to their quota.    What OPEC needs now is a mechanism that would adjust the year's production ceiling on a frequent basis as demand for its oil rises or falls. </TEXT></DOC>
