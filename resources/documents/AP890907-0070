Mitchell todayassailed a proposed capital-gains tax cut as a break for the richthat would be paid for by middle-income Americans.   In addition, he said, the cut proposed by President Bush andothers would undoubtedly cause a loss of government revenue ``overany period of time beyond one year'' and thus would worsen thebudget deficit.   ``The present proposal is unfair, unwise,'' the Maine Democrattold reporters. It is ``effectively a tax break for the wealthy tobe paid for by the middle class. It is a $31,000-a-year tax breakfor those whose income exceeds $200,000 a year.''   A capital-gains reduction also would unravel the big 1986 taxoverhaul, Mitchell added. When the tax system was rewritten byCongress, capital gains was only one of several special tax breaksthat were wiped out in order to allow a significant reduction of taxrates.   Under the new law, capital gains _ profits from the sale of stockand other assets _ are taxed at the same rate as wages and otherincome. Bush has proposed to reduce the rate to 15 percent.   Mitchell reasons that if a preference is restored for capitalgains, pressure will increase to bring back other benefits that wereended in 1986.   In that regard, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and ChristopherDodd, D-Conn., announced today they were introducing a bill torestore tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for allworkers, regardless of income. The 1986 law restricted deductibleIRAs only to lower-paid workers and those not covered by a companypension.   In running for the presidency last year, Bush promised to seek areduction in the capital-gains tax in order to spur investment andsaving.   A majority of the House Ways and Means Committee favors atemporary cut in the capital-gains tax, which could help reduce thebudget deficit in the short term by prompting investors to sell someassets they have been holding for some time.   However, many economists dispute the administration's contentionthat a capital-gains cut would produce long-term revenue gains.   The Ways and Means Committee is weighing an alternative byChairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., that would protect againsttaxation of gains caused solely by inflation and also provide morefavorable tax treatment of long-term gains.   But Mitchell said now is not the time to even consider acapital-gains cut, chiefly because of the budget deficit.   He noted that in 1986, when tax overhaul was being debated, heoffered an amendment that would have retained a special tax breakfor capital gains _ but only as part of a plan that would include ahigher tax rate on income of all kinds earned by wealthier taxpayers.   That amendment was defeated when 49 of the 53 Republican senatorsvoted against it. Now, Mitchell said, Republicans have made acomplete reversal and want a lower rate for capital gains.   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that 70 percent of thebenefit of a capital-gains cut would go to those with incomes over$100,000 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
