Gorbachev,heralding a bid to ease the tense stalemate between Moscow and thebreakaway Baltic republic.   Also today, a Soviet bill on secession cleared one house ofParliament after heated debate and lawmakers in Estonia passed aresolution in support of their Baltic neighbor.   Egidis Bickauskas, a Lithuanian legislator, told a Moscow newsconference that three representatives including Lithuanian DeputyPremier Romualdas Ozolas met with Alexander N. Yakovlev, consideredto be one of Gorbachev's top advisers.   ``If there are people who are ready to listen, I think it isvery good,'' Bickaukas said. No results of the meeting wereimmediately available.   The meeting signified the first high-level personal contactbetween Lithuania and Moscow since just after the Baltic republicdeclared independence on March 11.   The secession bill was approved by the Soviet of Nationalities,one of two houses of the parliament, said the official Soviet newsagency Tass, without giving a vote count. It was sent on to thesecond chamber, the Soviet of the Union, for possible considerationlater today.   Some deputies to the Supreme Soviet legislature found the billtoo harsh, while others thought the conditions it set were toolenient, Tass said.   An amendment approved by the Soviet of Nationalities requiresany republic leaving the union to pay the costs of citizens whowant to resettle back in the Soviet Union. Lithuania has a largeRussian minority.   Legislators in the neighboring Baltic republic, Estonia, whichis taking a more cautious approach to independence, approved ameasuring supporting Lithuania and urging Gorbachev to open talks.   The Estonian Supreme Soviet ``expresses full support of theirstrivings, pays high tribute to their courage and expressesrecognition of the independent state organization of Lithuania,''the declaration said.   Gorbachev's top deputy spoke of ``friendly ties'' with Lithuaniaand said the Kremlin does not question its right to secede _ aslong as it adheres to the constitution.   The comments by Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairman of the SupremeSoviet parliament, came as Lithuanian leaders sought a compromisethat would allow them to start talks with Moscow without giving into demands by Gorbachev that they first repeal their March 11declaration of independence.   On Monday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said hisrepublic intends to move toward independence gradually and throughnegotiations. The statement marked something of a retreat from therecalcitrance that had characterized the Baltic state's three-weekdrive for divorce.   The secession bill would require a two-thirds vote in areferendum of any republic wishing to leave the Soviet Union. Afive-year transition period would follow during which the republicand the Kremlin would divide up economic resources and settle anydisputes. In addition, Moscow would have final say over terms ofseparation.   Poland's Foreign Ministry said the Soviet government todayclosed the only border crossing between Poland and Lithuania, butthere was no immediate comment by government officials.   Over the weekend, Soviet soldiers seized Lithuania's chiefprosecutor's office in the capital Vilnius as well as the Balticstate's main newspaper printing plant. Foreign reporters wereordered to leave Sunday.   Kremlin strong-arm tactics aimed at forcing the Lithuanians toback down have included sending armored vehicles through Vilnius torattle the populace, demanding citizens turn in their firearms androunding up at least 23 Lithuanians who deserted the Red Armyfollowing the independence declaration.   Soviet officials say that if Lithuania or any other republicwants to secede, it needs to follow the law. Gorbachev warnedSaturday that to do otherwise could result in ``grave consequencesfor all of us.''   Lithuania and Estonia, forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in1940 with fellow Baltic republic Latvia, have declared themselvesto be under illegal Soviet occupation and Lithuanian leaders refuseto renounce their independence declaration.   However, Landsbergis said Monday that his republic intends to``consolidate'' its independence ``by means of agreements and agradual takeover of certain functions.''   In a telegram to Gorbachev, he invited Kremlin officials toLithuania to discuss secession.   Lukyanov, first in line to succeed Gorbachev, said in remarkscarried by Tass late Monday that the Kremlin leadership's attitudetoward Lithuania is ``calm, clear-cut and rather friendly.''   ``Nobody questions the constitutional right of nations andpeoples to self-determination,'' he said. ``Only this should bedone in legal forms, so that neither to damage the interests of thenation that has decided to gain self-determination nor of othernations and ethnic groups inhabiting the Soviet Union.''   But Lukyanov said Lithuania's ``hasty decision'' ignored itsrelationship with the rest of the Soviet Union.   Landsbergis told legislators Monday that Gorbachev probably tookthe tough stance over the weekend because he faces his ownpolitical difficulties from conservatives and otherindependence-minded republics.   ``Therefore it is essential to look for a way of helping themand ourselves,'' Landsbergis said. Gorbachev faces independencemovements in several of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.   Virginijus Razmantas of offical Lithuanian radio said therepublic's legislature was today debating whether about 9,000youths scheduled to report for Soviet military service this springshould start their service.   All pro-independence newspapers were printed in the republic'smain printing plant, Razmantas said. A leader of the minority ofLithuanian Communists who remain loyal to Moscow had told plantworkers Monday that the papers would no longer printed there.   In Vilnius on Monday, about 1,000 pro-independence demonstratorsrallied outside the chief prosecutor's office to protest the Sovietoccupation.   Both a prosecutor appointed by Lithuania's breakaway governmentand one sent by Moscow were working in the building, employeessaid. They reported a tense atmosphere but no direct conflictsbetween the two.</TEXT></DOC>
