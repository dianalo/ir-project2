The draft document, which recognizes the right to a smoke-freeenvironment in public areas and at work, was part of a reportpresented at the end of the first European conference on tobaccopolicy.   Richard Peto of Oxford University in England said tobacco kills500,000 Europeans a year and 100 million alive today will die ifcurrent smoking patterns continue.   ``What is needed is to inform the governments,'' he said. ``Anincreasing number of people concerned, even at the ministeriallevel, are beginning to realize these are real deaths of realpeople.''   A final version of the document is to be distributed early nextyear by the World Health Organization, which joined Spain's Ministryof Health and Consumer Affairs in sponsoring the Madrid conference.   Officials from six countries said their governments wouldconsider adopting the document in combination with higher tobaccotaxes and bans on tobacco advertising.   They included three health ministers _ Julian Garcia Vargas ofSpain, Philippe Busquin of Belgium and Tove S. Gerhardsen of Norway_ and lower-level officials from Italy, France and Portugal.   All said they agreed with much of the statement, including therights to air ``free from tobacco smoke'' in enclosed public placesand transport, help for smokers to break the habit and informationon ``the unparalleled health risks of tobacco use.''   Agreement was not universal on banning tobacco at places of workand eliminating all advertising.   Garcia Vargas said: ``We cannot have laws for everything. It isbetter to persuade.''   Ms. Gerhardsen said legislation to increase the price of tobaccoproducts, ban advertising and create smoke-free environments havebeen essential in reducing Norway's consumption of tobacco to one ofthe lowest in Europe.   ``The law is necessary because there will always be people whodon't cooperate with agreements,'' she said.   Spain passed a law this year that puts restrictions on smokingand negotiated an agreement with tobacco companies to limitadvertising. Statistics indicate Spain is second only to Greece inper capita consumption of tobacco in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
