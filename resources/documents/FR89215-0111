Applicant, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland,is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registeredunder the 1940 Act. Applicant filed a registration statement under theSecurities Act of 1933 and the 1940 Act on October 1, 1987 and filed amendmentsthereto on December 8, 1987, January 22, 1988, February 5, 1988 and February15, 1988. The SEC declared the amended registration statement effectiveon February 17, 1988.2. Applicant's investment objective is long-term capital appreciation throughinvestment primarily in equity securities of Thai companies. It is thepolicy of Applicant to invest under normal circumstances, at the conclusionof the initial investment period, at least 80% of its net assets in equitysecurities of Thai companies. During defensive periods, Applicant may reduceits holdings in equity securities of Thai companies and increase its holdingsin bonds, short-term debt obligations, money market instruments or cash,all denominated in Baht,\1\<NOTE/> which could bring the amount of net assets invested in Thaiequity securities below 80%.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As of February 12, 1988, the Noon Buying Rate of the FederalReserve Bank was 25.33 Baht to $1.00.3. In order to meet or anticipate its operating expenses and distributionrequirements and during defensive periods when the value of the Baht isexpected to depreciate against the dollar or when there are either negativedevelopments in the markets for Thai securities or in Thailand, Applicantmay invest in non-Baht denominated investments, including obligations issuedor guaranteed by the United States Government and other dollar-denominatedsecurities, non-Baht denominated prime grade finance company or corporatecommercial paper, and certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances ofUnited States commercial banks. After the Applicant's initial investmentperiod, however, such non-Baht denominated investments are limited by theBank of Thailand to 20% of the Fund's net assets invested through the investmentplan (the ``Investment Plan'').4. Applicant's investment advisers are Morgan Stanley Asset ManagementInc. (``MSAM'' or ``U.S. Adviser''), a Delaware corporation, and The MutualFund Company Limited (``Thai Adviser''), a Thai limited company (together,``Advisers''). Applicant's administrators are MSAM and The Vanguard Group,Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, (``Vanguard'', together with MSAM, ``Administrators'').Each Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment AdvisersAct of 1940. Their advisory activities are governed by an investment contract(``Investment Contract'') establishing the Investment Plan and a relatedTechnical Assistance and Seconding Agreement (``Seconding Agreement'')which, during the time the Investment Plan is in existence, together serveas investment advisory agreements between Applicant, MSAM and the ThaiAdviser. Under these two agreements MSAM provides staff to the Thai Adviserto make investment decisions for Applicant (``Seconded Staff'') and theThai Adviser, through such Seconded Staff, makes investment decisions forthe Investment Plan. During the existence of the Investment Plan, MSAM,pursuant to the MSAM Administration Agreement, has agreed to provide administrativeservices to Applicant, directly or through third parties such as Vanguard.Vanguard has agreed to provide administrative services to the Fund pursuantto the Vanguard Administration Agreement between MSAM and Vanguard.5. Thai laws permit SET-Listed Securities Companies to act as securitiesbrokers, securities dealers, underwriters or investment advisers. MostSET-Listed Securities Companies are members of the SET, and all engagein securities-related businesses. Currently, there are twenty SET-ListedSecurities Companies, seventeen of which are also members of the SET.6. As of December 31, 1987, market capitalization of corporate equity securities(excluding unit trusts) (``Corporate Equity Securities'') for the SET was135.37 billion Baht, compared to 74.46 billion Baht as of December 31,1986. In 1987, SET-Listed Securities Companies represented 22.95% of theSET's Corporate Equity Securities market, which includes major industrial,transport, service, insurance, financial and utility stocks. In addition,as of December 31, 1987, finance and securities companies comprised theSET's single largest sectoral group in terms of number of companies quoted.7. Applicant submits that the securities of SET-Listed Securities Companiesthat it intends to purchase have at least the degree of investor interestand depth and breadth of market as certain securities traded in the U.S.over-the-counter market which have been designated as ``OTC margin stock.''Applicant further submits that its investment in securities of SET-ListedSecurities Companies would have no adverse effect on, but rather wouldenhance, the liquidity of its portfolio.8. Applicant further represents that the public information available inThailand about SET-Listed Securities Companies is at least as extensiveas information available in Thailand about Thai issuers in other industriesin which Applicant intends regularly to invest. Applicant submits thatthe disclosure required by Thai laws and regulations, while not in allrespects as comprehensive as U.S. securities laws, provides significantdisclsoure in connection with the issuance of securities which is the ``substantialequivalent'' of the disclosure required by the Securities Act of 1933.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Conclusions</ITAG>1. Applicant's proposed investment in SET-Listed Securities Companies wouldbe subject to the prohibitions of section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act againstregistered investment companies purchasing securities of isuers engagedin securities-related businesses. With respect to the exemptive relieffrom section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act provided by Rule 12d3-1, Applicantrecognizes that SET-Listed Securities Companies derive more than 15% oftheir gross revenues from securities-related activities for any given period,and Applicant has assumed for the purposes of this application that investmentin SET-Listed Securities Companies would be subject to the conditions ofRule 12d3-1(b).2. Applicant has reviewed all the conditions set forth in Rule 12d3-1(b)under the 1940 Act and represents or undertakes that it will be able tosatisfy all but one of the conditions. Applicant cannot satisfy the conditionthat any equity security acquired must be a ``margin security'' as definedin Regulation T promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem. Because the equity securities of SET-Listed Securities Companiesare not listed on a United States securities exchange or traded in theUnited States in the over-the-counter market, they cannot be ``margin securities.''Because Applicant is unable to satisfy all of the conditions of Rule 12d3-1and thus cannot avail itself of the exemption provided by such rule, itis unable to take advantage of good investment opportunities and to increasethe diversification of its portfolio, particularly its diversificationwithin the financial sector of the Thai economy.3. Applicant asserts that the granting of the requested exemptive orderis appropriate, in the public interest and consistent with the protectionof investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisionsof the 1940 Act. The SEC's concern about the entrepreneurial risk of investingin securities related businesses is not relevant to the Applicant becausethe Applicant intends to purchase interests in Thai limited companies,which are analogous to shares of corporate stock and are unlike partnerhsipinterests. Further, the SEC's concern about possible conflicts of interestarising out an investment company purchasing shares in a broker-dealeras a reward for selling the investment company's shares also is not relevantto the Applicant, a closed-out investment company.4. Finally, the SEC's concern that an investment company might direct brokeragebusiness to a broker-dealer in which the investment company has investedin order to enhance such broker-dealer's profitability or to assist itduring financial difficulty is not relevant to the Applicant. The Thaientities in which Applicant would invest are institutions of substantialsize while the Applicant possesses total assets which are unlikely, inlight of investment management policies, to be able to effect such a result.5. Based on the foregoing, Applicant respectfully requests an exemptionfrom the provisions of section 12(d)(3) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessaryto permit it to invest in securities of SET-Listed Securities Companies,which are listed on the SET.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions</ITAG>Applicant agrees that if the requested order is granted it will be expresslyconditioned on the following conditions:11. Applicant undertakes to invest in only SET-Listed Securities Companies'securities that would meet the criteria concerning total market value,earning power and share distribution and would, based on these grounds,be eligible for listing on one or more of the following: The New York StockExchange, The American Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ National System.2. The investments in SET-Listed Securities Companies will comply withall the requirements of Rule 12d3-1 under the 1940 Act, except the requirementthat such equity securities be ``margin securities.''3. Applicant undertakes that, prior to the acquisition of the equity securitiesof a SET-Listed Securities Company, the Advisers will determine that suchSET-Listed Securities Company satisfies each of the following standards:(a) Daily quotations are available for both bid and asked prices;(b) The company's stock has been publicly traded for at least six months;(c) The company or a predecessor in interest has been in existence forat least three years;(d) The company has at least $10 million of capital, surplus, and undividedprofits;(e) The company is required by exchange or governmental regulation publiclyto file (i) reports of any important financial or structural corporatechanges, (ii) semi-annual profit and loss statements and (iii) annual reportsof independently audited assets and liabilities, profits and losses andchanges in financial position;(f) The company has a minimum market capitalization of $20 million; and(g) The Company's equity securities have (i) an average daily trading volumeof at least 500 shares and (ii) an average daily trading volume equal invalue to at least $25,000.4. Applicant will not invest more than 2% of its assets, determined asof the time of purchase, in the securities of any SET-Listed SecuritiesCompany.5. Applicant will maintain in one place all of the necessary documentationrelating to its investment decisions regarding securities issued by theSET-Listed Securities Companies and to employ an independent third partyto review periodically Applicant's compliance with the terms of the Orderissued.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
