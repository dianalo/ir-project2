Just substitute criminalizing offoreign-policy differences for a high-tech lynching and LeeHamilton for Howard Metzenbaum.   It's some progress that Justice Thomas doesn't have Mr.North's $5 million legal bill, which itself might justify thepublisher's hype that Mr. North's autobiography says thatPresident Reagan knew about the diversion of profits fromIran arms sales to the Contras. This allegation is abookseller's dream, but Mr. North carefully hedged this claimin the full text of &quot;Under Fire: An American Story.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. North said yesterday he was &quot;perplexed and hurt&quot; somuch attention has focused on one sentence in the book: &quot;Fiveyears later, I am even more convinced: President Reagan kneweverything.&quot; He stressed that the evidence is circumstantial,including the mysterious tape of the phone conversationbetween parties unknown about what Mr. Reagan knew.   Mr. North wrote that he thought someone must have told Mr.Reagan about the diversion, &quot;but that doesn't mean he paidattention to it or remembered it.&quot; Strange as it might seemnow, it wasn't such a big deal. For one thing, the divertedfunds were a small part of the White House effort to keep theContras alive while Congress vacillated with Bolandamendments. Mr. Reagan also met with private donors andapparently encouraged King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to increasehis contributions. Excess profits from other arms sales werealready used to fund covert activities.   Most importantly, &quot;Despite everything that's been said orimplied, the `diversion' was not illegal,&quot; Mr. North wrote.&quot;You could argue that it was a bad idea -- that much iscertainly debatable -- but despite all the allegations, thetransfer of funds did not violate any laws. After five yearsand tens of millions of dollars spent on investigations,prosecutions, trials and tribunals, no one involved inIran-Contra was ever tried for `diverting' anything.&quot;   The great theme of the book is Washington's unlearnedlesson of concocted scandal vs. real scandal -- with thegreatest scandal of them all how political differences nowlead to criminal charges. When word leaked about thetroubling hostage negotiations and arms sales to Iran, theWhite House panicked (Watergate]). The solution was to tossout the red meat of Mr. North and John Poindexter, which onlyfed the frenzy.   Mr. North's experience linked the personal andinstitutional problems that mar a presidency when loyalty upis not followed by loyalty down. Mr. Reagan &quot;could have endedyears of suffering for me and my family either by granting apresidential pardon or by shutting down the office of thespecial prosecutor,&quot; Mr. North wrote. &quot;Is that betrayal?Well, it sure as hell wasn't supportive.&quot; In the process, Mr.North wrote, &quot;Instead of strengthening the office of thepresidency, he actually weakened it.&quot;   One of the more intriguing anecdotes in the book recallshow Mr. North once spent a day in 1985 researching executiveprivilege in the Old Executive Office Building law library.He drafted a letter he hoped would be sent to Congressdefending the traditional confidentiality of executive-branchdocuments and conversations. It's too bad no one else waswilling to invoke the privilege. The result was that Congressasked for information that it did not want the responsibilityfor having, but that paved the way for indictments based onmisleading testimony.   Mr. North put Iran-Contra into political and legal contextwith his disclosure that &quot;well over a hundred people in ourgovernment,&quot; including congressmen, knew about at least someof his efforts for the Contras. Many congressmen -- &quot;not allof the Republicans,&quot; he emphasized yesterday -- accompaniedLt. Col. North to the Salvadoran airfield at Ilopango in theearly 1980s. Many knew all about his efforts to help theContras, but then came the &quot;great plague of amnesia that hitWashington in the fall of 1986.&quot;   Mr. North reserves his strongest words for Lawrence Walshand his team of special prosecutors. &quot;They had sought thisjob in a politically charged case,&quot; Mr. North wrote, likeningthem to a &quot;lynch mob in pin-striped suits.&quot; This is preciselywhat Congress intended by creating these budgetlessprosecutors. &quot;The whole process is eerily reminiscent of thatcynical line from the early days of the Soviet KGB: `Firstbring us the man. We'll find the crime,'&quot; Mr. North wrote.   No pebble was too small for Mr. Walsh or congressionalinvestigators to turn over. Agents went to California toinvestigate a $30 check Mr. North wrote a friend of his son'sfor helping to paint a fence. They questioned Mr. North'sfinancial dealings with a baby-sitter and the local gasstation. They asked about Mr. North's church contributions,but were stumped with an invocation of &quot;pastoral privilege.&quot;It's not in the book, but at one point Mr. Walsh forced BetsyNorth to get fingerprinted and sit for a mug shot in agoonish effort to squeeze Mr. North through his wife.   The recent innovation of criminalizing policy differencesdoesn't square very well with due process, so it was finaljustice that Mr. Walsh had to drop all charges against Mr.North. Federal judges ruled that Mr. Walsh unconstitutionallytag-teamed with Congress by using Mr. North's immunecongressional testimony in a criminal court. The jury refusedto convict Mr. North on any of the serious charges, so it'svery possible that there would not have even been thetemporary North Guilty headlines if Mr. Walsh had followedthe rules.   Mr. Walsh is now nearing the end of his fifth year in thejob. He continues to search for new targets and new politicalacts to criminalize. He has kept several former Reaganofficials in the nightmare of legal limbo. Indeed, call thisDay 1,769 of the Iran-Contra Hostage Crisis.   Mr. North, who said his lawyers were forced to run up$10,000 a month in photocopying bills alone, isn't surprisedthat Alan Fiers, Elliott Abrams and others were forced intoplea bargains. It was only after he became a national hero inthe congressional hearing that &quot;I had enormous financial andlegal resources to fight back,&quot; Mr. North said.   Fans of Mr. North's performance in the congressionalhearings can find some of his impish humor in this book,co-written with William Novak. &quot;It would have been wonderfulif Mother Teresa had volunteered to approach the Iranians onour behalf, but she wasn't available.&quot; And, &quot;In the Bible, inthe second chapter of Joshua, Rahab lies to the authoritiesin order to save the lives of two Israelite spies. I don'trecall reading about her trial.&quot;   Finally, the Acknowledgments section ends with thisexpression of gratitude: &quot;Larry Walsh was no help at all.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
