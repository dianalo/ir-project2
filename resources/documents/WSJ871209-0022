Lawrence Korb, who was head of Raytheon's Washington office, was among a group of defense experts who in February 1986 wrote a report contending that the national defense budget could be trimmed by $200 billion over five years. After the report was issued, Navy officials complained to Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon about Mr. Korb's comments.    The suit, filed in Massachusetts Superior Court here, contends that Mr. Korb was fired in March 1986. A report by the Defense Department's inspector general later concluded that the Navy's complaints contributed in part to Mr. Korb's departure from Raytheon.    Responding to the suit, Raytheon said that it didn't fire Mr. Korb, but offered him a transfer, which he declined after initially accepting it. Raytheon added: &quot;He proved to be ineffective in the job for which he was hired. His lack of experience in industry began to cause problems soon after he took the position in Washington.&quot;    Mr. Korb's suit contends that Raytheon initially fired him, and that he was offered another job only after the Navy told Raytheon that it was overreacting. The job that he was offered wasn't as good and paid less, the suit adds. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages from Raytheon.    Mr. Korb, who was an assistant secretary of defense from 1981 to 1985 before joining Raytheon, is now dean of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh. </TEXT></DOC>
