Much about the way the A's went about dismantling theCleveland Indians 8-4 struck a chord. Wasn't this the way the A's weresupposed to subdue the rest of the West, with lights-out homers from Hendersonand Jose Canseco, plenty of offensive support and quality starting pitching?;   The A's have won three straight and trail the Minnesota Twins by four games,as do the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers.;    Eric Show, resurrected inthe second half after more than a month's sojourn in Triple-A, presented theA's with six solid innings for his first American League victory. And he wasso delighted, he; could be seen in the clubhouse writing the details on thegame ball.;    The first four hitters -- Rickey and Dave Henderson, Cansecoand Terry Steinbach -- combined to go 10 for 17 with eight runs, two doubles,two homers and seven RBIs.;    &quot;The offense showed you what they're capableof. They had some great at-bats,&quot; A's Manager Tony La Russa said.;    The A'strailed 3-1 when they got to Greg Swindell (6-8) in the top of the sixth.Rickey Henderson singled, and Dave Henderson sent his 19th homer crashing intothe empty second-deck seats in left field. Canseco doubled, and Steinbachdrove him home with a single.;    Canseco's two-run homer, No. 24, sentSwindell to the showers with two out in the seventh.;    The A's haven't hadthis sort of tag-team offensive production much this month. And their troublescoincided with Dave Henderson's rapid cool-down. He was hitting .325 a monthago and is at .277 now.;    Henderson did some extra work before Tuesday'sgame and had only a bunt single to show for it, going 1 for 5. But he hit theball well, and hitting coach Rick Burleson said he saw signs that Hendersonwas coming around.;    &quot;It's been a long time for him to come out of it, but Ithink he found a couple of keys in the last couple of days that helped him,&quot;said Burleson, who had Henderson make adjustments in his approach. &quot;He'sdefinitely on the comeback, and we're real happy about it, too.;    &quot;If he andRickey and Jose play like they did tonight the rest of the way, we're going tobe real tough. It's important if we're going to win.&quot;;    When Show fellbehind 2-1 in the first because of a strange play, he began to wonder if he'dever get his first A.L. win. With runners on first and second and one out, theA's apparently turned a double play that was wiped out when third-base umpireJohn Shulock said Show had balked. The Indians came back to score a pair.;   &quot;Steiny came out and he told me, 'Get your chin off the ground,' &quot; Show said.&quot;I said, 'I'm sorry, I didn't know it was there.' And he said, 'C'mon now,let's go.' I said, 'You're right.';    &quot;The last two years seemed to be just agiant rut,&quot; said Show, who signed with the A's last winter after strugglingwith the San Diego Padres last season. &quot;I guess the longevity of it wasgetting to me at that point.&quot;;  HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 1st -- R. Hendersonsingled. With one out, Henderson was caught stealing but reached third safelyon first baseman Aldrete's throwing error and scored on left fielder Belle'sfielding error.
