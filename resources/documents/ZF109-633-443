 Perhaps one cablewon't reach where you want to place your printer, or the cable connected toyour modem bunches up in a tangled mess on your desk.andP;  For a really custom PCsetup, use custom-made cables tailored to your workspace.andM;If you're short on time or you're not a do-it-yourselfer, the simplestapproach is to pay a computer repair shop to make a cable to the exact lengthyou need.andP;  Before paying for a custom cable, familiarize yourself with them,so that you ask for what you really need and get a fair price--$30 or more,depending on the length of the cable and the complexity of the wiring in theconnectors.andM;&quot;If you don't mind using a few simple tools, however, it's often better tomake a cable yourself.andP;  Materials generally cost less than $10.andP;  Just asimportant, some peripherals--such as plotters and printers--don't usestandard pin-outs, connections for transmitting data to and from a PC.andP;  Witheccentric devices, your only choice may be to make your own cable,experimenting until your find the correct wiring configuration.andM;With more standard devices such as a modern, pin-outs are usually no problem.andO;But whether the pin-out is straightforward or obscure, making the cablerequires nothing more daunting than soldering--and you can usually avoidthat.andM;Your computer may have one of two types of serial ports.andP;  One is a 25-pin&quot;D-sub&quot; (D-subminiature) connector, a connector with 13 pins on a top row and12 pins on a bottom row.andP;  Other PCs use a 9-pin serial port connector.andP;  Eachpin-either a metal rod that plugs into a hole or the hole itself--isnumbered.andM;We'll use the 25-pin connector as an example.andP;  If your serial port has a9-pin connector, follow our instructions for the 25-pin, to avoid confusionbetween numbering for 25-pin and 9-pin connectors.andP;  Then buy a25-pin-to-9-pin converter, available for less than $5 at Radio Shack (partnumber 26-265).andM;Serial cables have a female D-sub on one end and a male D-sub on the otherend.andP;  The male/female nomenclature follows anatomical logic: Male D-subs havetwo rows of protruding pins, while female D-subs have two rows of holes intowhich the pins fit.andP;  The cable connecting the two D-subs may be a flat ribbonor a round cable in which a plastic sheath covers individual wires.andM;Straight Serial CableandM;The simplest type of serial cable contains wires that run from each pin onone end to the matching hole on the other end.andP;  Pin 1 connects to hole 1, pin2 to hole 2, and so on.andP;  The simplest method to make this sort of cable is touse a length of 25-conductor ribbon cable (Radio Shack part 278-772, $3.59for a 5-foot length) and two connectors: a female IDC (insulationdisplacement connector) 25-pin D-sub (Radio Shack part 276-1565, $3.99) andits male counterpart (Radio Shack part 276-1559, $3.99).andP;  You can find theparts at other electronic or computer stores.andP;  You'll also need two smallpieces of heavy cardboard and a pair of vise-grip pliers.andM;Cut the 25-conductor ribbon cable to length.andP;  Ribbon cable is usually graywith red or red-and-blue bands indicating the pin-1 side of the cable.andP;  EachIDC connector has individual pins labeled 1 through 25.andP;  The labels, next tothe pins on the connector, are often difficult to see without a magnifyingglass.andM;Locate the pin-1 side of one connector and insert the cable through the holein the connector, so that the pin-1 side of the ribbon cable and theconnector are aligned.andP;  The ribbon cable should project about 1/16 inchbeyond the connector edge.andP;  Make sure the ribbon cable is aligned in theconnector at a right angle and midway between the connector sides.andP;  This isusually no problem, as the connector path is just wide enough to admit a25-conductor ribbon cable.andM;Once the ribbon cable is loosely inserted, move the top portion of theconnector down onto the cable and press the two portions of the connectorlightly together.andP;  This pushes sharp, pointed contacts into the insulationsurrounding each wire in the cable.andM;The final step is the most important.andP;  The top portion of the connector mustbe driven firmly into the ribbon cable so that all 25 pins pierce the cableand contact the wires inside.andP;  Place a small piece of cardboard on each endof the connector.andP;  Working slowly across the connector, squeeze the twoportions of the connector together using the vise-grip pliers.andP;  Make severalpasses instead of putting too much pressure on one end, to avoid bunching thecable.andP;  Increase the pressure with the vise-grips for each pass.andP;  When thetop portion of the connector has been pressed together properly, it will snapinto place, locking the halves of the connector together.andM;Some connectors, such as Radio Shack's, come with a cover that fits over theconnector top.andP;  This provides added support to ensure that the cable does notpull out of the connector.andP;  Fold the ribbon cable over the top of theconnector and snap the cover onto the connector.andP;  Ignore the cover if thecable assembly will not be subjected to repeated tugging or other physicalstrain.andM;Repeat the entire process with the second connector on the other end of thecable, making certain that the pin-1 side of the cable is over that of theconnector.andM;Once the two connectors are assembled, verify again that the red band is onthe pin-1 side or each connector and the ribbon cable is squarely aligned andcentered in both connectors.andP;  You should now have a working cable.andP;  If youhave problems, verify the connections on the pins by using a continuitytester (Radio Shack part 22-110, $16.95).andM;Making a Crossover CableandM;Not all cables connect matching pins.andP;  For example, a null-modem cable--usedto connect two computers in serial without using a modem--requires acrossover, which connects pin 2 on one end to to pin 3 on the other end, andvice versa.andP;  Printer cables also often require crossovers because theyconvert the 36 signals found on a male Centronics connector, located on theprinter, to the 25-pin connector on the cable end that plugs into the PC.andO;(The PC's parallel port looks like a serial port except that it is always a25-pin connector and usually female.)andP;  Eighteen wires from the printer sideare unused; 14 of the 18 wires that are used involve some crossovers.andM;When making a serial or parallel cable that involves crossovers, consult yourhardware's manual to find out which pins on one end match which pins on theother end.andP;  Be prepared to experiment if, as sometimes happens, the manual'sinformation is not complete or correct.andM;The snap-on connectors used with a straight cable won't work with a crossoverserial cable.andP;  Instead, use round cable that contains individual, color-codedwires.andP;  Radio Shack carries a 36-wire, 6-foot cable (part 278-774, $4.69); ifyou need a longer cable, an electronics parts store can sell you one cut toany length.andP;  You can strip the ends of the wires and insert the bare endsinto individual metal pin connectors in either a female or a male connectorhousing.andP;  Solder the connections or crimp the pins with either needle-nosepliers or a crimping tool to hold the wires in place.andM;On the female end, the pins generally are attached permanently to thehousing.andP;  But you can buy male connectors that don't have the pins built in,so that you can connect the wires to the individual pins and then snap thepins into holes in the male connector.andP;  This snap-in arrangement lets youchane the pin-outs easily if you need to experiment.andM;For a printer cable, use the same type of pins and male connector, but on theother end use a Centronics-type connector (Radio Shack part 276-155, $3.99).andM;If you solder the connections, use any soldering iron or gun andsmall-diameter, rosin-core electrical solder.andP;  If you crimp the connections,use either needle-nose pliers or a wire crimper (often found on a wirestripper).andM;William Barden, Jr., is a PC consultant and the author of more than 30computer-related books.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
