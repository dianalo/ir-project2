This report describesthe tracers that are being used or that may have future use, their productionby cyclotrons, and other needed resources for PET imaging. Current routineand automated methods for convenient production of labeled compounds,coupled with simple computer-controlled accelerators, can support thecreation of clinical PET centers in any large medical institution, obviatingthe need for in-depth research teams. An alternate approach involvesthe development of regional centers that provide in-house service andthat supply fluorine 18- and carbon 11-labeled compounds to nearby hospitalswith PET machines.63 references.</TEXT></DOC>
