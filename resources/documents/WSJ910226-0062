Morgan andamp; Co. failed to round up a broad syndicate ofbanks for a $1.1 billion leveraged buy-out loan, a furthersign that bankers have adopted a more cautious stance.   More than 60 banks had been asked to take a part of thefinancing already agreed upon by Morgan and five other banksfor Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc.'s leveraged buyout of theoffice-products operations of International Business MachinesCorp. The deal is scheduled to close next month and isbelieved to be unaffected by the poor response to thesyndication attempt, which was reported yesterday in AmericanBanker.</LP><TEXT>   J.P. Morgan and the five other banks had wanted to sellportions of their exposures of $183 million each to otherfinancial institutions. But as of yesterday, a week and ahalf past the original deadline, a spokesman for Morgan saidonly eight institutions, including several mutual fundsspecializing in corporate loans, had committed toparticipate.   &quot;We are disappointed we didn't get more banks in by theFeb. 14 deadline,&quot; the spokesman said. He added thatsyndication efforts are continuing without a set deadline andthat &quot;when a bank goes into an underwritten deal, as we did,it accepts the fact that it may end up with it all.&quot;   The spokesman said that with the eight commitments to asyndicate, none of the six co-agent banks would have morethan a 14% exposure, or $154.4 million, to the $1.1 billioncredit. The co-agents are Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank,Banque Nationale de Paris, Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. andMitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking Corp.   Originally, Bankers Trust New York Corp. and ManufacturersHanover Corp., two U.S. banks among the most active inbuy-out loans, were invited to participate as coequal headswith J.P. Morgan in underwriting the loan, according topeople close to the deal. A Bankers Trust spokesman said,without further explanation, that his bank declined toparticipate. Manufacturers Hanover officials were unavailablefor comment.   Indeed, while banks in general are wary of taking on newexposures to leveraged loans, the lack of financial historyand questions about the projections for the operating incomeof the IBM unit are also said to have caused hesitation. Theunit makes typewriters and laser printers.   The Morgan spokesman declined comment on how much of theloan Morgan and its co-agent banks had hoped to resell.Typically, the lead banks on buy-out loans seek to end upwith no more than $25 million-to-$50 million each on theirbooks.   &quot;The startling fact is that even with names like J.P.Morgan and IBM, they could not put the syndication across inthis environment,&quot; said Christopher Snyder, president of LoanPricing Corp., which monitors corporate loans. He wasreferring to the aversion most banks have to increasing theirportfolios of highly leveraged loans, a figure whichregulators now require them to publish regularly.   Mr. Snyder said that just since last summer &quot;there hasbeen an enormous decrease in broadly syndicated&quot; highlyleveraged loans. There was an average of 55 dealsrepresenting $5.6 billion of loans per month in the latespring and early summer. But in December there were only 11deals for $768 million, he said. The Clayton andamp; Dubilier loansale would have been the largest highly leveraged loansyndication this year.   The combination of large up-front fees and generousinterest rates would give participants the equivalent ofyields in the 11 1/4% to 11 3/4% range, said Steven Miller, avice president at Loan Pricing Corp. But he said a recentsurvey by his firm of 380 banks indicated that only 30% wouldparticipate in a syndicated leveraged loan.   ---   George Anders contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
