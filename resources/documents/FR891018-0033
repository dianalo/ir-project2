The current schedule calls for completion of the new BurkeEast CDF in the mid-1990s.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions about the proposed actionand Draft Environmental Impact Statement can be directed to: Mr. TimothyDaly, (716) 879-4171, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District, EnvironmentalAnalysis Branch, 1776 Niagara Street, Buffalo, NY 14207-3199.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Previous Reports </ITAG>Supplemental Information Report for Cleveland Harbor, Ohio, Diked DisposalSite 14, January 1983; and, Final Environmental Impact Statement, DikedDisposal Facility Site No. 14, Lake Erie, Cleveland Harbor, Cleveland,Ohio, Office of the Chief of Engineers, Department of the Army, Washington,DC 20314, December 1975, filed with USEPA 20 February 1976. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority </ITAG>The current Federal CDF at Site 14 was constructed under the authorityof section 123 of Public Law 91-611. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>The proposed action involves raising the existing CDF Site 14 as an interimmeasure to provide holding capacity for dredged material until a new CDFcan be constructed at the nearby Burke Lakefront Airport vicinity. Thedike would be raised by seven feet, and provide a service life (additionalholding capacity) of about three years. Raising the Dike by seven feetwould put its height at +27 feet LWD; therefore, the target height of thedike would be approximately two feet higher than the existing steel sheetpile wall. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives </ITAG>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District has investigated concernsand potential alternative measures to address the need for interim dredgeddisposal capacity at Cleveland Harbor. Many alternative plans were consideredin the effort to find the least costly and environmentally sound dredgedisposal method. In addition to the structural plans being considered fora new CDF in conjunction with raising Dike 14, other alternatives, includingopen lake disposal, upland use of dredged material, upland disposal, anda no action plan were considered. Several concerns need to be addressed in finalizing the proposed Dike 14plan. A Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act Report is currently being prepared,as well as a section 404(b)(1) Water Quality Evaluation, both of whichwill be included with the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. In addition,continued coordination with Federal, State, and local agencies will examinethe need for any additional studies to assess project effects on endangeredor threatened species, cultural resources, or other aspects of the humanenvironment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scoping Process </ITAG>Scoping coordination is being conducted for each phase of this evaluation.Activities are coordinated with government agencies, interest groups, andthe general public. The general intent is to gain assistance in: Identifyingand scoping problems, needs, and concerns; developing feasible alternativesolutions; and in assessing, evaluating, and identifying preferred andselected plans. The public involvement process incorporates written correspondence,telephone communication, public meetings/workshops, and draft and finalreport review procedures. Additional scoping input from potentially affectedFederal, State, and local agencies or interests is invited by this notice.Significant issues to be analyzed in depth include those ``concerns neededto be addressed'' under Alternatives. The evaluation shall be conducted so as to comply with the various Federaland State Environmental Statutes and Executive Orders and associated reviewprocedures. When the Engineering Report and accompanying DEIS are completedfor review, the combined document will be filed with the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency to be coordinated and reviewed under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act procedures. <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability </ITAG>The combined document consisting of a project Engineering Report and DraftEnvironmental Impact Statement will be made available to the public aboutApril 1990. A local public meeting may be scheduled after coordinationof the draft reports.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 2, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Hugh F.
