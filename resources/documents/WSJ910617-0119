Kmiec's May 30 editorial-pagearticle, &quot;The Abortion Counseling Decision Is Right&quot;: It is amost interesting notion to laud the Supreme Court'sinterpretation of the First Amendment to declare, in fact,what the First Amendment never said, yet fail ultimately torecognize a callous disregard for life itself coming out ofthe Supreme Court.   Apparently, Mr. Kmiec never once considered the poor womanwith prenatal problems. Or those women with chronic ailmentsaggravated by a pregnancy. Justice David Souter alsodisregarded these women, as did Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist. Abortion as family planning is a requirement forat-risk women too poor to seek medical services elsewhere.Thus, the women in this situation are deemed unimportant. Thefetus, which is not guaranteed survival, is deemed moreimportant in this religiously ideological court.</LP><TEXT>   Outside of increased prenatal risks to women, did Mr.Kmiec once think about the judicial abridgment of freespeech? What it can mean to a think tank that has ties togovernment? Or a university with similar ties? How aboutbusiness interests -- federal funds are prevalent there aswell. And The Wall Street Journal? Its blind rah, rah,rahing, looks real good to the radical religious. But thethinking types who are, it is hoped, also included on yourpaper's staff will not be so sanguine. I would also like toknow, what is so conservative about introducing atotalitarian state in this country's democracy? If it's notacceptable for the politically correct to do this, it shouldnot be acceptable to support a judicial role in this.   Joan E. Harman   Coeur d'Alene, Idaho   ---   Mr. Kmiec delivers the kind of anti-personal-freedom,impose-my-morality-on-you mentality I'd hoped we'd see nomore of with Ronald Reagan gone from office and hismoral-majority ilk out of the limelight.   He claims that &quot;a First Amendment theory premised on`neutrality' . . . operates from a profoundly flawedindifference to the quality of literature, art, politicaltheory and, ultimately, moral choice.&quot; How is this&quot;indifference&quot; flawed? The American people have relied on theFirst Amendment to express themselves freely, to complain totheir government, or about their government, without fear of(legal) reprisal. Since when have they ever relied on theFirst Amendment to be a morally up-tight arbiter of goodtaste?   Mr. Kmiec also asserts the court has a doubt that &quot;theright to abortion can be found in the Constitution. . . .&quot;Now, ask yourself, can the court find a right to privacy inthe Constitution? Can the court find a right to freedom ofchoice there? What if someday it says it can't?   Bit by bit, ruling by ruling, we move closer to the momentwhen, incredibly, we will once again live in a nation inwhich a woman will be forced to carry her pregnancy to termagainst her will.   John W. Vellturo Jr.   Berlin, Conn.   ---   Mr. Kmiec is the hands-down winner for the person most&quot;unclear on the concept.&quot; He ends his piece by praising theSupreme Court decision to disallow the use of federal fundsfor abortion counseling with, &quot;Congress can confidently andconstitutionally recognize the significant difference betweenplanning a family and counseling someone to destroy one ofthat family's members.&quot; It's hard to believe he doesn'trealize that most women seeking abortions through agenciesare young, scared, desperate, alone and devoid of family.
