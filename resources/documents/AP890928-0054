The strike against NYNEX in New York and New England has goneeight weeks. It has produced consumer complaints, allegations ofwidespread vandalism, and little movement on the main issue: thecost of health care.   Talks have been intermittent. The first informal bargaining intwo weeks was scheduled for today in Rye Brook and in Boston.   In August, workers staged walkouts against four of the Baby Bellcompanies formed in the break-up of ATandamp;T _ NYNEX, Pacific Telesis,Ameritech and Bell Atlantic. All except NYNEX were back at work bythe end of the month, though Pacific Telesis workers have sincerejected a tentative pact.   NYNEX has insisted that its workers assume as much as $1,500 ayear in health costs.   On that issue, ``NYNEX is really out there alone, away from ATandamp;Tand the other six Baby Bells,'' said Gaye Williams Mack, aspokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America in Washington.   The CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX strikers at New York Telephone,a NYNEX subsidiary; they are joined by 20,000 members of theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who work for NewEngland Telephone, another subsidiary.   To the union, NYNEX's stand ``really looks like a very classicand depressing case of corporate greed,'' Mack said.   But Paul Aran, an industry analyst with Bear Stearns, notedNYNEX suffered losses in the last quarter.   ``It's not their fault that doctor costs are skyrocketing in thedouble digits. It's not anybody's fault,'' Aran said. ``Managementwould like the labor force to pay for part of that increase.''   NYNEX's 10.5 million customers are paying the price for thedispute. The New York State Public Service Commission has recordedmore than 4,600 complaints against New York Telephone since thestart of the strike Aug. 6. There were 11,000 complaints filed inall of 1988.   Management workers have taken the place of union members. But itis often impossible to get through to directory assistance, andrequests for phone installations often are delayed days or weeks.   In Boston, the City Council has sought to question New EnglandTelephone officials about service disruptions due to the strike.The executives have refused, and are fighting subpoenas.   Today, the council was expected to consider a proposal towithhold payment of the city's telephone bill until the strike issettled.   Service problems have been compounded by damage done by vandals.New York Telephone said it has experienced more than 325 acts ofvandalism, affecting 75,000 customers since the strike began.   On Tuesday, the company said, service was cut to 12,000customers using voice and data circuits made of fiber-optics andcopper on Long Island in what officials called the worst act ofsabotage yet.   In response, the company quadrupled its reward to $100,000 forinformation that would flush out the vandals. ``This sabotage isdespicable and must be stopped,'' said New York Telephone'spresident, Frederic V. Salerno.   Strikers walk picket lines at all NYNEX installations; onepicket died early in the strike when he was hit by the car of awoman who was crossing the line to get to work.   A Westchester County grand jury began hearing evidence Tuesdayin the death of 34-year-old Edward Horgan at a NYNEX office inValhalla in suburban Westchester County who was fatally injured onAug. 15.   Police said Horgan jumped on the hood of the woman's car,pounded her windshield, then fell off and struck his head. Theunion charges the car struck Horgan as the driver sped into work.   The electrical workers union said it intended to reduce its wagedemands at today's negotiations; CWA spokesman Bob Master would notconfirm that the CWA planned a similar proposal, though the twounions have acted in concert.   Still, the two sides are dug in on the health costs issue.   ``We are still firm that we are not going to accept payrolldeductions to maintain health benefits. We have not moved on thatprinciple,'' said Master.   ``This theory of asking for employees to pay for part of theirhealth care costs is our principle and will continue to be,'' saidNYNEX's John Bonomo.</TEXT></DOC>
