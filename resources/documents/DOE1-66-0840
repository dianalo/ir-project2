Thedata for glassfibre/polyester and for carbonfibre/epoxy are given fortensile and shear properties: A test method is described, which allowssimultaneous measurement of tensil and shear behaviour, through a threepoint bending technique; this type of loading imposed both tensile andshear deformations in the material. Examples are given to illustratethe method.</TEXT></DOC>
