In the 1989 first quarter, the bank holding company posteda profit of $42.3 million, or 60 cents a share -- before asurge in troubled real estate loans led to a $1.11 billionloss for the year.</LP><TEXT>   Bank of New England, now struggling for its survival, saidthe latest quarterly results reflect a $20 million operatingloss, a $151 million provision for possible loan losses and a$48 million reserve for foreclosed real estate.   Nonperforming assets, which include foreclosed real estateand loans on which payments are past due or likely to becomedelinquent, rose to $2.67 billion from $2.2 billion at Dec.31. Total assets, meanwhile, dropped to $24.9 billion from$29.77 billion as the company scrambled to raise cash andprop up its capital ratios by selling off some of its mostmarketable assets.   &quot;As I said when I joined Bank of New England {in March},our recovery will be difficult and it will be measured inyears,&quot; said Lawrence Fish, chairman and chief executiveofficer.   In a statement, Mr. Fish said the company has now reviewed&quot;over 85% of our loans and 100% of our real estate loans, andwe believe the picture of the loan portfolio represented bythese numbers is accurate and complete at this time. We alsofeel that the loan-loss provision is appropriate given thecurrent uncertainties about the economic environment.&quot;   Mr. Fish said he believes the company is &quot;on the road tobecoming a smaller, well-reserved, profitable bank.&quot; Asrecent steps toward that goal, he cited an increase in thecapital ratio to 1.65% from 1.54% at Dec. 31, growth in coreretail deposits, an increase in loss reserves as a percentageof loans and leases, and $300 million in projected savingsfrom staffing and other overhead reductions.   But securities analysts, while generally giving thecompany high marks for its recent efforts, said the $470million increase in nonperforming assets shows how tough itwill be to reverse the company's slide unless the outlook forthe New England economy brightens soon.   In composite trading on the New York Stock ExchangeFriday, Bank of New England stock slipped 12.5 cents to$3.625.   Net interest income for the quarter was $161 million,compared with $262 million in the year-ago quarter. The netinterest margin shrank to 2.65% from 3.69% a year earlier,largely because of the higher levels of nonperforming assets.   Figures supplied by the company show that core retaildeposits -- certificates of deposit, checking accounts,savings accounts, and money market accounts issued throughits branch network -- have stabilized at about $15 billionsince early February. The company, which had $18.7 billion insuch deposits in mid-December, had experienced a sharpoutflow after it began to disclose its loan problems.   But stanching the outflow has come at a price: Bank of NewEngland has been offering some of the highest deposit ratesin the nation -- another reason for its slim interest margin.</TEXT></DOC>
