A police spokesman said the casualties occurred during athree-hour barrage by gunners of the Israeli-allied South LebanonArmy militia in the crowded market town, which has a population ofabout 100,000.   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,said the attack started after fighters of the mainstream ShiiteAmal militia ambushed an SLA squad on a road east of Nabatiyeh.   ``SLA casualties could not be determined, but judging by theretaliatory artillery barrage, it seems they've had somefatalities,'' the spokesman said.   The 2,500-strong SLA, backed by Israeli troops, patrols a narrowstrip of south Lebanon referred to by the Jewish state as thesecurity zone.   Israel carved out the 328-square-mile zone when it withdrew thebulk of its invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985,ending a three-year occupation of the region.   The zone serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrillainfiltrations into northern Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
