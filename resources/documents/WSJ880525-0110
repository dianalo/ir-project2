Defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meet in Brussels tomorrow specifically to decide how to finance the transfer of the U.S. 401st tactical fighter wing from Spain, which no longer wants it, to Italy, which does but doesn't wish to bear the costs alone.    The question of who pays the estimated $500 million for building a new base for the 72 F-16s is simply the tip of a much larger issue known as burden sharing, a phrase American officials increasingly use to argue that Europe should pay more of the cost of maintaining its own defense now that America is a major debtor nation. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Howard Taft IV has been in Europe recently, politely urging a greater defense contribution by Europeans to head off a growing inclination in Congress to draft legislation dictating more European burden sharing -- or else.    On the narrow issue at hand, several European nations would like NATO simply to absorb the cost of relocating the F-16s by using a special joint &quot;infrastructure fund,&quot; designed to finance $11 billion of NATO construction projects between 1985 and 1990.    The U.S. will argue that NATO members should cover most of the costs of the new base by adding to the fund. Otherwise, it will shrink and NATO will have to postpone other programs, U.S. officials believe.    A debate among allies over burden sharing &quot;is likely to go on for a good long time,&quot; one NATO official says. He notes that European NATO members plan to issue a report today countering the U.S. campaign for Europe to cover more of the alliance's costs. The report likely will press the argument that European nations already bear a heavy burden in programs that can't easily be expressed in dollars and cents; for instance, military conscription and removing land from the tax rolls for use as military bases.    High inflation in the cost of military hardware and declining birth rates in several Western nations will prolong this debate. Price rises for advanced technology weaponry well exceed consumer-price inflation, forcing military planners either to forgo modernization or reduce the size of their units to fit their pocketbooks.    A huge drop in the number of young men available for draft will accelerate the shrinkage of the military in the 1990s. The result will be further politically unpleasant decisions, including the use of older military reservists or the addition of more women in combat-related roles.    In March, West Germany became the first NATO member to devise a plan to meet this stark vision of the 1990s. One of its army reserve divisions will disappear and a second will be folded into the regular army to maintain its current 12 divisions. Tank-equipped West German armored infantry brigades will decline to six from 15 by the mid-1990s because the army no longer can afford to buy as many new Leopard II tanks. It will have to rely on overhauled, 30-year-old Leopard I's.    &quot;These are pressing developments which nobody can change,&quot; explains a West German army spokesman. &quot;Nobody can change birth rates. Modernization costs simply outstrip any foreseeable budget the public might approve.&quot;    Ortwin Lowack, a defense specialist for the conservative Christian Social Union in the West German parliament, says an effort to find more money to forestall the army's crisis is being hampered by West Germany's recent commitment to a $37 billion program to create a European fighter aircraft rather than buy an American one.    Smaller NATO nations will face a similar dilemma even sooner because their costs per weapon system are higher, says Olav Brundtland, a defense analyst at Norway's Institute of International Affairs. To cope with the declining number of men in military services, he says, Norway plans to &quot;open up more places for women.&quot;    Stefano Silvestri, vice president of the Italian Institute of International Affairs, says the Italian government is studying a new government report stating that planned military-buying programs will cover only two-thirds of the hardware needed by the mid-1990s. &quot;Instead of burden sharing, we have to confront the cost of maintaining,&quot; he says.    According to Gen. Sir Hugh Beach, a former master general of the Ordnance, which buys the British army's weapons, the army has been sidestepping costly modernization decisions for years. For example, he says it quietly dropped plans to build a modern tank in 1981 as too costly.    Instead, in the 1990s, it will buy more Challengers, an updated version of an earlier tank.    Gen. Beach believes that the no-growth defense budgets recently adopted by the U.S., Britain and other NATO nations will make shrinkage of defense forces unavoidable, especially because politicians sometimes intentionally underestimate cost increases by as much as half of inflation. He doubts the debate over burden sharing will help the allies resolve their budget problems unless they talk more honestly about the need to cut spending.    &quot;It is better to negotiate {reductions} with allies and the {Warsaw Pact} opposition than to fudge them and pretend that they aren't happening, which is what we've been doing up to now,&quot; he says.    The only bright spot for NATO, he says, is that &quot;the Russians must be in the same bind as we are.&quot; NATO analysts predict wrenching demographic changes for the Soviet army in the 1990s as the number of white Russian recruits drops sharply. They will be replaced by non-Russian-speaking Asians who may not share their political and cultural values, raising sticky questions for Moscow.    The Soviet army's modernization program continues. But in the last three years, the Soviet navy has been conducting fewer exercises, leaving newly built warships tied up at the dock for extended periods, according to a recent U.S. Navy report.    Rear Adm. William O. Studeman, head of U.S. Navy Intelligence, recently told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee that &quot;economic constraints&quot; may be one reason why the Russians are conducting fewer maneuvers. </TEXT></DOC>
