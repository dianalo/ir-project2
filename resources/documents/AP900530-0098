Protest groups and police shared one problem: Gorbachev'schanging schedule.   ``The bad part is it doesn't give us much time to plan how toprotect him,'' said Richard McDrew, agent in charge of the SecretService in San Francisco. ``The good part is it doesn't give apotential assassin time to plan, either. If we don't know exactlywhat he is going to do, neither does anyone else.''   The flags of the Baltic republics will fly Sunday in Minneapolisto show Gorbachev that emigrants in Minnesota support the push forindependence by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia.   ``We will be demonstrating for Baltic independence, not againstGorbachev coming here,'' said Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian-Americanmember of the Governor's Commission on Eastern Europe.   ``Our ultimate goal is to show Gorbachev that `Everywhere you gothere will be people who feel the same way that they do back inEastern Europe,''' Berkholtz said.   Between 500 and 1,000 people of Eastern European descent areexpected to participate in non-disruptive demonstrations during thesix hours the Soviet president is in Minnesota.   After Minnesota, Gorbachev will go on to San Francisco, and thenleave the United States on Monday.   The planned Minnesota demonstrations ``are not meant to offendanyone,'' said Walter Anastas, the Ukrainian representative on theGovernor's Commission on Eastern Europe. ``We want to express toGorbachev and to our fellow Minnesotans that we have concerns aboutthe human right of national self-determination.''   ``We're planning a peaceful demonstration, in keeping with thepeaceful revolution in the Baltics,'' said Joe Sidas, spokesman forthe Baltic Alliance in San Francisco.   Security will be tight.   Sharpshooters will be posted on buildings at every location theGorbachevs will visit in California. Dozens of Highway Patrol carswill line the 35 miles between San Francisco and StanfordUniversity during their drive Monday to the campus.   McDrew said the Secret Service will have hundreds of agents inSan Francisco from around the country leading a security operationthat will involve thousands of officers.   The San Francisco Police Department will have 1,775 officers andthe Stanford University police will have 30 officers, bolstered bySanta Clara County sheriff's deputies, to deal with demonstrationsplanned by Armenians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Soviet Jewsand Eritreans from Ethiopia.   Minnesota State Patrol Chief Kevin Kittridge said tentativeplans are for 150 to 200 state troopers from around the state to bebrought into St. Paul for Sunday's visit. ``We've canceledeveryone's day off,'' he said.   But in Minneapolis, police Sgt. Keith Oldfather said there'sbeen no blanket prohibition on officers taking a scheduled day offSunday and that he doesn't expect one, although he said plans arenot firm because Gorbachev's itinerary is not set.   ``It's very likely we won't know until the last minute or lastday exactly what we are going to do, in which case all our planningand worrying was for nothing,'' said Minneapolis police Lt. JimHeimerl.   If Gorbachev ventures into crowds to talk with protesters, as hehas in the past, it will present a risk, said McDrew, but one thatthe Secret Service is preparing to handle.   ``Extemporaneous visits and unplanned movements are things we'vehandled before,'' he said. ``It's pretty difficult sometimes. JohnF. Kennedy didn't want a bulletproof top on his car in Dallas. We'dlike to have the best security at all times, but we have to adaptto the circumstances.''</TEXT></DOC>
