Secretary of State G. William Diamond said Wednesday that evenif people claim a park bench as their residence and a food bank astheir mailing address, they must be permitted to register to vote.   He said all reasonable action must be taken to ensure the votingrights of the homeless.   ``Any denial leaves a homeless person, whose survival depends onpolitical decisions, with no political recourse,'' Diamond said.   He outlined the policy in a letter to registrars, citingsuccessful court challenges in other states to residencerequirements that restrict the voting rights of the homeless.   The president of the Maine Town and City Clerks Association,whose members had expressed concern to Diamond about the lack of aconsistent policy on homeless voters, said his liberalinterpretation of residency requirements probably would generateopposition, particularly in rural areas.   ``Some of the clerks are not going to be happy with that,'' saidBrenda Caldwell, town clerk in Gorham.   Diamond said estimates of homeless people living in Maine rangefrom 500 to 2,000.   In Portland, Maine's most populous city, a registrar saidofficials in recent years have routinely assigned homeless peoplethe address of City Hall so they may vote.</TEXT></DOC>
