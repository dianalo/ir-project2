The group, Revolutionary Justice Organization, also demandedthat Israel allow all 55 Palestinians deported during the uprisingagainst Israeli rule of the occupied territories to return home.   Also Sunday, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said anIsraeli soldier it holds could be killed unless Israel frees thecleric. The Hezbollah leader, Hussein Mousawi, also admitted forthe first time that the party wields influence over the kidnappersof foreign hostages.   Israeli officials refused comment on both the RevolutionaryJustice and Mousawi statements. Earlier, they said the cleric,Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, would only be freed if two Israelisoldiers and an air force navigator held in south Lebanon werefreed.   In Washington, Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said, ``Wewouldn't comment on it in any way. ... We try not to react to eachindividual rumor or report. It's a very fluid situation and thatdoesn't do any good.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for aconference of U.S. and Mexican Cabinet members, was asked about thedemands for Cicipio's release and he said ``our well-establishedpolicy is not to negotiate with terrorists.   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simplysee a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world.''   He reaffirmed the U.S. policy of neither concurring in norobjecting to the Israeli position of offering to negotiate withhostage-takers for the release of captives in Lebanon.   The proposal by the Revolutionary Justice Organization made nomention of freedom for any of the other 15 foreigners held inLebanon.   It was contained in a handwritten statement, written in Arabicand delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar. Aninstant photograph of American hostage Edward Tracy, whom the groupalso holds, was sent along with it.   It was the first time Revolutionary Justice has said it wouldfree Cicippio, 58, a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986.   The statement cited ``the flexible stances declared by theparties concerned and the encouraging regional developments thatherald happy endings to the hostage problem'' for making theexchange offer.   The group threatened last week to kill Cicippio if Israel didnot free Obeid, who is affiliated with Hezbollah and was abductedby Israeli commandos July 28. Israel accused Obeid of instigatingattacks on the Jewish state.   Less than an hour before the deadline set for Cicippio's death,Revolutionary Justice said it was ``freezing'' the execution orderand substituting it with an ``initiative'' calling for Obeid'srelease and freedom for Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held byIsrael.   Sunday's statement said the new demands represented the``practical stages of the initiative,'' and added, ``Its successcould be an adequate introduction to curb the dramatic developmentsof the hostages issue.''   In Norristown, Pa., one of Cicippio's brothers, Thomas Cicippio,said he was not happy with the offer because it did not mentionfreedom for the other foreigners held in Lebanon.   Meanwhile, in the Lebanese town of Baalbek, Mousawi met withforeign reporters and was asked what would happen if Obeid were notfreed.   ``If we find out that the interests of Islam and Moslems and theinterests of the oppressed dictates that one of the Israelisoldiers be killed, so will it be,'' he responded.   He also said that if the United States ``is able to help itselfand help its hostages by stopping its support for Israel and by notparticipating in anything that hurts Moslems in Lebanon... thiscould encourage Hezbollah to think of a way to help resolve thehostage issue.''   Mousawi said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holdinghostages are ``known to us, and we hold consultations with themfrom time to time.''   It was the first time Hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it hascontacts with groups holding hostages.   It has denied having anything to do with the abductions but isgenerally believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem extremistsholding most of the captives.   Mousawi also lauded the reported slaying of U.S. Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins, saying ``Bravo for the Oppressed on Earth,because challenging the Islamic nation should not continue.'' Buthe also said he could not confirm Higgins was dead.   The pro-Iranian Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimedon July 31 that it had hanged Higgins because of Israel's refusalto free Obeid. Higgins' body has not been found.   There are 16 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University inBeirut when he was abducted. Tracy is a writer. His date ofabduction is unclear, but Revolutionary Justice claimed Oct. 21,1986, that it had abducted him.   The photograph with the statement Sunday showed Tracy from thewaist up. He wore a brown t-shirt, had a bushy white beard and wassmiling broadly as he looked into the camera.   Elsewhere Sunday, U.N. mediator Marrack Goulding said familiesof hostages in Lebanon should not lose hope and said there is a``kind of subdued optimism'' about prospects for arranging ahostage swap.   He met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk El Sharaa as part of hiseffort to break the stalemate in the hostage crisis and todetermine Higgins' fate.</TEXT></DOC>
