A final rule on this subject waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> June 10, 1986 (at 51 FR 21114). The rule wassubsequently amended on November 21, 1986 (at 51 FR 42166), and again onApril 29, 1988 (at 53 FR 15539). The present amendment proposes to amendandSection;544.73 to require that an inmate possess either a prior, verifiedhigh school diploma or General Equivalency Degree (GED) and be functioningat the 8.0 academic grade level before that inmate can be assigned to aperformance pay or Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (UNICOR) work positionat the grade one level, or be assigned to an incentive pay (piece rate)position. The existing rule requires that the inmate be able to demonstrateachievement of at least an 8.0 academic grade level before being assignedto either grade one, two, or three pay positions. The proposed amendmentis made in recognition of the higher standards of literacy required inthe workplace, and in the belief that grade one and incentive pay positionswarrant the higher standard. The rule allows the Warden to make exceptionsto this policy for good cause.The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a major rulefor the purpose of EO 12291. The Bureau of Prisons has determined thatEO 12291 does not apply to this rule since the rule involves agency management.After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisonshas certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, Room 767,320 First Street NW., Washington, DC 20534.
