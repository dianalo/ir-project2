But she and her family suffered anyway for their lineage,and now she is seeking justice.   Mrs. Akselrod, 52, who immigrated to the United States in 1979,has written to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev seekingposthumous rehabilitation for her father, Sergei Sedov, whom shenever met. Though he was not a follower of his ostracized father,he was exiled to Siberia, where he died.   Heartened in part by the recent rehabilitation of scores of foesof Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Mrs. Akselrod said in a recentinterview that the Soviet government also ought to clear Trotsky'sname and document his true role in the 1917 revolution.   Trotsky, once a leader of the revolution, was expelled from theSoviet Union by Stalin in 1929.   ``Now, 60 years later, they're trying to decide who was right orwho was wrong,'' Mrs. Akselrod said. ``They're trying to do what anarcheologist does; brush dust from bones. But they're afraid tobrush all the bones, to admit the whole thing was wrong.''   Mrs. Akselrod, a paint chemist living in New Brunswick, N.J.,asked Gorbachev in the letter dated March 18 to help establish theexact time and circumstances of her father's death. She said she isseeking information, not compensation.   ``Compensation would never cure (the suffering). What could Iget, what could I ask for?'' she said. ``I want the historicaltruth.''   She said she has not received a reply to her letter.   The name of Trotsky, taboo since his denunciation by Stalin, wasmentioned publicly for the first time in decades in a speech Nov. 2by Gorbachev. Earlier this month, the party newspaper Pravdapublished an article acknowledging Trotsky's role in the revolution.   Trotsky helped direct the 1917 coup that brought the Bolsheviksto power, served as a deputy to Vladimir Lenin and created andcommanded the Red Army in a civil war againstcounterrevolutionaries.   Trotsky, whose real name was Lev Bronshtein, envisioned a``permament revolution'' that would spread across Europe. But afterLenin's death in 1924, Trotsky lost a power struggle to Stalin, whopreached ``communism in one country.''   Trotsky was expelled from the party, deported and reviled as atraitor. He left the country with his wife, Natalia Sedova, andtheir oldest son, Lyova, an active follower of his father. Trotskywas assassinated in Mexico in 1940.   Under Stalin, those suspected of being ``Trotskyites'' werehunted down and imprisoned or killed. But Sedov, who had taken hismother's name in an effort to avoid persecution, remained in theSoviet Union.   ``He decided to stay because he had nothing to do with(Trotsky)'' and thought he was safe, Mrs. Akselrod said.   Mrs. Akselrod remembers her mother's glowing accounts of herfather as a man talented in science and math but dogged for most ofhis life by the legacy of his father, with whom he never got along.   In 1936, about three months before Yulia was born, Sedov wassent to Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, in one of Stalin's sporadiccrackdowns, she said. According to Western historians, Sedov wasgiven work as an engineer in a factory and later died in whatSoviet newspapers called an ``accident'' while trying to organize amass protest.   Natalia Sedova later wrote that she was sure her apolitical sonwas murdered.   When Mrs. Akselrod was nearly 2, her mother, HenriettaRubenstein, was arrested. Yulia was sent to live with her maternalgrandparents in Moscow.   In 1951, when she was 15, her grandparents were arrested forbeing ``socially dangerous elements.'' Yulia was sent to anorphanage for three months, then to prison to live with hergrandparents for a month. Then she was shipped off to Kolyma, asmall Siberia village, to live with her mother until her graduationfrom high school, she said.   ``Because of my youth, I was never convicted or sentenced,'' shesaid.   Yulia returned to the Moscow area in 1954, a year after Stalin'sdeath, studied chemistry and eventually married, telling only twopeople of her past.   ``You cannot imagine Russia in these years. Nobody could saythat name out loud,'' she said. ``I was scared my whole life.''   Though life improved slightly under Stalin's successors, Mrs.Akselrod said she was determined to leave the country. Finallyduring detente, with the Trotsky name still taboo, Mrs. Akselrodemigrated with her husband and son.   Her mother died last year in Tallinn, the capital of SovietEstonia, at age 77. With no other relatives alive in the SovietUnion, Mrs. Akselrod said she finally felt secure seeking moreinformation about her father's fate as Trotsky's son.   ``I do not hate him personally. I just hate his ideas,'' shesaid of Trotsky. ``This system killed me for 40 years. It is his(system) _ his and Lenin's.''</TEXT></DOC>
