GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parent company of United Airlines said Fridayit was considering a $6.5 billion buyout proposal from a group thatincluded the company's employees, senior management and BritishAirways PLC.   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said it had received and wasreviewing the $300 a share proposal, which tops an earlier offer of$6.19 billion, or $275 a share, by investor Marvin Davis, and waswilling to consider other offers as well.   UAL's announcement capped a week of frenzied takeover speculationinvolving the nation's biggest airlines and kicked off a full-scalebidding war for the Chicago-based company, parent of United Airlines.   The UAL board also indicated that Davis had informed it that hemight sweeten his current offer to more than $300 a share after hereviewed confidential corporate data.   No decisions were made, but the UAL board said a committee ofindependent directors would consider any proposals or financialalternatives available to the company.   The stock of UAL, parent of United Airlines, jumped $7.25 to $287a share Friday on reports that United's pilots union, management andBritish Air was preparing a bid for the carrier.   Under the proposal made by the group, British Airways wouldcontrol 15 percent of the consortium that would acquire UAL. Underfederal law, foreign carriers may not control more than 25 percentof a domestic carrier.   The employees, including the pilots and staff of UAL, wouldparticipate through an employee stock ownership plan that would holda majority of shares. In return the employees would agree tounspecified wage concessions, the UAL board said in a statement.   The management element of the consortium would include StephenWolf, UAL's chief executive officer, and Jack Pope, its executivevice president.   Wolf would be asked to sit on the board of British Airways, andSir Colin Marshall, British Airways' deputy chairman and chiefexecutive, would sit on the UAL board.   In a prepared statement, Wolf said the buyout proposal did notcontemplate the sale of any essential assets or the revision of itsplans for fleet expansion and new routes.   British Airways, the world's biggest international carrier,issued a statement saying it had agreed in principle to invest $750million in the consortium in a combination of junior and seniorsecurities.   British Airways Chairman Lord King said the proposal would allowUnited and British Airways to form ``the most formidableinternational partnership in every part of the globe.'' United isthe second largest U.S. airline.   Earlier reports about the group's proposal indicated the pilotsunion might put up as much as $1 billion, with funds coming from twoof the union's pension funds, one of which is overfunded.   The rest of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed.   United pilots said in a statement they were pleased the employeeownership plan was being considered.   ``We look forward to a positive response from United's board ofdirectors to our joint labor-management proposal.''   Also Friday, the leadership of the flight attendants' union atUnited approved a resolution directing its representatives to pursueparticipation in employee ownership of the airline.   ``The airline is in play and we intend to protect our members'interests,'' said Pat Friend, president of the Association of FlightAttendants United unit. ``An employee stock ownership plan forflight attendants may be the best way ... to do that.''   A relationship between United and British Airways would furtherlink two of the world's biggest commercial airlines.   UAL has a fleet of 421 aircraft serving more than 151 cities inNorth America and the Pacific region.   UAL also owns 50 percent of the Apollo computerized reservationsystem, one of the nation's largest, with British Airways holding an11 percent stake in that business.   British Airways in December 1987 entered into a joint marketingagreement with United that included the sharing of facilities atfive major U.S. airports plus joint marketing.   Davis' bid for UAL and the recent buyout of NWA Inc., parent ofNorthwest Airlines, have ignited a speculative fever in airlinecompany stocks.   But the U.S. Department of Transportation hinted Wednesday it maymove soon to curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in theairline industry.   Jeffrey Shane, assistant transportation secretary for policy andinternational affairs, said the agency was concerned that a highdegree of debt from an airline buyout could compromise an airline'ssafety.</TEXT></DOC>
