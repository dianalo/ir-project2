A strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper for Americanconsumers while hurting American exporters by raising the cost oftheir goods overseas.   While some economists applaud the dollar-bashing efforts of theGroup of Seven industrialized nations, others say the group'sattempts to lower the dollar are either inadequate or misguided.   The debate over the dollar's proper level isn't just academic:the dollar's value affects everything from the trade deficit andinflation to jobs for American factory workers and the price of abottle of imported wine in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.   The Group of Seven nations began flooding the market withdollars from their reserves after agreeing Saturday in Washingtonthat the dollar's rise in recent months was ``inconsistent withlonger run economic fundamentals.''   The central banks knocked the dollar sharply lower Monday, butcontinued intervention on Tuesday produced only a slight furtherdecline. The dollar actually edged up against the Japanese yen onTuesday in New York.   Those who support attacks on the dollar say the dollar atcurrent levels makes American goods too expensive in world marketsand will cause the nation's trade deficit to start rising again.That could cost jobs of Americans who work in industries affectedby world trade.   ``I think it was highly timely that the G-7 finally moved and atleast temporarily has been able to sober the markets,'' saidWilliam Cline, senior economist at the Institute for InternationalEconomics in Washington.   But other economists favor leaving the dollar alone, arguingthat it is more important to focus on how well the domestic economyis faring. Right now, they say, the economy is doing well.   Trying to knock the dollar down by flooding the market withdollars or lowering U.S. interest rates could reignite inflation,says that school of economists.   ``We're walking a very fine line between making sure the economygets enough juice and appearing to flood the economy with too muchfuel,'' said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at KleinwortBenson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.   Setting policy in light of the dollar instead of focusing oneconomic conditions could throw off that delicate balance, Kahansaid.   Even those who support dollar sales by the central banks say thetactic won't work all by itself, any more than a lion tamer couldindefinitely hold hungry lions away from a pile of pork chops.   Global investors will keep buying dollars as long as theybelieve they can get a high rate of return on U.S. investments,such as Treasury bills, factories and real estate.   Worldwide currency trading has nearly doubled in the last threeyears to well over than $300 billion a day, enough to swampintervention by central banks over the long run, Cline said.   ``What we have to do is have the dollar come down as aconsequence of a reduction in our budget deficit, which would causelower interest rates in the United States, and it would be thatmechanism that would bring down the dollar,'' he said.   Cline said he favors action to cut the trade deficit because theUnited States is in danger of eventually becoming another Brazil, adebtor nation forced to lower its living standards to make paymentsto foreign creditors.   But Kahan said, ``The United States is not just anothercountry.'' Foreigners are accumulating IOUs from the United Statesbecause they see the country as a good place to invest, he said.   ``We should look at the trade balance but not get overly wrappedup in it as a problem,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
