The company earned $3.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $64.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. The per-share figure is adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in September.    The mail order clothing distributor said it hasn't seen any significant fall in incoming orders despite recent talk of consumer caution. The company said its orders continue to be well above those at the similar time last year and only slightly below those prior to the plunge in the stock market Oct. 19. </TEXT></DOC>
