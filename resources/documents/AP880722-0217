The agreement would settle a lawsuit brought by the group, theEnvironmental Defense Fund, said Ellen Silbergeld, toxicologist forthe fund.   However, the Justice Department still must approve thesettlement before it can be submitted to the judge, said AliciaTenuta, EPA's spokeswoman for toxic substances.   The case had been scheduled to go to trial on Monday.   The 135 dioxins and dozens of related compounds are consideredhighly toxic because one of them is the most powerful cause ofcancer ever tested in laboratory animals. There is some evidencethat dioxins can cause birth defects, but in humans the mostsignificant known effect is the appearance of chloracne, a form ofacne, among people exposed to high concentrations.   The dioxins are formed in tiny amounts as a byproduct of almostall combustion and as unwanted reaction products in certainchemical reactions. Almost all humans have trace amounts in theirfatty tissues.   ``It will be the first time EPA has considered dioxin at thesource. All their programs have been cleanup programs,'' Ms.Silbergeld said.   The fund sued to force action under the Toxic Substances ControlAct, which allows petitions like the fund's for restrictions onchemicals that pose an ``unreasonable risk'' to health or theenvironment.   ``We were addressing them anyway,'' Ms. Tenuta said. But underthe settlement, if approved, ``There are various hammers(deadlines) that come into play'' for making decisions on whethercontrol measures are needed and when to adopt them.</TEXT></DOC>
