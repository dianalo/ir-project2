The orchestrated walkout began at 9 a.m. CDT as agreed Thursdaybetween the company and members of the United Transportation Unionto avoid snarling thousands of Chicago-area commuters who ride Candamp;NWtrains from the suburbs.   But the fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands ofCongress, where the House was scheduled to consider a version of aSenate bill passed Thursday that would impose a settlement betweenthe UTU and railroad.   ``It is scheduled to be the first thing up ... It will be rushedto the president, the president should sign it within an hour orso,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.   However, consideration of the bill was delayed, and a vote wasnot expected until the afternoon, said Mike Bushman, an aide toRep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill.   Candamp;NW is a leading Midwestern freight hauler and also runscommuter trains serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's suburbs.   Union members had planned to walk out at 12:01 a.m., when a36-day cooling-off period in the dispute ran out, but held offuntil 9 a.m. after Simon and Bruce helped persuade the railroad topostpone layoffs of freight brakemen.   The bill would implement recommendations of a presidentialemergency board and cut 689 brakemen in its 10-state freightoperations. The railroad had sought to lay off 1,150. The board wasappointed by President Reagan in April.   ``Right now we know of no opposition in the House,'' Simon saidThursday.   Union representatives said Thursday the dispute should beresolved at the bargaining table and not on Capitol Hill.   ``It would be a great injustice to the working man if they passthis (Simon) law,'' said Don Markgraf, general chairman of the UTU.``The politicians should be home getting elected instead of foolingaround in labor disputes.''   Some union members threatened to stay off the job no matter whatCongress decides.   David Wells, a brakeman, said union members planned to dispersewithin a 100-mile radius of Chicago and not be available to becalled back to work today because they were angry about Candamp;NW'shandling of the dispute.   ``Most of our people were docked pay'' during a brief, two-hourstrike Aug. 4, Wells said. ``We informed our commuters that wedidn't anticipate there would be an evening rush hour.''   Markgraf said he hadn't heard of such a plan and attributed itto rumors.   Candamp;NW officials said intervention was needed to avert a strike.   ``In this case collective bargaining did not work and we'rehappy Sen. Simon stepped in,'' said Leslie Cleveland, a railroadspokeswoman.   Under the Railway Labor Act, Congress and the president haveauthority to settle railroad disputes that threaten nationalcommerce.   The railroad and the union have been battling for more than ayear over the size of crews on Candamp;NW freight trains.   The company contends the brakemen's jobs are obsolete; the unionargues the brakemen _ two on each train's crew _ are neeeded tomaintain safety.   The UTU struck Candamp;NW for about four hours Aug. 4, after anearlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. Congress,however, ended that strike quickly by imposing a second cooling-offperiod _ which expired today.</TEXT></DOC>
