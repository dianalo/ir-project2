(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chunks missing from a Titan 4 motorafter a recent ground test could mean a delay in the firstscheduled launch of the rocket in October, the San Jose MercuryNews reported Wednesday.   The test was conducted Feb. 14 at the San Jose researchfacilities of United Technologies Corp., whose engineers, alongwith Air Force specialists, are trying to find out if a flaw mightrequire retesting or redesign, the newspaper said.   U.S. space officials have been counting on the Titan 4 to carryinto orbit dozens of satellites.   ``There are some chunks missing, not terribly large,'' spokesmanRick Huling of the El Segundo Air Force unit said. ``I think in oneparticular case the burn was down fairly close to the metal on theoutside of the (nozzle) casing. If the flames had burned throughthe remaining insulation and ruptured the metal nozzle case, thenyou've had it.''   A smaller Titan 34D rocket exploded April 18, 1986, duringlaunch at Vandenberg Air Force Base when some insulation brokeloose inside the motor. The heat burned through the rocket's outerwall.   The Titan 4 launch, scheduled for October from the Kennedy SpaceCenter at Cape Canaveral, Fla., would take up a classified militarypayload that analysts have said is a satellite equipped with aheat-sensitive infrared telescope to spot nuclear missile attacks.   ``We have a backlog of space shuttle-size loads,'' said Huling.``The Titan 4 is, in fact, going to be the substitute for anythingthat doesn't need a man up there in space. I would say we need toget up there as quickly as possible.''   The manned shuttle program was put on hold after the Challengerexplosion, with the target date for the next launch set for Aug. 4.</TEXT></DOC>
