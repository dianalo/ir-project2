Bankers have taken extra care to educate consumers about the pros and cons of variable-rate lending. The American Bankers Association was even lauded by some critics for its recent consumer-education efforts about home-equity loans. ABA bankers are also involved in other projects designed to educate consumers and lenders about sound debt management.    Your article perpetuates a disturbing myth that variable-rate loans represent a &quot;gamble,&quot; an &quot;economic wild card&quot; and cause borrowers to &quot;lose control of their ability to manage their money.&quot; You fail to mention the prudent underwriting standards used by lenders to grant credit and the protections this provides borrowers in rising-rate environments.    According to ABA's consumer credit delinquency report, most consumers handle their debt responsibly. In fact, the first-quarter delinquency rate on seven types of consumer loans was 2.19%, the lowest in several years.    Despite the rapid growth of home-equity lines of credit from approximately $20 billion in 1985 to about $70 billion in 1987, it is estimated that only 8% of consumers who have equity in their homes have taken out a home-equity loan. In addition, only about half of the home-equity credit granted so far has actually been drawn on.    James D.
