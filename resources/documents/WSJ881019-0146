It records the Reagan administration's last opportunity and most recent failure to fulfill one of the many political promises that was made before November 1980.    The Reagan administration failed to reform LSC because it failed to understand that this private corporation, which is funded by Congress and by diverting interest from private bank accounts into its pools of cash, is a huge and highly sophisticated political organization and network. Its correct name should be &quot;Political Services,&quot; not &quot;Legal Services.&quot;    LSC is a political-corporate giant that had a 1982 net income larger than every bank in the U.S. except five, and in 1988-89, there is little change in this comparison. In early 1981, LSC held $19 million in cash in one of its nine regional offices, which was dedicated solely to federal and state political activity. This is more political money than the Republican and Democratic national party organizations will spend on George Bush and Michael Dukakis in 1988, which is estimated to be about $16 million.    In 1979-80, LSC spent millions defeating Proposition 9 on the California state ballot. In 1988, its political system will spend or allocate millions to the Bush-Dukakis race. All of it will be devoted to Mr. Dukakis. LSC has written and published books that teach its people how to politically target and destroy identified individuals. In Congress, it can use the likes of a Kastenmeier or Rudman or Morrison to attack any targeted person. The attack on Clark Durant III, in an effort to disrupt his function as LSC chairman, is the most recent but not the first example.    The Reagan administration failed because it took a &quot;zero-dollar&quot; or &quot;defunding&quot; or &quot;OMB&quot; approach to LSC, rather than a &quot;political&quot; approach to it. Almost without exception, the White House staff members in the 1980s never understood what LSC had become even before they took their offices in January 1981. They simply refused to comprehend that politically (and at every level) LSC was much better organized than the Republican Party they said they represented. LSC apparatchiks presented more political pressure in Congress than the East Wing of the Reagan White House, and this on every occasion when they thought their political and ideological interests were at issue.    To this day, I suggest, the Reagan administration does not understand how the political structure in LSC assisted the Republican loss of the Senate in 1986, the defeat of Judge Robert Bork, or blocked funding for the Contras in Central America. A &quot;zero-dollar approach&quot; permitted the administration to believe that intense political questions such as these and LSC, may be addressed through a profit-and-loss statement, or a budget recommendation. Sen. Denton said that LSC was the single-greatest political blunder in the Reagan administration.    As a result, LSC's political cancer, so powerfully inserted into the American social order as the 1980s commenced, has fully metastasized, even though several people such as a Clark Durant III, or a LeaAnn Bernstein and others gave their all to stop it, and to convert it into a legal-services delivery program.    William F. Harvey   Professor of Law   Indiana University   Indianapolis   (Prof. Harvey was LSC chairman of the board in 1982.)    ---   Getting the facts after the fact isn't the way I thought the news business was supposed to work, but in light of the &quot;low fact content&quot; of the Journal's editorial blast at the Legal Services Corp. and at the exercise of my subcommittee's oversight responsibility over the LSC, several facts are clearly called for in response.    The fact is that the LSC provides a vital service to thousands of indigent citizens who otherwise would not be able to afford legal representation.    The fact is that the corporation has spent millions of dollars since 1985 to monitor LSC programs for alleged abuses alluded to in the Journal's editorial, but to date not one program has been defunded as a result.    The fact is that many in Congress who voted against LSC funding did so not because they want to reform the corporation, but because they want to obliterate it.    The fact is that those who support zero funding for the LSC have had an ally in President Reagan for seven years.    Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier (D., Wis.) Chairman   House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts,   Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
