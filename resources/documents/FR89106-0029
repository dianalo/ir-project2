In this issue of the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> we are publishing a final rule, titled ``Useof Irradiation as a Quarantine Treatment for Fresh Fruits of Papaya fromHawaii,'' Docket No. 87-040, that authorizes irradiation as a quarantinetreatment for papayas intended for movement from Hawaii to the rest ofthe United States and its territories. The minimum required absorbed dosageof radiation for this treatment is 15 kilorads (krads). We have determinedthat this minimum dosage will prevent introduction of the oriental fruitfly, the Mediterranean fruit fly, and the melon fly into the continentalUnited States and into uninfested off-shore areas of the United States.In evaluating the potential environmental impact of this irradiation, wehave reviewed documents prepared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)regarding the treatment of food products by irradiation. The FDA has preparedan environmental assessment (EA), finding of no significant impact (FONSI),and final rule (51 FR 13376, Docket No. 81N-0004) concerning irradiationin the production, processing, and handling of food. The FDA regulationspermit use of irradiation at doses not to exceed 1 kGY (100 krad) to inhibitthe growth and maturation of fresh foods and to disinfest food of arthropodpests, and permit use of irradiation at doses not to exceed 30 kGY (3,000krad) to disinfect dry or dehydrated aromatic vegetable substances (spicesand herbs) of microorganisms. They additionally require that irradiatedfoods be labeled at both the wholesale and retail level to show that theyhave been treated, and require that irradiation treatment records be maintainedand be available for FDA inspection. We have reviewed these FDA documentsto determine their applicability to gamma irradiation treatment for papaya,as allowed by our final rule, published in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> For the purpose of the treatment of papayas,we have determined that potential environmental effects have been adequatelyconsidered by the FDA, and we concur with the conclusions of that agency'sEA, FONSI, and final rule. We have documented this concurrence in our FONSI.The FDA documents, and the FONSI that we issued based on our review ofthose documents, provide the public with analysis of environmental effectsthat may be associated with the irradiation of papayas at levels not exceeding100 krad.The following is a summary of the facts supporting our FONSI:1. No adverse environmental effects are anticipated at food processingfacilities using a radioactive source to sterilize food. Similarly, noadverse environmental effects are anticipated from the transportation ofradioactive sources for the irradiation treatment.2. Machine-generated radiation sources are subject to the Radiation Controlfor Health and Safety Act of 1968 and must comply with appropriate reportingrequirements (21 CFR Part 1002) established by the Bureau of RadiologicalHealth, FDA.3. No cumulative effects of radiation are expected from eating irradiatedfruit. The process would treat papayas only for disinsection, and wouldnot expose humans to gamma radiation. The process does not make the fruitradioactive (21 CFR Part 179, 51 FR 13376, Docket No. 81N-0004).4. The FDA has determined that chemical differences between irradiatedfoods processed at less than 100 kilorads and nonirradiated food are toosmall to affect the safety of the food (21 CFR Part 179, 51 FR 13376, DocketNo. 81N-0004).5. There is no evidence that insects or microorganisms surviving irradiationgive rise to mutants with undue resistance to radiation or of abnormalvirulence (21 CFR Part 179, 51 FR 13376, Docket No. 81N-004).6. The FDA has determined that concerns over potential adverse human healtheffects (abnormally high rates of testicular tumors, kidney disease, deathin offspring, lessened life spans, and abnormal increase in white bloodcells) were not substantiated (21 CFR Part 179, 51 FR 13376, Docket No.81N-0004).7. The FDA has determined that there was no evidence to conclude that foodirradiated and stored under normal handling practices would show increasedproduction of aflatoxin (a toxic fungal metabolite implicated in the causationof liver cell carcinomas, produced by some strains of <T3>Aspergillus flavus</T3> and <T3>Aspergillus parasiticus</T3> in stored products) (21 CFR Part 179,51 FR 13376, Docket No. 81N-0004).8. To the extent that irradiation replaces fumigation by toxic chemicals(ethylene trioxide and ethylene bromohydrin), there is a reduction in theamount of toxic residues of these substances in the environment. (21 CFRPart 179, 51 FR 13376, Docket No. 81N-0004).9. No reduction in vitamin, mineral, nutritional content, or quality offruit is expected. A delayed senescence (aging) of the papayas may be expected.Based on the foregoing, we have determined that the irradiation of papayasat levels not exceeding 100 krad will have no significant impact on thehuman environment.The FDA environmental assessment, our review of that document and the FDAfinal rule, and our finding of no significant impact have been preparedin accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council of Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 3rd day of January 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
