Journal on cutting U.S. troop strength:   With the pain and consternation at the Pentagon in the aftermathof the outbreak of peace, it is difficult to distinguish trialballoons from real plans among the resulting announcements andleaks.   Nonetheless, the disclosure that the Army proposes to cut troopstrength by 25 percent by 1997 is a reasonable strategy, if worldevents stay on their trend toward peace.   The Department of Defense should not be so quick, however, toreduce strength in the Reserves and National Guard.   The proposal is to reduce active duty personnel from 764,000 to580,000 and Reserve and National Guard forces from 776,000 to645,000.   With a downsized regular Army, the strategic importance of areserve of trained and organized manpower takes on greaterimportance.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 15   Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald on the legacy of the Vietnam War:   The (Vietnam) war put a tarnish on our national nobility.American policymakers couldn't convince Americans that the war wasright, and the rest of the world was equally doubtful. Thefoundation of American moral leadership was cracked, and it hasn'tbeen completely repaired.   Then, there were the thousands who first found political powerthrough opposition to the war. The Civil Rights movement had shownthe way, and the Free Speech Movement ... had trained new cadres.   But it was the war that energized so many young people, thatbrought them into the streets and later into the political process.This politicization would have happened in any case, but the warmade it happen in a particular way, and that way has had a profoundinfluence on how today's world works.   The years of that war _ the longest war in American history _were years that molded the nation. We don't know yet just how.   The war is a part of the nation's unfinished business _ thedivisiveness, the bitterness, the doubt, the grief. These allremain. It is understanding and acceptance that still elude us. ...   Perhaps, the longing for them in the nation's soul is as greatas the grief in the nation's heart and the doubt in the nation'smind.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 13   Philadelphia Daily News on Lithuania:   It would be quite a picture. The Seminole nation _ in fulltribal regalia _ pleads with Mikhail Gorbachev to pressurePresident Bush for the return of their half of Florida, which thewhite man stole.   The photo op would be spectacular, but Gorbachev would never buyit. Nor would he intervene if the people of California tried tosecede from the United States.   Fortunately for all of us, President Bush has taken the same _and proper _ position regarding independence movements within theSoviet Union.   Quietly and firmly, Bush makes it clear that the use of militaryforce to squelch the independence movements in places likeLithuania, Estonia or Latvia would not sit well with Americans.   But he refuses to repeat the mistakes of 1956, which saw theEisenhower administration seemingly supporting the Hungarianrevolution only to find itself helpless when the Soviet tanksrolled into Hungary to crush the revolution. Some feel, even today,that the anticipation of American intervention helped inspire thatuprising _ and the brutal Soviet overreaction.   But 1990 is not 1956. Gorbachev has demonstrated in word anddeed that he wants to encourage peaceful and democratic changethroughout the Soviet spheres of influence. ...   As they prepare for the arms control summit next month, Bush andGorbachev know it would be insanity to abolish one form of massdestruction while inviting another form of carnage. Their cautious,yet consistent, approach to the promotion of peaceful change isencouraging, and deserves the support of everyone who wants theprocess to continue.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 15   Los Angeles Daily News on Lech Walesa the politician:   Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa injected more excitement intoEastern European politics ... when he bluntly ``confirmed'' hisinterest in becoming president of Poland, in remarks attributed tohim by the official Polish news agency PAP. About 24 hours later,however, Walesa executed a remarkable about-face, although hedidn't quite describe it that way.   ``Today on radio and TV, I hear that Lech Walesa agreed to bepresident. I didn't say so at all,'' Walesa insisted. ...   Walesa has picked up a decidedly American political trait _ notallowing himself to be pinned down about future plans.   Walesa claimed that he had been ``cajoled'' into making astatement about his presidential ambitions and was misunderstood.``I simply did not guard my tongue enough somewhere,'' he said.   Obviously, Walesa has developed another skill that Americanpoliticians long have been famous for _ how to make excuses.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
