The president, after meeting with Nobel Peace Prize laureateDesmond Tutu, invited Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of theUnited Democatic Front in South Africa to visit the United States,White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   ``The president shares the archbishop's abhorrence ofapartheid,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president promised to stress hisopposition in every way possible. The asministration will belooking at ways to best use American pressure, influence andleverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, said heurged Bush to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending hiscountry's apartheid policies of racial separation and said he wasenouraged the president had a ``warm openness'' to that cause.   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters,adding he had been impressed that Bush appeared to genuinely abhorapartheid, that he wanted to be ``a catalyst for change'' and ``apositive influence.''   Tutu and two other anti-apartheid leaders, Revs. Allan Boesakand Beyers Naude, who met briefly with Bush at the White House, didnot disclose the specifics of their conversation. Tutu indicated,however, they did not ask for specific initiatives other than thatBush urge Pretoria to negotiate with its opposition.   Asked about the discussion, Tutu said: ``We said we wanted tohelp the United States ... to take the moral leadership of theworld in helping to end apartheid and bringing the South Africangovernment to the negotiating table, which is our primary end.''   Although the White House said a day earlier that Bush does notintend to back further sanctions against Pretoria to press forsocial change, in essence maintaining the policy of PresidentReagan, the leaders were upbeat after the meeting.   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the doorstands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu said.   At a news conference later, the group said Bush and Congressshould support sanctions that would squeeze the economicallystrapped South African government and force it to the negotiatingtable.   Boesak also urged Bush to take advantage of indications of arecent Soviet shift in southern Africa toward more pragmaticpolicies or ask himself ``the question: will we be trailing behind(Kremlin leader Mikhail) Gorbachev again?''   If Bush fails to understand the importance of resolving theSouth African problem for the stability of the region and forsuperpower relations, ``then it's not only our funeral, it's histoo,'' Boesak said.   The meeting itself was seen as a small victory for theanti-apartheid activists.   Under President Reagan, whose veto of anti-Pretoria sanctionswas overridden by Congress, ``we had the idea that here was aposition that was taken and there was no further possibility ofeven discussing the issue. Here we have a feeling that thepresident has not closed his mind to any possibility of how hecould best be helpful in the South African situation,'' said Boesak.   ``And the very fact that he values the opinion of those of uswho represent black people in South Africa, that in itself is asign that we did not get in the same measure from the previousadministration.''   The White House session was scheduled as U.S. officials werepreparing for the visit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected tosucceed President P.W. Botha after Botha resigns in September. DeKlerk would be the first top South African leader to officiallyvisit here in 30 years.   Tutu, as well as Democrats in Congress, said Bush's failure tomeet with the trio would have shown his unwillingness to support anend to South Africa's racial segregation system.   Anti-apartheid leaders believe a window of opportunity may becreated both by the new U.S. administration and by the anticipatedchange in their country's leadership. De Klerk has called forpolitical reforms, although he has ruled out completeenfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85 percent of the nation'spopulation.   The Reagan administration argued that sanctions impoverish SouthAfrica's 28 million blacks rather than forcing the government toreform.</TEXT></DOC>
