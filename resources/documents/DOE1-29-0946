Significant speedups over the serial versionof the FORTRAN code have been obtained by using bulk shared memoriesto expedite information passing between the attached array processors.In this manner the authors have been able to obtain data for chains with128 and 256 units. Data on these larger chains indicate that the radiusof gyration follows the predicted power law.</TEXT></DOC>
