But there is just one government, and that is the United States government. If there is an indictment in this case, the indictment will not read &quot;The President v. John Poindexter.&quot; It will not read &quot;The Congress v. John Poindexter,&quot; and it will not read &quot;Lawrence Walsh v. John Poindexter.&quot; It will say &quot;The United States of America v. John Poindexter.&quot;    So Richard Beckler, Admiral Poindexter's counsel, complained to the Iran-Contra panel yesterday. He said his client had officially been notified that he was a target of Mr. Walsh's grand jury. He said the government should choose which investigation it wanted to pursue; &quot;Not to try to hammer someone for four or five days in public and then follow up with a criminal indictment.&quot; To no one's surprise, the panel refused his request either to lift the subpoenas or remove the TV cameras, but we can once again see the confusion sowed by the notion of an &quot;independent&quot; prosecutor disembodied from the real world.    At this stage, is Mr. Walsh really going to indict Lt. Col. Oliver North? After witnessing days of hostile questioning on national television, 69% of the American public opposes his criminal prosecution (according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). Even columnist James Reston, scarcely a defender of the Reagan administration, suggests a presidential pardon of Mr. North.    Aside from the difficulty in impaneling a jury that hadn't already formed opinions about the Marine, there is the matter of finding a law that was violated. The Boland amendments carried no criminal penalties, but the word is out that Mr. Walsh may charge a conspiracy to violate Boland and apply the penalties of the conspiracy laws. Or he may charge a broad conspiracy to defraud the government, even though the central players did not directly profit. No ordinary federal prosecutor would want to base a case against such sympathetic defendants on such technical charges; this would be the work of a prosecutor with nothing else to do.    This is clearly a matter of prosecutorial discretion, and since this is among the most superior powers of the executive branch, we've argued that &quot;independent prosecutor&quot; is a constitutional oxymoron. The Constitution gives the president the duty to faithfully execute the laws; Congress can't mandate a court to appoint its own lawyers to prosecute executive-branch personnel. Those who justify the appointment point to Article II, section 2, which says that Congress can appoint &quot;inferior officers,&quot; that is, that Congress need not approve every clerk in the executive branch. Nearby, we publish the lively June 3 discussion on this issue between three circuit court judges and Lawrence Walsh's deputy, Guy Struve (see &quot;Walsh and Shultz: What Is the Difference?&quot; -- WSJ July 16, 1987). Mr. Struve was driven to admit that his argument meant that independent prosecutors are inferior to no one, including the president.    In a little-noticed court ruling last Friday, D.C. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. opened the way to imposing some discipline on Mr. Walsh. When Brendan Sullivan Jr. first filed suit on behalf of Lt. Col. North challenging Mr. Walsh on separation-of-powers grounds, Attorney General Edwin Meese protected Mr. Walsh's investigation by giving him a parallel appointment inside Justice. Despite this, Mr. Walsh has considered himself independent, and Mr. Sullivan has continued his suit.    After the June 3 hearing, the appeals judges sent word for the district court to hold off on deciding the constitutional challenge and instead decide whether Mr. Walsh is or is not an employee of the Justice Department. In answer to this, Judge Robinson wrote, &quot;Although {Mr. Walsh} believed his new office to be outside the Department of Justice, his acceptance of the appointment under the regulation indicated his consent to the precise set of duties and relationships described in the regulation.&quot; In other words, whether either man likes it or not, Mr. Meese is Mr. Walsh's boss.    Which means that the attorney general is accountable for Mr. Walsh's actions. For example, getting Contra fund-raisers Carl Channell and Richard Miller to plead guilty to tax evasion charges that the Internal Revenue Service told us were never considered criminal violations before, and that Assistant Attorney General John Bolton says were based on &quot;a wacko theory.&quot; Or in another example ignoring diplomatic immunity and foreign-policy considerations in trying to subpoena former Israeli agent David Kimche.    If Mr. Walsh is a Justice Department employee, as Judge Robinson ruled, the Justice Department has duties to perform -- such as allocating the resources of its budget. Mr. Bolton, Mr. Meese or Mr. Reagan should start issuing some guidance to Mr. Walsh, starting with what kinds of office space he can rent -- and limiting the legal theories he can try out.    This is a green light for President Reagan to reclaim his presidency, and undo the damage to the executive branch that he and Mr. Meese have abided. Congress has enough powers of its own without being able to reach into the executive, snatch prosecutorial discretion, and turn it against the executive by criminalizing policy differences. </TEXT></DOC>
