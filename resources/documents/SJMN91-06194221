The visit also will include stops in South Korea andAustralia.;    Kaifu, speaking at a joint press conference, said the presidentcould count on a warm welcome in Japan. Both men sought to play down strainsin the U.S.-Japan relationship that have been heightened this year bylingering resentment over what many in Congress saw as Japan's reluctant rolein support of the war.;    The administration, concerned that Japan's tradesurplus with the United States is rising again, has stepped up efforts toreduce that imbalance by trying to pry open Japanese markets to more Americanproducts from rice to computer chips.;    America's trade deficit with Japantotaled $41 billion last year, or close to half of the total $101 billion U.S.trade deficit.;    Both leaders conceded that they had not made progress onthe issue of removing Japan's near total ban on rice imports, although theyagreed to continue discussing the issue in the context of global free tradetalks.;    In those discussions, known as the Uruguay Round, The United Statesis pushing for significantly reduced barriers to trade in farm goods andbelieves that Japan's removal of the ban on rice imports would serve as a prodto get European countries to agree to sharp reductions in their farm subsidyprograms.;    Speculation that Kaifu might be prepared to offer concessions onthe rice issue died away after a leaked U.S. State Department memo on theissue caused a furor in Tokyo because of what was seen as its heavy-handedtone.;    Kaifu was able to resolve one dispute with the United States overthe level of Japan's contributions to the war effort. Just before leaving forhis visit with Bush, Kaifu's Cabinet approved an additional $500 million,which was designed to make up for currency fluctuations that caused Japan topay about 5 percent less than the $9 billion Kaifu had pledged when the warstarted in January.;    Bush said the payment had &quot;totally resolved&quot; thedispute between the two governments.;    &quot;Some elements in this country appearto want to bash Japan,&quot; Bush said, warning that various disputes between thetwo nations should not threaten the economic ties.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kennebunkport, Maine  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910712  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  522  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 12, 199100194221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
