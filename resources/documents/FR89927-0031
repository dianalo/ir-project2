The revision reflects an amendment to 7 CFR 1.122 publishedelsewhere in today's issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that provides a general exemption under 5 U.S.C.552a(j)(2) for the two systems of records, and indicates that the preexistingexemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) is more specifically under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)and (5).The routine use revision applies to all OIG systems of records, USDA/OIG-1through USDA/OIG-6, and replaces previous routine use provisions with revisedand additional routine uses. Disclosure for routine use is authorized bythe Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), as amended.The revision to the procedures for access to records or for contestingrecords applies to USDA/OIG-2, ``Intelligence Records, USDA/OIG.'' Theseprocedures are added to bring this system of records into conformity withother USDA/OIG systems of records procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Paula Hayes, Assistant InspectorGeneral for Policy Development and Resources Management, Office of InspectorGeneral, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 (202-447-6979).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Notice of revision of Privacy Act Systemsof Records was published on pages 11253-11255 of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 17, 1989, to become effective upon finalpublication of 7 CFR 1.122 published in proposed form n pages 11204-11206of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 17, 1989. Comments were received fromtwo sources regarding proposed 7 CFR 1.122 and are published elsewherewith the final rule in today's issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The two sources also commented on the routineuses in the notice of revision. The following summarizes the suggestionsreceived and actions taken.It was suggested that routine use of (2) was necessary since the disclosurescould be accomplished with the consent of the subject of the record. Obtainingthe consent of the subject, however, often would be impracticable. Forexample, a subject could not be expected to give consent to release ofinformation where the agency sought either to establish a claim or takean adverse personnel disciplinary action against the subject, or to bringa suspension or debarment action concerning the subject. It also shouldbe noted that routine use (2) is not unique, but largely duplicates currentroutine uses in other agencies.It also was suggested that routine use (3) was not compatible with thepurpose for which the records were collected. The routine use providesfor disclosure to assist governmental and nongovernmental agencies in takingresponsible action. OIG is required by section 4(a)(4) of the InspectorGeneal Act of 1978, Public Law 95-452, 5 U.S.C. App., to coordinate withFederal, State, and local agencies, and nongovernmental entities, withrespect to its mission and responsibilities. Therefore, disclosure of recordsto these entities in circumstances defined by the routine use would beconsistent with the purpose for which the records were collected.It was suggested further that routine use (3) was unnecessary since thedisclosures could be accomplished with the consent of the subject of therecord. Obtaining the consent of the subject, however, often would be impracticable,and otherwise notifying the person when a record is made available underthe routine use could prematurely reveal an intestigation.It also was suggested that the routine use concerning disclosures relatedto court proceedings (formerly (5)) could be overboard. That routine usehas been deleted and relaced by two routine uses, (5) and (6), patternedafter those developed by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition,routine use (8) (formerly (7)) has been changed to reflect this replacement.It was suggested that the routine use concerning disclosures of medicalinformation (formerly (9)) was unnecessary since subsection (b)(8) of thePrivacy Act already provides for this. That routine use has been deleted.It also was suggested that routine use (11) should note that any contractorreceiving records must be subject to the Privacy Act under the provisionsof subsection (m). Routine use (11) has been changed to note the requirement.It was suggested that routine use (12) was unnecessary since subsection(b)(7) of the Privacy Act already provided for disclosure to a grant jury.Recent case law, however, raises concerns regarding the usefulness of subsection(b)(7). The Office of Inspector General collects records for law enforcementpurposes. Routine disclosure for use by a grand jury, therefore, wouldbe compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected.It also was suggested that routine use (14) was overly broad in authorizingdisclosure to recipients who take action that benefits the Government.Routine use (14) has been changed to clarify the requirement that informationmay be disclosed only when the action taken benefits the programs and operationsof the United States Department of Agriculture.Accordingly, USDA hereby amends the OIG Systems of Records last publishedbeginning on page 50814 of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 12, 1985, by revising the followingsections:<ITAG tagnum="66"> USDA/OIG-1</ITAG>System name:Employee Records, USDA/OIG.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categoriesof users and the purposes of such uses: (1) A record from the system of records, which indicates, either by itselfor in combination with other information, a violation or potential violationof law, whether civil or criminal, and whether arising by statute, regulation,rule or order issued pursuant thereto, may be disclosed, as a routine use,to a Federal, State, local, or foreign agency or other public authoritythat investigates or prosecutes or assists in investigation or prosecutionof such violation, or enforces or implements or assists in enforcementor implementation of the statute, rule, regulation or order.
