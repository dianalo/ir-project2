Clark Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><TEXT>   These are anxious days on the economic front, and the overriding question in the wake of the Crash of '87 is: How will the stock market's plunge affect general business activity?    A final answer may not be in for many months, but in the meantime it may be helpful to keep a watchful eye on some barometers that over the years have tended to indicate where business is -- and where it may be going. By and large, these are reported in various places in this newspaper as they emerge from statistics mills in Washington and elsewhere.    In light of the heightened concern about the economic outlook, however, a weekly pulling together of such data -- above and beyond such daily barometers as the stock, credit and currency markets -- may be useful. This will be done in this space each Monday, even though most of the data will have appeared during the preceding week. Also presented here will be a brief report on some indicators that are scheduled to be released in the week ahead.    The October collapse in stock prices almost guarantees a drop in the leading indicators for the month. But there were positive factors, including the length of the average workweek and real M2 growth.    Earlier statistics for new jobless claims suggest that employment statistics for November will be relatively stable. Chain store sales for November will be an early indicator of pre-Christmas business.    Sales of existing homes, reported last week, were unexpectedly strong, rising 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3,560,000. The National Association of Realtors said the gain was due in large part to home buyers switching to adjustable-rate mortgages to finance their purchases instead of fixed-rate loans.    The initial rates on adjustable mortgages usually are lower than those on fixed-rate loans, so the adjustable loans were especially attractive early in October, when mortgage rates were rising. Since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, however, mortgage rates have been falling. The Realtors think this is helping existing home sales in November. Based on the performance of existing homes, new home sales probably rose in October too.    M1, the narrowly defined money supply, is being watched more closely now than has been the case in the past two or three years. The statistical relationship between the money supply had seemed to be breaking down, and the Federal Reserve stopped paying much attention to the statistics for M1.    After the stock market crash, however, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan stressed that he would supply the banking system with ample liquidity. So it was comforting to see the M1 number rise sharply in the first two weeks after the market collapse. More recently, however, the rise in M1 has slowed, raising questions as to the Federal Reserve's plans.    ---                 The Economy in Numbers          Statistics Released in the Past Week                                                  Change                                                  (from prior                                      Total       period) Durable goods orders Advance, Oct.
