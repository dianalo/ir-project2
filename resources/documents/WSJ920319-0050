Somatogen, a Boulder, Colo., biotechnology concern, isracing other companies to find blood substitutes thateliminate the threat of infection from blood-borne organisms,such as the AIDS virus. Researchers are developing syntheticblood, recycling outdated human blood, and chemicallytreating and purifying hemoglobin from other animals. Theworld-wide market for blood substitutes has been variouslyestimated at $5 billion to $8 billion a year.</LP><TEXT>   In a report published in this week's issue of Nature,Somatogen and researchers at the Medical Research CouncilLaboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England,described a new, genetically engineered form of hemoglobinsynthesized in bacteria.   Hemoglobin is the blood component that carries oxygen totissues. Naturally occurring hemoglobin must be chemicallymodified to prevent it from breaking down into substancesthat harm the kidneys and to improve its ability to releaseoxygen to tissues, said Gary Stetler, Somatogen vicepresident of research and development. But the chemicalprocess is complex and difficult to control, Mr. Stetlersaid.   As described in the Nature article, Somatogen's newesthemoglobin molecule needs no chemical modification and thusrequires 12 fewer steps than the company's previoushemoglobin technology, which required some chemicalmodification. The new process allows greater control over theproduct and reduces its cost, Mr. Stetler said.   Somatogen believes that, unlike other blood substitutesbeing developed by competitors using human or animal blood,its newest synthetic blood won't be limited by supplysources. Moreover, the company hopes consumers will have moreconfidence in the synthetic product's purity since it doesn'tuse blood as a raw material.   Somatogen's hemoglobin is currently undergoing early humantesting for safety but not for efficacy. If the testing andapproval process goes as planned, Somatogen could be ready tomarket the blood substitute in three years, Mr. Stetler said.   Other companies working on blood substitutes are BaxterInternational Inc., Deerfield, Ill.; Alliance PharmaceuticalCorp., San Diego; DNX Corp., Princeton, N.J.; Biopure Corp.,Boston, in which Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., has a majorinvestment and a marketing agreement; and a number of closelyheld companies.   Somatogen has been a hot stock since it went public at $19a share in August. The stock peaked at $50.50 in January buthas since cooled with the rest of the biotechnology group,closing yesterday at $30, up 25 cents, in over-the-countertrading.</TEXT></DOC>
