American expects to place an initial order for about 100 planes with delivery beginning in 1991 or 1992, a company spokesman said. The airline estimated the new jets would cost about $30 million apiece.    Based on 100 jets, the initial order would be valued at about $3 billion. However, American said it hasn't made a firm decision yet on the number of aircraft it will order.    A spokesman for American said the plan is still &quot;very speculative,&quot; but said the company believes it must make a decision soon on replacing its Boeing 727s with more fuel-efficient planes so the manufacturer can proceed with production.    American said it is evaluating three aircraft models: Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s 7J7, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-91/92, and Airbus Industrie's A-320. Airbus is a government-supported consortium of French, West German, British and Spanish companies.    American said two of the models -- the Boeing 7J7 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-91/92 -- exist only in design. Each would use new propfan engines, which are powered by high-speed propellers and are significantly more fuel efficient than current jet engines.    American said it is studying &quot;stretch&quot; versions of the aircraft, which would carry 15 to 25 more passengers than the 150-passenger Boeing 727, because it believes airtraffic constraints may eventually force the industry to fly fewer planes.    In its most recent major aircraft order, American split a $2.5 billion order between Boeing and Airbus. The carrier has a total of 386 planes with more than 100 additional planes on order.    A spokesman for Boeing's commercial airplane unit said the seating capacity for the 7J7 airliner hasn't been officially determined, though in its initial planning stages it has been considered about a 150-seater. He said preliminary design discussions are under way with a number of airlines, including American.    Boeing hopes to have one or more &quot;launch customers&quot; for the 7J7 before the end of this year, with the first deliveries of the proposed airliner due in 1992. The company has said it selected that year because it determined that 727s and older DC-9s in airline fleets would be ready for replacement at that time. </TEXT></DOC>
