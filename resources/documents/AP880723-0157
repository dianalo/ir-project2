Hanna Andrievna Sverstiuk, who had a brain tumor removed atChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia, was listed in stable conditionin the intensive care unit, said spokeswoman Martha Phan.   ``She's doing real well,'' Phan said.   Neurosurgeons removed the core of Hanna's brain tumor during anearly six-hour operation Friday and awaited test results todetermine whether the growth is benign or malignant. Phan said theresults are expected by Monday.   Hanna's mother, Maria Sverstiuk, has said she believes thewalnut-sized tumor that was at the base of the child's brain stemresulted from the radiation of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, 50miles from Kiev in the Soviet Union.   Hanna was born in Kiev five days after the April 26, 1986,explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released acloud of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe.Two months ago, Hanna was diagnosed as having a brain tumor.   Dr. Leonard A. Bruno, a neurosurgeon, said it is unlikely thatexposure to Chernobyl's radiation would cause a solid tumor, thetype of growth removed from Hanna's brain, in an infant.   ``Radiation can be the cause of tumors of any kind,'' he said.``However, the type of radiation one would get from a situationlike Chernobyl has a much longer latency period _ 10 to 20 years.''   The toddler's trip to the United States followed efforts ofUkrainian communities on both sides of the Atlantic andnegotiations between officials in Washington and Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
