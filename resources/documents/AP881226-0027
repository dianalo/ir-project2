The white-robed pontiff, speaking from the balcony over the mainentrance to St. Peter's Basilica, appealed for help for AIDSsufferers and for help for survivors of the devastating earthquakein Soviet Armenia.   ``Let forces be joined and efforts be increased to help those inneed, with whom Christ himself wished to identify himself,'' saidthe leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics.   The pope, wearing a glittering gold miter and carrying a stafftopped by a cross, said Sunday that the beauty of Christmas lies inthe fact God sent his son as a poor person.   ``The poor under every label, old and new, have a place in themystery of Christmas: those suffering and dying of hunger, therejected, the disinherited, refugees, the victims of hatred, ofwars, of natural disasters,'' he said in Italian.   John Paul II devoted several minutes of his address to thosesuffering from illnesses, including aquired immune deficiencysyndrome.   ``I think of them all, and to all of them I say: do not losehope,'' the Polish-born pope said. ``These words are addressed aboveall to the victims of AIDS, called to face the challenge not only ofthe sickness but also the mistrust of a fearful society thatinstinctively turns away from them.   ``I invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of thesebrethren of ours, and, as I assure them of my deep affection, Iexhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to findan effective treatment for this mysterious illness,'' he said.   ``May the concerted efforts of science and love soon find thehoped-for remedy: this is the hope that I lay at the crib of thenewborn savior.''   About 70,000 people who packed St. Peter's Square under sunnyskies listened quietly to the traditional message. Different groupsburst into applause when the pope, in his conclusion, offeredChristmas greetings in 44 languages.   The address was broadcast directly to 15 countries, including theSoviet Union for the first time. It was shown on television later orin partial form in 35 other nations.   The speech marked one of the few occasions on which the68-year-old pontiff has discussed AIDS. He first publicly addressedthe issue during a 1987 visit to San Francisco in which he told AIDSsufferers that ``God loves you all without distinction.''   He also expressed sympathy for AIDS victims earlier this month,saying the church must consider them ``brothers and sisters.''   In a major statement on AIDS earlier this year, the Vaticannewspaper L'Osservatore Romano said that the spread of the diseasemust be arrested and people must ``overcome ethically aberrantbehaviors.''   It said that sexual permissiveness was the true cause of theproblem.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spreadmost often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared bydrug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnantwomen to their offspring.   The Vatican condemns homosexuality and the use of artificialbirth control. It has criticized campaigns advocating condoms tostop the spread of AIDS.   The pontiff gave Sunday's address after saying Mass in St.Peter's for about 8,000 people, ranging from diplomats to the HolySee in black morning coats to tourists in blue jeans.   Earlier, he celebrated midnight Mass before thousands of peoplein the Basilica.</TEXT></DOC>
