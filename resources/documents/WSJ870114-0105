The department also proposed future changes in its system for evaluating oil, natural gas and coal produced from federal lands for royalty purposes. Officials said coal companies would save about $10 million to $12 million a year from these changes, while oil producers would come out about even. Officials didn't give any estimate on the future effect on gas producers.    William Bettenberg, head of the department's Minerals Management Service, said the retroactive change &quot;would help rectify past instances of inflated royalty charges.&quot; The proposed future changes in valuation methods, he said, &quot;more closely reflects actual market prices.&quot;    The announcement is sure to spark complaints from Indian tribes and states on one hand and industry on the other. The tribes and states would lose the $100 million in royalties returned to the gas producers and receive smaller payments in the future under the proposed changes. Oil, gas and coal producers, meanwhile, have claimed the agency's valuations for royalty payments are too high and the new proposals stop short of what the industry wanted.    The federal government acts as trustee for the Indian lands, collecting royalties and disbursing them to the tribes; in addition, states get a share of the royalties on federal leases within their borders. The states and the tribes accuse the Interior Department of allowing the owners of mineral leases to underpay the royalties, largely by undervaluing their production.    Companies that produce minerals from leases on federal and Indian lands pay royalties ranging from 12.5% to 25% of the value of the mineral. Thus, their payments shrink if the value of the mineral, which is set by the Interior Department, is reduced.    The proposed retroactive cut in gas valuation stems from the growing disparity between the market price for gas and the ceiling price set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Until last July, the Interior Department based its valuation on the ceiling price. But since 1982, a glut of gas and the availability of low-priced oil have forced market prices below the ceiling price for an increasing amount of gas. Mr. Bettenberg said that in one case, the market price was so far below the ceiling that the royalty almost equalled the price of the gas.    The agency proposes to reduce its valuation of the most expensive category of gas as far back as May 1, 1982, and others retroactive to dates in 1983 and 1985.    Where oil, gas or coal sales are between unrelated producers and buyers, the agency proposal would base the value of production on the gross proceeds of such sales. Currently, the U.S. uses a price based on a majority of the sales from a given mineral field. Gross proceeds would include state severance taxes and &quot;take-or-pay&quot; payments, which are made regardless of whether the mineral is delivered. The industry wanted take-or-pay payments exempted.    The proposal also would allow producers to deduct from gross proceeds federal fees for reclaiming abandoned mine lands and payments to miners disabled by black lung disease, a change that benefits coal producers.    Where sales are between financially related entities, the proposal would base valuation on proceeds from similar sales by the same producer or others to unrelated entities. </TEXT></DOC>
