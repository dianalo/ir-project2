In 1985, he says, the dollar started to decline because foreigners were no longer buying dollar investments at a pace that would support the dollar's price. They had adjusted their portfolios, and their need for dollars fell.    &quot;In 1987,&quot; he continues, &quot;we had a different situation. Governments adopted the policy of trying to peg the exchange rate. I don't know what the right price of the dollar is, and no one else does either.    &quot;Governments decided they were smarter than the market. It was price-fixing. Japan and Germany have been buying the dollar. But they aren't fools -- not unmitigated ones, anyway. They aren't spending their own money; they're spending their citizens' money.&quot;    Mr. Friedman has been advocating floating exchange rates for many years, all through the period when nations, under the post-World War II Bretton Woods agreement, were trying to stabilize exchange rates internationally. These efforts, of course, are still going strong; the U.S. and its economic allies last week reaffirmed their determination to stabilize the dollar. So it's hardly surprising that Mr. Friedman ridicules attempts to find a &quot;proper&quot; level for the dollar and somehow keep it there.    What is moderately surprising is that most other economists also believe that governments should stop trying to manipulate the dollar and let it find its own level. Some of them think that the dollar, if allowed a little peace and quiet, might stabilize at a point somewhere near its current level. Others think that the dollar would fall a good deal more. This dissension, among economists who spend a good deal of time worrying about the dollar, backs up Mr. Friedman's point: No one knows the &quot;right&quot; level for the dollar.    James Tobin, a Yale University Nobel-prize winner, for instance, says it may take a further 30% depreciation in the dollar to bring the trade deficit down to anywhere near balance. Martin Feldstein, former head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, earlier this month said the dollar might drop to 100 yen &quot;within three or four years&quot;; the dollar is currently trading at around 126 yen.    The speculative nature of the dollar market was underscored by the response to Mr. Feldstein's remark. Traders recalled Mr. Feldstein's former position in the Reagan administration and wondered: Is he speaking for the White House? Does this mean that the president and Treasury Secretary James Baker are about to embark on another program of dollar-bashing? The dollar fell sharply.    What the market didn't remember was that Mr. Feldstein, while in the administration, was often at odds with it. If Mr. Reagan wished to leak such information to the market he would choose a more congenial channel than Mr. Feldstein.    No one is going to stop Mr. Tobin, Mr. Feldstein or other economists from making forecasts about the dollar or anything else. But forecasts, even by the most distinguished economists, by themselves aren't likely to move markets very much.    What matters is not what the economist knows but whom he knows. If he doesn't have an inside track to the White House, maybe he has been tipped off that the Federal Reserve is planning to buy a few billion dollars. Maybe he has heard that the reaffirmed stabilization agreement is about to collapse. In such circumstances his words acquire a weight they wouldn't have if they were based on intellect alone.    During the past year the Reagan administration has switched dollar policy so often that its credibility has suffered. &quot;Every time Jim Baker opens his mouth,&quot; says University of Rochester economist Karl Brunner in a bit of overstatement, &quot;policy changes.&quot; In mid-December the White House issued a statement that the U.S. isn't seeking a weaker dollar, and the statement helped the dollar market temporarily. After a while, traders decided that statement actually meant that the administration, while it wasn't actively seeking a lower dollar, wouldn't be at all unhappy to see the dollar fall. So the dollar rose, but not by much.    The administration has been trying to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by persuading Japan, Germany and other countries to stimulate their economies; the reasoning is that this would increase demand for U.S. exports and thus the demand for dollars. Mr. Feldstein thinks the U.S. should let other nations handle their own policies and spend more time on policies at home.    The deficit-reduction package that Congress managed to pass last week gets low marks from many economists; more is surely needed. Runaway budget deficits decrease confidence in the future of the dollar, and thus foreigners' willingness to hold dollar investments. Many economists, moreover, argue that the U.S. should rely more on taxes on consumption, such as a national sales tax, less on taxes on investment, such as capital gains taxes. Allan H. Meltzer of Carnegie-Mellon University, says this would help businesses increase productivity.    The dollar should be allowed to find its own level in the market. Let's stop trying to talk the dollar up or down. If speculators wish to continue to operate, let them guess at market factors, not the manipulative measures of government officials.    The result could be pleasantly surprising. </TEXT></DOC>
