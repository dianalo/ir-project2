Federal agents raided the headquarters of four futures marketsin lower Manhattan on Thursday, seizing documents from at least onefirm, subpoenaing traders and sending shudders through the frenetictrading pits.   But officials close to the investigations by the CommodityFutures Trading Commission and Manhattan U.S attorney's office saidthey were focusing on allegations of price fixing and otherpractices by a few individual traders and not the exchanges atlarge.   They said the FBI was not involved, unlike a separate two-yearundercover probe in Chicago where agents infiltrated commoditiespits and secretly tape-recorded traders.   ``It's not something that hits out at you and goes boom, boom,boom,'' one market official who asked not to be named said of thetrading practices being studied in New York.   The CFTC, which regulates U.S. commodity markets, subpoenaedtrading and broker records from the New York Commodity Exchange,the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York MercantileExchange and the New York Cotton Exchange, plus at least sixindividual traders.   The CFTC's civil probe is examining activities of more than 50traders over the past two years. An official said the subpoenasrequest information detailing disciplinary action, personal bankaccounts and about leasing expensive and hard-to-get memberships tonon-members.   The U.S. Postal Service executed two criminal search warrants atthe offices of MBF Clearing Corp., headed by Mark B. Fisher, aprominent trader on all four exchanges who was disciplined in 1985for trading violations.   ``I'd say he (Fisher) is one of the focuses of it. We'recertainly not limiting the case to just him,'' said Postal ServiceInspector Jack Ellis.   Melvin A. Brosterman, Fisher's attorney, said his client wascooperating with the government and had done nothing wrong.   Officials confirmed reports that the scrutiny includedpre-arranged trading, in which dealers agree to fix pricesbeforehand, and trades conducted to skirt tax losses or deferincome.   Critics consider the futures markets prone to fraudulentactivity partly because of the volatile, split-second atmosphere inwhich trading is conducted. Screaming traders wearing brightlycolored coats use hand signals and shouts to coordinate buying andselling of futures contracts on commodities from oil to orangejuice. Dealers and investors make money by speculating on thefuture prices of the commodities.   Other violations may have occurred in a practice known as``front-running,'' whereby traders execute trades for their ownaccounts before those of customers.   Traders legally are allowed to trade for both themselves andtheir customers but that practice, known as dual trading, has beenwidely criticized as a possible source of abuses.   While no indictments have been announced, the criminal probe ofthe Chicago markets, which are the nation's largest, reportedly hasinvolved more than 200 subpoenas and threats of racketeeringprosecutions.   In New York, meanwhile, exchange seats were selling for about$335,000 Friday on the Merc after plunging from $350,000 to aslittle as $285,000 Thursday after the probe was disclosed. Analystssaid a similar pattern followed news in January of the Chicagoprobe, and seats there now are selling at record highs.</TEXT></DOC>
