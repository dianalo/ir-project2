Securities Are Placed On Sandamp;P CreditWatch </HL><SO> </SO><CO> AMB </CO><IN> BON STK FIN </IN><DATELINE> OLD GREENWICH, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. placed $1.4 billion of American Brands Inc. securities on its CreditWatch list for possible downgrading.    The move affects American Brands' single-A-plus senior debt, single-A subordinated debt and preferred stock and single-A-1 commercial paper.    The securities were added to the list following disclosure that the tobacco and consumer products concern will meet with E-II Holdings Inc. to discuss possible moves to boost value for holders.    E-II is a Chicago-based holding company that owns several consumer-product and specialty-food businesses that were a part of Beatrice Cos.    &quot;A successful E-II takeover or a costly defense by American Brands could weaken creditor protection and could result in downgrades,&quot; the rating concern said. A spokesman for American Brands declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
