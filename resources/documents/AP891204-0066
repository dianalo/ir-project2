Guerrilla sources also claimed to have crushed a major offensiveby the communist government to retake strategic positions outsideKabul, the Afghan capital.   MIDIA, a news agency run by various guerrilla factions, reportedthat Brig. Gen. Ghulam Haider was killed Saturday when Mosleminsurgents launched an artillery attack on army headquarters inJalalabad.   Guerrillas said Haider was the third Afghan army general to bekilled in fighting in the past month.   The guerrilla news agency claimed three government army officerswere captured and a fourth defected during fighting outsideJalalabad.   The insurgents have been trying for nine months to capture thestrategic city.   The guerrillas also said three of their key commanders werekilled during the past week.   They said Khalid, a commander who uses only one name, died whenhe stepped on a mine outside Jalalabad while trying to retrieve thebodies of some fighters killed in an earlier clash.   Guerrilla sources said Khalid was a leader in offensives earlierthis year that eventually gave the insurgents control of the45-mile strategic highway leading from Jalalabad to the Pakistanborder.   The guerrilla news agency said commander Abdul Matin was hit inan artillery attack near Rodat, about 24 miles west of the Pakistanborder.   It said commander Zarab Gul Khomeni died along with five rebelsduring a weekend attack on government positions near Surkhrud, sixmiles west of Jalalabad.   The city has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting inthe guerrilla's 11-year-old war to overthrow successive communistgovernments in Kabul.   The insurgents began their battle for the city last March, aboutthree weeks after the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan. Theirdeparture ended nine years of Soviet military intervention.   Kabul's ruling communists control most of Afghanistan's citiesand the insurgents control most of the countryside.   The guerrilla news agency claimed that an estimated 3,000government troops, led by Afghan Defense Minister Gen. ShahnawazTanai, tried unsuccessfully to rout insurgents from posts atChakaray and Illajay, outside Kabul.   The fighting, which reportedly was centered about 18 milessoutheast of Kabul, could not be independently confirmed.   The guerrillas claimed they destroyed eight government militaryvehicles and killed 45 soldiers before repulsing government troops.They declined to say how many rebels were killed.   The guerrilla news agency also said that fighters ringing Khostused anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down a government transportplane Saturday. The report did not say how many people were onboard but that all were killed.   Insurgents have been fighting for months to capture Khost, about18 miles west of Pakistan.   The seven most powerful Afghan guerrilla groups are based inPakistan, which helps channel U.S.-supplied weapons to them. Moscowarms the Afghan government.</TEXT></DOC>
