(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 1989 Atlantic hurricane season,which began today, should be milder than last year's, a leadingstorm forecaster says.   Colorado State University professor William Gray predictedWednesday that there would be only four hurricanes and seventropical storms during the season, which runs through Nov. 30.   ``This will be a below-average year in the number of hurricanes,and they will be less intense,'' Gray, a teacher of atmosphericsciences, told a conference of the American Meteorological Society.   In the last six years, Gray has made near-perfect predictionsabout the number of hurricanes formed in the Atlantic, using reamsof data on such things as ocean temperature patterns.   Last year, there were six hurricanes, including Gilbert, aparticularly strong storm that killed more than 300 people andwrought heavy damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica andMexico; and Joan, which devastated parts of Nicaragua. In addition,there were five tropical storms.   Weather disturbances that begin in the tropics are classified astropical storms, and given a name, when their sustained winds reach39 mph. They are classified as hurricanes if their winds reach 74mph.   During the average Atlantic season 10 tropical storms developand six of them become hurricanes.   In Coral Gables, the National Hurricane Center on Wednesdayreleased the 21 names that will be given 1989 hurricanes andtropical storms in the Atlantic.   The names are: Allison, Barry, Chantal, Dean, Erin, Felix,Gabrielle, Hugo, Iris, Jerry, Karen, Luis, Marilyn, Noel, Opal,Pablo, Roxanne, Sebastien, Tanya, Van and Wendy.   Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane center, cautioned thatapathy and unfamiliarity with the destructive power of a majorhurricane could prove fatal.   In his annual hurricane awareness warning Wednesday, Sheetssaid: ``If a major storm strikes a coastal metropolitian centerthis year, the risk of fatalities is high because the endangeredpopulation will face congested evacuation routes, insufficientescape and too little experience in hurricane survival.''   His comments were echoed by other disaster officials, who saidthey fear that newcomers to a region and tourists, in particular,sometimes don't take storm warnings seriously enough.   ``Getting people to take hurricanes seriously is the biggestproblem,'' said Rick Scofield, assistant director of DisasterServices for Miami's Red Cross. ``When a community goes a long timewithout a major storm, they're less sensitive to the danger.''</TEXT></DOC>
