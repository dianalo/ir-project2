The Soviet-built Ilyushin-62 owned by Interflug, East Germany'sairline, was trying to take off when it swerved off the runway atSchoenefeld airport, smashed through trees and burst into flames.   East Germany's ADN news agency said 36 of the 113 people on boardwere hospitalized, 15 of them with serious injuries.   Among the 17 dead was a farmer hit by debris as the jetlinerroared through a field after its aborted takeoff, officials said.The rest of the dead were passengers.   Work crews continued Sunday to search the wreckage of thefour-engine aircraft, but ADN did not say whether passengers werestill missing.   ``Salvage work as well as the identification of bodies is verydifficult,'' ADN said.   According to ADN, ``nearly 100 of the (plane's 113) occupantswere able to escape before the fuselage was enveloped in flames.''   The news agency did not give a more specific figure. It saidsearchers recovered a flight recorder and began evaluating its dataon Saturday. Most aircraft carry cockpit voice recorders and flightdata recorders that register instrument readings, such as speed.   The passengers included 11 from the Soviet Union, two each fromItaly and Poland, and one from Nepal, while the remainder, includingthe crew, were East Germans, ADN said.   ADN said the airliner began its takeoff at 8:28 a.m. Saturday but``was unable to get off the ground even though the engines hadreached their full power, and tore about 500 meters beyond therunway ...''   ``The aircraft ... split into many pieces and burst into fire,''ADN said.   Some survivors said Saturday the plane had slightly lifted offthe runway but then slammed back down and raced across a field,smashing trees and other obstacles before catching fire.   Scores of passengers were able to leap though areas where thefuselage was torn apart or fled down emergency escape chutes, ADNsaid.   East German authorities had initially grounded the country'sfleet of Ilyushin-62 airliners, but ADN said five of the aircraftwere given renewed permission to fly following inspections of thoseplanes.</TEXT></DOC>
