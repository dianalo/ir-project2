Themission of the OJJDP is to provide leadership and resources to states andlocalities in implementing the mandates and goals of the JJDP Act, as definedby Congress, within the appropriations provided for the program annually,and in a manner consistent with the policies and directions establishedby the Executive Branch of government. The Act authorizes OJJDP to coordinate Federal juvenile delinquency programs,provide formula grants to states, provide information, training and technicalassistance, develop and implement effective programs, and conduct researchon juvenile delinquency and child victimization. Organization and Functions To implement the legislation and systematically confront the problems ofjuvenile delinquency and missing and exploited children, OJJDP conductsresearch, develops programs, demonstrates promising approaches, and disseminatesinformation and resources. OJJDP also coordinates Federal juvenile delinquencyprograms as well as programs for missing and exploited children. OJJDP FY 1988 Program Priorities Each fiscal year, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preventionfunds programs targeted at those issues deemed most critical in the juvenilejustice field. To ensure the development of well planned, cost-effectiveprograms, and fiscal accountability, OJJDP used a strategic planning processto garner input from the field, establish program priorities, and ensurethat decisions on the allocation of staff and resources reflect the directionof the Office.The following describes the four FY 1988 priority program areas developedby OJJDP: <ITAG tagnum="81">Illegal Drug Use Among High-Risk Youth </ITAG>Programs will be based on the concept of accountability of youth, theirfamilies, and communities_to promote zero tolerance for illegal drug use.Prevention and control of youth gang drug trafficking will be a major focus.Prototype programs for each component of the juvenile justice system willbe developed. Community-wide strategies will be designed to promote systemcoordination, and research will continue to increase understanding of therisk factors for youth involvement in illegal drugs to guide communitiesin combatting this problem. <ITAG tagnum="81">Serious Juvenile Crime </ITAG>Programs in this area focus on the individual components of the juvenilejustice system that impact on serious crime (e.g., law enforcement). Inaddition, a major emphasis is coordination across local system componentsto more effectively concentrate and direct resources to respond to seriousjuvenile crime. Demonstration and training programs promote the implementationof community-wide strategies to impact on serious juvenile crime and developcoordinated, consistent responses by all components of the justice system.Research will also continue on patterns of delinquent and criminal careersand the implications for prevention and control, which will assist localcommunities in developing more effective programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Missing and Exploited Children </ITAG>Programs in this area are designed to reduce the incidence of crimes againstchildren, particularly abduction and sexual exploitation, and to improvethe responses of agencies that are responsible for dealing with these crimes.Priority will be given to providing information, training, and technicalassistance to juvenile justice and other decisionmakers regarding effectivestrategies to address missing and exploited children. There will be a continuedemphasis on responding to missing children and their families who havebeen victims of abduction and/or sexual exploitation. Efforts to developbetter information on the scope and nature of the problem to inform policyand program development will continue. <ITAG tagnum="81">Jail Removal </ITAG>The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, as amended, callsfor the removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups as a conditionof receiving formula funds. OJJDP discretionary programs are aimed at developinginformation on appropriate alternatives to jails for different types ofjuveniles, and on assisting states and local jurisdictions to systematicallyplan and implement strategies to remove juveniles from adult jails andlockups. OJJDP Management Priorities Significant steps were taken in the previous fiscal year to improve themanagement of the Office in order to ensure the efficient development oftechnically sound and cost-effective programs. The focus of these effortswas the development and implementation of a program planning process, aprogram development process, and a monitoring process to ensure carefuland effective implementation of both the discretionary and formula awards.As a result of these efforts in FY 1987, approximately 62 discretionaryprograms were awarded totaling $28,280,970 to address all components ofthe juvenile justice system: prevention, law enforcement, adjudication,supervision and missing and exploited children. This fiscal year the management priorities will be to continue to: andbullet; Promote better planning between the discretionary and formulagrant programs to assist communities in developing innovative programsand providing better services; andbullet; Improve communication and procedures between the Office and otherstate and local juvenile justice agencies, grantees and contractors; andbullet; Initiate new methods and procedures for monitoring grants andcontracts as well as tracking the use of formula funds and states' compliancewith the legislative mandates; and, andbullet; Aggressively enhance the knowledge and skills of professionalsin the field by training, technical assistance, and dissemination of informationin a timely fashion regarding the best practices and latest informationon office activities and programs. OJJDP Program Development OJJDP programming is guided by a conceptual framework that defines theprimary purpose of a program in terms of its contribution to building acomprehensive strategy in preventing and controlling delinquency. As aresult, the Office is assisting the field by defining each of the componentsof the system, its operations and its relationship to other components,as a basis for developing programs to improve service delivery to youth.The programs that comprise the comprehensive strategy address three concepts:andbullet; <T3>Systemwide Development</T3>_Program development is focused on one ormore specific components of the juvenile justice system (prevention, lawenforcement/prosecution, adjudication, and supervision). The purpose isto develop state-of-the-art approaches to respond to specific problemsor issues, and to increase the effectiveness of each component of the juvenilejustice system in providing services to juveniles. andbullet; <T3>System Coordination</T3>_Program development emphasizes community organizationand planning strategies within programs focused on specific topics (e.g.,arson, gangs, etc.), as well as promotes systemwide program developmentand implementation efforts (e.g., SHOCAP, Effective Strategies Systemwide).These programs promote system coordination within one component area (e.g.,prevention) as well as among system components (e.g., prevention, law enforcement,and adjudication) and guide communities in implementing comprehensive strategiesthat maximize the use of resources. andbullet; <T3>System Operations</T3>_Program development is designed to enhance howthe system components function individually and cooperatively with regardto decisionmaking, information collection analysis, and utilization, aswell as resources management and assessment (e.g., Law Enforcement Handlingof Juvenile Offenders and Juvenile Court Management Training). Each systemcomponent must understand its own operations and decisionmaking processesin order to effectively participate in systemwide program development andcoordination. Through promoting systematic decisionmaking, informationcollection, resource management, and utilization, these programs enhancesystem operation and service delivery to youth and their families. The OJJDP approach to program development calls for research to developnew information; the application of research to the development of prototypes/programmodels; field testing or demonstration of prototypes in selected sites;and dissemination of prototypical programs and processes to states andcommunities nationwide through training and technical assistance. This approach to program development allows OJJDP to systematically trackthe development of programs; to monitor financial obligations and projectfuture expenditures; to ensure the information needs of future stages orphases of the project are considered in program development; and to periodicallyreassess its resource commitments to a program at the completion of eachdevelopmental stage. FY 1988 Program Planning Activities As with the previous fiscal year, the program planning process consistedof an internal review of existing programs as well as external input froma variety of sources: Juvenile justice policymakers and practitioners fromthe State and local levels, OJJDP grantees and contractors, State planningagencies and advisory groups, human service organizations and professionalassociations with interests in juvenile justice and related issues. The intenal planning process focused on the effectiveness of existing programsand projects to determine whether they should be continued, expanded, reorientedto another purpose or terminated. This process involved input from thestaff and management personnel. OJJDP engaged in five primary activities that comprised the external planningprocess for fiscal years 1987 and 1988: andbullet; Program Development Seminar_convened to provide information regardingcritical juvenile justice issues from the perspectives of practitionerexperts. andbullet; Program Development Workshop_convened to identify key juvenilejustice issues and develop specific program strategies utilizing the talentsof a diverse group comprised of practitioners, researchers, policy analysts,information specialists, planners. andbullet; State Advisory Group Conference_to garner ideas from the fieldon the priority issues and program needs of States and state juvenile justicepractitioners. andbullet; Training sessions, conferences, and other activities related tovarious OJJDP programs that provided an opportunity to review specificissues with a variety of juvenile justice professionals. andbullet; Program Development Workshop on High Risk Youth_convened to reviewspecific issues and strategies to prevent, intervene and provide treatmentto the youth at most risk of becoming involved in illegal drug and alcoholuse.
