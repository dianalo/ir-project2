(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The only way to stop poachers fromkilling elephants for their tusks is to take the fashion statementout of ivory, Kenya's leading wildlife official said.   ``A piece of paper which says you shall not trade in elephantivory is about worth the paper it's written on,'' Richard Leakeysaid Sunday at a benefit for Friends of Conservation.   ``The way to stop the trade in elephants is to make the people ofthe world disgusted and revolted by the wearing of animal parts,particularly elephants.''   Leakey, who became director of wildlife conservation in Kenya inthe spring, has boosted the East African country's efforts to saveits elephant population.   Earlier this year, Kenya was losing an average of 2{ elephantsevery day from its national parks and reserves, Leakey said. Thecountry's elephant population has dwindled during the last decadefrom 65,000 to 17,000.   Leakey said that during the past four months poaching hasvirtually stopped because of a crackdown on poaching.   Four people have been killed since July in attacks that Leakeyblamed on poachers who were frustrated by the drive, he said.   Friends of Conservation was originally founded as Friends of theMasai Mara in 1982 to preserve the wildlife and endangered habitatof the Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.   By 1987, the original project was expanded to help other regionsin Africa, and the name was changed to Friends of Conservation. Thegroup has offices in Oak Brook, Ill., London and Nairobi.</TEXT></DOC>
