(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who admitted causing ``a lotof hurt and pain'' was convicted Thursday of kidnapping a baby froma hospital last summer and keeping him for four months.   The Prince George's County jury deliberated an hour beforereaching its verdict against Linda Stancil-Lewis, 34, for thekidnapping of Jeremiah Thate.   Stancil-Lewis, who stood silently as the verdict was ready,faces up to 30 years in prison for kidnapping, child abduction andfalse imprisonment when she is sentenced June 17.   In an eight-page statement written by Stancil-Lewis andpresented at trial, she said she saw the infant's mother ontelevision pleading for his return, but she couldn't give him backbecause she loved him.   The boy, who was kidnapped in June when he was 3 weeks old, wasfound in Stancil-Lewis' Southeast Washington apartment Oct. 28.   ``I took a sweet little baby boy,'' Detective Robert Davidsonquoted Stancil-Lewis as saying as he read her statement in court.   ``My heart went out to her,'' she wrote of the baby's mother,Theresa Thate, adding she ``couldn't give him back. I loved him,too.''   Stancil-Lewis, who had suffered a miscarriage shortly before thebaby was abducted, recounted in her statement that she foundJeremiah lying unattended in a hospital crib last June 11, smuggledhim out of the hospital in a canvas sports bag and took him home.   As the statement was read, Mrs. Thate, left the courtroom intears. Seconds later, she was followed by her shaken husband,Robert Thate.   In the statement, Stancil-Lewis said: ``I caused this lady a lotof hurt and pain.'' She said she had begun thinking about givingthe baby back to the Hyattsville couple.
