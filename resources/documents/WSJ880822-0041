Frank Knowles, Power Corp.'s president.    Mr. Knowles said Power Corp. hasn't decided what investments the new unit will make or whether its 40% stake in Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., a big pulp and paper concern, will be moved to the new holding company.    But he said the Kuwait state investment agency's recent purchase of a 10.3% stake in Consolidated-Bathurst &quot;opens the door for us to discuss with them the possibility of joint ventures.&quot;    The new unit will look at international as well as domestic acquisitions, Mr. Knowles said. Power Corp., a large holding company, also has investments in newspaper publishing and financial services.    Power Corp. said Thursday that William Turner Jr. would head its new industrial holding unit. Mr. Turner continues as chairman of Consolidated-Bathurst but relinquished his chief executive officer position to Oscar Stangeland, who is also president. </TEXT></DOC>
