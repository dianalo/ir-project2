(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential candidatesMichael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt swapped charges and drew firefrom the rest of the pack Saturday in a high-voltage debatereflecting the importance of Tuesday's lead-off New Hampshireprimary.   Gephardt, the narrow winner in Monday night's Iowa caucuses,apologized to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. for profane remarks made by hiscampaign manager.   But when Gephardt complained that commercials being run by PaulSimon's campaign were ``over the line,'' he was brought up short byGore.   ``What Paul Simon has done is simply to spell out the record.And you ought to respond to the substance ... rather than taking itpersonally,'' said the Tennessee senator.   Dukakis, the runaway front-runner in the polls for next week'sprimary, came out swinging with an attack on Gephardt's acceptanceof contributions from political action committees and his call foran oil import fee. But then he was forced to field criticism fromGary Hart and Bruce Babbitt, both men struggling for survival inthe presidential race.   Dukakis and Gephardt were the frequent targets of barbs becauseof their position in the race, the Massachusetts governor asfront-runner in the New Hampshire polls and the Missouricongressman as victor in Iowa.   Gore continued his assault on Gephardt after the event ended. Hetold reporters his rival ``has changed an incredible list ofpositions...Of course it's fair for Paul Simon to say yourpositions are 180 degrees different,'' he said.   Jesse Jackson and Gephardt engaged in an intense conversationafterwards, with Jackson waving his finger at his campaigncompetitor. Neither man would say what they were talking about.   Jackson sought to play peacemaker during the debate as he urgedhis rivals to address the issues rather than engaging in a game of``how bruised I am.''   It was Babbitt, the former Arizona governor, who spoke mostfrankly about the importance of New Hampshire where he said votershave the ``power of life and death over my candidacy.''   In a bid to attract voters from the audience watching the debateon Cable News Network, the Gore campaign aired a 30-secondcommercial within a half hour of the conclusion of the event.   The candidates exchanged barbs from the very beginning in areflection of the struggle for survival that the New Hampshireprimary has become. They spent only a few moments at mid-debatecriticizing the Reagan administration.   Hart and Babbitt continually chided the top-three in Iowa forfailing to provide specific proposals, Hart complaining thatDukakis didn't have an energy policy or a budget plan either.``Where's the beef?'' he asked, in a reprise of the line thatWalter F. Mondale used effectively against him in the 1984 race.   ``You don't know anything about'' putting together a budget,replied Dukakis, who has served as governor of Massachusetts for 10years and has said that now is not the time to deliver a detailedfederal spending plan.   ``And what is your energy policy?'' Hart said. ``I haven't hearda Dukakis policy yet.''   ``That's because you haven't been campaigning,'' shot backDukakis. ``Gary, wait a second, if you'd been around in the longhot summer and fall months you'd have heard about my energypolicy,'' he said in a reference to Hart's withdrawal from the raceafter questions were raised about his relationship with Miami modelDonna Rice.   Babbitt, supporter of a national sales tax to reduce thedeficit, taunted Dukakis, saying, ``Where's your budget plan?''   Simon, locked in a battle for second place with Gephardtaccording to the polls, was the first candidate to speak during thedebate sponsored by the League of Women Voters.   He began with an attack on the Missouri congressman, complainingthat Gephardt's support of President Reagan's ax bills had led tothe huge budget and trade deficits.   At one point Gephardt defended his own shift in positions onseveral issues, noting that Simon had endorsed Republican Tom Deweyfor president in 1948 and ``now you base your campaign on HarryTruman.''   The 60-minute debate was interrupted at the outset by a hecklerwho stood at his seat and began shouting ``When is the Democraticparty going to do something about AIDS?'' He was quickly hustledfrom the hall by security officials.   ``Where were we?'' said Dukakis as the commotion died down.   Where they were was a Dukakis attack against Gephardt's practicefor taking PAC funds. ``You can't beat up on the establishment andtake their money,'' said Dukakis.   ``Where are the PACs for the homeless, where are the PACs forthe working people who don't have health insurance,'' he said.   Babbitt, who finished fifth in Iowa and places the same in NewHampshire polls, took a shot of his own at Gephardt for being acongressional insider but campaigning as an anti-establishmentfigure. ``That's not a flip-flop; that's a triple back somersaultwith a half twist,'' he said.   The Democrats have been trading attacks and counterattacks inspeeches and television ads this week as the battle moved into thefinal 72 hours.   The sharpest exchanges came between Gephardt and Simon,concerning a new television ad attacking Gephardt for his votes onnuclear power, the B-1 bomber, taxes and other matters. Simon saidthe ad reveals inconsistencies in Gephardt's record but thecommercial infuriated Gephardt, who demanded it be taken off theair.   Gephardt's apology came when Gore asked him about comments madeearlier in the week by campaign manager William Carrick disparagingGephardt and his staff. Gephardt first said that Carrick was sorry,but Gore persisted and asked if he was, too.   ``Of course Al, of course. You're my friend.''   The League debate is the latest in the long series ofconfrontations between the 1988 presidential hopefuls. By onecampaign's count, it is the 19th such debate in 1987 and 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
