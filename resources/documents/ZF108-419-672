 But the next version could be awinner.andM;PC Manager is an ambitious program.andP;  It aims to combine a menu-basedapplication-launching front-end with the management and SideKick-styleutilities -- a calculator, notepad, address book, diary, ASCII editor and soforth.andP;  The phylosophy is to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use standardinterface to DOS for all PC users.andM;It's not massively easy to set up but once up and running it's verystraightforward to use.andP;  Realistically, this package is unlikely to be thechoice of stand-alone users or small businesses -- they're probably betteroff with a full-blown file manager like XTreePro or Norton Commander and somewell set-up batch files to launch their applications.andP;  It's really aimed atcorporate buyers who want a consistent, user-friendly front-end across alltheir machines.andM;The installation program supplied creates a\PCMAN sub-directory and copiesthe relevant files into it.andP;  The program also gives you the option of addingthe lines CD\PCMAN, MENU to your AUTOEXEC.andP;  BAT.andM;After installation, the setup program automatically executes.andP;  This allowsyou to set up password protection.andP;  Up to 10 users can share one package, andeach can have their own notepad, diary, auto reminder and auto task and canbe granted access to whatever other facilities the system administrator seesfit.andM;PC Manager has 10 pop-up utilities which can be accessed from anywhere withinthe package: a phone book, notepad, calculator, reminder, auto task,calendar, date and time, alarm, password and system info.andM;Like SideKick, the notepad is controlled by WordStar commands and includessome very word processor-like features such as search and replace, copy blockand print.andP;  You can resize the page although you can't make the page fill thewhole screen as you can with SideKick.andP;  I was taken aback, though, todiscover that there's no file handling provision whtsoever -- you save yournotes to a mysterious and unnamed place.andP;  Looking through my PCMansub-directory I realized that PC Manager had created a sub-directory under PCMan called Ben (my user ID -- in fact the program creates a subdirectory forevery ID) and saved my sample note file in Ben as a plain ASCII text file.andM;This has two implications, one good and one bad.andP;  It means that you canimport files created in the Notepad into most word processors, but it alsomeans that y our potentially confidential (and password protected) note filescan be accessed by anyone with even a passing knowledge of PCs.andM;The main menu initially has eight options: system setup, diary, addressbooks, quick ed, screen logo designer, file manager, exit to DOS and DOSshell -- provided, of course, you have access to the opening menu.andP;  Eachuser's applications can be added to this core via they system setup.andP;  Theopening screen also displays a calendar and the date and time.andM;The address books -- there are two, the private and the company addressbook-- are fairly sophisticated flat filedatabases which use the BTree datastructure and will take up to 10,000 entires each.andP;  Both address books arealso linked to the pop-up phone book utility.andM;The main difference between the two address book is the codes box included inthe company one.andP;  This enables you to categorize names and addresses byadding user-defined codes.andP;  Both address books have a ficility to import orexport ASCII delimited files.andM;Compared to XTreePro, for example, the file manager is very basic, althoughit will perform the handful of DOS commands which are probably all that mostusers need: copy, delete and rename.andP;  If y ou've used XTree you'll be able touse PC Manager's file manager -- you just won't particularly want to.andP;  Accessto the file manager can be restricted if required, but only in a blanketfashion.andP;  For example, y ou can't restrict people from access to hidden orsystem files, y ou can only lock them out of the whole file manager.andM;My main criticism of PC Manager is the fact that it's not a TSR (Terminateand Stay Resident) program.andP;  If, like me, you're a SideKick fan, you'relikely to resent having to leave your application every time you want to takea note or look up a phone number.andM;On the other hand, as an applications launcher there's nothing really wrongwith PC Manager.andP;  When you launch applications from PC Manager it retains areasonable 8Kb for itself, provided you've invoked memory optimization fromthe setup menu.andM;Greenscreen describes PC Manager as its entry-level product and it intends toproduce a network version -- how useful this will prove with the advent ofWindows 3 remains to be seen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
