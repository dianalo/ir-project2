Officials for the International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers said the union's members will return to their jobs Mondayat New England Telephone Co.   ``We are very pleased that our employees have ratified thecontract,'' company spkesman Peter Cronin said late Sunday. Thecontract vote was held at union locals in New Hampshire, Vermont,Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, with the results beingtallied in Maine.   About 18,000 IBEW workers have been on strike since Aug. 6against New England Telephone, a subsidiary of Nynex Corp.   About 40,000 Nynex workers in New York also have been on strike,but talks broke off this weekend between the phone company and theCommunications Workers of America, which represents the New Yorkemployees.   Nynex had resolved the larger, regional issues with the unionslast week, covering wages and benefits. But the unions then had tonegotiate local contract issues.   At first official count, striking IBEW members voted 7-1 infavor of both regional and local packages, said George Nadeau,chairman of the T6 Council in Maine, the administrative branch ofthe ten regional locals.   ``Both have been accepted on a comfortable margin,'' said Nadeaufollowing the final tally Sunday night.   On Saturday, negotiators for New England Telephone and the IBEWannounced they would send out for ratification a proposed contractcovering both the regional NYNEX and local agreements.   But union officials in Boston opposed the move, saying they wereunhappy with the proposed settlement of local issues.   Dennis Banks, a business agent for the IBEW in Boston, said hehad hoped the union membership would reject the plan.   A key dispute with New England Telephone was the company's useof outside contractors to perform certain jobs. As part of thelocal negotiations, union officials wanted the company to end thispractice, ``or at least put a cap on it,'' Banks said.   But he said the union could not get New England Telephone tochange its position.</TEXT></DOC>
