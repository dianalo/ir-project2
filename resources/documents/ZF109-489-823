 It willhighlight two applications of its Publisher software: Active Documents andHypermedia Authoring.andM;Active document systems are aware of their environment and are able to reactto, and interact with, information and events in that environment.andP;  Thus, forexample, they can recognize the last Friday of every month and trigger amonthly status report including information from a database and perhaps evenvoice and video.andP;  Similarly, they could be used by programmers to checksource files in or out automatically, communicate with other programmers,compile and execute programs, link error messages and corresponding lines ofsource code, etc.andM;ArborText will team with Electronic Book Technologies, of Providence, RI, todemonstrate how an SGML-based editor can be used to create and deliverhypermedia documents.andP;  Documents prepared with The Publisher will be passedto EBT's DynaText hypertext system for side-by-side presentation.andP;  DynaTextaccepts SGML documents and produces a multiwindow view of the documents withbuilt-in links to audio, graphic, animation and other support data.andM;Elan Computer Group  (2510)andM;Avalon Publisher is a Unix-based publishing system that runs under X Windowand uses ATandamp;T's Open Look graphical interface.andP;

 It will be running onmultiple platforms: the new Macintosh version; the X/Motif version on Apollo,DEC, HP and IBM platforms; Sun Microsystems; and Next.andM;Interleaf  (1528)andM;Interleaf will unveil the next generation of its Technical PublishingSoftware technology and show how it offers more than just electronicpublishing.andP;  TPS has been completely rebuilt into a programmable engine forbuilding publishing software for a variety of applications.andP;  The engine willbe available for Unix, PC and Macintosh platforms, with identicalfunctionality for all environments and configurable user interfaces.andO;Interleaf will demonstrate a variety of Neptune-based packages built byInterleaf and third parties that highlight its active-document capabilities,and it will announce a Developer's Toolkit.andM;Xerox  (2442, 2536)andM;The conference and exhibition will be the launching pad for a new generationof Xerox publishing systems.andP;  Xerox will have two, side-by-side booths, fromwhich it will announce and demonstrate The DocuTech Publishing Series ofproducts, the cornerstone of which is the DocuTech Production/NetworkPublisher, a digital multifaceted scanner/printer/collator.andP;  The ProductionPublisher is a high-speed (over 100 ppm) device targeted at in-plant andquick-print reprographic shops.andP;  The Network Publisher configuration is aprinter for large work groups.andP;  It is the first Xerox output device to printPostScript files, featuring an Adobe software interpreter.andP;  It also acceptsHP PCL and Interpress files.andM;Also in the family are DocuTeam and DocuBuild, two advanced applications forthe GlobalView environment announced September 19.andP;  GlobalView is the port ofthe ViewPoint operating environment to Sun workstations.andP;  As part of theport, Xerox will demonstrate in the exhibition many of the Viewpointapplications running under BlobalView on Sun workstations.andM;DocuTeam (formerly called structured ViewPoint) is project and documentmanagement software that links ViewPoint documents to an Oracle database.andO;Using a programmable file header, the contents of which are stored in Oracle,DocuTeam provides a variety of tools for sharing, organizing and trackinginformation created in the GlobalView environment.andM;DocuBuild is a structured editor that works with native SGML files.andP;  It willfeature WYSIWYG screen and print formatting that is much more sophisticatedthan the basic editor of GlobalView.andP;  For example, it will offercontext-sensitive formatting (the same style tag formatted differently,depending on its context); a new table editor; much better paginationcapability; and automatic numbering, cross-references and extraction ofelements into running heads and feet.andP;  DocuBuild will feature programmablejob tickets for executing batch operations, such as routing or translatingfiles.andM;Xerox will also demonstrate GlobalView for IBM-compatible PCs.andP;  The PCproduct is based on an add-in card containing the Mesa processor (the CPU forthe Xerox 6085 workstation).andM;Commercial compositionandM;Interest  (5406)andM;Interset, which had one of the hits of Drupa with the Macintosh version ofits quality composition system, Quoin, will show the same system at thisexhibition.andP;  Since Drupa, it has begun delivering the system, althoughinitial shipments support interactive page layout only, not the full bookpagination program for which Interset is well known.andP;  The book program won'tbe demonstrated.andM;The program follows Macintosh conventions closely and provides qualitycomposition, including kerning, tracking and automatic hung punctuation.andP;  Ithas nice features for generating rules, such as rules with different weightson different sides.andM;Magna Computer Systems  (1342)andM;Magna, appearing in the Linotype booth, will show the current status of thePageComp layout program it previewed last spring.andP;  Due to be releasedformally about the time of this event, it runs under Windows.andP;  It enablescreating frames on the screen and flowing text in, including irregularshapes.andP;  Text is edited in a window that pops up while the page is in view.andM;Penta Systems International  (2406)andM;Penta will demonstrate its current line of products running on Data Generalhost computers and PC workstations under Windows.andP;  Included will beMasterPage, a sophisticated book pagination program based on comprehensivetry tables; LayoutMaster, a program for creating page layouts interactivelyand assigning stories and graphics to frames on the pages; AdPro, a qualitycomposition program for advertising work; and NetworkMaster.andM;We had hoped to see the next-generation Penta workstation, the Data GeneralAviion, running software similar to LayoutMaster, but we were told that itmight not be shown.andP;  Apparently some aspects of its design haven't beenfinalized.andM;Ultimate Technographics  (931)andM;Ultimate will show its PC-based composition system, but it won't be the newOS/2 version we have been waiting for.andP;  It was shown in rough form at Drupa,but apparently isn't ready yet for a regular introduction.andP;  So the MS-DOSversion will be demonstrated.andM;Ultimate is continuing to develop products for a broader market than itstraditional one.andP;  In addition to the Impostrip (formerly PostStrip) systemfor automatically imposing PostScript files for printing and ColorMask, a newproduct will be introduced at the San Jose event.andP;  Called Paper Saver, itarranges pages for efficient output, with the target being to save paper, notto prepare the pages for platemaking.andP;  It runs on Macintoshes and PCs.andP;  Theprice will be $995.andM;Ultimate also will announce the development of some new drivers forImpostrip.andM;Specialized softwareandM;Design Science (239)andM;Design Science will demonstrate a Windows version of its MathType softwarefor engineers, scientists and educators.andP;  It has the same WYSIWYG display,user interface, automatic formatting and built-in TEX translator as theoriginal Macintosh version.andP;  It outputs PostScript and PCL.andP;  MathType enablesbuilding complex equations and pasting them into documents.andM;Also in the booth will be ParaFont, the PostScript font utility for modifyingPostScript fonts to generate fractions, small caps and other customvariations.andM;Softview (446)andM;Best known as the developer of MacInTax, Softview will bring anotherinnovative idea to the production of forms.andP;  Shown first at the recentMacworld exhibit, the Ifx Forms Designer package provides flexibility notgenerally found on competitive form systems, such as in resizing the form orindividual columns.andP;  If text is added to one cell so that it takes an extraline, the form automatically adds the extra line.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
