(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen television evangelist Jim Bakker hassued a New York attorney who formerly represented the PTL ministry,charging that the attorney tricked him into resigning and turningthe ministry over to the Rev. Jerry Falwell.   In the suit, which seeks more than $10,000 in damages and wasfiled this week in York County, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye,say they did not know that Roy Grutman also represented Falwellwhen he advised the Bakkers to step down.   ``What the Bakkers are really saying in the lawsuit is that Mr.Grutman tricked the Bakkers into resigning from office to open theway for Mr. Falwell to take over the leadership of the ministry,''said Jim Toms, one of the Bakkers' attorneys.   Grutman said Tuesday the allegations were ``utterly meritless,''adding that he was never Bakker's attorney.   ``I didn't tell him to resign. He made that decision,'' Grutmansaid.   Bakker left the Fort Mill-based ministry last March amid a sexscandal involving a church secretary, Jessica Hahn. Falwell tookover the ministry for several months. PTL now is undergoingreorganization in bankruptcy court.   Grutman told the Bakkers, according to the suit, that televisionevangelist Jimmy Swaggart, now beset by a sex scandal himself, washeading a conspiracy to take over PTL.   The Bakkers claim that Grutman and Falwell advised them to``turn the leadership of the ministry over to Mr. Falwell, who, itwas said, would lead the ministry as a caretaker until such time asthe (Bakkers) could return to the ministry,'' the suit said.   The suit also charged that ``Grutman either knew or should haveknown that the alleged conspiracy to seize control of PTL by Mr.Swaggart, either was not truthfully reported or was impractical ofattainment.''   Bakker resigned as PTL president on March 19; a month later,Falwell took the Bakkers off the PTL payroll.   The suit said the Bakkers left PTL ``severely damagedfinancially and diminished as a Christian ministry'' and accusedGrutman of giving the Bakkers incorrect advice to resign, resultingin damage to the Bakkers' reputations.</TEXT></DOC>
