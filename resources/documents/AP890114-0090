The helicopters then flew the West German captain and his wife,the West German engineer, and the 29-member Filipino crew to Ireland.   The West German-owned ship, the 42,000-ton Yarrowanga, was boundfrom Norway to the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada to take on iron orewhen it was caught in a gale Friday that put two large gashes in thehull.   The ship's boiler failed Friday, but the crew restarted it andthe ship was moving under its own power toward Ireland when therescuers arrived.   The Yarrowanga was listing in 30-foot seas and 50-mph winds whenone of the helicopters first tried unsuccessfully to land on thedeck, rescue organizers said.   The long-range HH 53C helicopters, based in Woodbridge-Bentwatersin eastern England, had flown to Shannon International Airport onFriday night and took off early Saturday for the flight of more than200 miles to the vessel.   They were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Herculestanker aircraft and reached the Yarrowanga in the early afternoon.   In little more than an hour, the first helicopter lifted up 15people with a winch and the second aircraft hauled up 17 more.   The helicopters then headed back to Shannon, where the IrishMarine Rescue Coordinating Center had been monitoring their progress.   ``This was a textbook rescue operation,'' said Maj. Ken Stafford,leader of the U.S. rescue squad. ``Everything went according toplan. All taken off the stricken ship are in good health, and noneof them will need to be hospitalized.''   As the skipper, identified only as Capt. Pietersen, and his wifestepped out of the rescue helicopter, he shook hands with IrishMarine Minister Brendan Daly and told him, ``We are all very happyeverything went well. It is great to be back on land.''   The rest of the crew was driven to hotels after they were givenstrict orders not to speak publicly until all reports are made, saidan airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   U.S. Air Force Capt. David Freeman said, ``It is the mostdangerous mission I've ever been on. But everything went well.''   Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes, designed for longsearches at sea, circled the ship Friday night.   The Coast Guard Rescue Center at Falmouth, England, said a Dutchtug, the Typhoon, was expected to reach the Yarrowanga on Sunday andattempt to salvage it.   Its Irish agent, shipping broker John Dundon, said the ship'sowners had sent instructions through him that the crew shouldabandon ship, even if salvage rights were to be claimed by anotherparty.</TEXT></DOC>
