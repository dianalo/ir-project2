They signed a giant card to celebrate his birthday _ his fourthin captivity _ released white doves and took out an ad in a Beirutnewspaper to appeal for him to be allowed to contact his family.   ``A dove is a symbol of peace,'' said Jill Morrell, a closefriend of McCarthy. ``We are releasing them as a gesture of freedomin the hope of galvanizing the Foreign Office to do more.''   McCarthy, a Worldwide Television News journalist, was kidnappedApril 17, 1986, as he drove to Beirut airport to fly home after 32days in Lebanon.   It happened two days after the bombing raid on Libya by U.S.warplanes based in Britain.   No group has claimed responsibility for McCarthy's abduction andonly in April 1988 did word emerge from released French hostagesthat he was alive. No communication has been received from him, andhis captors have released no photos or videotapes.   McCarthy is among 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon and believedheld by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. Held longest is American TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Other missing Britons are Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoywho went to Beirut to try to free the hostages; Brian Keenan, ateacher holding British and Irish citizenship; Alec Collett, a NewYork-based British journalist whose kidnappers say they killed him;and Jack Mann, a retired airline pilot.   The Friends of John McCarthy, Ms. Morrell's organization,published a full-page paid ad in Beirut's leftist newspaperAs-Safir.   ``To the people who are holding our friend John McCarthy, weappeal to you to allow him contact with his family, throughwhatever means you choose,'' it said.   Ms. Morrell said she wants evidence the Foreign Office isworking for the hostages.   ``For 3{ years we have had nothing but words,'' she said. ``Whensomeone important like Terry Waite is among the hostages you wouldimagine the government moving heaven and earth to get them out.   ``But that hasn't happened. They have just one person keeping aneye on the hostage situation. The government is just standing byand letting it happen. Britain is tolerating what is happening toJohn and the other hostages,'' Ms. Morrell said.   A Foreign Office spokesman said several Foreign Office officialsare following up every lead.   ``As Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said only one week ago, wecontinue to make every effort to secure his release and the releaseof the other hostages,'' said the spokesman. He added that Hurdwould meet with Ms. Morrell as soon as his schedule allowed,probably after the New Year holiday.   The Friends of John McCarthy was formed six months after hedisappeared, and Ms. Morrell, also a TV journalist, has been waginga campaign on McCarthy's behalf.   It includes fund-raising, demonstrations and 150 billboardsaround London that say: ``Close your eyes and think of England.John McCarthy has been doing nothing else for three years.''   The billboards and a TV commercial were produced for free by theadvertising agency Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty.   ``There's a very strong feeling by people in the media to usewhatever talents they have to help and this is what we can dobest,'' said Stef Tiratelli, the executive responsible for the adcampaign.   ``Inch by inch we have made progress,'' said Robin Corbett, anopposition Labor Party lawmaker involved with the campaign. ``Twoyears ago the government insisted there was no link with Iran andthe hostages and that has changed.''   Ms. Morrell said she is sure she'll see McCarthy again.   ``Other people have been released after a long time and they'reOK,'' she said. ``They're in bad shape but they're OK, which givesme hope.''</TEXT></DOC>
