The test would be the first to gauge a therapeutic strategy that would employ a genetically engineered drug as a decoy to prevent infection of cells in the immune system by the AIDS virus.    The initial test of the protein, manufactured by Genentech Inc., will take place at three centers: San Francisco General Hospital in affiliation with the University of California; New England Deaconess Hospital in affiliation with Harvard University; and the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health.    The protein is normally found on the surface of T-4 cells, white blood cells that are infected and killed by the AIDS virus. A synthetic version, prepared by means of recombinant DNA, is to be given in an intravenous infusion in the hope that flooding the body with false targets would mop up virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells of the body.    At least seven competing groups are vying to develop CD4, including Genentech; SmithKline Beckman Corp. in collaboration with Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the federal Centers for Disease Control; Biogen Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., a biotechnology company working with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, working with Harvard Medical School; Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland; and most recently, GeneLabs Inc. of Redwood City, Calif.    For patients, it is yet another hopeful agent added to the menu of drugs being tested against the fatal syndrome. For scientists, it has the added excitement of blending two expanding spheres of knowledge -- that of recombinant DNA and AIDS virology.    &quot;To my knowledge, this is the first time a product of recombinant DNA technology has specifically been applied against a part of the AIDS virus life cycle to yield a possible therapy,&quot; said Samuel Broder, clinical oncology director of the National Cancer Insititute. An older product of gene-splicing, recombinant alpha interferon, currently is used against Kaposi's Sarcoma, an AIDS-related malignancy.    One patient is scheduled to begin receiving CD4 today at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., where the first AIDS patient received the inaugural test dose of AZT three years ago.    Eventually, 50 AIDS and AIDS-related complex patients will be enrolled in the first phase of the study, which will consist of a two-week intravenous infusion at the National Cancer Institute portion of the trial. In San Francisco and in Boston, doctors will give the drug as a series of injections, at first daily and then tapering off to three times a week.    As in most early safety studies, doctors hope to escalate the dosage gradually to discover the thresholds of efficacy and of toxicity.    So far, pre-clinical studies of CD4 have shown the drug to be safe when administered to test animals. But only human tests can disclose human safety or efficacy of the protein. Some scientists have speculated, however, that the protein -- because it is normally a part of cells of the immune system -- could at least theoretically disrupt immune functions of the body. </TEXT></DOC>
