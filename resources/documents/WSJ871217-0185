In the past two years, 10,000 weapons-industry workers have been laid off.    The large, state-controlled arms companies have lost tens of millions of dollars because of lower export sales and even more because of the loss of domestic business to cheaper imports, defense officials say. Small, private arms companies, where the decline has been even more drastic, fear bankruptcies and the idling of as many as half their workers.    &quot;Things are bad,&quot; says A. Goldberg of ADM Aviation and Defense Parts Manufacturers Association, which represents more than two dozen small, private defense contractors. &quot;And it will get worse.&quot;    The Israeli arms industry -- the world's sixth-largest exporter of war materials -- has been hit by the same economic developments that have pressured the European arms industry: a shrinking market, the declining value of the U.S. dollar and rising competition. Moreover, Israeli budget constraints have forced lower military spending. And two of Israel's biggest markets -- Iran and South Africa -- have been officially closed, although some say that a much-reduced level of trade continues.    In response, the arms industry is trying to restructure. Industry is pressing the government to make the Israeli economy more competitive and friendly to business. But with Israel's highly regulated, slow-moving economy, few here predict that the transition will be quick or easy.    &quot;In view of all of this, we have to think what branches of the arms industry are going to be profitable for the future,&quot; says Joseph Evron, spokesman for state-owned Israel Military Industries, a maker of weapons systems, ammunition and the most famous Israeli military export, the Uzi submachine gun. IMI has laid off 2,000 of the 14,000 people who worked for the company two years ago, and many observers fear more cutbacks are coming.    The arms trade here directly employs some 60,000 people, and between one-fifth and one-quarter of the population is thought to depend on the industry. Foreign arms sales soared from $850 million in 1983 to about $1.3 billion in 1986, becoming Israel's biggest export category.    &quot;These are statistics that speak for themselves,&quot; says Moti Hod, chairman of state-owned Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd. &quot;We are still fighting to get the government and the Ministry of Defense to understand this.&quot;    The decline has repercussions for defense and foreign policy. Defense strategists are being forced to consider warfighting scenarios that rely more heavily on foreign sources of supply. And Israel has found that it can no longer rely so heavily on arms sales -- known as &quot;Uzi diplomacy&quot; -- for winning friends.    What's more, there is stiff new competition from places like Brazil, South Africa, India, Taiwan, China and North and South Korea.    Budget cuts over the past three years have forced the Israeli military to buy cheaper imported gear. This has reduced orders for the Israeli arms industry by as much as $400 million, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said recently.    One casualty of the budget cutbacks was Israel's planned Lavi fighter plane. The seven-year, $1.5 billion project to build an advanced fighter was draining the Israeli defense budget. The decision to abandon the Lavi left Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's largest single employer, without a clear future. Now it is laying off 3,000 of its 20,000 workers.    Arms sales to South Africa and Iran, two of Israel's biggest customers, have been sharply reduced. The Israeli cabinet this year voted to adopt sanctions against South Africa because of Pretoria's apartheid policy. In 1985, South African trade with Israel was valued at $250 million and included military equipment such as firearms and tanks, industry analysts say.    Although the sanctions halted open transactions, arms-industry analysts say military-related trade has continued. One recent deal, valued at $7 million, involved the trade of an Astra executive jet made by Israel Aircraft Industries for as much as 250,000 tons of South African coal. Israel in September denied that the trade violated any sanctions.    The Israeli arms industry has also been stung by embarrassing disclosures concerning its sales to Iran. Israel helped the Reagan administration arrange an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran in 1985, and it facilitated European arms trade to Iran.    Exactly how much the Iran-Iraq war and sales to Iran contributed to the export boom between 1983 and 1986 is subject to dispute. Israeli defense officials won't discuss Iran trades. A Swedish government investigation of arms dealers' trade with Iran uncovered a telex showing that in one 1985 deal alone, Israel Military Industries had an order for $120 million of military material destined for Iran.    Arms dealers with ties to Israel and Iran say some Israeli arms are still getting through to Iran. &quot;This is a very hot potato,&quot; says one arms dealer with close links to both countries. &quot;They don't like to talk about it in Israel. Or Iran.&quot; But the dealer says the Israeli-Iran trade is still going on, partly because of 30,000 Jews still living in Iran. &quot;If Israel stops supplying Iran, their Jews are in danger,&quot; he says.    Indeed, many leading Israeli political thinkers and politicians still believe Israel's long-term strategic interests lie in keeping the gulf war going through the quiet support of Iran. &quot;You can't avoid saying that this war serves the best interests of Israel,&quot; says Aharon Levran, a senior research associate at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. The war also keeps Israel's Arab neighbors focused on Iran rather than on their traditional enemy, Israel. </TEXT></DOC>
