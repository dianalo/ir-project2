Analysts said the early elections would allow the Gonzalez totake advantage of favorable results in European Parliamentaryelections, disarray among opposition groups, and a strong economy.   The independent El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper, said the47-year-old leader would dissolve Parliament on Sept. 2 and setelections for Oct. 29. An election had been scheduled for June 1990at the latest.   The paper cited unidentified government sources for its report.   Gonzalez would be seeking an unprecedented third term for theSocialists.   On Oct. 28, 1982, the Socialists won a landslide victory inelections to gain their first Parliamentary majority in the historyof Spanish democracy. They won another majority in June 1986.   The analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidGonzalez's party could benefit from the June elections acrossWestern Europe, when Socialists won 39.5 percent of the vote for theEuropean Parliament.   They said the prime minister also was taking advantage of astrong economy and the breakdown of an alliance between theconservative Popular Party and the centrist Social Democratic Center.   The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house ofParliament. The Popular Party holds 91, the Social Democratic Centerhas 28, and the rest of the seats are controlled by several smallerparties.   In addition, the analysts pointed out that Spain's economy hasgrown by 4.5 percent annually for the past three years, setting aEuropean record.   Early elections could also disrupt the momentum of the leadingsocialist and communist labor unions, whose leaders have hinted atstrike action later this year.</TEXT></DOC>
