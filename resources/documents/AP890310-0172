Malcolm R. Wilkey, chairman of the Commission on Federal EthicsLaw Reform, urged President Bush to incorporate as many of thepanel's recommendations as possible into an executive order thatwould apply to senior government officials.   ``Laws alone, of course, won't do the job. What is needed is aspirit of ethics and morality in the government,'' said Wilkey, aformer federal appellate judge who has served since 1985 as U.S.ambassador to Uruguay.   ``There must be a will to form, maintain and operate an ethicalgovernment. That leadership must come from the top in each branch,''Wilkey added.   ``The president, the Cabinet officers, the heads of independentagencies,'' Wilkey said, ``must emphasize ethics and lead byexample.''   The eight-member commission issued a 150-page report detailing 27recommendations for changes in ethics laws and regulations as theyapply to senior government officials, members of Congress and theirstaffs, as well as judges.   The commission, which adopted its findings in public sessionsover the last month, recommended:   _ An outright ban on fees that government officials, lawmakersand judges are paid to give speeches.   _ Limiting the outside income an official could earn, but notsetting amy specific percentage. The commission recommended thelimit be toward the lower end of a range between the 15 percent capthat now applies to executive branch employees and the 40 percentlimit on the income of U.S. senators.   The president would have the right to exempt certain types ofincome, such as royalties for writing books or any activity thatdoesn't conflict with government service.   _ Giving people entering government a chance to defer paying thecapital gains tax on stock divestitures made to avoid conflicts ofinterest before assuming office.   _ Extending the law that bars officials from taking action thatconflicts with their financial interest to judges and congressionalstaffers, but not lawmakers.   _ Putting lawmakers and judges under the same one-year ban thatnow prohibits former senior government officials from contactingtheir former agency about particular issues they were involved in.   _ That the Congress create a two-year bar on former officialsdisclosing certain proprietary or strategic information gainedduring government service to private clients. This would includestrategy on international trade and arms negotiations as well ascertain financial data.   _ Change the reporting rules to require that officials discloseall assets worth more than $1 million and income of more than$250,000 a year. Wilkey these changes in categories would be moremeaningful. The report also will require officials to disclosemortgages and private debts to relatives.   ``We feel that debts and liabilities pose more danger ofinfluencing the employee than small amounts of stock,'' Wilkey said.   The recommendations were immediately criticized in a statement byFred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause. ``The EthicsCommission's principal failure comes with regard to the executivebranch where its recommendations for the most part represent acombination of preserving the status quo, backtracking on existingrequirements, or ducking.''   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, the panel's vice chairmandisagreed, saying: ``I think it's very tough. The test of it will behow much of it is adopted.''   Other members of the panel were Jan Baron, Judith H. Bellow,Lloyd Cutler, Fred Fielding, former Sen. Harrison Schmitt, D-N.M.and R. James Woolsey.</TEXT></DOC>
