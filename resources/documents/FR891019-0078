The carrier's rail systemextends from Kansas City, MO on the west to Chicago, IL on the east andnorthward from East St. Louis, IL to Chicage, IL. CMW transports approximately8,000 carloads of freight monthly and operates 54 Amtrak trains weeklyover the St. Louis-Chicago corridor. The CMW's line between East St. Louisand Chicago contains trackage rights over the Burlington Northern Railroad(BN), Conrail (CR), Chicago, South Shore and South Bend Railroad (CSSSB),Illinois Central Railroad (ICR), Indiana Harbor Belt (IHB), and METRA.On August 3, 1989, the Bankruptcy Court issued Order No. 145, Establishingprocedure for Sale of Property of Estate, to cover the proposed sale ofcertain of CMW's rail lines requested by the carrier's Trustee, DanielR. Murray, in a Notice of Sale filed with the court on August 3, 1989.The proposed sale ralates to the rail line and trackage rights operatedby the CMW between Chicago and East St. Louis. While the Commission, ina decision served on September 29, 1989, approved the purchase by RGI,the court must still decide whether to authorize the sale.On October 12, 1989, the CMW's Trustee notified the Commission, in writing,that because of its deteriorating cash position the carrier will be unableto continue operations over its entire system. The directed service authoritysought here will enhance CMW's ability to continue operations over theeast-west portion of the railroad between Kansas City, MO and Springfield,IL, and between a junction with the Kansas City, MO line and East St. Louis,IL. To facilitate this partial operation, CMW states that it must ceaseoperations between East St. Louis, IL and Chicago, IL no later than October17, 1989. Simultaneously on October 12, 1989, RGI, on behalf of its subsidiarySSW and jointly with the Trustee, filed a request with the Commission tooperate CMW's line between East St. Louis and Chicago as a directed carrieruntil a decision is reached on the sale by the bankruptcy court or forat least 45 days, and without compensation.Section 11125(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the Commissionto act in situations where it finds that a rail carrier cannot transporttraffic offered to it because_(1) its cash position makes its continuingoperation impossible; (2) transportation has been discontinued under courtorder; or (3) it has discontinued transportation without obtaining a requiredcertificate under 49 U.S.C. 10903 (emphasis added). The initial periodfor the directed service order may not exceed 60 days. However, the ordermay be extended for an additional period not to exceed 180 days.Under a directed service order from the Commission, a directed carriermay voluntarily choose to provide directed service without any subsidyor compensation to which it may be entitled from the Commission, as SSWhas done here. <T3>See St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co._Directed Service_Chicago,</T3> 363 I.C.C.1 (1980), and Directed Service Order No. 1504, The New York, Susquehannaand Western Railway Corporation_Direct Service_The Delaware and HudsonRailway Company, (not printed) served June 22, 1988.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Likewise, the Commission may authorize directed rail servicewithout provision for compensation to the carrier over which service isdirected. <T3>Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co._Operate_Chicago R.I. andamp; P.,</T3> 360I.C.C. 289 (1979). Considering CMW's announced imminent cessation of service due to cashlessness,and CMW's request that the Commission direct service over the East St.Louis to Chicago line, we find that CMW's current situation meets the statutorystandards of 49 U.S.C. 11125(a)(1) and (3). In view of the urgent need for continued rail service over CMW's East St.Louis to Chicago line, and SSW's willingness to provide directed servicewithout compensation from the Federal government, the Commission is exercisingits authority under 49 U.S.C. 11125(a) and authorizing SSW to commenceoperations upon CMW's cessation of service. Service authorized by thisorder includes operations utilizing trackage rights agreements, leases,and other existing arrangements of CMW with connecting railroads.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ We recognize that the Commission did not grant RGI theauthority to acquire CMW's trackage rights over BN in Finance Docket No.31522. That decision looks to a resolution of the long term transportationproblems, and leaves to the parties the resolution of various contractissues. This decision, on the other hand, is based on an emergency needfor continued rail transportation, will remain in effect for a short periodof time, and is consistent with the Commission's treatment of other directedrail service emergencies. The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advancepublic notice and hearings would be impractical and contrary to the immediatepublic interest concern to secure continued rail transportation services.Accordingly, we exercise our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11125(a) to waiveadvance public notice and hearings in the present circumstances. Section 11125 permits us to direct service for an initial period of notmore than 60 days, with an option to extend the directed service periodfor an additional 180 days, if cause exists. We believe directed serviceauthority to be necessary here at least for an initial 60 day period. Anyinterested person may file comments on this action during this period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Terms and Conditions </ITAG>Effective Date Directed Service Order No. 1507 shall be effective on October 16, 1989.On the date CMW ceases operations and notifies the Commission and SSW thatit has done so, SSW shall be authorized to commence operations and shallnotify the Commission and all parties to this proceeding of the date itcommences operations under this authority.
