In cement manufacturing, domestic demand became 6.1% higherthan that of the previous year. To obtain a high efficiency of operationin cement calcining furnaces, a method that raises decarbonization rateof CaCO{sub 2} in a tentative furnace and lower kiln heat load was studied.Furthermore, for laborsaving, methods using computers, including personalcomputer, were reported. The production of flat glass in 1987 became0.4% higher than that of previous year and is still expanding fast inthe first half of 1988. In fine ceramics, the shipment of silicon nitrideas a raw material increased. Recent calcining methods and furnaces fornew ceramics were reported. The total shipment of carbon black in 1987marked the highest figure. The new technology is beginning to be usedfor asphalt. (8 figs, 2 tabs, 11 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
