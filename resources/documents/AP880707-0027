The department's existing production reactors are located at theSavannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., but all of them presentlyare shut down.   The report found that construction of a new heavy-water reactorat Savannah River would result in a plant based on reliabletechnology and located in a setting with years of experience inproducing and handling tritium, a key element in nuclear bombs.   ``The heavy-water reactor appears to have the best chance ofquickly providing the needed capacity because of existingfacilities, personnel and experiences at Savannah River,'' thereport said.   The report said that while conversion of the mothballedWashington Public Power Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanfordreservation offered some ``unique opportunities,'' both legal andtechnical uncertainties presented serious drawbacks.   Although the report conceded that conversion of the WPPSS plantmay not take as long to complete or cost as much, at leastinitially, as other options, it cited other problems.   ``There are risks because of the need to demonstrate an adequatetarget technology, uncertainties of public acceptance of conversionto defense purposes, and possible delays because of the legalprocess required to acquire the WPPSS facility,'' the report said.   The commercial reactor was more than 60 percent complete whenmothballed in 1982 as WPPSS, the construction arm of publicutilities in Washington state, ran into financial difficulties andquestions were raised about whether the electricity the plant wouldproduce would be needed.   The Energy Research Advisory Board report was released byWashington Democratic Sen. Brock Adams, a leading opponent ofconverting the WPPSS plant, and other Northwest congressionaloffices.   ``I've said all along that conversion is the wrong option andshould not be pursued,'' said Adams. ``This report reaches the sameconclusion.''   One of the Savannah River production reactors is undergoingextensive work to fortify it against earthquakes. Another has beenclosed for the summer because its discharge is too warm to complywith state water quality regulations and the third is undergoingroutine maintenance.</TEXT></DOC>
