Under the decision, expected to be announced shortly, the countries will have the option of pre-paying or temporarily reducing the interest burdens on about $16 billion of loans made to them to finance their purchases of U.S. weapons. Israel and Egypt will be the biggest beneficiaries of the plan, which is designed to lower the high interest rates on loans made in the late 1970s and early 1980s.    &quot;It is difficult to justify high interest rates to friendly countries who accepted these loans to promote our mutual security interests,&quot; said a White House paper circulated on Capitol Hill arguing in favor of the debt relief. &quot;We have concluded that these loans represent a political liability which the U.S. can no longer ignore.&quot;    Prodded by Egypt and some in Congress, the administration concluded that the loans, which were granted to strengthen the security of U.S. allies and expand American influence, are endangering these same countries' stability because of the interest payments that now are falling due. Because the loans were made years ago, some of them carry interest rates that are substantially higher than today's market rates.    The decision also serves several other purposes, according to officials and Arab diplomats. It shows moderate Arab countries, shaken by U.S. military sales to their Iranian enemies, that Washington still is willing to help them address their difficulties. It not only solves a serious cash shortage for Egypt, but it also strengthens the hand of pro-Americans and economic reformers, including the major lobbyist for the debt relief, Defense Minister Abu Ghazala.    The administration has decided to offer borrowers two options: They may pre-pay the high-interest loans outstanding at par without penalty, then turn to commercial sources for help, or they may accept a reduction of the original interest rates, which average nearly 14% for Egypt, to current market rates of about 7%.    However, the interest-rate reduction plan would merely postpone full payment, although in some case for about 15 years. Borrowers who accept that option would have to capitalize the difference in payments between the new and the old rates at the end of the loans' original maturity. For Egypt, this would produce a huge balloon payment of more than $2 billion. Cairo hopes the U.S. will forgive this payment when the time comes.    President Reagan's decision falls far short of the debt forgiveness or unqualified interest write-down Egypt and the State Department sought. The administration designed its decision to avoid a sweeping -- and costly -- action that would have set an unwanted precedent for other debts and would have required congressional action that could take months.    A move to grant Israel interest-rate relief failed in Congress last year. This year the administration acted out of growing concern that Egypt's economic problems could destabilize the most populous Arab country, and the one Middle Eastern country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. &quot;Israel was happy to let Egypt do its bidding for it,&quot; said one congressional staffer, explaining that Tel Aviv was uneasy about appearing to undermine U.S. deficit reduction efforts by fighting for more economic benefits.    Mr. Reagan's decision also waives for Egypt a 4% penalty it must pay on its monthly arrearages, which amount to about $500 million. Egypt runs habitually late in its repayments. It often pays just before it falls a year behind. Under current law, the U.S. must suspend aid to countries that fall more than a year behind.    The debt-relief measures were chosen because they don't require new legislation or budget authority. Early repayment is allowed under foreign military sales contracts if the country consents to enter a temporary default. The president may allow interest capitalization as long as the full value of U.S. assets is recovered.    The program's cost to the Treasury is still uncertain. A senior administration official said receipts could actually be increased over the short term because of countries taking advantage of the pre-payment option by repaying their principal outstanding. However, another official said the revenue shortage during fiscal 1987 would be $400 million and would total $1 billion to $1.2 billion from 1988 to 1992.    Recent U.S. foreign military assistance has been on more concessionary terms -- or, in some cases, outright grants -- so that repayment problems in general aren't likely to increase over time.    Egypt is receiving $1.3 billion in fiscal 1987 in military grants, and Israel is getting some $1.8 billion. The Senate last year tried to convert the entire foreign military sales program into grants, an approach that was blocked by the House.    The administration action was prompted partly by a dogged lobbying effort by Egyptian officials and their Washington consultants, Neill andamp; Co., who succeeded in winning the support of Secretary of State George Shultz, Vice President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker against opposition from the Office of Management and Budget and some treasury officials.    ---   Major Borrowers Eligible for Relief          (In billions of dollars)                             High-Interest Country                      Loan Amount Israel ........................ $5.500 Egypt .......................... 4.600 Turkey ......................... 1.400 Korea .......................... 0.740 Spain .......................... 0.617 Pakistan ....................... 0.538 Source: Treasury Department</TEXT></DOC>
