Yeltsin, the maverick Sovietlegislator, on Wednesday toured the birthplace of U.S. democracy,visiting Independence Hall and touching the Liberty Bell.   ``The same kind of crack which I see in this bell should notarise in the free countries of the world as a result of theemergence of liberty,'' Yeltsin said.   After sightseeing, the 58-year-old Yeltsin addressed more than800 people at a World Affairs Council luncheon for a fee of $25,000,which he said will go to charity.   Yeltsin, who met briefly with President Bush during his weeklongspeaking tour of the United States, also arranged for a meetingThursday with former President Reagan, recovering from brain surgeryat a hospital in Rochester, Minn., Reagan spokesman Mark Weinbergsaid.   Yeltsin, a sharp critic of what he called Mikhail Gorbachev's``compromising and half measures,'' said he hoped the Soviet Unionwould improve economic relations with the United States.   ``We have to change some of our laws on land holdings andproperty to make this possible,'' he said through an interpreter.``If foreigners could purchase land, they would make investments.   ``I would like to see someone build 1 million apartments and sellthem because Soviet citizens have money available and they wouldbring a good price if they were good.''   Yeltsin, ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief in 1987 butlater overwhelmingly elected to parliament, said he did not expectany retaliation for his frank criticism about developments in hiscountry.   ``I'm no less straightforward about what I say back there as Isay here,'' Yeltsin said. ``I'm trying to practice the diplomacy oftruth. I think we should get away from the old-fashioned diplomacyof people trying to outwit each other.   ``If we can be truthful it will increase the level of confidencebetween countries and people.''   He said he did not expect any kind of effort to oust Gorbachev,calling it ``extremely unlikely since I have been on the inside for2{ years and I know it can't happen.''   On the thousands of East Germans fleeing through Hungary to theWest, he said, ``People should have the right to leave their countryand go someplace else. This is part of an international agreement.''   Yeltsin was asked about a report that the KGB, the Soviet secretpolice, had offered the United States help in its drug war.   ``All I can say is that the KGB has its hands full dealing withdrugs in the USSR,'' he answered. ``They have to take care of theirown domestic problems before they start trying to help someoneelse.''</TEXT></DOC>
