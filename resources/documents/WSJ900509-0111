The hour-and-a-half bargaining session, held at therequest of ATU officials, marked Mr. Currey's first directinvolvement in negotiations since the start of theoften-violent strike on March 2, by 9,400 employees ofGreyhound, a unit of GLI Holding Co. But the meetingapparently drove the two sides farther apart and may havemarked an end to bargaining for the forseeable future.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We left it that we are not going to get back together,&quot;said P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice presidentand chief labor negotiator. &quot;There are no future meetings andthere are no plans for any future meetings. Our position isthat until they are willing to talk about what the companycan afford, bargaining is fruitless.&quot;   In a news conference Monday, Mr. Currey said he hadeffectively defeated the ATU strike because as a result ofstrike defections and newly hired replacement drivers, he hadnearly enough employees to operate the Greyhound system.   In addition to Mr. Currey, Mr. Lannie and a federalmediator, also present were ATU vice president James Hayesand Edward Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council ofGreyhound Local Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.   Mr. Strait, who flew to Dallas from Washington, D.C., saidhe requested the meeting with Mr. Currey because he didn'twant to &quot;leave any stone unturned.&quot;   According to participants in Monday's session, neitherside made any new economic proposals or offered substantialmodifications from previously announced positions.   Last weekend, after announcing $55.8 million instrike-related losses in the first quarter, the companysharply reduced its original contract offer and proposed asix-year pact with a four-year pay freeze.   Union officials have called the company's offer an&quot;insult&quot; and say they are standing by their previous demandfor a contract that would raise drivers' base pay 20% overthree years. Company officials complain that the unionproposal would cost the company more than $140 million and isunrealistic in light of the bus company's deterioratedfinancial picture.   &quot;They don't care what we can afford,&quot; said Mr. Lannie.&quot;They want what they want.&quot;   Mr. Strait said that in Monday's meeting, companyofficials refused to discuss the idea of laying off thereplacement drivers or reducing their seniority so thatstrikers could go back to work.</TEXT></DOC>
