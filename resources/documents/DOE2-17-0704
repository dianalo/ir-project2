<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0704 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study of the mechanism of electrooxidation of 1,3-propanediol on a goldelectrode in basic medium has been made. The kinetic parameters measured,together with other experimental data, allow the formulation of a mechanismin which both 1,3-propanediol and OH/sup -/ ions adsorb on the gold surfaceand the rate determining step is an interaction between both coverageswith the result of the formation of an adsorbed radical, whose oxidationleads to the formation of 3-hydroxypropanoic acid which has been identifiedby nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).</TEXT></DOC>
