Its lack of appeal as a takeover candidate has helped make it one the worst performing food stocks. Since late August 1986, Hershey has gained only 7.8%, while food issues have risen 23% and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index has climbed 32%.    But this month, Hershey has come back to life, breaking through its previous resistance level of 30. Volume in the past 13 trading days has been more than 3 1/2 times the July daily average, sparked in part by a buying campaign by Yamaichi Securities Co. of Japan.    Rumors of a takeover or leveraged buy-out are considered pretty far-fetched because a trust owns 42% of Hershey stock and controls 77% of the votes. But several analysts have been warming up to the stock based on its fundamentals of fast-growing earnings, low debt, and aggressive management led by chief executive officer Richard Zimmerman.    Yesterday, June Page of E.F. Hutton became the latest to pound the table for Hershey. She upgraded the stock to an aggressive long-term buy and raised her estimate of 1988 per-share earnings by a dime, to $2. Ms. Page forecasts $1.65 a share for 1987.    &quot;This is a company with a very strong balance sheet growing very quickly that is being totally disregarded because it isn't an acquisition candidate,&quot; said Ms. Page. Her endorsement follows earlier recommendations from Prudential-Bache and L.F. Rothschild, among others.    The Hutton analyst praised Hershey's recent acquisitions of the Luden's cough drop business and the Canadian candy unit of RJR Nabisco. Their combined $240 million cost, together with an $87 million stock buy-back, have boosted Hershey's ratio of debt to capital to 21% from 13% a year ago.    She said Hershey has been closing a market-share gap against its main rival, closely held Mars Inc. And Hershey's results have been bolstered by lower-than-expected cocoa prices.    John McMillin of Prudential-Bache said that in June, &quot;everyone wanted to be in the food stock that (E-II Chairman) Don Kelly was going to take over. You had a lot of people selling Hershey and trying to move to the takeover names. Now those people are singing the blues.&quot;    Mr. McMillin notes Hershey's five-year earnings growth rate of 13% is the second fastest among food issues. The stock far outperformed the market between the end of 1980 and mid-1986, multiplying sevenfold.    Hershey spokesman James Edris said the stock peaked last August after the announcement of a 3-for-1 split. Then, he noted, food stocks fell out of favor against other more cyclical issues whose earnings rise and fall with the economy.    The Hershey executive said one factor that kicked off this month's rally was Hershey's announcement of a 15% annual dividend increase to 62 cents a share.    Still, things sound sticky for anyone who might consider a takeover or other buy-out. Some analysts think Hershey's trustees would have to consider a bona fide premium offer pretty seriously, as fiduciaries for the Milton Hershey School, a local orphanage.    But Mr. Edris cautioned that, while Hershey can't speak for the trustees, &quot;they've indicated their fiduciary responsibility is considerably broader than dollars and cents.&quot;    The Hershey spokesman added: &quot;Given the fact that the company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities and the school's campus are located in the same environment, the preservation of the environment in which the school operates is extremely important.&quot;    Mr. McMillin also cautioned that Hershey stock's recent move has erased its 15% discount to the rest of the food stocks based on multiples of 1988 earnings. &quot;Now I think the case to buy the stock is a little more difficult, because you've got to justify a premium to the group.&quot;    The Prudential-Bache analyst said that's still possible because he forecasts Hershey's earnings growth at an above-average 14%. He said that could merit a 10% to 15% premium to other food stocks and a 20% premium to the market. Oppenheimer food analyst Lee Tawes concurred that such a premium is warranted.    Hershey is more than just candy kisses and chocolate bars. It has diversified into pasta and Friendly's restaurants, with uneven results. Mr. McMillin believes Hershey should sell the Friendly's business because it is sitting on a sweet store of undervalued Northeast real estate.    ---   Hershey Foods   (NYSE; Symbol: HSY)   Business: Food products   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Sales: $2.17 billion   Earnings: $132.8 million; $1.42 a share    Second quarter, July 5, 1987:   Per-share earnings: 30 cents vs. 26 cents    Average daily trading volume:   187,000 shares   Common shares outstanding: 90.2 million </TEXT></DOC>
