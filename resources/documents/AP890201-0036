Armacost the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, where hewill grapple with touchy trade and defense issues.   Armacost, 51, is the highest-ranking foreign service officer inthe State Department. If confirmed by the Senate, he will succeedMike Mansfield, a former Senate Democratic leader who was theambassador for a record 11 years before retiring last November atage 85.   Bush's selection of Armacost was confirmed Tuesday by a U.S.official who declined to be identified, after reports of the pendingnomination circulated in Japan.   Three other diplomatic selections also surfaced: Bernard Aronsonfor the sensitive job of Assistant Secretary of State forInter-American Affairs, Richard T. McCormack to be Undersecretary ofState for Economic Affairs and John Negroponte to be U.S. ambassadorto Mexico.   Aronson is a Democrat who broke with the majority of his party tosupport U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. McCormack is currentlyassigned to the Inter-American bureau. Negroponte, deputy nationalsecurity adviser, was a candidate to succeed Armacost.   Armacost is a former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and wasthe ranking Asian specialist on the National Security Council staffin 1978-1979, during the Carter administration.   He has held a Pentagon post as well, serving as deputy assistantsecretary of defense in 1979-80.   U.S. relations with Tokyo are at a crucial stage, with pressurebuilding in Congress to have the Japanese increase theircontribution to the country's defense. Another problem in therelationship is the U.S. trade deficit of $57 billion caused by aninflux of Japanese products.   Under former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Armacost playeda key role in dealing with Soviet authorities on regional disputesin Afghanistan, southwest Africa, Cambodia and Central America.   And Armacost, in a memorandum to Shultz on July 2, 1986,counseled him to oppose former President Reagan's surreptitious planto send U.S. missiles to Iran in an effort to free American hostages.   ``This seems scarcely a propitious moment to send arms to Teheranand it has never been clear the Iranians we are dealing with aregoing to possess any clout in a post-Khomeini Iran,'' Armacost wrote.   An imposing 6-footer, Armacost has a quiet demeanor and low-keystyle.   Twenty years ago, he served in Tokyo as a visiting professor ofinternational relations at the International Christian University,and from 1972 to 1974 he was a special assistant in the U.S. embassythere.   Armacost is a graduate of Carleton College and ColumbiaUniversity. He is married and has three children.   He is expected to be succeeded in the job of undersecretary ofstate for political affairs by Robert Kimmet, a Washington lawyer.Bush is breaking precedent by not naming a career diplomat to theNo. 3 job at the State Department, but Lawrence Eagleburger, aformer foreign service officer with 37 years' experience, is to benominated Deputy Secretary of State.   McCormack is a former ambassador to the Organization of AmericanStates and has politically conservative views.   Aronson, on the other hand, is a Democrat who shifted fromskepticism about U.S. support for the Contra rebels to supportingthe Reagan administration's program.   A Democratic Senate source, who spoke only on condition ofanonymity, said the choice had been made because Aronson was amoderate who could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans ondivisive Central American policies, and Nicaragua in particular.   Aronson would succeed Elliott Abrams in the post. Abrams was anardent champion of the Contras who clashed with Democrats inCongress over what many considered to be misleading testimony aboutthe secret U.S. program to finance the Nicaraguan rebels with fundssolicited from foreign governments.   Meanwhile, a White House source said Bush was expected to nameNegroponte ambassador to Mexico. Negroponte, a former ambassador toHonduras, also has served in a variety of foreign posts, includingin Hong Kong, Vietnam and Ecuador.</TEXT></DOC>
