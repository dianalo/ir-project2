At the requestof transportation agencies from several states, the TEXIN model was revisedto improve its performance and flexibility. The new capabilities includeT-intersections, one-way streets, four-way stops, inspection/maintenancecapabilities, anti-tampering programs and a short-cut emissions algorithm.TEXIN2 uses the CMA procedures for estimating traffic flow parameters,MOBILE3 to determine free flowing traffic cruise emissions, and CALINE3to model the pollutant distribution downwind of an intersection. Thenew model, TEXIN2, offers the user more accurate simulations with enhancedversatility while still requiring a minimal amount of input data.</TEXT></DOC>
