David Day, president of the 14-union Fernald Atomic Trades andLabor Council, said he sees no reason for workers to stay away fromthe government-owned uranium processing plant.   The U.S. and Ohio environmental protection agencies announcedTuesday that they have barred their inspectors from the FeedMaterials Production Center after two people were contaminated withuranium.   Day described himself as ``surprised but not shocked'' thatmeeting areas at the 38-year-old plant in the Fernald communitymight be contaminated.   He said the union coalition repeatedly has alleged thaturinalysis tests by the plant operator and the U.S. Department ofEnergy on uranium-exposed workers are unreliable.   ``We don't think we can trust the results of those tests. And theDOE takes too long to give us results,'' Day said.   The Energy Department plant, on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest ofCincinnati, processes uranium for the department's productionelsewhere of nuclear weapons. Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohiooperates the plant for the Energy Department.   Inspector Catherine McCord, a Chicago-based federal EnvironmentalProtection Agency inspector, said her contamination was througheither inhalation or ingestion.   She said she would return to the plant after it is satisfactorilycleaned up. `It's my job,'' Ms. McCord said.   Ms. McCord is overseeing the plant's cleanup, which is projectedas a 10-year, $5 billion program to remove surface uraniumcontamination, thousands of drums and thousands of tons ofcontaminated wastes in pits from the plant site.   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, in a statement, said he was ``alarmedthat the federal government has had to pull its inspectors fromFernald because of unsafe working conditions. It is time for thefederal government to live up to its responsibility to operate asafe plant.''   The EPA inspectors were contaminated by radioactive uranium inmid-December while attending meetings, according to a Feb. 9 letterto the Energy Department from Valdas Adamkus, U.S. EPA regionaladministrator in Chicago.   ``As of today, U.S. EPA personnel and contractors will not begoing to the U.S. DOE Fernald site until this health risk can besatisfactorily addressed,'' Adamkus' letter said.   Lisa Crawford, spokeswoman for the citizens group FernaldResidents for Environmental Safety and Health, said Wednesday shefound the EPA's announcement frightening.   ``I just think it lends credit to what we've been saying allalong, that there is a problem there and something needs to be doneabout it. I think the EPA made a valid choice,'' Mrs. Crawford said.   Her group has filed a $300 million lawsuit in U.S. District Courtin Cincinnati against the plant's former operator, National Lead ofOhio Inc. The group alleges the plant contaminated the environment,created a health hazard and ruined values of neighboring properties.   Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ruled this week that the lawsuit, filedas a class-action on behalf of 14,000 people living within fivemiles of the plant, can proceed to trial June 5.   Westinghouse officials questioned the Energy Department test andsaid they are also seeking an independent evaluation. Tests of plantworkers have shown no unusual problems, and Westinghouse considersits laboratory examinations reliable, company spokesman William H.Kelley said.</TEXT></DOC>
