A group of army officers' wives demanded on Tuesday that DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin either resign or accept responsibility fororders they claimed he issued to soldiers in the occupiedterritories.   On Monday, the army announced plans to court martial IsraeliCol. Yehuda Meir, accused of ordering troops to beat and break thelegs of 20 bound and gagged Palestinian detainees in January 1988.   Meir's wife, Orna, and other officers' wives claimed Rabin gavethe orders to brutalize the Palestinians.   Tuesday's violence came a day after a PLO leaflet urgedPalestinians to escalate attacks on Israeli forces betweenChristmas and the New Year ``to honor the Palestinian revolution.''   At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis duringthe two-year uprising against the occupation of the West Bank andGaza Strip.   At least 161 other Arabs have been slain by fellow Palestiniansas accused collaborators with Israel. Forty-three Israelis alsohave died.   The latest fatality, Farraj Daher Abu Fekhaida, 26, was shot inthe chest when an Israeli commander fired on stone-throwers duringan army raid on the village of Jina near Ramallah, the army andArab reports said.   The Israeli-owned bus was set on fire within Israeli territorynear the West Bank town of Jenin, Israeli radio reports said.   One masked assailant held a hatchet to the driver, while twoothers spilled kerosene on the floor and then set the vehicle onfire, the reports said. The passengers, Palestinians going to jobsin Israel, reportedly managed to flee unhurt.   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinianteen-agers in clashes in the Jebaliya and Shati refugee camps, Arabreports said.   In Jerusalem, Israeli state prosecutor Dorit Beinisch orderedfurther investigation into the death of a 27-year-old Palestinianwho died last week in custody of the Shin Bet security agency inthe Gaza Strip, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.   The prisoner, Khalid Kamel Sheikh Ali, had been detained threeweeks earlier on suspicion of concealing weapons for a Moslemfundamentalist group.   Michael Baden, director of Forensic Sciences for New York StatePolice, who was commissioned by the victim's family to conduct anautopsy, told reporters Monday Ali died from a blow to the abdomendealt with ``a large amount of force.''   The charges against Meir say soldiers under his command leftbeaten and bound Palestinians from Beita and Hawara villages in afield until other Arabs came and took them to a hospital.   Meir served as military commander of Nablus, the largest town inthe West Bank, and becomes the highest-ranking officer to facetrial during the uprising. He resigned from the army under pressurein April 1988.   Orna Meir, who formed the wives' group on Tuesday, said onIsrael radio that Rabin was responsible for the beating orders.</TEXT></DOC>
