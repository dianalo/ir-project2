The method includes alloy fluctuations in the interatomic chargetransfer, enables one to transcend the muffin-tin approximation and thustreat surfaces and layered structures, and allows the inclusion of latticestrain effects. The calculated EPI have a large magnitude when d-bondingeffects are important. For transition metals the EPI are strongly concentration-dependent.In NiAl, results for bcc and fcc lattices are similar and exhibit a quickdecay of the EPI with interatomic separations. The concentration dependenceof the transition metal EPI exhibits rapid oscillations with the numberof valence electrons. The concentration-averaged EPI varies less dramatically.The oscillations in the concentration dependence of the EPI are interpretedin terms of the position of the Fermi level relative to peaks and valleysin the one-electron density of states.</TEXT></DOC>
