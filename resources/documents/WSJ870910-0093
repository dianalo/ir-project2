Spurred by a new wave of cheaper, more powerful machines, personal-computer sales will soar 20% in the crucial fourth quarter, says market researcher Infocorp. &quot;We think it's going to be a big one,&quot; agrees a spokesman for Tandy Corp., who also predicts double-digit gains. Bert Helfinstein of Entre Computer Centers Inc., a major chain, says sales might jump as much as 25%.    Why? Businesses are trading in old PCs for more powerful models, while lower prices are helping the home market. Commodore PCs, including a monitor, sell for under $500 in New York. But the high-power models carry smaller discounts because &quot;the market is booming,&quot; says Joseph Boudames, a San Francisco store owner. In better financial shape after an industrywide slump, chains are ordering aggressively again. &quot;We're really going out there to do business,&quot; says Rick Inatome of Troy, Mich.'s Inacomp Computer Centers Inc.    Aggressive trimming of dealer rosters by big PC makers means more sales for those who are left.    LAWMEN AND CRIMINALS both find that computers are handy tools.    Federal agents use advanced software to help solve crimes, and the proliferation of more portable computers has lawmen bringing hardware right into the field. Some Drug Enforcement Administration agents take laptop computers with them on drug busts. The computer tells them, for example, which chemicals used to make LSD explode upon contact with water.    Wrongdoers use computers, too, but find they can be a double-edged sword. A Los Angeles bookmaker is being prosecuted on records of bets he kept on an IBM PC; Los Angeles police also discover that massage parlors that are fronts for prostitutes keep clients' names on PCs. Computers are so popular among criminals that the FBI now trains agents so they can retrieve data from computer storage disks during busts. &quot;You just run the disks through and play them to a jury,&quot; says a DEA spokesman.    BIG MINICOMPUTER MAKERS seek profitable niches as the industry matures.    With International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. dominating big business accounts, other makers of $10,000 to $1 million minicomputers scramble to find their place. The problem: Business, having tied more PCs into networks, is dependent on the large makers for service. The &quot;long-term viability of the company has risen in importance in purchasing decisions,&quot; says Marc Schulman, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst. More powerful PCs are also wooing many from the low end of the minicomputer market, says Gartner Securities Corp.'s Ulric Weil.    Specialization may be the key to survival. Stung by losses, Data General Corp. retrenches and refocuses on smaller businesses. Tandem Computers Inc. thrives by selling banks and airlines &quot;fault-tolerant&quot; computers that continue working even if some parts fail.    But even those that carved out special niches -- like work-station makers -- feel pressure as companies such as DEC enter their markets.    BANNED IN BONN: West Germany prohibits sales of three MicroProse Inc. computer games to children -- for glorifying war. F-15 Strike Eagle, for example, simulates air combat missions. MicroProse President William Stealey protests. &quot;There's no blood and guts,&quot; he says.    GEORGIA TECH researchers are developing a computerized poultry-processing line to inspect chickens for disease and other flaws. Human chicken-line workers miss a lot of bad birds: &quot;They get mesmerized,&quot; says a spokesman for the school.    DEALS ON WHEELS: To court busy customers, HLA Computers, a Beltsville, Md., PC dealer, displays its wares in an $80,000 recreational vehicle that it drives to the customer's door. The microwave-equipped RV lets HLA woo potential buyers with &quot;drinks and little nibbles.&quot;    SECURITY EXPERTS see widespread use of &quot;biometric&quot; devices by early 1990s.    Computerized biometrics, such as voice recognition units and fingerprint readers, will be commonplace next decade, says a Personal Identification News reader survey. Biometrics, previously the province of the military and defense industries, has attracted interest as prices decline and corporations seek more sophisticated security devices.    One use: voice recognition devices to restrict home entry, PIN readers say. Such a device would be for &quot;the high yuppie market,&quot; says the newsletter's George Warfel Sr. Others are likely to encounter such devices in automated teller machines. Diebold Inc. already has a prototype ATM that requires a user to repeat vowel-laden words like &quot;Alabama.&quot; Signature readers that spot phony autographs are expected to be big with retailers next decade.    Biometrics' biggest application could be scanning fingerprints of authorized computer operators, adds Joe Gagliano of Diebold.    BRIEFS: Battelle Memorial Institute is developing a wristwatch-sized computer for deep-sea divers that will help prevent decompression sickness. . . . A data base containing case histories of 38,000 animals at the San Diego Zoo is nicknamed &quot;Noah.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
