The proposed rule would address the Commission's role underNEPA in connection with a license application submitted by the Departmentof Energy with respect to a geologic repository for high-level radioactivewaste (HWL). The changes are needed in order to reflect the provisionsof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), as amended. Under thatAct, the Commission is required to adopt the Department's environmentalimpact statement (EIS) to the extent practicable. The proposed rule, amongother things, sets out the standards and procedures that would be usedin determining whether such adoption is practicable.In summary, under the proposed rule:(1) The Commission will conduct a thorough review of DOE's draft EIS andwill provide comments to DOE regarding the adequacy of the statement.(2) If requested by Congress pursuant to the NWPA, the Commission willprovide comments on DOE's EIS to the Congress with respect to a State orTribal notice of disapproval of a designated site.(3) The NRC will find it practicable to adopt DOE's EIS (and any DOE supplementalEIS) unless:(a) The action proposed to be taken by the NRC differs in an environmentallysignificant way from the action described in DOE's license application,or(b) Significant and substantial new information or new considerations renderthe DOE EIS inadequate.(4) The DOE EIS will accompany the application through the Commission'sreview process, but will be subject to litigation in NRC's licensing proceedingonly where factors 3(a) or 3(b) are present.In accordance with NWPA, the primary responsibility for evaluating environmentalimpacts lies with DOE, and DOE would therefore be required to supplementthe EIS, whenever necessary, to consider changes in its proposed activitiesor any significant new information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>Comment period expires August 3, 1988.

The EIS contains a detailed statementof the environmental impacts of a proposed action, including adverse unavoidableeffects resulting from its implementation, as well as an identificationand environmental evaluation of alternatives to the proposed action.  The Commission is responsible for the licensing and regulation of activitiesinvolving the possession of nuclear materials. Atomic Energy Act of 1954,as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 <T3>et seq.</T3> The Department of Energy (DOE) must obtain a license fromNRC before disposing of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in geologicrepositories. Section 202, Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C.5842. The licensing of DOE to receive and possess HLW at a geologic repositoryinvolves one or more major Federal actions which might significantly affectthe quality of the human environment. Accordingly, NEPA requires the Commissionto have an EIS (or multiple EIS's if more than one major Federal actionby NRC is involved) to accompany its decision process when it considersa license application from DOE involving HLW disposal. Further directionregarding NRC's NEPA responsibilities is provided by the Nuclear WastePolicy Act of 1982 (NWPA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 10101 <T3>et seq.</T3>  The Commission in 1984 promulgated revised regulations (10 CFR Part 51)to implement section 102(2) of NEPA, the section which, among other things,calls for the preparation of an EIS. 49 FR 9352, March 12, 1984, and 49FR 24512, June 14, 1984. In issuing these regulations, the Commission notedthat it had initiated a review of the licensing procedures applicable togeologic repositories in the light of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act andthat the Commission would determine, as part of that review, whether furtherchanges to 10 CFR Part 51 are needed. On July 30, 1986, the Commissionpromulgated certain amendments to 10 CFR Part 60. 51 FR 27158. Those amendmentsdeal with (1) the role of NRC during site screening and site characterizationactivities and (2) State, tribal, and public participation in NRC activitieswith respect to geologic repositories. In proposing those rules, the commissionhad noted that issues pertaining to NRC responsibilities under NEPA willrequire modifications to 10 CFR Part 51 and that such amendments wouldbe the subject of a subsequent rulemaking. 50 FR 2579, Jan. 17, 1985. Thestatement of considerations accompanying the final amendments advised thatPart 51 ``will need to be changed_specifically to (1) define the alternativesthat must be discussed in an environmental impact statement, (2) exemptthe promulgation of the NRC licening requirements and criteria from environmentalreview under NEPA, and (3) set out procedures that will be followed bythe Commission in determining whether or not to adopt the DOE EIS.''  As contemplated by its prior statements, the Commission now proposes amendmentsdealing with NRC implementation of NEPA in connection with Department ofEnergy geologic repositories. A full appreciation of these amendments requiresan understanding of NEPA itself and the Commission's original plans formeeting its NEPA responsibilities; an analysis of the text and legislativehistory of NWPA, and of the recent amendments thereto, with particularregard to the policies and procedures established by that law for the resolutionof environmental issues; and, finally, the specific regulations the Commissionwould promulgate in order to implement the NWPA policies and procedures.These matters are examined in the following discussion.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Pre-NWPA Licensing Framework</ITAG>The Commission believes it will be helpful to outline the repository licensingprocedure that it had approved before enactment of NWPA. As appears below,that procedure included a customary NEPA review of DOE's license application.With that intention in mind, the Commission required DOE to characterizeat least three sites and to provide certain timely information to the Commissionregarding its site selection process. The Commission's requirements hadbeen promulgated before the passage of NWPA, and they were familiar toCongress. In some respects the new law tracked the Commission rules closely;in other cases, however, there were marked differences, and from thesedifferences a modification of policy can be inferred. A review of the pre-NWPAframework is therefore essential.To begin this review with fundamental considerations, it is first notedthat the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 charges the Commission with severaltypes of licensing responsibility. One class of Commission action is <T3>materials licensing.</T3> Under its statutory authority, the Commissionprescribes such rules as it finds to be needed to assure that persons possessand use the regulated materials in a manner that protects public healthand safety and is not inimical to the common defense and security. DOE'sdisposal of HLW at a geologic repository is subject to this materials licensingauthority of the Commission. The Commission several years ago determinedthat it would be necessary, to protect health and safety, to review DOE'splans with respect to a geologic repository before commencement of construction.46 FR 13971, Feb. 25, 1981 (final licensing procedures). Accordingly, DOEmay not commence construction of a geologic repository unless it has firstfiled a license application and obtained the Commission's constructionauthorization. 10 CFR 60.3(b). A construction authorization is not itselfa license, since it does not authorize possession or use of nuclear materials,but DOE's failure to comply with the requirement to apply for and to obtainconstruction authorization constitutes grounds for denial of the licensethat DOE would later need in order to receive high-level waste at the repository.Moreover, the Commission may, if necessary, issue orders to secure compliancewith construction authorization conditions and to protect the integrityof the repository. 46 FR 13971.In the pre-NWPA licensing framework, the Commission specified that an environmentalreport prepared in accordance with 10 CFR Part 51 was to accompany thelicense application. 10 CFR 60.21(a). The environmental report was to discussrelevant NEPA considerations. In particular, as provided by this regulation,10 CFR 51.40(d)(1983):<ITAG tagnum="21">The discussion of alternatives shall include site characterizationdata for a number of sites in appropriate geologic media so as to aid theCommission in making a comparative evaluation as a basis for arriving ata reasoned decision under NEPA. Such characterization data shall includeresults of appropriate in situ testing at repository depth unless the Commissionfinds with respect to a particular site that such testing is not required.The Commission considers the characterization of three sites representingtwo geologic media at least one of which is not salt to be the minimumnecessary to satisfy the requirements of NEPA. (However, in light of thesignificance of the decision selecting a site for a repository, the Commissionfully expects the DOE to submit a wider range of alternatives than theminimum required here.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Failure to provide the specified site characterization data wouldconstitute grounds for denial of a license application. 10 CFR 2.101(f)(4).If DOE had prepared its own EIS, that document could be submitted so longas it contained the information called for by the regulation; the Commissionnoted, however, that it could not be bound to accept judgments arrivedat by DOE in its EIS. 46 FR 13973.NRC was to publish notices of the availability of the environmental reportand of its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 10 CFR51.50(a), (b)(1983). An environmental impact statement would be requiredbefore issuance of a construction authorization, 10 CFR 51.5(a)(11)(1983);and an EIS might also be determined to be necessary for issuance of thelicense to possess high-level waste at a repository, <T3>id.</T3> at andSection; 51.5(b)(11), or to terminate such license. <T3>id.</T3> at andSection; 51.5(b)(10). The EIS prepared before constructionwould be supplemented prior to issuance of a license to take account ofany substantial changes in the activities proposed to be carried out orsignificant new information regarding the environmental impacts of theproposed activities, <T3>id.</T3> at andSection; 51.41.Whenever an EIS was required, it was first to be distributed as a draftand, after receipt of comments, NRC would then prepare a final EIS whichwould respond to any responsible opposing view not adequately discussedin the draft. The draft and final statements, and comments received, wereto accompany the application through the Commission's review processes.<T3>Ibid.</T3> (reference to andSection;andSection; 51.22-51.26). In an adjudicatoryhearing, as is required before issuance of construction authorization fora repository, the NRC staff was to offer the final EIS in evidence. Anypart to the proceeding could have taken a position and offered evidenceon NEPA issues. As a result of the hearing, the Commission could have arrivedat findings and conclusions different from those in the final EIS preparedby the staff, and the final EIS would have been deemed modified to thatextent. <T3>Id.</T3> at andSection; 51.52(b).Upon review and consideration of an application and environmental report,a construction authorization could have been issued if the following environmentalstandard was met:<ITAG tagnum="21">That, after weighing the environmental, economic, technical and otherbenefits against environmental costs and considering available alternatives,the action called for is issuance of the construction authorization, withany appropriate conditions to protect environmental values. 10 CFR 60.31(c).</ITAG>While the Commission's formal NEPA determination would thus have been madein the course of licensing proceedings, the regulation Buenos Aires, Argentinasprovided further for NRC involvement at an even earlier stage_namely, atthe time of site characterization. Site characterization is a program ofexploration and testing that includes specified activities ``to determinethe suitability of the site for a geologic repository.'' 10 CFR 60.2(p)(1983).It is needed not only to determine whether defects are present, but alsoto determine specific properties such as homogeneity, porosity, the extentof fracturing and jointing, and thermal response of the rock. Site characterizationdata are needed so as to provide a satisfactory basis for arriving, withconfidence, at the technical judgments underlying the Commission's initiallicensing decision. 44 FR 70410, Dec. 6, 1979 (proposed licensing procedures).The Commission noted its belief that it would be necessary for DOE to carryout site characterization at three or more sites in two (or more) geologicmedia, at least one of which is not salt. Such a program of multiple sitecharacterization would provide the only effective means by which NRC couldmake a comparative evaluation of alternatives as a basis for arriving ata reasoned decision under NEPA. It was estimated that $30,000,000 representedthe upper limit for the ``at depth'' portion of site characterization insoft rock, with a limit of up to about $40,000,000 in hard rock. 46 FR13972-73.The Commission regulations called upon DOE to submit, in advance of sitecharacterization, a Site Characterization Report, which would have beenreviewed informally by NRC. In addition to describing the site to be characterizedand the proposed site characterization program, the report would have includedseveral items of information pertaining to site selection, specifically:andbullet; The criteria used to arrive at the candidate area.andbullet; The method by which the site was selected for site characterization.andbullet; Identification and location of alternative media and sites atwhich site characterization is contemplated.andbullet; A description of the decision process by which the site was selectedfor characterization, including the means used to obtain public, Indiantribal and State views during selection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">10 CFR 60.11 (1983). The Commission found the inclusion of plans forconsidering alternative sites to be necessary so that NRC could call tothe attention of DOE, in a timely manner, additional information that mightbe needed by the Commission in reviewing a license application in accordancewith NEPA. 46 FR 13972. (Also, in the preamble to the proposed licensingprocedures, the Commission had discussed the requirement that DOE describethe site selection process, and State involvement therein. The Commissionnoted its belief, in this connection, that many issues, ``including theNEPA questions related to alternatives and alternative sites,'' would bemore easily resolved if State concerns were identified and addressed atthe earliest possible time. 44 FR 70412.)<ITAG tagnum="84">The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[<T4>Note:</T4> Under this heading, the Commission reviews its NEPA responsibilitiesunder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as originally enacted; that is, thisdiscussion does not reflect the 1987 amendments. The 1987 changes, whichwill be analyzed below (under the heading ``Nuclear Waste Policy AmendmentsAct of 1987''), were not intended to alter the duties of the Commissionwith respect to NEPA; and it is therefore in order to review the pre-1987situation in order to understand the Commission's role. All citations inthis part of this notice are to NWPA as codified as of January 1, 1987.]</ITAG>Congress established Federal policy for civilian radioactive waste disposalin the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10131 et seq.). TheCommission's responsibilities for radiological safety, under prior law,were recognized and confirmed_most clearly in the express provision insection 114(f) that ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to amend orotherwise detract from the licensing requirements of the Nucler [sic] RegulatoryCommission as established in title II of the Energy Reorganization Actof 1974 (Pub. L. 93-438).'' 42 U.S.C. 10134(f).The statute provides for a licensing process that conforms closely to thepreexisting framework of 10 CFR Part 60. NWPA thus requires DOE to carryout a program of site characterization, after first submitting to NRC ageneral plan for site characterization activities (along with certain informationregarding waste form or packaging as well as a conceptual repository design).Section 113(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. 10133(b)(1). This corresponds closely to theSite Characterization Report provision of Part 60, 10 CFR 60.11(a) (1982);notably, however, the NEPA-related requirement of the regulation that DOEinclude site screening and selection information in its submission wasomitted. (As discussed below, the site screening and selection informationmust be identified in a separate document_the environmental assessment_whichdoes not require NRC review.)As provided earlier in Part 60, an application is to be submitted in advanceof construction. This is to be followed by Commission review in accordancewith the laws applicable to such applications and a decision approvingor disapproving the issuance of a construction authorization. Section 114(b), (d), 42 U.S.C. 10134 (b), (d). In addition to its action on applicationsfor construction authorization, the Commission would review, and approveor disapprove, applications for licenses to receive and possess the waste(and spent fuel) in a respository and applications for closure and decommissioning.<T3>See</T3> section 121(b), 42 U.S.C. 10141(b). For the corresonding provisionsof NRC regulations, <T3>see</T3> 10 CFR 60.31 (construction authorization), 60.41 (licenseto receive and possess), and 60.51 (license amendment for permanent closure).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ One difference betweeen the language of NWPA and Part60 is worthy of note: that the statute differentiates between an applicationfor construction authorization and an application for a license, whereasthe regulation had referred, and continues to refer, solely to an applicationfor a license to receive and possess waste (to be filed prior to construction).The Commission considers this differentiation to lack any substantive significance.In the view to the Commission, the information it needs in order to beable to consider the issuance of a construction authorization is generallythe same as will be needed prior to issuance of the license to receiveand possess HLW. For this reason, the Commission regulations call for theapplication to be as complete as possible in the light of information thatis reasonably available at the time of docketing_i.e. prior to commencementof construction. 10 CFR 60.24(a). Accordingly, the Commission intends toretain its requirement of a unitary application; it is not required to,and it does not propose to, modify its rules to provide separately forapplications for construction authorization on the one hand and a licenseto receive waste on the other.The Nuclear Waste Policy Act also confirmed the Commission's most importantstated position with respect to compliance with NEPA. In its regulations,cited above, the Commission had construed NEPA's direction to considerreasonable alternatives as constituting a mandate to characterize at leastthree sites, in at least two geologic media. Although establishing newprocedures, NWPA followed precisely the same substantive approach.Site Selection Under the Nuclear Waste Policy ActThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act directed the development of two geologic repositories.This section will describe the process leading to the selection of a sitefor the first repository. The process for a second repository was generallythe same, except that the statutory dates for particular actions were severalyears later.The site selection process, as carried out by DOE, began with the identificationof States with ``potentially acceptable sites''_sites at which DOE, aftergeologic studies and field mapping, was to undertake preliminary drillingand geophysical testing for the definition of site location. DOE was requiredto notify States involved, and affected Indian tribes, of the identificationof such sites. Section 116(a), 42 U.S.C. 10136(a). DOE identified ninepotentially acceptable sites for the first repository and provided noticeto the six States in which such sites were located.Before the selection process could move any further, DOE had to issue ``generalguidelines for the recommendation of sites for repositories.'' NWPA providedthat, under the guidelines, DOE would need to consider the various geologicmedia in which sites may be located and, to the extent practicable, torecommend sites in different geologic media. The guidelines were to specifyfactors that qualify or disqualify a site from development as a repository;among the factors specified by the law were certain nonradiological environmentalconcerns as well as considerations related to the isolation of the radionuclidesin the waste. NWPA required DOE, prior to issuance of the guidelines, toconsult with the Council on Environmental Quality, the Environmental ProtectionAgency, the Geologic Survey, and interested Governors. DOE was also requiredto obtain the concurrence of the Commission in the guidelines. Section112(a), 42 U.S.C. 10132(a). Guidelines have been issued by DOE. 49 FR 47714,Dec. 6, 1984. The concurrence of the Commission in the guidelines was publishedin the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on July 10, 1984. 49 FR 28130.DOE was directed, following issuance of the guidelines and consultationwith the governors of affected States, to nominate at least 5 sites determinedto be suitable for site characterization. Section 112(b)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C.10132(b)(1)(A). Nomination had to be preceded by public hearings near thesite, on which occasions residents of the area would be solicited withrespect to issues that should be addressed by DOE in its environmentalassessment and site characterization plan. Section 112(b)(2), 42 U.S.C.10132(b)(2). Also, before nomination DOE was required to notify the Statesor affected Indian tribes of its intent to nominate a site and of the basisfor such nomination. Section 112(b)(1)(H), 42 U.S.C. 10132(b)(1)(H). Thenomination itself needed to be accompanied by an environmental assessment,which set out the basis for nomination and which discussed the probableimpacts of site characterization activities. The environmental assessment,to be made public, would contain an evaluation of the suitability of thesite for site characterization under the general guidelines, an evaluationof the suitability of the site for development as a repository under eachguideline that does not require site characterization as a prerequisitefor application, an evaluation of the effects of site characterizationon the public health and safety and the environment, a comparative evaluationwith other sites that have been considered, a description of the decisionprocess by which the site was recommended, and an assessment of the regionaland local impacts of locating the repository at the site. The sufficiencyof an environmental assessment with respect to these matters was subjectto the judicial review provisions of the statute, which generally requirepetitions for review to be filed within 180 days after the action involved.Section 112(b)(1) (E through G), 119; 42 U.S.C. 10132(b)(1) (E throughG), 10139. On May 28, 1986, DOE released final environmental assessmentson five potential repository sites (at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; Deaf SmithCounty, Texas; the Hanford Reservation, Washington; Richton Dome, Mississippi;and Davis Canyon, Utah). (The NRC staff had previously reviewed and commentedon the draft environmental assessments for these sites.)Subsequent to site nomination, DOE was required to recommend to the Presidentthree of the nominated sites for characterization as candidate sites. Section112(b)(1)(B), 42 U.S.C. 10132(b)(1)(B). Upon arrival of the candidate sites,the States and affected Indian tribes were to be notified. Section 112(c),42 U.S.C. 10132(c). On May 28, 1986, the Secretary of Energy formally recommendedthe sites in Nevada, Texas, and Washington, and these recommendations wereapproved by the President.Before sinking shafts at an approved site, DOE is to submit to the Statesand affected Indian tribes_and, in this instance to the Commission as well_fortheir review and comment, a general plan for site characterization activities,a description of the possible form or packaging of the waste, and a conceptualrepository design. The general plan is to describe the site, the proposedsite characterization activities, plans for decommissioning a site thatis determined to be unsuitable (and plans for investigation of significantadverse environmental impacts of site characterization), the criteria tobe used to determine site suitabililty (i.e., the siting guidelines), andother information related to site characterization activities requiredby the Commission. Section 113(b), 42 U.S.C. 10133(b). Congress has declaredthat site characterization activities shall not require the preparationof an environmental impact statement, or other environmental review underNEPA. Section 113(d), 42 U.S.C. 10133(d). However, DOE is to hold publichearings near a site, and to receive comments of residents of the areawith respect to the site characterization plan. Section 113(b)(2), 42 U.S.C.10133(b)(2). And those comments, as well as those received on the environmentalassessments, are to be considered by DOE. DOE, in consultation with theStates and affected Indian tribes (but not specifically the Commission),is to conduct site characterization activities in a manner that minimizessignificant adverse environmental impacts identified in the comments. Section113(a), 42 U.S.C. 10133(a). DOE is to report periodically to the Commissionand to States and affected Indian tribes on the progress of site characterizationand the information developed to date. Section 113(b)(3), 42 U.S.C. 10133(b)(3).Under NWPA, the selection process was to continue with the identificationof one site for development of a repository. DOE was required to hold hearingsnear that site, and it was also required to complete site characterizationnot only for that site but for at least two other sites as well. DOE mightrecommend to the President that he approve the site where hearings wereheld. The recommendation, notice of which would be given to States andaffected Indian tribes, was to be accompanied by a description of the proposedrepository and waste form or packaging; a discussion of data, obtainedin site characterization activities, relating to the safety of the site;a final environmental impact statement, together with comments made concerningsuch statement by the Commission and others; preliminary Commission commentsregarding the sufficiency of data for inclusion in a license application;comments of States and affected Indian tribes, with DOE's response; andan impact report prepared by States or affected Indian tribes requestingfinancial or technical assistance, to mitigate impacts. Section 114(a)(1),42 U.S.C. 10134(a)(1). Subject to a good cause exception, the EIS mightonly be reviewed by the courts if a petition is filed within 180 days afterthe date of the decision concerned (i.e., presumably, the recommendationto the President). Section 119(a)(1)(D), 42 U.S.C. 10139(a)(1)(D). Thealternative sites to be considered in the EIS would consist of three sitesat which characterization has been completed and DOE has made a preliminarydetermination of their suitability for development as repositories underthe guidelines issued earlier. Section 114(f), 42 U.S.C. 10134(f).The President might submit to Congress a recommendation of a site thathad previously been recommended to him by DOE. By law, the President'srecommendation would not require the preparation of an EIS or other NEPAenvironmental review. Section 114(a), 42 U.S.C. 10134(a). A State mightdisapprove a site recommended by the President, by giving notice of suchaction to Congress. Any such notice of disapproval is to be accompaniedby a statement of the State's reasons. Section 116(b), 42 U.S.C. 10136(b).In the case of a site on a reservation, the affected Indian tribe mightsubmit such a notice of disapproval. Section 118(a), 42 U.S.C. 10138. ThePresident's recommendation would then become effective only if Congresspasses a resolution approving the site, and such resolution thereafterbecomes law. Section 115(c), 42 U.S.C. 10135(c). In considering a noticeof disapproval, Congress might obtain comments of the Commission, but theprovision of comments would not bind the Commission with respect to anylicensing action Section 115(g), 42 U.S.C. 10135(g).If the site designation becomes effective_by virtue of a State or Tribe'sfailure to disapprove within the specified times or by virtue of the Congressionaloverride of the State's or Tribe's notice of disapproval_DOE was directedthen to submit its application to the Commission. Section 114(b), 42 U.S.C.10134(b). The Commission was to consider an application in accordance withthe laws applicable thereto. Section 114(d), 42 U.S.C. 10134(d).If DOE's application is acceptable, the site selection process would thenend, subject to judicial review, with the Commission's issuance of a constructionauthorization.NRC NEPA Responsibilities in Light of NWPAThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 generally preserves the Commission'sobligation to comply with NEPA. Nevertheless, the scope of the inquiryand the standards and procedures to be applied in arriving at findingsin accordance with NEPA are clearly influenced by the express and impliedmandates of the later statute. The import of NWPA is especially forcefulin relation to site selection, but the Commission regards the statute ashaving a pervasive effect upon all of its NEPA responsibilities. First, there are several express provisions of NWPA that narrow the rangeof alternatives that must be considered in the environmental impact statement,especially for the first repository. Thus, DOE's compliance with the proceduresand requirements of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act ``shall be deemed adequateconsideration of the need for a repository, the time of the initial availabilityof a repository, and all alternatives to the isolation of high-level radioactivewaste and spent nuclear fuel in a repository.'' Even more forcefully, the1982 Act declares that any EIS prepared with respect to the first repositoryshall not consider the need for a repository or nongeologic alternativesto the site; and the alternative sites to be considered are those candidatesites (three in the case of the first repository, and at least three inthe case of subsequent repositories) with respect to which site characterizationhas been completed and the Secretary of Energy has made a preliminary determinationthat such sites are suitable for development of repositories. Section 114(f),42 U.S.C. 10134(f).In addition, section 114(f) directs the Commission to adopt DOE's EIS ``tothe extent practicable.'' As a minimum, this requires the Commission togive substantial weight to the findings of other bodies, where relevantto the determinations to be made by the Commission itself. This is consistentwith prior practice. For example, in <T3>Public Service Company of New Hampshire</T3> (Seabrook Station, Units1 and 2), CLI-77-8, 5 NRC 503, 527 (1977), the Commission observed thata competent and responsible state authority's approval of the environmentalacceptability of a site or a project after extensive and thorough and environmentallysensitive hearings is properly entitled to such substantial weight in theconduct of its own NEPA analysis. Similarly, to the extent that Congresshas enacted legislation approving a specific project, an agency's obligationto discuss alternatives in its EIS is relatively narrow; although the ``ruleof reason'' applies, such action does have a bearing on what is considereda reasonable alternative and a reasonable discussion. <T3>Izaak Walton League </T3>v. <T3>Marsh, </T3>655 F.2d 346, 372 (D.C. Cir. 1981), citing <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Adams, </T3>578 F.2d 389, 396 (D.C. Cir. 1978). The concept of adoption,as it appears in NWPA, is examined more fully below.The Nuclear Waste Policy Act provides that adoption of the EIS shall bedeemed to satisfy the Commission's NEPA responsibilities ``and no furtherconsideration shall be required.'' While the purpose of this provisionis not entirely clear, it appears to counsel against the wide-ranging independentexamination of environmental concerns that is customary in NRC licensingproceedings.The final limitation on the Commission's consideration of NEPA issues stemsfrom the judicial review provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Section119, 42 U.S.C. 10139 provides for the United States courts of appeals tohave original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for reviewof any environmental impact statement prepared with respect to a geologicrepository and imposes a deadline of 180 days (with certain exceptions)for commencing such an action. Thus, a review of the adequacy of DOE'senvironmental impact statement must be sought, if at all, within 180 daysafter the Secretary has made a site recommendation to the President. Asa minimum, any judicial findings with respect to the adequacy of the EISprepared by DOE would be entitled to substantial weight in the Commission'sdeliberations. But this statement is incomplete. As explained below, ifthe EIS prepared by DOE has been adjudged to be adequate for purposes ofthe site recommendation made by the Department, further litigation of theissues in NRC adjudications would be precluded under the doctrine of collateralestoppel. <T3>Toledo Edison Co. </T3>(Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Units 1,2, and 3) ALAB-378, 5 NRC 557, 561 (1977). And, if an issue bearing uponthe adequacy of that EIS could have been raised, but was not raised ina timely manner, the deadline for commencing action set out in section119 operates to bar a challenge at a later date in NRC licensing proceedings.In the light of the policies and procedures established by the NuclearWaste Policy Act, the Commission regards the scope of its NEPA review tobe narrowly constrained, with those issues that were ripe for considerationafter issuance of DOE's EIS being excluded from independent examination,for purposes of NEPA, in the course of NRC licensing proceedings. It willbe useful to review the legislative history of the Act and certain regulationsof the Council on Environmental Quality, and to discuss applicable principlesof repose, in order to explain the basis for the Commission's views.Legislative HistoryThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 reflects a judgment that the Commissionis to concern itself primarily with issues of health and safety ratherthan the other kinds of issues that are ordinarily considered in the contextof reviews under NEPA. This judgment is especially clear in connectionwith the screening and selection of repository sites. The <T3>only </T3>provisions for NRC involvement in the site screening andselection process concern the issuance of the general guidelines for therecommendation of sites for repositories (in which the Commission is requiredto concur), the Department's plans for site characterization (which mustbe submitted to the Commission for review and comment), and the preparationof preliminary comments by the Commission to accompany the Secretary'srecommendation of a site concerning the extent to which DOE's site characterizationanalysis and waste form proposal seem to be sufficient for inclusion ina license application. With the possible exception of the guidelines, theCommission's role is defined so as to address the safety issues (whichare the subject of DOE's site characterization program and waste form proposal)that must be resolved in licensing proceedings. Where Congress sets upa detailed mechanism for consideration of particular issues by an agency,and both judicial and legislative review of that agency's decisions, asit has here done with respect to the NEPA actions of DOE, it may be inferredthat it did not intend to rely upon this Commission to challenge DOE'spossible ``disregard of the law'' after all these procedures have run theircourse. <T3>Cf. Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </T3>467 U.S. 340, 351,81 L.Ed.2d 270, 279 (1984).A consideration of the legislative history lends further support to thisanalysis. Although there were several bills dealing with nuclear wasteissues before the 97th Congress, the provisions dealing with site selectionissues can be traced directly to H.R. 3809, as reported out by the Committeeon Interior and Insular Affairs. H.R. Rep. 97-491, Part 1, 97th Cong.,2d Sess. (1982). The bill included sections_similar to those ultimatelyenacted_on guidelines, site characterization, site approval and constructionauthorization, review of repository site selection by Congress, participationof States and Indian tribes, etc. The provision relating to the site characterizationplan to be prepared by DOE was drawn directly from the corresponding NRCregulation. (<T3>Compare</T3> H.R. 3809, section 113(b)(1)(B) <T3>with</T3> 10 CFR 60.11(a) (1982). All the matters related to the abilityof the site to host a repository and isolate radioactive waste were carriedover from the regulation to the bill. But matters pertaining to the screeningand selection of sites, though set out in the regulation, were omittedin the bill. These include the requirements that DOE discuss the decisionprocess used by DOE in selecting sites for characterization and identifyalternative media and sites at which DOE intended to conduct size characterization.Under the proposed legislation, this information would no longer come tothe Commission for review. H.R. 3809 also included the provsion, ultimatelyenacted, that the Commission would be required to adopt the EIS preparedby the Secretary ``to the extent practicable.'' The limited nature of theCommission's role was emphasized by the explanatory language of the reportto the effect that the Commission would be required so to adopt the EIS``to the <T3>maximum</T3> extent practicable'' (emphasis added). Moreover, the EIS``is intended to suffice regarding the issues addressed and not be duplicatedby the Commission unless the Commission determines, in its discretion,that significant and substantial new information or new considerationsrender the Secretary's statement inadequate as a basis for the Commission'sdeterminations.'' H.R. Rep. 97-491, Part 1, 53-54.There was no specific provision in H.R. 3809 requiring DOE to carry outand document a comparative evaluation of sites considered for site characterization.Later in the year, however, such a provision was incorporated into thebill (now H.R. 6598), as reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce.H.R. Rep. 97-785, Part 1, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982). Among other things,the bill (in section 113(b)(1)(A)(v)) would have required DOE to prepare,prior to site characterization, an environmental assessment which wouldinclude a description of any other sites considered for site characterization.This information would have been submitted to the Commission for its reviewand comment. The purpose of providing reports at this stage was ``to assurethat adequate information is available to the Commission regarding theSecretary's proposed activities.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 64. H.R. 6598 retained the provision for NRC adoption ofDOE's environmental impact statement. The report explained, <T3>id.</T3> at 69:<ITAG tagnum="21">This provision is intended to avoid the duplication caused as a resultof the applicability of NEPA to the actions of both the Secretary and theCommission regarding the preparation of an environmental impact statement.While the Commission is encouraged to adopt the Secretary's statement,or parts of such statement, the independent responsibilities of the Commissionare specifically recognized. To the extent the Commission determines itis not practicable to adopt all or part of the Secretary's environmentalimpact statement, the Commission's responsibilities under NEPA remain inforce, thus requiring the preparation of a supplemental environmental impactstatement.</ITAG>Floor consideration in the House was addressed to H.R. 7187, as a substitutefor both H.R. 3809 and H.R. 6598. The EIS-adoption language appears onceagain. However, the provisions for an environmental assessment were modifiedin two important ways. First, DOE would not explicitly be required to make``a reasonable comparative evaluation'' of the sites that had been consideredfor site characterization. Section 112(b)(1)(A). Second, under H.R. 7187the environmental assessment would precede, rather than follow, the President'sapproval of sites to be characterized, and it would no longer be submittedto the Commission for review and comment. <T3>Ibid.</T3>There was no committee report on H.R. 7187, but a summary of its provisionsnoted:<ITAG tagnum="21">In issuing the construction permit and license the NRC will rely onthe Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Secretary of Energyin recommending the repository site. The Commission will have to supplementany environmental impact statement with considerations of the public healthand safety required under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">128 Cong.Rec. H8163 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1982) (statement of Rep.Udall). Rep. Moorhead also characterized the Commission's role in termsof its health and safety responsibilities:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * an extensive environmental assessment must be developed by theSecretary of Energy in consultation with the States. There will be a fulland complete review of the planned site under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act, culminating in a comprehensive environmental impact statement.This as well as all other final agency actions_will be open to full judicialreview. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will have ovesight authorityover the development of this repository under its independent public healthand safety standards.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.</T3> at H8170. Congressman Ottinger, too, differentiated in passingbetween ``full environmental review'' on the one hand and ``full NRC licensingprocedures to assure that the storage is safe'' on the other. 128 Cong.Rec.H8527 (daily ed. Nov. 29, 1982).The legislative history in the Senate is less illuminating, inasmuch asits bill, S. 1662, differs substantially from the final legislation. (S.1662, as reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, appearsat 128 Cong.Rec. S4139 ff., daily ed. Apr. 28, 1982.) Under S. 1662, theCommission would have a more substantive role with respect to implementationof NEPA. There would be no direction to the Commission to adopt the DOEenvironmental impact statement. Rather, under Section 405, the Commissionwould be required to consider the application in accordance with the lawsapplicable thereto; as an exception, however, the bill provided that theCommission need only consider as alternate sites for the proposed repositorythose sites which have been approved by the President for characterization.Senator Simpson, sponsor of the legislation, explained that the NRC licensingprocess would provide opportunities for ``a detailed evaluation of thehealth and safety <T3>and environmental</T3> aspects of the proposed project'' (emphasisadded). 128 Cong.Rec. S4302 (daily ed. Apr. 29, 1982).In December 1982, the Senate turned to consider legislation following thepertinent language of the bill which had by that time been passed by theHouse of Representatives. Senator Mitchell declared that the national nuclearwaste policy should ``preserve the integrity and full scope of the NRClicensing review and environmental analysis under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act,'' 128 Cong.Rec. S15669 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 1982), but the broadscope of his remarks leaves it of doubtful import in the context of geologicrepositories alone. Of more significance, perhaps, is the colloquy withrespect to an amendment proposed by Senator Levin, and passed, to includein section 114(f) the language that nothing in the Act should be construedto amend or otherwise detract from the Commission's licensing requirements.Sen. Levin stated his understanding that the Act was not intended to restrict,or amend, or modify NRC requirments for the repository in any way ``including,but not limited to, findings of need.'' Senator McClure, the floor managerof the bill, replied that Sen. Levin was correct and added that ``thatis my understanding also.'' Since findings of need have generally beenregarded as NEPA issues, this could be taken to mean that the Commissionshould discharge its NEPA requirements in the same way as it would in theabsence of the review procedures prescribed by the Nuclear Waste PolicyAct. This cannot be the case, however, in light of the other provisionsof the Act, including those in section 114(f) itself. It seems clear thatthe law was not intended to modify any of the Commission's licensing requirementsunder the Atomic Energy Act. The Commission construes the clause in questionto be limited to those requirements; it does not pertain to the provisionsof NEPA. The remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are notcontrolling in analyzing legislative history, <T3>Chrysler Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Brown,</T3> 441 U.S. 281, 311, 60 L.Ed.2d 208, 231 (1979), especiallywhere as here their significance is not apparent without further study.Whatever the understanding of Sen. Levin may have been, the Nuclear WastePolicy Act manifestly does affect the manner in which the NEPA responsibilitiesof the Commission must be carried out, and the rules proposed below indicatethe approach which we intend to take.Although the views of Congress are not entirely unambiguous, the overalltenor is that the Commission's role should focus upon radiological safety,with an independent review of NEPA factors only where warranted in thelight of ``significant and substantial new information or new consideration.''``Adoption'' and the Nuclear Waste Policy ActThe Council on Environmental Quality has established procedures to guideagencies that are engaged in actions that have related environmental impacts.These procedures allow for several approaches to NEPA compliance, includingone approach in which the environmental impact statement prepared by oneagency is ``adopted'' by another agency. 40 CFR 1506.3. In appropriatecircumstances, an EIS prepared by another agency may be adopted, in accordancewith CEQ regulations, in whole or part by NRC. 10 CFR Part 51, AppendixA to subpart andpara; 1(b). An examination of those regulations will illuminatethe direction to the Commission, in section 114(f) of the Waste PolicyAct, to ``adopt'' the DOE EIS to the extent practicable. In the absenceof irreconcilable conflict with other provisions of NWPA, those regulationsshould be followed.The CEQ regulations provide that where more than one agency is involvedin the same action, either one agency will be designated a lead agencyto prepare an EIS, or two (or more) agencies will be designated as jointlead agencies. Any agency which has jurisdiction by law with respect tothe action shall be a cooperating agency, if so requested by the lead agency.An agency_even if it has jurisdiction_need not serve as a cooperating agency,however, unless the lead agency has requested it to do so. Whether or notit is a cooperating agency, a Federal agency with jurisdiction by law orspecial expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved hasa duty to comment on a lead agency's statement within the commenting agency'sjurisdiction, expertise, or authority. 40 CFR 1501.5, 1501.6, 1503.2.In the context of NWPA, it is apparent that the Department of Energy wouldbe the lead agency and that the Commission would not be a lead agency.The Commission could either be a cooperating agency, with the particularresponsibilities set out in andSection; 1501.6 of the CEQ regulations, ora commenting agency. The NWPA points to the Commission's assuming the latterrole. A cooperating agency is required to participate in the NEPA processat the earliest possible time, to participate in the scoping process leadingto preparation of the environmental impact statement, and to assume onrequest of the lead agency responsibility for developing information andpreparing environmental analyses including portions of the EIS concerningwhich the cooperating agency has special expertise. The framework of NWPA,as rehearsed above, contemplates no such involvement by the Commission.It would be far more faithful to the statutory scheme for this agency merelyto provide its comments, from time to time, with respect to environmentalimpacts failling within its jurisdiction or areas of special expertise.This is entirely consistent with the statutory provision that the Secretaryof Energy's recommendation to the President of a site for repository developmentshall be accompanied by a final EIS, together with comments made by theCommission concerning such EIS. Section 114(a)(1)(D), 42 U.S.C. 10134(a)(1)(D).As a commenting agency, the Commission would be authorized to adopt theEIS prepared by DOE provided that the statement meets the standards foran adequate statement under the CEQ regulations. The pendency or outcomeof litigation with respect to the DOE EIS is one factor to be considered.This is apparent from CEQ's direction to the adopting agency to specify,where applicable, that ``the statement's adequacy is the subject of a judicialaction which is not final.'' Since the actions covered by the DOE EIS andthe Commission's action are substantially the same_namely, developmentof a geologic repository of the proposed design at the proposed site_theCommission would not be required to recirculate the DOE EIS except as afinal statement. 40 CFR 1506.3.The Commission can follow the CEQ procedures for a commenting agency, includingthe procedures for adoption of DOE's EIS. But the IES can only be adoptedif it meets the standards for an ``adequate statement.'' The approach beingtaken by the Commission, in these proposed rules, is that NWPA and theprinciples of res judicata obviate the need for an entirely independentadjudication of the adequacy of the EIS by this agency. As this might beseen as a departure from established practices, the differences merit somefurther discussion.It is well established that the Commission has a responsiblity to considerenviromental issues just as it considers other matters within its mandate.Moreover, the duty to consider environmental issues extends through allstages of the Commission's review processes, including proceedings beforehearing boards. And the Commission may not simply defer totally to thestandards set by other regulatory authorities with respect to enviromentalmatters within their jurisdiction; to do so would be an abdication of theCommission's NEPA authority. <T3>Clavert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, </T3>449 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1971).There would be an abdication because NEPA mandates a case-by-case balancingjudgment_a judgment that is entirely different from the piecemeal certificationby another agency that its own environmental standards are met. The onlyagency in a position to make the kind of balancing judgment contemplatedby NEPA is the agency with overall responsibility for the proposed federalaction. <T3>Id. </T3>at 1123. In <T3>Calvert Cliffs, </T3>only the Atomic Energy Commission could make therequired decision. In the case of a geologic repository, the Departmentof Energy is required to make precisely the kind of analysis that the courtthere deemed to be essential. For the Commission to adopt the DOE EIS withoutindependent analysis, after there had been opportunity for judicial review,therefore, would be entirely consistent with the reasoning of the earliercase. Similarly, the overlap between DOE and Commission actions distinguishesthe present situation from the other NEPA decisions which required an independentbalancing judgment by each of the agencies involved in a project. <T3>See Silentman </T3>v. <T3>Federal Power Commission, </T3>566 F.2d 237, 240 (D.C. Cir. 1977);<T3>Henry </T3>v. <T3>Federal Power Commission, </T3>513 F.2d 395, 407 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (Bureauof Reclamation control of relevant water rights for coal gasification plant;FPC regulation of gas transportation). The similarity of DOE and Commission actions, from the standpoint of theirrespective environmental impacts, has not in the past been considered,by itself, to be sufficient to persuade the Commission to defer to DOE'sbalancing judgments. The fact that the applicant for a license to builda nuclear power plant is another Federal agency has not excused NRC fromcarrying out its usual NEPA obligations, even though both agencies wereconsidering the same impacts associated with construction and operationof the facility. <T3>Tennessee Valley Authority </T3>(Phipps Bend Nuclear Plant, Units 1and 2), ALAB-506, 8 NRC 533, 545 (1978). But in prior practice there wasno prior judicial determination that the other agency's EIS was adequateand there was no special statutory scheme for consideration of environmentalimpacts by interested parties and Congress. It is the judgment of the Commissionthat these unique considerations warrant, and indeed require, adoptionof an EIS that is adequate to meet the obligations of DOE. To repeat: the Commission must consider the environmental impacts resultingfrom the construction and development of geologic repository for high-levelradioactive waste. All that is in question is the basis for the Commission'sconsideration. The factors discussed above make it entirely reasonablefor the Commission not to reopen issues that have been, or could previouslyhave been, brought before the courts for resolution. The Commission doesnot derogate the importance of NEPA issues. Under the Nuclear Waste PolicyAct, they are extremely important_and in fact they are central to manyof the elaborate procedural provisions incorporated in that legislation.It is to those provisions that parties concerned must turn. But once anapplication is submitted to the Commission, the primary question to beaddressed is no longer one of environmental balancing, but rather the criticalissue of radiological safety. That is an issue that is entrusted solelyto the Commission, and the Commission can discharge its duties most effectivelyif it makes that the primary basis for decision. The Preclusive Effect of Section 119The approach being proposed by the Commission reflects the policies ofrespose associated with the rules of res judicata. Before examining thoserules in detail, it might be helpful to go over, once again, salient featuresof the NWPA site selection and approval procedures. The NWPA procedures really reflect two different kinds of review. The firstrequires judgments regarding the radiological safety of HLW disposal_mattersto adjudicated solely by the Commission, taking into account the standardsissued by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Act clearly recognizesthat while the Commission's preliminary views are to be solicited and consideredon several occasions, a final judgment of radiological safety can onlybe made at the conclusion of the adjudicatory licensing process. The Commissionis expected and required to deny an application_long after other procedureshad run their course_if it is unable to find, with reasonable assurance,that the relevant safety criteria have been met. The responsibility ofconsideration of the radiological consequences of a proposed action isadvisedly vested in the Commission, which can bring its experience andexpertise to the task, in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act. The second kind of review involves the weighing of the range of environmentalconcerns that are addressed by NEPA. This review focuses heavily on thecomparison of alternatives, including alternative sites, rather than withthe narrower task of evaluating a specific site. Moreover, the relevantconcerns under NEPA are multitudinous, as opposed to the single issue ofradiological safety that is the primary concern of the Atomic Energy Act.While the Commission does have experience and expertise in carrying outa review under NEPA, Congress in 1982 elected not to rely upon the Commissionin this regard. It structured the process in such a way that the evaluationof alternatives_in particular, alternative sites_would have been attendedto before the Commission was required to act. This was accomplished largelythrough the State and Tribal participation provisions, including the requirementof Congressional action to proceed in the face of a notice of disapproval.And, additionally, it was accomplished through requiring early judicialreview.The consequence of this approach is that the Commission would carry outa licensing review to assure that a repository could be operated safely_butthat it would, in general, treat as settled those other issues arisingunder NEPA. The Commission's understanding, based in particular upon its reading ofsection 119, merits a fuller statement of the legal doctrines that arecollectively referred to as the rules of <T3>res judicata</T3>. One of these doctrines is the rule of ``claim preclusion''_thata party who once has had a chance to litigate a claim before an appropriatetribunal usually ought not to have another chance to do so. The relatedrule of ``issue preclusion'' (or collateral estoppel) reflects the principlethat one who has actually litigated an issue should not be allowed to relitigateit. The effect, and value, of these rules is that they compel repose, sothat the indefinite continuation of a dispute can be avoided. Judgmentsmust in general be accorded finality despite flaws in the processes leadingto decision and the unavoidable possibility that the results in some instanceswere wrong. Only when there is a substantial possibility of injustice mightrelitigation be warranted. <T3>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</T3> 2-12.The clearest application of these principles would occur where there hasactually been a timely challenge to the adequacy of DOE's environmentalstatement. A final judgment in such litigation would be conclusive, inany subsequent action between the parties, as to any issue of law or factthat had actually been litigated, <T3>id.,</T3> section 27. Moreover, the party who had challenged the EISwould thereafter be precluded from litigating such issues with anotherperson as well, <T3>id.,</T3> section 29.The judgment in an action, under section 119(a)(1)(D), for review of DOE'senvironmental impact statement will therefore preclude the petitioner fromlater litigating the same issues with NRC (even assuming that NRC is adifferent person, for these purposes, from its sister agency, DOE). Thedimensions of the issue that were determined by the judgment may be a matterof debate. But if the litigant has had an adequate day in court, a desireto prevent repetitious litigation of what is essentially the same disputejustifies preclusion of the issue's being raised anew. While the actionbeing taken by DOE is the recommendation to the President of a site forrepository development and the action being taken by the Commission isthe issuance of a construction authorization for a repository, the relevantconsiderations in the two situations are identical. Both agencies willbe addressing the development of a repository at a specific location andboth will require an environmental impact statement that describes thepertinent environmental impacts and considers appropriate alternatives.If the DOE EIS is found to be adequate to meet the requirements of NEPA,then it would ordinarily be proper to preclude a challenge to the ``adequacy''of the identical EIS, if relied upon by the Commission. See <T3>id., </T3>section 27.The preclusive effect of a prior judgment sustaining DOE's environmentalimpact statement would not necessarily be limited to the petitioner ofrecord in that proceeding. It can be argued that those who were representedby that petitioner would also be barred from litigating the issue in asubsequent action.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For example, if the EIS had been challenged by the publicofficials of the State in which a respository was proposed to be located,members of the public who had been represented by those officials mightbe precluded, to the same extent, from raising the issues anew. <T3>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</T3> andSection; 41, comment d. Thebasis for this argument would be that, under the doctrine of <T3>parens patriae, </T3>a State is deemed to represent all of its citizenswhen the State is a party in a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest.<T3>See, e.g., Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Higginson,,</T3> 631F.2d 738 (D.C. Cir. 1979); <T3>U.S. v. Olin Corp., </T3>606 F. Supp. 1301 (N.D. Ala. 1985).Section 119 specifically requires that a civil action for review of anenvironmental impact statement with respect to any action under SubtitleA (pertaining to geologic repositories) be brought within a period of 180days after the date of the action (or after obtaining actual or constructiveknowledge thereof). Thus, a failure to meet the deadline for challengingthe DOE environmental impact statement would foreclose any subsequent litigationwith respect to the action to which that EIS pertains. The objective appearsto have been to identify issues promptly and to seek to resolve them ina timely manner. Where there is litigation in accordance with this provision,the principles described above would preclude further judicial examinationof the same issues as they relate to the Commission's action. But whatwould happen if for some reason the adequacy of the DOE environmental impactstatement had not been challenged judicially before it was time for theCommission to act_or if it had been challenged, the action had been broughtby other parties? If the Commission were to adopt the DOE environmentalimpact statement, would the merits of the decision to adopt be subjectto further review? The Commission suggests that the courts should denya petition under these circumstances as being untimely. There would be,in this case, only one environment impact statement; and, in accordancewith section 119, there would be but one opportunity for review. To concludeotherwise would be to frustrate the objective of seeking an early resolutionof the environmental issues that might be involved. <T3>See Eagle-Picher Industries v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,</T3>759 F.2d 905, 911-919 (D.C. Cir. 1985). <T3>See also National Wildlife Federation v.

The merits of multiple site characterization were addressed in the courseof the Congressional debate that immediately preceded passage of the AmendmentsAct. Senator Burdick, in particular, noted that full characterization ofthree sites (according to the original NWPA) was based, in part, on theimportant NEPA principle of fully considering reasonable alternatives whenmaking important decisions that will significantly affect the human environment.In discussing the different approach (in the conference report on the pendingbudget reconcilation, legislation) that was soon to be adopted, he stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">Other than the elimination of the consideration of three alternatesites for the repository, which was just outlined, is a major and dangerousdeparture from current law, the [conference] substitute does not affectthe application of NEPA to the repository program. Congressional Record,S 18674 (daily ed., Dec. 21, 1987).  </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The conference report expresses the same point. It declares:  <ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act pertaining to the applicationof the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are preserved except thatthe existing requirement that the environmental impact statement accompanyingDOE's repository siting recommendation consider alternative sites is eliminated.NEPA applies to the redirected program under this Act in the same way asNEPA applied to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The conferees donot intend that enactment of the conference substitute result in any changein NEPA application except as expressly provided.

Rept. 100-495, 776.  </ITAG>The Commission has explained above that, under NWPA as originally enacted,it should make an independent review of NEPA factor only when warrantedin the light of ``significant and substantial new information or new considerations.''Further, it was the duty of the Commission, under that law, to adopt anEIS that is adequate to meet the obligations of DOE. Since the AmendmentsAct was not intended to affect the implementation of NEPA with respectto the repository program_except as to the consideration of alternativesites_the Commission will follow the same procedures, discussed below,that it would have had the Amendments Act not been passed.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rules  </ITAG>This rulemaking proceeding is primarily concerned with amendments to 10CFR Part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensingand Related Regulatory Functions.'' The proceeding also encompasses conformingamendments to other parts of the Commission's regulations.  Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51 sets out NRC regulations for implementing section102(2) of NEPA. The principal matters addressed by Subpart A are the following:(1) Identification of licensing and regulatory actions requiring the preparationof enviornmental impact statements or environmental assessments; (2) requirementsfor the submission of environmental reports and information by licenseapplicants and petitioners for rulemaking; (3) contents and distributionof draft and final environmental impact statements; (4) NEPA procedureand administrative action; and (5) public notice of and access to enviornmentaldocuments. Since each of these topics is treated, expressly or implicitly,by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, the Commission proposes todevelop as part of Subpart A certain new rules, discussed below, that willapply to geologic repositories and that will take into account the provisionsof the Act.\3\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\The Nuclear Waste Policy Act applies only with respectto geologic repositories that are used, at least in part, for the disposalof waste from civilian nuclear waste activities. Section 8, 42 U.S.C. 10108.Under the Act, however, high-level radioactive waste resulting from atomicenergy defense activities is to be disposed of in such repositories, alongwith civilan wastes, unless the President finds that a separate facilityis required. The President has determined that such a separate facilityis not needed. In the light of these developments, the Commission believesthat it is sufficient to limit the scope of this action to those facilitiesthat may be situated and constructed in accordance with the Nuclear WastePolicy Act.       Actions Requiring Preparation of Environmental DocumentUnder Section 121 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 10141, theCommission's promulgation of technical requirements and criteria in 10CFR Part 60 does not require the preparation of an environmental impactstatement or other environmental review under section 102(2) of NEPA. Theproposed rules incorporate this provision.\4\<NOTE/> Under existing 10 CFR Part 51, certain procedural actionspertaining to the licensing of geologic repositories have been determinedto be categorically excluded from environmental assessment. See referencesto 10 CFR Part 60 in 10 CFR 51.22(c). No change in those provisions isneeded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See andSection; 51.22(d). Conforming amendments would bemade in andSection; 51.21 and in the caption of andSection; 51.22.Under 10 CFR 51.20(a), an environmental impact statement is required ifthe proposed action is a major Federal action significantly affecting thequality of the human environment or if the Commission, in the exerciseof its discretion, determines that the proposed action should be coveredby such an EIS. Section 114(f) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.10134(f), reflects a Congressional understanding, with which the Commissionis in full accord, that the issuance of a construction authorization andlicense for a geologic repository will require an environmental impactstatement. This has been incorporated into the proposed rules. Other licensingactions, unless covered by existing categorical exclusions (see paragraphs(10), (11), and (12) of 10 CFR 51.22(c)), would require an environmentalassessment under 10 CFR 51.21.Ordinarily, a determination that an environmental impact statement (orsupplement) will be prepared triggers public notice and the initiationof a scoping process. Where another agency prepares the EIS, however, ithas the responsibility to carry out these functions. We are proposing toclarify this point by limiting the application of these procedures to situationsin which the appropriate NRC staff director determines that an environmentalimpact statement will be prepared ``by NRC.'' See the amendment to andSection;51.26(a).Submission of Environmental InformationThe Commission's regulations encourage prospective applicants or petitionersfor rulemaking to confer with NRC staff before submitting environmentalinformation. 10 CFR 51.40. The regulations also provide that the Commissionmay require such persons to submit information which may be useful in aidingthe Commission in complying with section 102(2) of NEPA. 10 CFR 51.41.These general provisions are compatible with the requirements of the NuclearWaste Policy Act.The more specific regulations dealing with the submission of environmentalreports are inappropriate in the context of the geologic repository program.Insead of providing for the submission of an environmental report, theNuclear Waste Policy Act requires that NRC consider, and if practicableadopt, a final environmental impact <T3>statement </T3>prepared by DOE at the time of its recommendation tothe President for the development of a repository at a particular site.Section 114, 42 U.S.C. 10134. The recommendation for development of a repositoryincludes, as a minimum, the obtaining of a license from NRC to receiveand possess wastes. The environmental impact statement must therefore addressnot only the environmental effects of construction but those of repositoryperformance as well. This is reflected in the statutory direction to theCommission to adopt the environmental impact statement, to the exent practicable,``in connection with the issuance by the Commission of a construction authorizationand license for such repository.''DOE will therefore be required to submit an environmental impact statementinstead of an environmental report. The Commission may nevertheless beunable to adopt that statement, with respect either to the constructionauthorization or the license, unless it has been supplemented to take intoaccount significant new information such as that developed during the courseof construction as part of the performance confirmation program or significantchanges in the plans of DOE since the time of its site recommendation tothe President. <T3>See </T3>40 CFR 1502.9(c)(1) (CEQ regulations). Accordingly, the proposedrules provide for the timely submission by DOE of supplemental environmentalimpact statements as needed.The information to be contained in an environmental impact statement isset out in section 102(2) of NEPA itself, and the submission of such informationis required by the proposed rules. The scope of alternatives to be consideredin the EIS is restricted, however, to take into account the limitationsin section 114(f) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 10134(f),with respect to the need for a repository, the time of the initial availabilityof a repository, alternatives to the isolation of waste in a repository,and the identification of alternate sites. Moreover, the proposed rulerequires DOE to inform the Commission of the extent to which, pursuantto section 119, 42 U.S.C. 10139, the environmental impact statement mayhave been found to be adequate or inadequate and the extent to which, underthat section, issues related to the adequacy of the environmental impactstatement may remain subject to judicial review.Because one of the alternatives available to the Commission is denial ofthe application, the environmental impacts of such denial need to be addressed.Even though denial of an application involves action by the Commission,it is proper for the environmental impacts to be addressed by DOE, sincethe lead agency is required by CEQ regulations to include reasonable alternativesnot within its jurisdiction. 40 CFR 1502.14(c).The Commission has not included any specific requirements for the submissionof environmental information by petitioners for rulemaking. The only ruleslikely to have significant environmental effects would be technical requirementsand criteria to be used in licensing; as already noted, such rules wouldbe exempt from the requirement of environmental review under NEPA. Section121(c), 42 U.S.C. 10141(c). In a particular case, however, environmentalinformation could be required, if needed to comply with law, pursuant tothe general language of 10 CFR 51.41.Preparation of Environmental Impact StatementsThe NRC regulations include a group of sections that prescribe a procedurefor preparation and distribution by the NRC of draft and final environmentalimpact statements. With respect to materials licenses, these requirementsapply to certain specified categories of NRC actions other than the issuanceof a construction authorization or license to receive and possess high-levelradioactive waste at a geologic repository. 10 CFR 51.80 (citing andSection;51.20(b)(7)-(12)). Because NRC, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, willin general have no need to prepare its own environmental impact statement,the proposed amendments would provide (in accordance with CEQ regulations)for the distribution of the EIS, if and as adopted by the Commission, onlyas a final statement.NEPA Procedure and Administrative ActionAlthough the procedures established in Part 51 are designed for the casein which NRC prepares its own environmental impact statement, they canequally well be applied in the situation where the EIS is prepared in thefirst instance by a license applicant. Thus, no action will be taken bythe Commission until necessary documents have been filed_in this case byDOE rather than NRC_with the Environmental Protection Agency. See 10 CFR51.100. NRC will not take action concerning the proposal which would havean adverse environmental impact until a record of decision is issued. See10 CFR 51.101. A record of decision will be prepared as part of the initialor final decision on issues adjudicated in formal hearings. See 10 CFR51.102. The record of decision will state the decision, including alternativesconsidered and the relevant factors upon which preferences among the alternativesare based. See 10 CFR 51.103. In the case of the adoption of a EIS preparedby DOE concerning a geologic repository, the relevant factors would includethe special provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In addition to these rules of general application, Part 51 includes specificprocedural provisions for different categories of licensing actions. Anew andSection; 51.109 would be added to describe the NEPA procedure to befollowed with respect to licenses issued under 10 CFR Part 60. The basic premise of andSection; 51.109 is that it is practicable to adoptthe EIS prepared by DOE if that statement is adequate to meet the requirementsof section 102(2)(C) of NEPA. The focus of the procedure, therefore, isthe presiding officer's determination of the extent to which it is practicableto adopt the DOE EIS. To the extent adoption is practicable, the issueswould be excluded from independent NRC inquiry. The adoption of the statementdoes not necessarily mean that NRC would independently have arrived atthe same conclusions on matters of fact or policy. And, of course, theadoption of the EIS would have no probative weight with respect to anysafety findings that the Commission must make under 10 CFR Part 60. It would still be proper to consider NEPA contentions with respect to significantmatters that arose after issuance of the EIS. But note, even in this regard,that if there are significant new circumstances or information relevantto environmental concerns and bearing on the action proposed by DOE orits impacts, DOE would be obliged to prepare a supplemental EIS that wouldbe subject to adoption by the Commission under the same standards as theoriginal document. Challenges to DOE's supplement should be adjudicatedin the courts of appeals, pursuant to section 119 of NWPA, in the samemanner as challenges to the original EIS. The Commission fully expects that supplementation of the EIS by DOE willresolve any new circumstances or information that might arise, and thatsupplementation by the NRC will not be necessary. Nevertheless, in theorythere might be situations when NRC must prepare a supplemental environmentalimpact statement. Under the proposed regulations, such action might beinitiated by the staff before the hearing or might be found to be necessaryin light of the record of the proceedings after the hearing. The formercase is addressed in andSection; 51.26(c), the latter (implicitly) in andSection;51.109(e). In each situation, though, the standards for adoption set outin andSection; 51.109(c) would be observed. The proposed rules provide a structured mechanism to address NEPA concernsin a licensing hearing. This is the presentation of the staff positionwith respect to the practicability of adoption, which appears in andSection;51.109(a)(1). As noted above, it is expected that DOE would, where necessary,supplement its EIS. Accordingly, the staff position is likely to be thatit is practicable for the Commission to adopt the DOE EIS, as it may havebeen supplemented by DOE and as filed with the Commission. Nevertheless,in some situations, the staff position could be that it is not practicableto adopt the DOE EIS, as it may have been supplemented, in which case anNRC EIS would be required. In that event, the staf is under an obligationto have prepared the necessary final EIS so as to be able to present itsposition on matters within the scope of NEPA. Whatever the staff positionmay be, any other party may seek to have the issue regarding practicabilityof adoption resolved by the presiding officer, but any contentions to thateffect must set forth the basis of the claim under the criteria set outin the proposed rule. Moreover, it is contemplated that the proceduresthat would be used by the presiding officer to resolve disputes regardingadoption would resemble those employed to rule on motions to reopen records.See 10 CFR 2.734.Several situations in which adoption of DOE's EIS is impracticable couldconceivably arise. For example, if the Commission were to impose licenseconditions requiring DOE to take actions other than those which DOE hadproposed, the Commission would need to consider the environmental impactsof such actions in accordance with NEPA. However, the Commission does notanticipate imposition of license conditions with significant environmentalimpacts. Under NWPA, DOE has the primary responsibility for considerationof environmental matters; and if significant changes from DOE's originalproposal are needed, the Commission believes that DOE should amend itslicense application and supplement its EIS, precluding any need for NRCsupplementation. Should DOE fail to do so, the Commission might deny DOE'sapplication rather than impose license conditions requiring NRC supplementationof DOE's EIS. In theory, though, it would still be possible for NRC toprepare its own EIS. The scope of the review would be limited, however,to the actions being required by the Commission. It is not intended thatother environmental issues would be reopened and relitigated in the licensingproceeding.Another situation in which NRC would prepare a supplemental EIS relatesto new information which it regards as significant even though DOE maynot have treated it as such. We recognize that DOE's failure to supplementthe EIS might arguably be viewed as a final action, so that objecting partiesmight have to seek review in the courts within the statutory 180-day reviewperiod, with any failure to do so barring later challenge in NRC proceedings.But such a reading of the law would have undesirable consequences uponNRC administrative proceedings. It would require NRC to decide whetheror not adoption is practicable on the basis of factual and legal considerations(pertaining to DOE's duty to supplement the EIS and, in particular, thetime such duty may have arisen), which go far beyond the materials otherwiserequiring NRC review. Accordingly, NRC proposes to prepare a supplementalEIS, if DOE is not doing so, whenever NRC regards such a supplemental EISto be required by law.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Commission once again emphasizes that, under NWPA.DOE has the primary responsibility to supplement an EIS to take significantnew information into consideration. This obligation is reflected in theproposed revision to andSection; 60.24(c).Furthermore, the Commission will review any statements in the DOE's environmentalimpact statement relating to radiological concerns. If such statementsare inconsistent with the facts found by the Commission on the basis ofthe record of the proceedings, the Commission will specifically determinewhether or not the findings constitute ``significant and substantial newinformation or new considerations'' which, under the rule, would renderthe environmental impact statement to that extent inadequate. The statementwill be supplemented where required by law, or otherwise will be deemedmodified to the extent necessary, in accordance with Commission practice.<T3>Citizens for Safe Power v. NRC, </T3>524 F.2d 1291, 1294, n. 5 (D.C.Cir. 1975); <T3>Public Service Company of New Hampshire </T3>(Seabrook Station, Units1 andamp; 2), CLI-78-1, 7 NRC 1, 29 (1978).The Commission would make its own NEPA findings, including an independentbalance of relevant factors, ``to the extent that it is not practicableto adopt'' the DOE EIS_that is, to the extent that the Commission findsthat the balance of these factors would be affected by the new informationor new considerations involved. This procedure is consistent with 10 CFR51.41, which states that the Commission ``will independently evaluate andbe responsible for the reliability of any information which it uses.''Public InformationSections 51.116 through 51.118 concern public notices about the preparationof an environmental impact statement. They apply in any situation in whicha notice of intent to prepare an EIS is prepared ``in accordance with andSection;51.26.'' But, as discussed above, andSection; 51.26 would be amended so asto apply only when NRC itself intends to prepare an EIS. Since the EISwith respect to a repository would be prepared by DOE rather than by NRC,the notice provisions of andSection;andSection; 51.116_51.118 would not comeinto play. Section 51.118 would be amended, however, to require circulationof a final environmental impact statement, if and when adopted by NRC.CommentingIt is the policy of the Commission to comment on draft environmental impactstatements prepared by other Federal agencies, consistent with the provisionsof 40 CFR 1503.2 and 1503.3. 10 CFR 51.124. The Commission intends to followthis policy in connnection with the draft environmental impact statementprepared by DOE in connection with a geologic repository recommendation.The submission of such comments is specifically called for, in fact, bythe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. <T3>See </T3>Sec. 114(a)(1)(D), 42 U.S.C. 10134(a)(i)(D).NRC will comment on environmental issues even though those issues may beprecluded from litigation in the licensing proceedings. The reason forthis is that an inadequate EIS may be set aside in the course of judicialreview. Should this occur, it would of course not be practicable for theCommission to adopt it. If NRC has objections or reservations about theDOE proposal on grounds of environmental impact, it will specify the mitigationmeasures it considers necessary to withstand challenge in court. The theoryunderlying such comments is that if the EIS is found not to be adequate,in the course of judicial review, NRC could not adopt it and, in the absenceof suitable revisions or supplementation, the Commission could not issuea construction authorization or license. <T3>See </T3>40 CFR 1503.3(d) (duty to specify mitigation measures considerednecessary to allow license to be granted).Ordinarily an agency that receives comments from another agency must considerthem, but it may exercise its discretion in determining how they shouldaffect the decision at hand. In principle, therefore, DOE could in somecases reject comments made by NRC on grounds that might be unsatisfactoryto the Commission. Still, the Commission's comments will be a matter ofpublic record and will be available for consideration during judicial andCongressional review of DOE's EIS and related actions. The Commission regardsthese forums, rather than the NRC usual review, to be the appropriate place,under NWPA, for review of DOE's responses to comments as well as othermatters related to the EIS.Responsible OfficialNo change is required in the provision establishing responsibilities withinNRC for NEPA compliance.Conforming AmendmentsSeveral changes to Part 60 of the Commission's regulations are needed inorder to reflect the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended,that deal with environmental review.Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, DOE is required to prepare an environmentalimpact statement instead of an environmental report. Several changes toPart 60 are proposed to reflect this direction. Revisions to the environmentalimpact statement would take the form of ``supplements'' instead of the``amendments'' or ``updates'' referred to in the existing rule.The requirement in andSection; 60.15 that multiple sites be characterizedis eliminated so as to conform to the provisions of the Amendments Act.The language of the findings for the issuance of the construction authorizationrequires consideration of costs and benefits and consideration of alternatives.andSection; 60.31(c). This language would not be changed. However, it shouldbe understood that a determination that it is practicable to adopt theDOE environmental impact statement will necessarily result in the specifiedenvironmental finding that the action called for is issuance of the constructionauthorization.The construction authorization is to include such conditions as the Commission``finds to be necessary to protect * * * environmental values.'' 10 CFR60.32(a). The Commission would include such conditions only where the environmentalimpact statement (as it may have been supplemented) specifically callsfor them. In principle, the incorporation of appropriate conditions inthe construction authorization could enhance environmental protection,since NRC would then have a basis to inspect, and take enforcement actionwhere needed, to assure that the conditions are observed. However, we doubtthat the adequacy of the EIS would ever depend upon NRC's being vestedwith this authority. DOE can describe in the EIS_and in fact it must describe_themitigation measures which are proposed to assure protection of the environment.Should DOE subsequently fail to implement these measures, affected partiescan seek redress against DOE in the courts. Moreover, the written agreementsto be entered into between DOE and the States and affected Indian tribesunder section 117(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 10137(c),provide a supplemental channel for identifying and resolving environmentalconcerns on an ongoing basis without direct NRC participation. Our approach,therefore, will be to require the observance of environmental protectionconditions where the environmental impact statement which we adopt providesfor the Commission to include such conditions in the construction authorization(or license); but if it is practicable for us to adopt an EIS that makesno provision for NRC to impose and enforce such conditions, we would noton our own initiative find such conditions to be necessary. Even if NRCcomments on the DOE proposal had specified mitigation measures considerednecessary to allow NRC to grant a construction authorization or license,these measures generally would not be incorporated as licensing conditions;for, as discussed above, the basis for NRC's comments was that the measureswere necessary for the EIS to be considered `` adequate'' by the courts,and it is expected that this issue would already have been resolved.The rules of practice (10 CFR Part 2) also need to be amended to take accountof DOE's submission of an environmental impact statement instead of anenvironmental report. Because the EIS must conform to statutory requirements,and because its completeness would have been subject to challenge in courtprior to filing with NRC, a completeness determination by NRC at the timeof docketing is unnecessary, and provision for such determination wouldbe omitted. As in the case of Part 60, reference would be made to ``supplements''rather than ``amendments'' to the environmental impact statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Petition for Rulemaking</ITAG>The States of Nevada and Minnesota have petitioned the Commission to amend10 CFR 60.24 so as to adopt DOE's environmental impact statement only ifsuch adoption ``would not compromise the independent responsibilities ofthe Commission to protect the public health and safety under the AtomicEnergy Act of 1954''. 50 FR 51701, December 19, 1985 (PRM-60-2A). (Thelanguage proposed by the petitioners also includes several matters whichwould be considered by the Commission in making the foregoing determination).In this regard, the Commission notes its resolve that adoption of the environmentalimpact statement must not compromise its independent responsibilities underthe Atomic Energy Act. Adoption of the rules proposed herein would be fullyconsistent with this resolve.The matters identified by petitioners for consideration by the Commissionrelate largely to the adequacy of the procedures followed by DOE in implementingthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act and in preparing its EIS. Nevertheless, asstated in the cited <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, the Commission will give further consideration,in this rulemaking proceeding, to the issues raised by the petitioners,as they may relate to this agency's responsibilities. Generally, the Commissionproposes to deal with these issues in a manner consistent with the discussionabove.Any person desiring to comment on the rulemaking petition, insofar as itrelates to 10 CFR 60.24, should do so as part of this rulemaking proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this proposed regulation is the type of actiondescribed in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c) (1) and (3).
