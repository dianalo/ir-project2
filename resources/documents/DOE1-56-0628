The shutters are manufactured by the method of thermalevaporation from special isotopic mixtures of ferromagnetic metals. Theobtained depth of modulation of the neutron flux is {approx_equal} 14,the transmission through the opened shutter is 0.36. The shutter is usedfor time-of-flight correlation measurement of the spectrum of neutronstransmitted through the neutron interference filter.</TEXT></DOC>
