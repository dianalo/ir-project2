Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility programfor that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before May8, 1989. This notice also announces the availability of this program forpublic review and comment.  Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise AbatementAct of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operatormay submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulationsand which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission ofsuch maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the waysin which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such mapsto be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties inthe local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are foundby FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations,Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noisecompatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures theoperator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatibleuses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatibleuses.  The Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on January5, 1988, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation whichwere produced during an airport noise compatibility planning study fromJanuary 1986 to December 1987. It was requested that the FAA review thismaterial as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1)of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointlyby the airport and the surrounding communities, be approved as a noisecompatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act.  The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and relateddescriptions submitted by the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority.The specific maps under consideration are ``Noise Exposure Map: 1986 Operations''and ``Noise Exposure Map_1991 Operations'' in the submission. The FAA hasdetermined that these maps for the McGhee Tyson Airport are in compliancewith applicable requirements. This determination is effective on November9, 1988. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposurse mapsis limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance withthe procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determinationdoes not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans,or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund theimplementation of that program.  If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific propertiesto noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted undersection 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involvedin any way in determining the relative locations of specific propertieswith regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noiseexposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which propertiesshould be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functionsare inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibiliitiesof local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in anyway under Part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore,the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contoursonto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively withthe airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agenciesand planning agencies with which consultation is required under section103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification of the airportoperator, under andSection;150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily requiredconsultation has been accomplished.  The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the McGheeTyson Airport, also effective on November 9, 1988. Preliminary review ofthe submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements forthe submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further reviewwill be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. Theformal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will becompleted on or before May 8, 1989.  The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of14 CFR Part 150, andSection;150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluationprocess are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviationsafety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or bereasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatibleland uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible landuses.  Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program withspecific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properlyaddressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAAto the extent practicable.
