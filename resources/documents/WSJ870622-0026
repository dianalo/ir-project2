The U.S. will make an appeal this week at a meeting of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based panel that coordinates export-control policies of the U.S. and 16 allies. The Reagan administration prefers to improve the security of Western technology through allied cooperation rather than through trade sanctions imposed by Congress.    Such sanctions recently were proposed against Toshiba Machine Co. of Japan and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway, which have shipped machine tools for making ultraquiet submarine propellers to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon has barred Toshiba Corp., Toshiba Machine's parent, from participating in new defense contracts until Tokyo completes its investigation of the case.    Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said the Cocom talks are meant to &quot;inspire our allies to commit more resources to export controls and enforce them more rigorously.&quot; He added: &quot;Norway and Japan are now supporting us.&quot;    In addition to stiffer export controls, the U.S. wants allies to lift laws that block the extradition of persons charged with export violations, Mr. Freedenberg said.    Norway's prime minister, Gro Brundtland, already has assured President Reagan that Norway's export controls will be &quot;significantly strengthened.&quot; Specifically, Norway intends to intensify customs inspections and lengthen the statute of limitations on export violations to 10 years from the current two.    Some Kongsberg employees believed to be involved in the machine-tool shipments couldn't be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had run out.    Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) and other members of the Senate Banking Committee are preparing a bill to ban the entire Toshiba and Kongsberg groups from the U.S. market for two years or more. Bills in the House would shut them out of bidding for Defense Department and other federal contracts. Also, a measure the House approved last week would authorize the U.S. to seek compensation from Norway and Japan for the cost of countering the quieter Soviet submarines.    The Reagan administration worries that such measures could do more harm than good. Norwegian diplomats warn that the sanctions not only could kill a Pentagon project to acquire Kongsberg-designed Penguin anti-ship missiles, but could also threaten Kongsberg's existence. &quot;Without the Pentagon's blessings, Kongsberg's continued operations would be questionable,&quot; asserted Arve Thorvik, the Norwegian Embassy's economic counselor.    The Penguin, designed to help defend Norway's narrow fiords, has attracted U.S. interest because it can turn sharply and seek targets in confined waters. Grumman Corp. has been contracted to help adopt the missile for U.S. use. </TEXT></DOC>
