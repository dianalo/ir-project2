One tornado killed a woman, and four people were swept to theirdeaths in swollen creeks. The body of the fifth victim, a12-year-old boy, was found in a creek west of Ennis today. Fiftypeople suffered storm-related injuries.   Thunderstorms lingered over southeastern Texas, eastern Oklahomaand western Louisiana this morning. Rain was forecast for todayfrom the Mississippi Valley across eastern parts of the CentralPlains, Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Mississippi, westernTennessee, western Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin.   Although the severity of the thunderstorms over Texas lessenedthis morning, new flash flood watches and warnings and some tornadowatches were posted throughout the state because of the likelihoodof more rain, especially in the Houston area. A tornado brieflytouched down in Houston today, but there were no immediate reportsof damage.   Elsewhere, the low pressure system that brought persistent rainsto the Northeast moved out to sea on Wednesday. But at least 100families in northern New Jersey remained in emergency shelters asthey waited for the Passaic River to crest today about two feetabove flood level.   A predawn tornado Wednesday ravaged the small Texas town ofJarrell, killing a woman who had been asleep in her mobile home.The twister roared through the town of 1,000 people 40 miles fromAustin, demolishing 33 houses, 12 mobile homes and 16 businesses,said David Barham of the state's emergency management office.   Thirty-nine homes were damaged, along with the school gym roof.   The tornado sheared utility poles, pulled down power lines,uprooted trees, overturned several cars and trucks, including sixtractor-trailers on an interstate and spread debris along aseven-mile path, authorities said.   About two dozen people were injured and treated at hospitals.   ``I heard a bolt of lightning and it wasn't more than fiveminutes before all hell broke loose,'' said W.G. Schurhammer, whoseapartment house was damaged. ``By the time I heard it, I dove forthe corner and the windows broke.''   A tornado Wednesday afternoon cut a quarter-mile-wide swath foras much as 30 miles through east Texas, destroying homes andinjuring at least nine people. A twister near Houston injured eightpeople, authorities said.   Another twister touched down six miles northwest of Lufkin,destroying eight homes in Allentown, said Angelina County sheriff'sofficers. At least nine people were injured, they said.   On Wednesday, flooding forced hundreds of Dallas-Fort Worth arearesidents to leave their homes. Floodwaters caused a levee failurealong the Trinity River in Dallas and rising tributaries wereforcing more evacuations today.   ``You could hear the roar of the creek right behind ourtrailers,'' said Don Reiter, who escaped high water Wednesday inKennedale. ``We didn't take anything because it came so fast. Ourcars are gone, our boats are gone. What we have on our back is justwhat we have.''   In south Dallas, a car driven by a 56-year-old woman stalled asshe tried to cross a bridge. Firefighters barricading the bridgeurged her not to attempt the crossing, said firefighter DennisGround.   Ground said the woman scrambled to the top of the car and wastold to stay there. But ``the water got so rough it just knockedthe car off. Whether she had been in it or on top of it, it stillwould have occurred,'' Ground said.   The body of 73-year-old Grand Prairie man was found in histruck, which had been swept into a flooded creek branch. A man waskilled when his car was swept into McAnear Creek south of FortWorth.   Rescuers plucked people from yards, trees and car tops. Thepilot of a radio station helicopter pulled two girls and theirmother from the roof of their car just before it was swept away ina rain-swollen creek in Cleburne.   Of the six emergency shelters opened by the Dallas Red CrossWedenesday, only two remained open this morning, said spokeswomanSandra Pomeroy. She didn't know how many people were in theshelters, but said, ``We served 150 breakfasts today. We served 200dinners last night and yesterday we served 300 lunches.''   Bobby Valentine, manager of the Texas Rangers baseball team,sought help from a radio station helicopter to reach two of hishorses that were trapped by rising waters behind his Fort Worthhome.   He was able to lead the horses to safety, but his son's ponydrowned.   ``It was something, jumping off the helicopter into waterwaist-deep,'' Valentine said.
