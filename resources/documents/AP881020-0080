Laurel also said the new bases agreement shows that PresidentCorazon Aquino plans to renew their lease when it expires in 1991.   The accord, signed Monday in Washington by U.S. Secretary ofState George Schultz and Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, allowsthe United States to maintain six military bases here in exchangefor $962 million in military and economic aid during the lease'slast two years.   ``Had we considered only the larger national interest instead ofthe purely mercenary consideration, we should have instead firstissued a notice of termination,'' Laurel told foreign and localbusinessmen.   ``It is obvious that the Aquino leadeship has already, ifsecretly, committed itself to renegotiate extension of the basesbeyond 1991,'' Laurel added.   Laurel broke with the administration in September and formed hisown political party after Mrs. Aquino refused his call for her toresign.   The Senate created a special committee Wednesday to determinewhether the new bases agreement violates the PhilippineConstitution.   The committee is also to determine whether the accord, actuallyan amendment to a 1947 agreement, is subject to approval by theSenate as some senators claim. Mrs. Aquino said it is not.   The agreement has been attacked by the press and various groupsbut Mrs. Aquino dismissed the criticism on Wednesday, and thelargest political party in the Philippine Congress pledged tosupport it.   The United States had been paying $180 million a year for use ofClark Air Base, Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations.   Despite the increase, the agreement has met with criticismbecause of the government raised expectations that it would holdout for $1.2 billion a year.   Mrs. Aquino argued that the agreement was for substantially morethan the agreement negotiated by ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition he not be furtheridentified, said the original Philippine demand was for nearly $2.4billion a year.</TEXT></DOC>
