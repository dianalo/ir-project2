The informal accord calls for each producer to reduceproduction by just under 5% in order to bring total output bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to about22.3 million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Although that's only half as deep a cut as several oilministers had lobbied for, the initial reaction of oilmarkets suggests it might be enough to avert a price plungeduring the second quarter, when petroleum demand istraditionally weak. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,crude oil for April delivery rose by 69 cents a barrel onnews of the accord, settling at $19.68.   Most of the 12 OPEC nations represented at this two-daymeeting wanted much deeper cuts in the current OPEC output of23.3 million barrels a day. They had proposed variousformulas calling for new production ceilings ranging from 21million to 22 million barrels a day.   But Saudi Arabia, OPEC's linchpin producer, made it clearfrom the start that under such scenarios it would reduce itsproduction very little, if at all.   &quot;We told them that we would not accept any productionlevel below eight million barrels a day whatever theceiling,&quot; said a high-ranking Saudi petroleum official. Thekingdom currently produces 8.4 million barrels a day afterincreasing its output some three million barrels a day tohelp offset the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil during thePersian Gulf crisis.   The new accord, good only for the second quarter, takesinto account the probability that neither Iraq nor Kuwait,whose oil production currently is near zero following theGulf war, will be able to produce much for several months, ifnot years. Iraq didn't send a representative or contact OPECofficials for this meeting while the Kuwaiti delegation,their oil industry in a shambles, was passive, an unusualrole for one of the organization's former big players.   Despite yesterday's market response to OPEC's informalaccord, oil prices may still soften somewhat. Prices hadfirmed at least $2 a barrel recently on expectations OPECmight reduce production twice as much as it actually did.   Several oil ministers, including some who had called forproduction cuts ranging as high as two million barrels a day,expressed public optimism that the agreement would pushprices higher than the current average of $17.72 a barrel,based on a basket of seven crudes.   &quot;The basket could get to $20 by the end of the {second}quarter,&quot; said Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister. Someothers suggested the OPEC basket might even reach the formerminimum reference price of $21 a barrel.   But Iran, which officially expressed reservations aboutthe agreement, wasn't so sure. &quot;We pray they are right,&quot; oneIranian delegate said. Despite his objection to thearrangement, Gholamrezah Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, saidhe would reduce output by the agreed-upon 5%.   Algeria, in search of higher oil prices, also officiallyobjected to the agreement. But that didn't matter much.Neither Algeria nor Ecuador had been physically able to meettheir old quotas anyway, so both have been been exempted fromthis informal pact.   Besides oil prices, a major goal of this meeting wasreaffirming the viability of OPEC after the Persian Gulf war,which involved five of its members: Iraq on one side andSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates onthe other.   &quot;It was important to show that OPEC has life and iskicking and that we are as united as ever,&quot; GinandjarKartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said in an interview.   The agreement allots Saudi Arabia an enormous share ofnearly 36%, or eight million barrels a day, of total OPECoutput. Next in line is Iran, which received a new productionquota of 3.2 million barrels. But the pact presumes thatSaudi Arabia and Iran, each holding huge amounts of unsoldoil in tankers, will release it into the market as part oftheir new quotas.   Most estimates of second-quarter demand for OPEC oil arelower than the production allowed under the interimproduction ceiling. Still, several ministers noted oilsupplies outside OPEC may decline because of falling exportsfrom the Soviet Union and scheduled shutdowns of North Seafields for maintenance projects.   But the overproduction worries evaporate after the secondquarter. &quot;A major concern, and nobody is talking about it, ishow we are going to meet demand later this year and earlynext year if Iraq and Kuwait are as slow as expected inresuming exports,&quot; said a Venezuelan delegate.   OPEC officials noted that if oil prices slide sharplydespite this agreement, they have the option of calling aspecial conference prior to the next scheduled meeting inJune to consider further curbs. There is an incentive,meanwhile, for the OPEC members to adhere to their pledgedsecond-quarter production levels even though they arevoluntary. Lessening the probability of cheating is the factthat most OPEC nations have based their budgets on an oilprice of at least $20 a barrel.   OPEC is also looking outside for help again. &quot;Since OPEChas taken the voluntary step to reduce current productionlevels . . . in order to stabilize the oil market, theorganization calls upon other oil-exporting countries to alsoshoulder similar responsibility by proportionately reducingtheir production levels,&quot; the oil ministers said in astatement released after they ended their talks here.   &quot;We have gotten indirect messages from some non-OPECproducers that they are willing to cooperate,&quot; said Nigeria'sMr. Aminu. &quot;We hope they will cut by 5% also.&quot;   ---                      Crude's Quota                                                                                                          Comparison of OPEC's crude production quotas, in millionsof barrels daily                                                                                                          COUNTRY            1990 QUOTAS      MARCH 1991 QUOTAS                                                                                                          Saudia Arabia         5.38                8.03   Iran                  3.14                3.22   U.A.E.                1.50                2.32   Venezuela             1.95                2.24   Nigeria               1.61                1.84   Indonesia             1.37                1.44   Libya                 1.23                1.43   Algeria               0.83                0.83   Qatar                 0.37                0.40   Gabon                 0.20                0.29   Ecuador               0.27                0.27   Iraq                  3.14                 ---   Kuwait                1.50                 ---                                                                                                          TOTAL                22.49               22.30</TEXT></DOC>
