KENDALL:I'll be looking at issues of ADP consolidation.andP;  As you know, we decided tocentralize policy and decentralize execution.andP;  The consolidation will behandled individually by each service.andM;I also retain responsibility for systems oversight by the Major AutomatedInformation Systems Review Committee.andP;  I'm responsible for supporting DuaneAndrews as the senior IRM official, and I'm responsible for IRM educationrequirements.andM;I'll be working closely with the IRM College on the new concepts andprinciples of CIM.andP;  They have a course nicknamed &quot;Paul Revere&quot; because theytravel around the country giving it.andP;  They include a section on CIM.andM;GCN: How are you involved in the transition of ADP to a fee-for-serviceoperation? KENDALL: We've set goals and will be pulling together a group ofpeople from the military services and defense agencies to work on it thisyear.andP;  We already have pockets within DOD where fee-for-service operates, andwe want to take advantage of that experience.andM;GCN: With fee-for-service, you will be asking people to write a check forinformation.andP;  The way it's paid for now, automation services are embedded inother costs.andP;  Don't you think the new structure will require a culturalchange? KENDALL: I'd say you're absolutely right, but look at what it will dofor users.andP;  They will have more control over where their dollars are spent.andO;They will be able to make informed trade-offs as to the best ways to spendscarce resources.andM;Years ago, when I worked in ADP support, a user asked me for a report.andP;  Isaid, no problem, but by the way, did you know it costs $400 for me to runthat report?andP;  He didn't realize it cost that much.andM;I think that's the situation with most of our users.andP;  Most don't have aconcept of what their information costs.andM;GCN: Congress supports CIM, but it's not clear they have the patience to waitfor some of the long-term savings.andP;  Will Congress wait for your functionalgroups to deliver? KENDALL: We've had strong support from Congress.andP;  Clearlythey believe in the idea of improving the way we do business.andP;  If we focus onbuilding individual systems, yes, they do take time.andP;  But we're also lookingfor incremental improvements.andP;  We will be expecting our executive agents, whoare more knowledgeable in specific areas, to identify and justify those typesof incremental improvements.andM;Once you get past the narrow aspect of looking at systems, you have torecognize that this department is putting a lot of emphasis on data standardsand open systems architecture.andP;  Once we have those things in place,additional improvements will be easier to recognize and accomplish.andM;We no longer will have to struggle to translate data between differentsystems.andP;  As more open system are installed, we can port more software.andO;Right now, we have a lot of difficulty because the different systems do notshare applications.andM;GCN: There's been a perception that funding of individual systems and CIM aretied directly to each other.andP;  The perception is that if a system was fundedlast fall or the previous year, it would be a player in CIM and vice versa.andO;Is this an oversimplification? KENDALL: Ongoing programs are budgeted andjustified to meet specifics missions.andM;When we fund them, or cut off funding, that shouldn't necessarily be seen asCIM decisions.andP;  The decision we're making regards the purpose of thoseprograms and whether they should be funded on their own merit.andM;GCN: But people often interpret funding decisions very strictly as CIMdecisions.andP;  Obviously, this tendency was fueled last fall when Congressshifted $1 billion to CIM for re-disbursement to the services.andP;  KENDALL:Let's put this in the perspective of what happened with the budget.andP;  Congresstook a request of $1.4 billion for operations and maintenance money for newdevelopments and modernization.andP;  It cut $400 million and returned $1 billionto a transfer account through which the CIM program manager could decidewhich programs to fund.andM;So you had a real 30-percent reduction in our development and modernization.andO;That meant we had to make some tough choices because, regardless of the meritof a project, you can't fund everything.andP;  You start asking what should befunded and what shouldn't.andP;  These were not easy decisions.andM;We asked the services to look at their programs with the 30-percent cut inmind and give us a priority list so we knew what was most important to them.andO;Our next step was to ask functional proponents andlsqb;senior Pentagon officialswithin various business areasandrsqb; to look at their list of priorities and atsystems DOD-wide and see if the priority lists for systems made sense tothem.andM;The third step we took was to examine each and every program, and there werealmost 400 programs involved.andP;  Granted that we didn't have a lot of time, welooked at each one to make sure it was meeting a legitimate mission.andM;We made an initial allocation of $806 million at the end of December, fundingthe bulk of those program requirements.andP;  Recognizing that we were very closeto identifying executive agents in some of our eight CIM areas, we chose tohold back some funds in those categories.andM;We made the second allocation to the executive agents.andP;  We told them, &quot;Nowyou have the capability to look DOD-wide because you have the funds for Army,Navy, Air Force and so on -- to decide the appropriate way to proceed in thatfunctional area.&quot;andM;GCN: Is this the process by which interim standard systems are beingdesignated? KENDALL: If you want to understand that process, you have to backup to a year ago, when the services really began making the case that weought to look for best of breed -- existing systems that are superior -- anddeclare them appropriate for departmentwide use.andP;  Clearly, if there issomething out there that can do the job and save us money, we should use it.andO;So we worked with the services to establish criteria for designating interimstandard systems.andM;You need to know if you're going to save money, or if it will cost too muchto field a system across the services, provide the training and set up theinfrastructure to deliver and maintain the software.andP;  We don't have opensystems in place across the services.andP;  It could become expensive trying toport software from one base of equipment to a different base.andM;There are advantages that have to be assessed, too.andP;  A central designactivity probably is already maintaining the software.andP;  Hardwarecompatibility might be better in one case than another.andP;  If you'reeliminating other systems by fielding an interim standard, then you have tomeasure the cost of fielding it vs.andP;  continuing the others.andM;So far, the only interim standards we've identified are 12 systems in themedical area.andP;  These were straightforward decisions because they were alreadybeing used DOD-wide.andM;GCN: Has the open systems gospel gotten through to the user commands, wherein some cases generals and admirals have built their own stovepipe,proprietary systems and are very happy with them? KENDALL: That's why we'regoing to be working with the IRM College, to get some of these discussionsout to the field so people understand what's happening.andP;  If there isresistance, it may be because they don't understand what it means or what'sgoing to happen.andP;  I personally haven't run into resistance because I mainlydeal with the IRM officials in the services, and I know the leadership isvery much on-board with this concept.andM;GCN: Is IRM being taken more seriously than ever before in your time?andO;KENDALL: I think it's becoming clear that it's not a job for the techies.andO;It's not a back-room job, it's an integral part of meeting any mission.andO;Someone in the back room may or may not be providing the required support.andO;If you don't go back there, you'll never know.andM;What we're saying with CIM and the idea of centralized policy anddecentralized execution is that we'll take a strong role in data standardsand open systems architectures and enforce them DOD-wide.andP;  Those thingsshould be transparent to the users.andP;  They should worry only about meeting themission and managing their own information.andM;GCN: There is concern that CIM will result in so much central management thatuser creativity will be stifled.andP;  People are afraid their good ideas won'thave a channel to get through.andP;  KENDALL: To the extent that we standardizedata elements, there is nothing to stop anyone from accessing data andaggregating it in whatever manner they need, even though a central systemsupports the function.andP;  In fact, as we standardize data and make it moreaccessible, we open new avenues of creativity.andM;GCN: Are the military services more accommodating about CIM than they were 18months ago? KENDALL: When the executive level group's plan was circulated forcomments andlsqb;last fallandrsqb;, there was universal acceptance.andP;  Granted, the plan is afairly high-level policy document.andP;  One of its eight strategies is commoninformation systems for common functional areas.andP;  There has been a lot ofdiscussion and some dissension.andP;  But that's where you're getting down intothe details, and people who agree with the concept might take issue withspecifics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
