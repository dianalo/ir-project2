Robert Dole endorsed the U.S.-Soviet treaty on intermediate-range missiles but made it clear that he wants to attach some conditions as he helps steer the measure through the Senate.    With President Reagan at his side at a White House news conference, the Senate minority leader and GOP presidential candidate sought to head off the gains that Vice President George Bush -- a rival presidential candidate -- has seemed to be making in opinion polls since his early endorsement of the treaty to eliminate medium-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles.    &quot;I don't want to get into a Bob Dole-George Bush thing, but we just have different roles,&quot; Sen. Dole said. &quot;Mine is an active role. . . . He doesn't even vote on the treaty.&quot; Mr. Bush was campaigning in Massachusetts and New Hampshire at the time.    Mr. Reagan denied suggestions that he was helping to boost Mr. Dole's candidacy by appearing with him.    &quot;I am and have always been neutral with regard to the political race,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. He said Sen. Dole was present &quot;as the leader for our side in the Senate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
