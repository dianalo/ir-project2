Gorbachev challengedthe United States and its NATO allies Thursday with two boldweapons-reductions proposals as Secretary of State James A. Bakerrejected negotiations over nuclear missiles in Europe.   Gorbachev offered to cut Soviet stockpiles of battlefieldnuclear weapons, but Baker called the offer ``a good step, ... asmall step, ... a modest move.''   ``There has to be a little less of an imbalance,'' Baker said,reiterating the U.S. assessment that the Soviets have a 12-1advantage in European short-range nuclear missiles.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said that the Sovietswould withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from Eastern Europethis year and that the Kremlin is prepared to pull out all nuclearmunitions from Eastern Europe by 1991 if the United Statesengineers equivalent steps in Western Europe.   A senior U.S. official flying with Baker to Brussels and abriefing for NATO ministers said the Soviets announced they wouldtake out of service this year 284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclearbombs carried aboard airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells.   Along with the request to discuss joint reductions in missilestocks, Gorbachev moved boldly on conventional arms cuts.   He told Baker during their 3{-hour meeting at the Kremlin _Baker's first since becoming secretary _ that the Soviets wouldoffer in exchange for NATO reductions to cut Warsaw Pact tanks by40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000 and artillery pieces by 47,000.   The U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Gorbachev alsoproposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both alliances and a 55percent cutback in NATO's combat aircraft.   By 1997, the official said, Gorbachev aims for equal levels of1.35 million troops in the two alliances, 1,500 strike aircraft,20,000 tanks, 1,700 helicopters, 24,000 artillery pieces and 28,000combat vehicles.   The Soviet conventional arms proposal will be presented formallyFriday at NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations in Vienna.   Baker declined to evaluate the conventional arms proposal. TheU.S. official said Baker told Gorbachev it would be up to the NATOalliance to reply.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze summoned foreignministers from the six Warsaw Pact nations to Moscow for a lateThursday meeting on the conventional arms offer, the U.S. officialsaid.   Gorbachev's announced reductions in Soviet tactical nuclearweapons appeared aimed at pressuring the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to drop plans to modernize its arsenal of 700 Lancemissiles and 88 launchers, most in West Germany.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, backed by several NATOallies, has demanded the negotiations Baker rejected. ForeignMinister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is expected to renew the plea whenhe meets with Baker on Friday at NATO headquarters.   Baker, who will return to Washington Friday night, is strivingto resolve the dispute with West Germany before, or at leastduring, the NATO summit meeting May 29-30 in Brussels. PresidentBush will attend with the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries.   As for the Soviet missile cutbacks, Baker noted that NATO had onits own eliminated 2,400 nuclear weapons since 1979. Only now isthe Soviet Union announcing cuts of its own, amounting to 5 percentof its 10,000-weapon arsenal.   Shevardnadze, who met separately with reporters in Moscow,called Gorbachev's request for talks on further nuclear weaponscutbacks ``a most important initiative'' designed to produce ``acomprehensive resolution of this question.''   He said that the Bush administration position on such talks was``very negative'' and added, ``This seriously concerns us.''   The Soviets contend that the Lance missiles could be used todeliver a first-strike attack and that their modernization woulddestabilize Europe.   Baker called his discussions with Gorbachev ``rather extensiveand in-depth.'' He said he and the Soviets had agreed to ``continueto disagree agreeably.''   The disagreement on tactical nuclear arms discussions contrastedwith an apparent improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations resultingfrom Baker's trip.   On two regional fronts there was apparent progress. Bakerreported that the Soviets would cooperate in peace efforts inCentral America and that the talks with Gorbachev made himoptimistic that Soviet military aid to the Marxist government ofNicaragua would be reduced from the current level of about 500million dollars a year.   In the Middle East, Baker said, ''we think there may be a fairamount of common ground'' on an Israeli proposal to hold electionsamong the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank andGaza Strip.   He said the Soviets would help try to persuade Arabs andIsraelis to convert the election process into a broader peaceeffort.   On human rights, Baker left Moscow with a list of Jewishrefuseniks who are being allowed to emigrate after years of wating.   Baker did not say how many would be allowed to emigrate as aresult of the talks with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, butindications were about 100 families would be allowed to go.   Baker pledged to keep working on behalf of 400 to 500 otherfamilies who are still waiting. State Department officials saidthey had a list of about 600 refusenik families.   The secretary also noted that the two sides had agreed to resumenegotiations in Geneva next month to reduce long-range nuclearweapons and on their space defense programs.   Baker said the talks would be reopened between June 12-19 withthe date to be set later.   The two sides also agreed to resume talks on a nuclear test banon June 26.</TEXT></DOC>
