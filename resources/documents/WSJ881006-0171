Opecna quoted KIO spokesman Michael Walter as saying that &quot;of course, we will fight back. We are studying all options, including bringing a court action.&quot;    The British government, citing possible conflict of interests, Tuesday ordered the KIO to reduce its stake in BP to 9.9% from 21.6% over the next 12 months or so.    Mr. Walter, a lawyer at the KIO's London attorneys, Stephenson Harwood, said it was never Kuwait's intention to try to influence BP policies through its stake. Mr. Walters pointed out that the KIO's purchase of its BP stake amounted to a &quot;bailing out&quot; of BP when the world stock market had crashed.    The KIO started buying BP shares following a #7.2 billion share issue and partial privatization that BP and the British government went ahead with shortly after last October's stock market crash. The British government was under pressure to call off the issue, but instead announced a mechanism where it offered to buy back the newly issued shares at a lower price to prevent them from tumbling. Because of the KIO's buying, the British government only had to buy back a token number of shares. </TEXT></DOC>
