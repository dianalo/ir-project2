In another display of the widening crackdown on dissidents, statetelevision in Beijing showed reputed protest leaders being packedinto police vans, their heads shaved and signs dangling from theirnecks describing their alleged crimes.   Government-controlled media reported numerous arrests in othercities.   The death sentences in Shanghai were the first announced sinceChinese troops opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijingon June 3-4, crushing a 7-week-old reform movement.   The hard-line government since has reported arresting more than1,000 people in a nationwide crackdown in which the student protestleaders have been branded as counterrevolutionaries and instigatorsof the turmoil.   Television said the three men sentenced to death were chargedwith setting a train on fire and beating security officials whotried to extinguish the blaze. National television showed the threemen in a courtroom being sentenced.   The court also accused them of instigating a riot unprecedentedin recent Shanghai history. The men, who appeared to be workers,were identified as Xu Guoming, Dian Hanwu and Yan Xierong.   The train incident occurred June 6 when six protesters werekilled as they stood at a barricade on the tracks near the Shanghaitrain station and a train from Beijing did not stop in time.   People in a large crowd set fire to the train and fought withfiremen and police who came to put it out, injuring 21.   In Beijing, the noon news showed 26 workers, their heads shaven,being led by armed police onto a stage before a packed hall in thenortheastern city of Changchun.   Several had large placards around their necks giving their namesand accusing them of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors.   The signs said they had been sentenced to labor reform, a type ofprison.   The placards are a throwback to the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,when leftist Red Guards paraded their victims through city streetswearing dunce caps and signs on their chests.   Beijing television today also showed young people being jammedinto a police bus in the southern city of Guiyang and said sixpeople were arrested in central China's Wuhan. It also broadcast thearrest of Chen Xuedong, a physics major at Nanjing University andshowed tapes of him leading mass demonstrations in the easternChinese city.   The government kept up its propaganda campaign portrayingsoldiers who put down the pro-democracy movement as heroes. Thereports deny troops opened fire on unarmed people as they movedprotesters out of Beijing's Tiananmen Square.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say up to3,000 died were killed in the assault, most of them civilians. Thegovernment contends about 200 people died, half of them soldiers.   The Communist Party's newspaper, the People's Daily, ran afront-page editorial today to drum up support for the government,urging Chinese to ``unite and join forces to fight the common enemy.   ``A great victory already has been achieved in quelling thecounterrevolutionary rebellion. In Beijing and the whole country,the situation is moving toward stability ... But the struggledefinitely is not over.''   The editorial also said it was important to ``strengtheneducation'' of the many people who ``are not clear about the truesituation and who took to the streets to march'' in support of thepro-democracy movement.   Today, television read a letter from six unidentified BeijingUniversity students who said they took part in a week-long hungerstrike during protesters' three-week occupation of Tiananmen Square.   The students were quoted as saying they now regret their actions,which stirred up popular sympathies for their movement for a freerChina.   The government on Wednesday ordered the expulsion of two U.S.correspondents, John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Voice ofAmerica's bureau chief in Beijing, Alan Pessin.   The two, accused of violating martial law regulations that banforeign reporting on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, weregiven 72 hours to leave the country.   Official media have launched daily diatribes against the U.S.government's VOA service, which enjoys wide popularity among Chineseseeking information beyond what the tightly controlled Chinese pressoffers.   Pomfret was accused of having contacts with leaders of theprotest movement, and of obtaining unspecified state secrets.   Pessin said the government accused him of fomenting unrest withhis reports. Both men denied the charges.   On Beijing's Tananmen Square, site of the bloody denouement ofthe student movement and the symbolic heart of China, workmenplanted shrubs around a monument to revolutionary heroes.   Dozens of tanks that had been sent in the square had disappearedby Wednesday and 20 remaining armored personnel carriers werecovered with tarps. Key intersections that had been guarded bysoldiers with rifles were unguarded.   Officials said today that two months of demonstrations andmartial law _ imposed May 20 _ had cost the city $270 million ineconomic losses, two-thirds from delays in deliveries of rawmaterials and worker slowdowns.</TEXT></DOC>
