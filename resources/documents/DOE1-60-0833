The therapeutic ratio is often close to unityand in such circumstances treatment must produce some toxicity in orderto induce a worthwhile regression of the tumour. Similarly, the differencebetween successful therapy and severe or even fatal iatrogenic effectsmay depend on only minor dose adjustments. It is of the utmost importancetherefore to understand those factors which influence response to therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
