The sintered material hadits microstructure analysed by optical and electron microscopy. The microsphereswere characterized initialy utilizing X-ray diffractometry and thermogravimetry.The equation which describes the microspheres shrinkage in function ofthe time was obtained using finite difference analysis X-ray diffractometryindicated hexagonal structure for the microspheres main starting material,ammonium diuranate thermogravimetric analysis showed reduction of thismaterial to U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ at 600/sub 0/C. Ceramography results showed5 hours sintered microspheres grain sizes G vary with the temperature.Sintered U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ micrographs compared with published resultsfor UO/sub 2/, indicate similar homogeneity microstructural characteristicsand suggest the processed micorspheres to be potentially useful as nuclearfuels.</TEXT></DOC>
