The application of the methodology results inan estimated 50-year accumulated dose (in units of mrem) to an individualliving within the region of influence of the underground waste disposalsite. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the important geosphereparameters (path length, leach rate, and time of initial release) andon the value for the publicly acceptable release consequences to definethe boundaries of the region where incentives exist for various specificpartitioning alternatives. Conclusions are drawn from the results, andrecommendations for future work are made. 9 refs., 17 figs., 24 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
