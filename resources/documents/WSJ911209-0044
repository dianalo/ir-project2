As long as the decline remains orderly, analysts said, theU.S. is unlikely to try to end the downtrend, because a lowerdollar could help increase demand for American goods at justthe time when some exportled strength would be welcome.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said Fridaythat &quot;recent and present&quot; foreign-exchange rates are not amatter of concern for the U.S.   Mr. Mulford's remarks came shortly after the dollar slidon news of the surprisingly sharp 241,000 decline in U.S.nonfarm payrolls in November.   In late New York trading Friday, the dollar was quoted at1.5674 marks and 127.95 yen, substantially lower than 1.5883marks and 128.70 yen late Thursday.   Early Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 128.20yen, down from Tokyo's close Friday of 128.70 yen, and at1.5735 marks, down from 1.5847 marks at Friday's close.   While Friday's decline was primarily because of theNovember employment data, another reduction in U.S. interestrates also took a toll on the dollar. The Fed signaled thatit was relaxing credit by lowering its target for the federalfunds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnightloans, to 4.50% from 4.75%. Lower rates make the dollarrelatively less attractive to overseas investors.   Mr. Mulford indicated a lack of concern about the dollar'slevels last month, when the Treasury released its semi-annualforeign-exchange report. &quot;On balance, the dollar, despiteseveral ups and downs this year, has continued to move in agenerally stable pattern, consistent with the trend of recentyears,&quot; he said in testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee.   The latest U.S. intervention report also suggests thatofficials aren't eager to see the dollar climb. The report,released Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,showed that the U.S. didn't intervene to influence thedollar's levels between August and October, even though thedollar declined substantially against a number of foreigncurrencies. The New York Fed conducts foreign-exchange marketintervention for the U.S. government.   Although the dollar is above the post-World War II low of1.4425 marks set last February, it is far below the 1991 highof 1.8425 marks reached in July. With the U.S. economy introuble and the Fed lowering rates, analysts say the dollarcould easily test support at 1.50 marks soon.   &quot;I don't think you're going to get a determined defense&quot;to lift the dollar if it keeps falling, said RaviBulchandani, an international economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co. &quot;You may get some smoothing&quot; intervention, but nothingmore, he added.   Even though the dollar's weakness is discouraging toholders of dollar-denominated investments, U.S. officials areexpected to tolerate its downtrend for the sake of U.S.exports. With the dollar at depressed levels, foreign demandfor attractively priced American products may help keep theexport industries going and breathe some life into the U.S.economy.   Exports for the first nine months of this year totaled$312.69 billion, up from $291.81 billion in the first ninemonths of 1990.   Only if the dollar's move down &quot;becomes disorderly&quot; willthere probably be any intervention to cushion the currency'sfall, said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bankin New York. While the dollar has fallen sharply in the pastfew months, there have been few episodes of frenzied sellingand a number of upward corrections along the way.   With a bit of &quot;safe haven&quot; buying caused by concerns aboutthe Soviet Union providing the dollar's only real support atthis time, analysts expect the U.S. currency will continue toslide.   &quot;The pressures are there for the dollar to continue tofall,&quot; said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;The trend is still somewhat lower.&quot; Byyear's end, she said, the dollar could easily decline to 1.50marks.</TEXT></DOC>
