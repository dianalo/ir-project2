Theylook at the pictures,'' said Dr. Paul Fischer, an associateprofessor of family medicine at the Medical College of Georgia.   Fischer conducted one of the studies, which were reported intoday's Journal of the American Medical Association.   Congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the U.S. SurgeonGeneral's warnings about the hazards of smoking to be put oncigarette packages and advertisements. The warnings began appearingin 1972 after the tobacco industry and the Federal Trade Commissionreached an agreement on the wording.   Fischer used video equipment to monitor how 61 Georgia teen-agersmoved their eyes across cigarette ads in magazines. The teen-agerswere paid for taking part in the study, he said.   Equipment problems meant data could be taken from only 45 of thesubjects, ages 13 to 17, who viewed a total of 202 advertisements,Fischer said.   But in 43.6 percent of the viewings, he said, the teen-agers didnot see the warnings on the ads.   A marketing research executive commissioned by the TobaccoInstitute, a Washington-based trade association that representsmajor cigarette manufacturers, contended the study was flawed.   ``They should have used a minimum of 150 to 200 people for thestudy and it should have been a representative sample in order toget true results,'' said Elliot Young, president of PerceptionsResearch Services Inc., an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., market researchfirm.   Fischer's study drew a distinction between ``looking'' and``reading'' and defined reading as a situation in which the eye wasfixed on the ad for at least 0.1 seconds.   After viewing the advertisements, the teen-agers were asked tochoose the five warnings that were in the ads from a list of 10possible choices.   Another study, conducted by Dr. Ronald Davis, director of theOffice on Smoking and Health for the federal Centers for DiseaseControl in Atlanta, found that while people were able to clearlyread cigarette ads on street and highway billboards and on taxis,they had trouble making out the warnings.   His study used two nonsmoking CDC workers in Atlanta and twononsmoking New York City Health Department workers as viewers.   In Atlanta, under average driving conditions, the two CDC workersin a moving car were able to read the brand name of a cigaretteadvertised on street billboards after viewing them for 3 seconds.But in 18 cases they were unable to read the warning against smokingand in 27 cases they were able to make out only part of it, thestudy said.   On highway billboards, the CDC observers were able to read thebrand name in the ad in all 39 cases, but were able to completelyread the warnings in only two of the incidents, the study said. Thewarnings were partially read in six of the viewings.   Two viewers, who saw 100 ads on taxis in New York City from asidewalk bench were unable to read any warnings, even though theycould read the brand name in every case, the study found.</TEXT></DOC>
