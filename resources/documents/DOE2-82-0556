By monitoring the change in propagationvelocity of a surface acoustic wave (SAW), atmospheric corrosion by gasescan be recorded. Sulfidation of copper and inhibition of the sulfidationprocess by organic inhibitors has been studied to demonstrate the extrememass sensitivity of the SAW devices. By exciting the same substrate ata different frequency, a shear horizontal acoustic plate mode (SH-APM)was used to monitor corrosion of aluminum in an aqueous sodium hydroxideenvironment. 7 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
