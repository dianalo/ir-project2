Police said seven peoplewere killed and more than 20 injured in violence overnight.   Strike supporters and transport companies said the protest easedtoday in many areas and worker attendance increased. Butparticipation near 100 percent was reported in other places.   Police reported more than two dozen incidents of violence betweenMonday evening and dawn today, including many firebombings andstonings of homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests werereported.   One black youth was killed by police shotgun fire after municipalofficers were stoned, police said. The other six blacks who died,including three children, were killed in shootings and a handgrenade attack in which the assailants were not identified.   In the black homeland of KwaZulu, hospital officials said a buspassenger injured in a firebomb attack early Monday had died.   A bomb caused minor damage to a rail line in Soweto early today,delaying some trains carrying blacks from the huge black township tojobs in Johannesburg.   Black union leaders had called for a three-day national protestwithout specifying a strike. They said the action aims to pressurebusiness leaders into demanding that the white minority governmentease restrictions on the anti-apartheid movement.   A three-day strike would be the longest nationwide protest sincethe government decreed an emergency June 12, 1986 to thwart a blackrevolt against apartheid, the policy of racial separation thatreserves power as well as the best schooling and living for SouthAfrica's 5 million whites and denies the country's 26 million blacksa voice in national affairs.   The boycott is the most ambitious opposition effort since thegovernment in February banned political activity by majoranti-apartheid groups and the Congress of South African TradeUnions, the largest black labor federation.   Union leaders targeted those prohibitions as well as proposedlegislation that would limit the ability of labor unions to strike.   Frank Meintjies, spokesman for the 691,000-member congress, said3 million people stayed home Monday and about 90 percent of thosewere still out today. Other estimates said there were about 1million strikers.   Police declined comment on the scope of the strike on groundsthat giving publicity to it would break emergency regulations.National police headquarters in Pretoria urged local news media toconsult their lawyers on restrictions against subversive statementsbefore publishing stories about the protest.   Some business leaders were quoted Monday as saying they intend toenforce a no-work, no-pay policy toward strikers, and ManpowerMinister Pieter du Plessis said strikers risked dismissal becausethe protest was illegal.   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a radioeditorial that the strike represented the strategy of ``thoseradical activists who want to make South Africa ungovernable.''   In Soweto, schools were empty today and many students wereexpected to extend a scheduled vacation period starting next week bystaying home for the rest of this week. Bus and taxi routes werebusier than on Monday.   Johannesburg, where sidewalks were virtually empty Monday, wasnearly as quiet this morning.   PUTCO, whose 2,400 buses carry 300,000 passengers daily inTransvaal and Natal provinces, said operations were back to normalaround Pretoria. Spokesman Robin Duff said service improved fromSoweto but was still only 25 percent of normal and that the stayawayappeared more than 90 percent effective in townships east ofJohannesburg and around the port of Durban.   South African Transport Services said rail commuter traffic wasup sharply in most areas.   Precious-metal mines, the backbone of South Africa's exportearnings, were slightly affected, with one gold mine and threediamond mines reporting significant stayaways Monday. Anglo AmericanCorp., the biggest mining company, said absenteeism was heavy Mondayat two of its coal mines, and that one mine was still affectedTuesday.   Milk and bread deliveries were curtailed in some areas aroundDurban. Hospital services there and in Johannesburg were reportedrunning smoothly.   In some areas around Johannesburg where transport was disrupted,police used large trucks to carry people to the nearest working busroutes.   All of the country's seven major automobile assembly plantsremained closed.   The union call for a protest was endorsed last week by leadinganti-apartheid clergymen and the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement said the economy ``must grind to a halt.''</TEXT></DOC>
