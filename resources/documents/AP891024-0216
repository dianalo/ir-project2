For many reasons, they drive to this two-story warehouse in thecity's South-of-Market district to give their sweat and time,helping people they do not know at a time of great need.   ``I did it for the feeling that I get,'' says Thomas Kay, 20,who came from San Mateo on his day off from a Safeway store to help.   Rodger Christopherson, 60, drove from his home in Bevelry Hills,300 miles south of San Francisco, to do his part. He worked 12hours on Sunday, including a supply trip to quake-ravagedWatsonville.   Still, the self-employed screenwriter and novelist shrugs offthe long hours. ``I think it's much better to have a first-handexperience,'' he says.</TEXT><DATELINE>PASADENA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fire at a plastics plant burned todayafter a series of explosions that flung debris five miles and shookthe ground 25 miles away. At least one worker was killed, more than100 were injured and 23 were missing.   ``I thought it was the end,'' said Billy Ridenour, a 35-year-oldworker who was inside the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant. ``I wasthinking, `Run till you die.'''   Flames and intense heat kept rescuers from getting close enoughto investigate Monday afternoon's explosion, and officials fearedthe worst.   ``We're betting there's a lot of fatalities, just because of thenature of the explosion and where it happened,'' said Dr. PaulPepe, director of Houston's emergency medical services. ``We don'tthink there's anybody alive in there.''</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze says theSoviet Union is willing to negotiate an end to the NATO and WarsawPact military alliances and is prepared to eliminate its ownoverseas bases by the year 2000.   And he has promised that as East bloc countries move away fromone-party Communist rule, the Soviet Union will observe strictprinciples of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''

On the other hand, the study says 45 million others are``healthy and wealthy'' and characterizes other large groups as``fat and frustrated'' and even ``confused and indifferent'' abouttheir health.   The survey done for Prevention magazine found that middle-agedwomen with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles, whilewhite, male, blue-collar workers have the worst health habits.   The report, ``The Fit and the Fat,'' found a sizable group ofpeople who want to be healthy but lack the resources, both personaland financial. Many others know what to do to be healthy but lackmotivation, said Thomas Dybdahl, director of the study.</TEXT><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Long-suffering consumers have gained the ear ofgovernment with a thundering protest over a new sales tax, butJapan's nearly lifeless consumer movement still lacks the spirit tokindle indignation against everyday price gouging.   ``Japanese consumers could certainly use a break,'' said MasaruOgawa, director of the America-Japan Society and a newspapercolumnist. ``They should learn that they don't have to takeeverything the government hands them.''   Japan is an economic giant, but at home people's purchasingpower is midget-sized. Overall, prices in Tokyo are 39 percenthigher than New York and 47 percent higher than Hamburg, WestGermany.   Prices are driven up by a number of factors, including aninefficient distribution system, common price-fixing, governmentregulations, exorbitant land prices and import restrictions thatkeep price competition to a minimum.</TEXT></DOC>
