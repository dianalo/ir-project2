The appointment of John Sununu, the New Hampshire governor ofLebanese descent who will be Bush's chief-of-staff, concerned someJewish leaders. And other appointments have not assuaged thatconcern, they indicated Monday.   ``None of them come to their posts with a clear message ofheartfelt identification with Israel's security needs,'' said HymanBookbinder, formerly the Washington representative of the AmericanJewish Committee and still a leading lobbyist for Jewish and Israelicauses.   ``None of this is meant to imply that Bush is anti-Israel,''added Bookbinder, who campaigned on behalf of Democraticpresidential candidate Michael Dukakis.   American Jewish leaders consider the Reagan administration,including Secretary of State George Shultz, the most pro-Israeladministration ever.   Bush ran on a strong pro-Israel platform but was viewed in thepast with suspicion by Jewish leaders for advocating an increase inSaudi oil prices and for supporting some arms sales to Arab nations.   Bookbinder and others, who echoed his sentiments but declined tobe named, suggested that Bush appoint a Jewish or pro-Israel Cabinetmember or U.N. ambassador.   Among the names mentioned were those of Morris Abram, thechairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American JewishOrganization; Max Kampelman, the arms negotiator, and RichardSchifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights.   Abram, a conservative Georgia Democrat who campaigned for Reaganand Bush, has also served Presidents Kennedy and Carter on civil andhuman rights projects. Abram, a partner in a New York law firm, saidhe had not been contacted ``but I would be willing to hear what thepresident-elect has to say. I have great respect for him.''   Also mentioned by several Jewish leaders was Jeanne Kirkpatrick,who served as U.N. ambassador during the first years of the Reaganadministration and is viewed as a staunch ally of Israel.   ``It doesn't have to be a Jew, but we need someone who will makeus feel better,'' Bookbinder said.   Leaders of Jewish organizations are to meet Wednesday with Sununuto voice their concerns about his record. ``We've never had anArab-American as gatekeeper to the president,'' said one leaderinvited to the meeting. ``I think there's legitimate cause forconcern.''   Sununu, whose grandfather was Lebanese, drew the ire of AmericanJews as the only governor to decline to condemn a 1975 U.N.resolution that equates Zionism with racism.   Standing at Bush's side during a news conference announcing hisselection for the White House job, Sununu said last week he had notwanted to involve his state in foreign affairs. Sununu said herejects the 1975 resolution and supports the pro-Israel platform ofthe Republican Party, which he helped write.</TEXT></DOC>
