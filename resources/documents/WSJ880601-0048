Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar's mini-rally edged forward for the fifth trading day even as traders raised doubts about how much further the currency could rise.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7328 marks, up from 1.7269 marks in Frankfurt on Monday and 1.7168 marks late Friday in New York. The dollar also inched up against its Japanese counterpart, climbing to 125.23 yen from 124.78 yen in Tokyo on Monday and 124.88 yen late Friday in New York. The pound fell to $1.8360 from $1.8559 late Friday in New York.    In trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened at 125.23 yen.    Markets in the U.S., Britain and Singapore were closed Monday for holidays.    &quot;This isn't so much dollar strength as . . . mark weakness against all other European currencies,&quot; said Klaus Schuermann, a vice president and chief mark dealer for Commerzbank, Frankfurt. Dealers said West Germany's economic growth and interest rates are lower than those in many other countries, diminishing the currency's appeal.    Mr. Schuermann said investors are selling marks to invest in higher-yielding currencies. &quot;When you can get 10% to 12% in (Spanish) pesetas or Danish kroner, people will change from . . . marks to these currencies,&quot; he added.    Traders in Europe got an early scare when West Germany's Bundesbank sold $7.4 million to buy marks at the Frankfurt fixing. Initially, dealers interpreted the move -- the first time since Aug. 10, 1987, that the West German central bank sold dollars at the fixing -- as a signal that Western central banks wanted to cap the dollar's rise and keep it below 1.73 marks.    But that feeling soon dissipated as the dollar regained some of its strength. The Bundesbank's action &quot;had nothing to do with intervention; you can't read out of this that they're willing to intervene at these levels,&quot; said Reinhard Pfeiffer, chief dealer for DG Bank, Frankfurt.    He and other traders attributed the sale to technical factors, specifically the inability of German currency brokers to match buyers and sellers at the daily fixing because of a shortage of dollar sellers.    &quot;The Bundesbank is just saying: 'We're here, we intend to be here and don't go crazy,'&quot; said Betsy S. Waters, a corporate foreign-exchange trader at Barclays Bank PLC, New York. Pointing out the small amount spent and the public manner of the central bank's action, she said: &quot;The central banks are concerned about volatility and want markets to remain calm and stable. If they really wanted to intervene to change (the dollar's) direction, they would have done it.&quot;    Still others read the Bundesbank's move as an attempt to reduce its huge dollar reserves in a rising market. &quot;The dollar moved up, so why shouldn't they sell a few,&quot; said Daniel Schwitter, a senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich. &quot;If they sell a few now, they can buy more later on; the dollar will come under pressure later in the year.&quot;    Although, German monetary growth slowed to an annualized 7.3% in the March/April period, West German authorities are believed to be concerned about the inflationary implications of the growth, much of which has been fueled by currency intervention. Traders said selling dollars at opportune times would help alleviate some of the expansionary pressure on the money supply without having to tighten monetary policy.    Much of the dollar's support rests on a combination of technical factors, the latest signs of a buoyant American economy and rising U.S. interest rates that have increased the currency's appeal relative to the mark.    Dealers said that when the dollar climbed past 1.7260 marks -- an important point on charts some traders use to predict currency movements -- they became bullish on the currency for the short-term.    Traders also pointed to the fact that the U.S. March trade deficit fell to $9.75 billion from $13.83 billion a month earlier and that unemployment was at a 14-year low.    Mr. Schwitter of Union Bank said that if the unemployment data for May was as positive as April, the market would be looking for a boost in the U.S. discount rate. But he added that if that happened, other central banks would use the opportunity to raise rates.    &quot;So the foreign-exchange situation would be more or less neutralized. They've kept (currency rates) in a very narrow range and they're doing it rather well,&quot; Mr. Schwitter said.    Mr. Schuermann of Commerzbank said a new trading range for the dollar could be established between 1.68 marks and 1.73 marks. &quot;We might have a test of 1.7325, but I don't think (the dollar) will go much higher,&quot; he said.    For several months, the U.S. currency mostly traded between 1.6550 and 1.6950 marks. The Commerzbank dealer added: &quot;If we get a few more good trade numbers -- better than the bad ones; $10 billion is still bad -- the range should shift to 1.70 to 1.75 marks.&quot;    Mrs. Waters of Barclays said she believes 1.74 marks or 1.75 marks &quot;is toppish.&quot; She said she believes all of the factors supporting the U.S. currency are short-term: &quot;Longer-term, I'm still a bear. Fundamentally, you haven't changed anything. You still have a budget deficit, a trade deficit and a questionable political situation -- it being an election year. Because of that you can't run out and buy dollars on a long-term basis.&quot;    Several traders said that while the dollar had advanced against the mark in recent days, it has risen little against the yen. That, said Mrs. Waters, showed that the U.S. currency's recent rally &quot;is all short-term, and nothing is really firm until we see the dollar go up against the yen substantially, and we don't expect that.&quot;    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold settled at $455 an ounce, up $4.20. Estimated volume was moderate at 3.1 million ounces.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, May 31, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
