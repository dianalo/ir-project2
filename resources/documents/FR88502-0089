The periodicpublication of these theft data does not have any effect on the obligationsof regulated parties under the Cost Savings Act. These theft data for yearsafter 1984 serve only to inform the public of the extent of the motor vehicletheft problem.This notice sets forth data on passenger motor vehicle thefts in 1986 forpublic review and comment. These data were calculated based on informationprovided to this agency by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).These 1986 theft data indicate that vehicle thefts in 1986 increased abovethe levels recorded in previous years. For example, the median theft ratecalculated for 1983/84 was 3.2712 thefts per 1000 vehicles produced. Thismedian theft rate is used in all determinations of whether a car line isa likely high theft line, and subject to the vehicle theft prevention standard.The median theft rate in 1986 was 3.6023 thefts per 1000 vehicles produced,an increase of 10 percent in the median theft rate compared to 1983/84.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date: </T2>All comments on this notice must be received by NHTSA notlater than June 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbersset forth in the heading of this notice, and be submitted to: Docket Section,NHTSA, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (Dockethours are 8:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:  </T2>Ms. Barbara Kurtz, Office ofMarket Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590(202-366-4808).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>NHTSA has promulgated a Federal motorvehicle theft prevention standard at 49 CFR Part 541. This standard appliesto cars that are in lines designated as ``high theft lines.'' Whether ornot a car line is a high theft line depends on the relationship of theline's actual or likely theft rate to the median theft rate for car linesin 1983 and 1984. Section 603(b)(3) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C.2023(b)(3)) sets forth the steps NHTSA had to follow in making its deterinationof the median theft rate for 1983 and 1984. The agency followed those steps,published final theft data for 1983 and 1984 car lines, and calculateda median theft rate of 3.2712 per 1000 vehicles produced in those years.<T3>See </T3>50 FR 46666; November 12, 1985.Section 603(b)(3) of the Cost Savings act also provides that NHTSA shall``periodically'' publish later calendar years' theft data for public reviewand comment. These publications of theft data for subsequent model yearshave no effect on the determination of whether a car line is or shouldbe subject to the requirements of the theft prevention standard. The agencybelieves that the reason Congress directed it to periodically publish theftdata for later years was to inform the public, particularly law enforcementgroups, automobile manufacturers, and the Congress, of the extent of thevehicle theft problem and the impact, if any, on vehicle thefts of theFederal motor vehicle theft prevention standard.To accomplish this purpose, this notice sets forth the theft rates forthe 157 lines of passenger motor vehicles sold in the United States duringthe 1986 model year. NHTSA calculated these theft rates based on informationprovided by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a division ofthe FBI.These 1986 theft data show an increase in vehicle thefts above the levelexperienced in 1983/84. For 1983/84, the median theft rate was 3.2712 theftsper 1000 vehicles produced. Exactly 50 percent of the 1983/84 lines hadtheft rates that exceeded this median theft rate. For 1986, the mediantheft rate was 3.6023, a 10 percent increase in the median compared to1983/84. For 1986, 92 of the 157 car lines, or 58.6 percent, exceeded themedian theft rate for 1983/84.In calculating these 1986 theft data, the agency followed the same approachit has used in all previous theft data calculations. Multiple countingsof a single vehicle theft could occur if a law enforcement agency computeroperator followed incorrect data entry procedures after getting furtherinformation about a vehicle already reported as stolen. In these circumstances,operators are supposed to revise an existing theft data entry to reflectnew or additional data about the theft, but they sometimes cancel the originaltheft entry and enter a new theft report. The result of such an actionwould be that one actual vehicle theft reported to NCIC would be enteredinto the system more than once. To address this possibility, NHTSA hasexcluded all duplicate vehicle identification numbers reported as stolenwithin seven days of each other. This limitation assumes that it is possiblethat a vehicle might actually be stolen more than once in a calendar year,but that it is highly unlikley a vehicle would be stolen more than oncein any particular week.Interested persons are invited to submit comments on these data. The agencyis particularly interested in comments about the accuracy of the data andthe methodology used to calculate theft rates. It is requested but notrequired that 10 copies be submitted.All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessaryattachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detailtheir primary arguments in a concise fashion.If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality,three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidentialbusiness information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA,at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedlyconfidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the DocketSection. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a coverletter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidentialbusiness information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be availablefor examination in the docket at the above address both before and afterthat date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing datewill also be considered before publication of the final 1986 theft data.Comments on this notice will be available for inspection in the docket.The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes availablein the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interestedpersons continue to examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments inthe rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in theenvelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisorwill return the postcard by mail.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>15 U.S.C. 2023; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50and 49 CFR 501.8.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on April 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Barry Felrice,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-9583 Filed 4-29-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-59-C</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
