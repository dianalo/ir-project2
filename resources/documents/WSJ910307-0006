On this latter point, you are mistaken.   From Sept. 16, 1958, to Feb. 9, 1959, Judge FlorenceEllenwood Allen served as chief judge of the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the Sixth Circuit (encompassing Kentucky,Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee). President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt appointed Judge Allen to the Sixth Circuit, whereshe served as an active circuit judge from 1934 to 1959, andremained a senior judge on that court until her death in themid-1960s. She was the first woman to serve as a federalcircuit judge as well. Prior to serving on the federal bench,Judge Allen had been elected several times to the OhioSupreme Court.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Wald is a talented and highly regarded jurist. Sheis also one of the few women who have served as chief judgeof a Federal Court of Appeals. Judge Dolores Korman Sloviter,equally well-accomplished, has recently become the chiefjudge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.These judges are a credit to the federal bench.   Unfortunately, in the U.S. District Court for the NorthernDistrict of Ohio, which is part of the Sixth Circuit, womenjudges since 1979 seem to have been appointed primarily onthe basis of gender or connections, not on the basis of highcaliber. To this day, this district dearly suffers theconsequences.   The contrast with the current situation in this districtis startling, and telling, when one reviews the life of JudgeAllen. Justice Potter Stewart, her colleague, regarded her asa legend. She was a most able jurist, imbued with thatprecious quality -- judicial temperament -- and respected byher male colleagues.
