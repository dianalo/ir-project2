ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A juror in the Oliver North trial testifiedWednesday that she gave incorrect background information to thecourt because she forgot that her brother had been sent to prisonfor armed robbery.   Tara Leigh King, who was on the panel that convicted North onthree Iran-Contra charges last month, had said ``no'' when asked ona jury selection form whether ``you or any member of your immediatefamily'' had been involved in any court proceeding or investigation.   ``When I filled this out, I had forgotten about it,'' Miss Kingsaid during a 90-minute hearing.   North's lawyers had asked for a hearing, saying that hermisstatement ``raises serious questions as to juror bias andimpartiality, and suggests that defendant was deprived of his rightto exercise peremptory and causal challenges in an informed manner.''   North, a former aide on the National Security Council, was at thedefense table with four of his lawyers, but took no part in theproceeding.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he will rule Thursdaywhether the jury was tainted by the events. His most serious remedywould be to grant a mistrial.   North's sentencing had been set for June 23 but was postponed toJuly 5 when the juror problem arose. He faces a maximum prison timeof 10 years for aiding and abetting in obstruction of Congress,destroying or mutilating official documents and accepting a gratuity.   Miss King said when she filled out the questionnaire on Feb. 1,she also had not remembered being questioned by detectives,receiving a subpoena, appearing before the grand jury and about hermother telling her that her brother was in prison.   ``I had forgotten about it after I shed tears,'' she said. ``Itstuck with me, but not until the point where he got out.''   The brother, Samuel King, 51, was in prison from mid-1987 tomid-1988 for armed robbery.   In the questioning it was brought out that Samuel and Tara bothlived at home. Miss King said she was one of 15 children, eight boysand seven girls.   ``Is it a little embarrassing to talk about this?'' asked BrendanSullivan, North's lawyer.   ``Yes, it is,'' said Miss King.   She explained that she forgot about Samuel's arrest atChristmastime 1986. ``It wasn't a nice thing to think about,'' shesaid, adding: ``I had a job to go to, I could not let it tear medown. I had to live my life.''   Sullivan also brought out that four other brothers had beeninvolved in criminal matters and that a sister had gone to court ina child custody suit.   But Miss King said she had not known anything about any of those.   Her misstatements on the juror form came to light during aninvestigation by North's lawyers. Miss King had been one of the fewjurors to grant extensive interviews to the news media following thetrial and she admitted to having used cocaine until four monthsbefore the trial.   Gesell said Wednesday's hearing would have been held behindclosed doors had it not been for that.   ``The reason for the public hearing is that Miss King herselfchose to accept the overtures of the press,'' he said. ``Simply,start playing this game with the press and you have to play it thewhole way.''   Like all others chosen for the jury, Miss King said before thetrial that she had not heard, seen or read about North at the timewhen he testified before congressional committees in 1987.   She was asked by prosecutor John Keker whether she had anypreference for or against North when she filled out thequestionnnaire.   No, said Miss King. ``I was doing what I was asked to do and Iwas answering the qestions as good as I could. I had forgotten thesituation about my brothers.''</TEXT></DOC>
