<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-0504 </DOCNO><TEXT>Up to 20 m of undated Tertiary sediment have been exposed by incisionof the White River in southern White River Valley, Nevada. The sediments,deposited in two distinct environments and time periods, range from conglomerateto mudstone. Older sediments comprise alluvial-fan and lacustrine faciesdeposited in a closed basin. Alluvial-fan grain size and provenance patternsindicate centripetal transport into a topographic low located on thewestern margin of the valley. Very fine grained sandstone to mudstonebasin-center deposits contain pennate diatoms and perhaps other microfossils.The basin-fill deposits are unconformably overlain by stream-terraceconglomerate. Such terraces are found along the White River as far southas Lake Mead and relate to the present southward external drainage. Multipleterrace levels, formed during incision, reflect base-level changes inthe Colorado River System. The valley is bounded by normal faults, onthe east by the White River fault and west by the Pahroc fault, in apparentcontrast to the half-graben form of nearby basins. The alluvial-fan depositsare cut by the Pahroc fault but appear to postdate slip on the WhiteRiver fault. Facies patterns in the basin fill thus indicate concentrationof fine-grained sediment near the fault that was active during deposition.Terrace conglomerates indicate progradation of coarse clastics acrossthe fine basinal deposits after activity on the bounding fault ceased.These relationships support the recent hypothesis that coarse clasticsedimentation in a basin may reflect post-tectonic rather than syntectonicdeposition.</TEXT></DOC>
