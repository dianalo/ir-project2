We have to act. We will act,'' Mitchellsaid.   President Bush, at a news conference Thursday night, joined thatcall, saying he hoped both Republicans and Democrats would avoidattacking each other.   ``I'd like to shift the gears and move into ethics legislation,''Bush said when asked about a Republican National Committee memoattacking new House Speaker Thomas Foley, the latest salvo in aCongress marked by charges of ethical violations.   ``We've got to do better,'' Bush said. ``The ugliness of theclimate is bad.'' But he brushed aside demands from some Democratsthat Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater resign because of thememo.   Earlier in the day, Mitchell said that skepticism about publicofficials is healthy but that ``a danger occurs when skepticismbecomes cynicism and mistrust.''   Mitchell renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees, coupledwith a pay raise. But he said members of Congress are reluctant torisk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises tomake up for losing the fees.   One possibility, he said, would be to gradually lower limits onspeech fees, known as honoraria, while gradually increasingcongressional salaries.   Mitchell, D-Maine, spoke to a group of reporters in his Capitoloffice at a time when congressional ethics issues have been broughtto the fore by allegations that brought resignation announcementsfrom House Speaker Jim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho.   Some of the allegations against Wright concerned rules onhonoraria, while Coelho has been criticized for a private investmentdeal.   Mitchell said separate Democratic and Republican task forces inthe Senate are studying proposals for ethics reform. But he said,``It's difficult to act in a situation in which there is no clearconsensus.''   ``We hope in the near future to be able to go forward with someeffort'' in the areas of banning speech fees, known as honoraria,and raising pay, he said. But he also said, ``If prevailing publicsentiment were the sole determining factor, the pay of members ofCongress today would be exactly what it was 200 years ago.''   ``One of the things we must do ... is find the proper balancebetween being responsive to the wishes of the electorate andapplying one's best conscience and judgment as to what is best forthe nation or the state as a whole.''   ``We are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted tohonoraria, in the press ... and a public wholly disinterested inhonoraria. It puts members of Congress squarely in a vise, squarelyin a difficult position. We are caught in a vise.''   Mitchell's comments amplified remarks made a day earlier byFoley, D-Wash., who told reporters he hoped the House would actbefore year's end on a new ethics package. Foley also said proposalswould likely have to address the honoraria issue.   Mitchell voiced interest in a bill, introduced by Sen.Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., which would phase out speaking fees whilegradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries.   ``Several senators, both Democrat and Republican, have expressedto me that that's the only reasonable approach ... which some feelis the way out of a difficult situation,'' he said.   Members of the House and Senate currently are paid $89,500 ayear, although the top leaders make more than that. Both the Houseand Senate, by overwhelming margins, defeated a proposed 50 percentpay raise early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal.   Mitchell said he would not set any ``arbitrary deadline'' forrecommending ethics changes, saying it was more important to findagreement on rules that provide ``more precise and definitestandards'' for lawmakers. He said a review also is needed of rulesconcerning acceptance of gifts.   He said he thought the increased press scrutiny of congressionalethics was legitimate but also said he doesn't think there has beena general deterioration in standards of behavior.   ``There has never been a time in history when there has been atotal absence of public skepticism about public officials,'' hesaid, adding that that is ``a healthy thing'' in a democracy.   ``There is nothing new here. There is a recurring theme inAmerican history. Of course it is episodic,'' Mitchell said. `We'rein one of those periods when interest is high. ... A danger occurswhen the healthy skepticism becomes cynicism and mistrust.''   Mitchell said Congress ``must address'' the questions of ethicsreform and changes in campaign finance laws, aimed at lessening theinfluence of special interests.   Meanwhile, Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, began circulating amongHouse members a letter demanding that President Bush ask for theresignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwaterbecause of a party document which attacked Speaker Thomas S. Foley.   The RNC memo compared Foley's record with that of Rep. BarneyFrank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual. Bush was said to be``disgusted'' with the incident, but he also expressed confidence inAtwater, who was his 1988 campaign chairman.   Mark Goodin, a Republican official who had been a press aide inthe Bush campaign, claimed sole responsibility for the letter andresigned.   ``These things don't happen in a political party unless the chiefsigns off on it,'' said Nagle, who was chairman of the IowaDemocratic Party. If Bush fails to get rid of Atwater, it will hurtthe president's credibility when he asks for bipartisan cooperation,he said.   But the president, recalling a conversation with Atwater aboutthe memo, said: ``He looked me right in the eye and said he did notknow about it and and I respect that.''   Bush said Foley had been done ``a terrible ill service by this''and likened the attack to those made against former Sen. John Tower,whose nomination by Bush to be defense secretary was doomed byaccusations about Tower's drinking and womanizing.   ``I have great respect for Tom Foley and he's the one who saysthe matter should be closed and he's right,'' Bush said in callingfor an end to the partisan warfare. ``Let met just repeat: It wasdisgusting. It's against everything that I've stood for in politicallife.''</TEXT></DOC>
