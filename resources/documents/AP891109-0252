Justin's parents earn $13,000 a year, too much to qualify forstate Medicaid yet well below the federal poverty level for afamily of five. Because the Coles fall through this ever-wideningcrack, Justin receives treatment for recurring ear infectionsthrough the Caring Program for Children.   Before he was enrolled in 1986, ``We were relying on clinics. Ifit would have been just your typical childhood illnesses I coulddeal with that but with permanent hearing loss...'' said hismother, Chris, her voice trailing off.   ``He's very happy because he can see his doctor now. There wasthat period of time when he was running from doctor to doctor andclinic to clinic.   ``The bottom line for him is it saved his hearing. I'm convincedof this.''   The program, sponsored by Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania andPennsylvania Blue Shield, has helped more than 13,000 youngsters infour years. About 700 more are waiting to get in. Its success hasprompted nine states to start similar programs, and four more areexpected to follow suit soon.   For Chris and Jim Coles, the Caring Program has removed thestigma of being on welfare while letting them provide for theirson. His ID card resembles any insurance card, and is accepted bymost physicians.   Mrs. Coles, 38, who has two children from a previous marriage,works part time as a nurse's aide. Her husband, 37, a laid-offsteelworker, paints houses.   ``We are the working poor. It's unfortunate, but we're notalone,'' Mrs. Coles said. ``You have to make a choice. What's moreimportant to my child? His ears or having food on the table and aroof over his head? That is absolutely what it came down to.''   No one should have to make that kind of choice, said FredRogers, host of public television's ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''and Caring Program honorary chairman. The program ``is not going tosolve all of the ills of our society, with its skyrocketing medicalexpenses. But it certainly is a stopgap.''   The Coles are among 37 million Americans the Census Bureau sayslack health insurance. About a third, or 12.5 million, are under19. From 1980 to 1988, the number of children under 15 living inpoverty rose by 1.2 million, according to the Children's DefenseFund.   ``We have a national problem,'' said Dr. James Strain, executivedirector of the American Academy of Pediatrics.   ``The very poor people have access to care'' through thegovernment, Strain said. ``The children who have trouble are thoseabove the level that makes them eligible for Medicaid and childrenwho should be eligible but aren't.''   The federal poverty level for a family of five, for example, is$14,140 a year. Earning more than $7,700 disqualifies them forMedicaid in Pennsylvania.   ``You see why people go on welfare in this situation,'' saidCharlie LaVallee, director of the Caring Program. ``It's incredibleirony. People who are working, their children are worse off. That'stragic in a land that has prided itself on the things we havedone.''   The program was established in Pittsburgh in 1985 after twoministers approached Eugene Barone, president of Blue Cross ofWestern Pennsylvania, and described the anguish of unemployedsteelworkers. Barone discovered that 40,000 western Pennsylvaniachildren lacked health insurance, and that the problem spread farbeyond the families of former steelworkers.   Blue Cross and Blue Shield agreed to match contributions dollarfor dollar, and to donate administrative costs, so children likeJustin could get not only treatment but regular checkups whileparents got back on their feet.   Although the Caring Program doesn't cover specialized care forchronically ill children and has no plans to do so, it hopes tohelp them indirectly with a five-year, $341,000 grant awarded Oct.30 by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the federal Office ofMaternal and Child Health.   The money will be used to train doctors to treat such lifetimeailments as diabetes or cystic fibrosis, said Dr. Woodie Kessel ofthe federal office. And parents of chronically ill children will bedirected to service agencies and specialty clinics.   The cost to the Caring Program of providing routine andpreventive treatment is $156 per child per year. Youngsters areeligible as long as their families are above the Medicaid cutoffbut below the federal poverty level. The parents pay nothing toparticipate in the program.   The other states with Caring Programs are Alabama, Iowa, Kansas,Maryland, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota andOhio. Four others plan to launch programs in January, but don'twant to be identified beforehand.   ``It's not a quick fix and then get out,'' said Al Rohling,executive director of the 1{-year-old Alabama Caring Program forChildren. About 3,000 children are waiting to get into the program,almost as many as those currently in it; the state's eligiblepopulation is estimated at more than 35,000.   In central New York, 17,500 youngsters are eligible for theCaring Program established Sept. 1. As of Nov. 1, 338 had beenapproved for assistance.   ``Are we going to wait until some federal program that may comedown a few years from now?'' asked Albert Antonini, president ofBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Central New York Inc. ``The needs areout there.''   Acutely aware of those needs, the pediatrics academy is pushingfor federal health insurance for all Americans under 21 and forpregnant women. Coverage would be furnished by parents' employersor a state insurance fund.   ``When we solve this problem, we can home in on the next groupthat is really vulnerable,'' like senior citizens, LaVallee said.``We have to keep attacking this with full strength.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
