Who killed the sultry chanteuse? And how many more ensembles canStephanie Zimbalist produce from her tiny carry-on bag?   Advertised as an ``intriguing mystery-drama,'' the movie isintriguing in only one regard: Can dramatic improbability really goany further?   Why Zimbalist, playing a flaky tourist stuck in Egypt, wants tostalk a murderer is never explained. How a car moving at about 8 mphcan kill somebody is equally perplexing.   The only thing that makes perfect sense is why Edward Woodward,Rue McClanahan, Ken Howard, Tony Randall and Zimbalist all agreed tostar in this clunker _ a neat chance to visit Spain for free.   Based, more or less, on a 1924 Agatha Christie novel, ``The Manin the Brown Suit'' focuses on a couple of murders _ or maybe onewas an accident? _ some missing diamonds, a handsome stranger in abrown suit, several suspects, a kidnapping, an EZ-Escape jail cell,a half-dozen lurking-in-the-shadows bad guys and a whole bunch ofromantic European film locations.   Zimbalist stars as Anne Beddingfeld, a camera-toting travelerlost in the Cairo airport with hardly any luggage and nothing muchto do except whimper. Before you can say ``plot device,'' a man atthe airport who smells like musk _ no kidding _ is hit by thatdeadly slow-moving car, and we're on our merry way.   On the dead man's body is a piece of paper that _ surprise! _might be a clue. After the handsome stranger _ the one in the brownsuit _ drops the note he has stolen from the corpse, Beddingfeldscoops it up. ``I don't want to leave now,'' she says. ``Theadventure hasn't started yet.''   Using sleuthing skills that would make Nancy Drew relax in herretirement, Beddingfeld books a cabin on a small cruise ship andsets to work. On board, lucky for her, are all of the key players inthe unsolved chanteuse murder and a related diamond theft. Belowdecks somewhere must also be a Bloomingdale's, as Beddingfeld neverseems to run out of fresh outfits.   Suspects include the man in the brown suit (Simon Dutton),dashing English businessman Sir Eustace Pedler (Woodward), hisassistant Underhill (Nickolas Grace), oft-married socialite SuzyBlair (McClanahan) and a creepy priest (Randall).   Special acting points should be given to Randall and Woodward forworking up new dialects especially for this project. Randall soundslike Quasimodo on a caffeine overdose, and Woodward manages abrilliant John Cleese impersonation. Ken Howard takes the smarterroute, spending most of the movie hiding behind dark sunglasses. Ifhe could have seen the finished movie, he probably would have worn ahat and fake moustache, too.   The creaky script, by Carla Jean Wagner, runs low on action andoverflows with talk. When Beddingfeld jots down a list of suspects,she has to announce each person's motive _ the film's director, AlanGrint, couldn't impart such basic information with his camera.   Beddingfeld and Blair eventually join forces. ``Oh Lord,'' saysBlair, ``this is so exciting I feel just like one of Charlie'sAngels!''   The closer Beddingfeld moves to solving the mystery, such as itis, the more endangered her life becomes. After Beddingfeld isalmost pushed overboard into the sea, she survives a plunge into awaterfall.   Tough private detective that she is, the watery near-deaths onlystrengthen her determination.   Does she solve the crime? Does anybody care?   The rewards of ``The Man in the Brown Suit'' do not rest with thedelivery of justice. Instead, the fascination is found in thepreposterous depths to which this story slinks. All-star camp, afterall, is all-star camp.</TEXT><TEXT>   ELSEWHERE IN TELEVISION:   PHONE IT IN _ The CBS series ``TV 101'' will hold a mockhigh-school election on Jan. 11, with viewers voting forstudent-council officers on special 900 telephone lines.
