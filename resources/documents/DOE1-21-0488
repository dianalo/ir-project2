In the lungs,the cytochrome P-450 decreased to 45, 13 and 20% of the control valuewith the increasing exposure intensity and the activity of 7-ethoxycoumarinO-deethylase to 70, 27 and 14%, respectively. The activity of epoxidehydrolase increased slightly after exposures both at 150 (1.6-fold) and300 cm/sup 3//m/sup 3/ (1.4-fold), while the other measured drug-metabolizingenzyme activities showed no consistent changes. The non-protein sulfhydrylgroup content of the lungs was not affected. The concentrations of m-xylenein blood indicated that the solvent uptake increased in the differentexposure groups more than expected, based on atmospheric concentrationsalone. Morphologic studies of the lungs with scanning electron microscopyshowed no apparent changes after exposure to 300 cm/sup 3//m/sup 3/ orafter a high oral dose (2 ml/kg/day, 3 days). Inhalation exposure tom-xylene for 5 weeks (7 h/day, 4 days/week) at a concentration of 300ppm lowered the contents of cytochrome P-450 in rat lungs to 65% andthe activity of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase to 41% without any othermarked effects on the other drug-metabolizing enzymes or on the levelsof non-protein sulfhydryl groups. In this study, the selective destructionof cytochrome P-450 in rat lung could be shown both after acute and subacuteexposures and at concentrations low enough to warrant occupational concern.</TEXT></DOC>
