Gun control opponents paint the attempt to outlaw small, cheaplymade handguns as a class and racial issue because poor people,especially blacks, are more often the victims of crime andinadequate police protection.   Assistant Attorney General S.G. Dennis Jr. told the HouseJudiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime Thursday that a totalban on the handguns commonly known as ``Saturday night specials''would ``deprive citizens who do not already own a handgun of theirability to obtain one suitable for self-defense but not forsporting purposes.''   But the committee's chairman, William J. Hughes, D-N.J., andother Democrats said it was hypocritical to ban imports and notdomestic versions of the weapons.   ``I regret that you have to come up here and advance thatargument,'' Hughes said.   ``I just think if you can't take it in you ought not to be ableto sell it here,'' said Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky.   But Dennis said the administration was called to testify on thebill that is being proposed, not the law that has been on the bookssince the late 1960s. The administration has no proposal to repealthat law, he said.   The proposed legislation, ``The Handgun Violence PreventionAct,'' would ban the manufacture, assembly, acquisition and futuretransfer of the Saturday night special-type pistols, said sponsorRep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.   The Gun Control Act of 1968 banned the import of guns thatlacked ``sporting purposes'' and required the Treasury Department'sBureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to create a panel to screenweapons using a point system.   The administration used that standard last year to ban theimport of rapid-fire, multiround rifles that have been used by drugdealers and in mass killings. The subcommittee has approvedlegislation covering the U.S.-made versions of those so-calledassault rifles.   Among those testifying was former White House Press SecretaryJames Brady, who used the occasion to argue for another proposedbill bearing his name. The Brady bill would require a waitingperiod for anyone wanting to buy firearms to let authorities checkthe record of the would-be purchaser.   The bill is so-named because Brady, the former press secretaryto President Ronald Reagan, was seriously wounded and remainsdisabled as a result of the assassination attempt on Reagan in1981. The attacker, John Hinckley, was able to buy a .22-caliberpistol easily despite a record of mental illness.   Another James Brady _ James C. Brady _ allegedly used ahigher-caliber pistol made by the same company to gun down fivepeople at an Atlanta shopping mall on Tuesday.   Brady had bought a pistol hours after being discharged from amental hospital, where he had been treated for homicidal andsuicidal tendencies.</TEXT></DOC>
