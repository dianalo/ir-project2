(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker presented a $100 million offerfor the failing PTL ministry during a bankruptcy court session inwhich his wife, Tammy, sobbed when the judge ordered the sale ofthe Bakkers' former parsonage.   PTL trustee M.C. Benton, who said he has received four offers,one for $200 million, to buy the ministry, promised that the formertelevision evangelist's proposal ``will be considered along witheveryone else'' if he can back it up.   ``We are ready to go forward with earnest negotiations,'' Bakkertold reporters Tuesday outside U.S. Bankruptcy Court. But herefused to identify who provided him with the $100 million line ofcredit to buy PTL.   The appearance of the Bakkers sensationalized an otherwiseroutine, 2{-hour bankruptcy hearing. They received a standingovation when they entered the courtroom, Tammy wearing a linendress studded with pearls and Bakker with a crisp, double-breastedgray suit.   ``Look how pretty she looks,'' whispered Bee Huffman, who saidshe supports the return of the Bakkers to PTL.   Judge Rufus Reynolds gave initial approval to PTL'sreorganization plan, which calls for sale of the 2,300-acreHeritage USA religious theme park in Fort Mill. He ordered the plansent to creditors for a vote next month.   Mrs. Bakker broke into tears and sobbed for several minutesafter Reynolds initially agreed to sell the PTL parsonage where theBakkers lived while running the ministry.   Reynolds later rescinded the order and said PTL could auctionthe mansion to one of two proposed bidders _ neither of themconnected to the Bakkers _ on Tuesday.   Bakker, with the letter of credit in his uplifted hand, said hewas ``committed to the restoration (of PTL) as a Christian retreatcenter, to pay all creditors 100 percent on the dollar, to restoreall lifetime partner benefits ... everything restored and all thepeople back happy and caring and ministering one to another.''   Benton said he hopes to decide which proposed buyer to presentto the court by mid-August. Informed of the $200 million offer froma group Benton would not identify, Bakker told reporters he doubtedits legitimacy.   ``So far all we see is smoke,'' he said, adding that his lenderwas ``prepared to go higher'' than his $100 million offer.   Asked why he was not willing to provide more details of hisfinancial backing, Bakker's attorney, James Toms, interjected,``That's all we're prepared to say at this time.''   The reorganization plan outlines the sale of Heritage USA to paycreditors and the formation of a debt-free, non-profit ministry.   The plan would give lifetime partners, major contributors whowere promised free lodging and other benefits for every $1,000donation, the option of relinquishing their claims. If they did,they would become voting members of the new Heritage Ministries Inc.   Reynolds ordered ballots sent to creditors July 15 and set anAug. 24 deadline to confirm or reject the plan. PTL, with debts ofup to $130 million and assets of $160 million, filed for bankruptcyreorganization in June 1987.   Reynolds also granted PTL permission to use $800,000 of theproceeds from property sales, normally frozen by the court duringbankruptcy proceedings, to cover a shortfall at the ministry.   Benton said contributions to the ministry hit an all-time lowthis month. ``We are at the end of the rope in cutting operationalactivities,'' he told Reynolds. ``We are hanging by a thread.''   In Charlotte, N.C., meanwhile, the federal grand juryinvestigating possible mail, wire and tax fraud by Bakker andformer associates has been given six more months to complete itsprobe into how the ministry raised and spent millions of dollars.   Prosecutors are trying to find out whether Bakker and his aidesraised money for one purpose and used it for another.   Bakker, who moved back to the Fort Mill area earlier this month,resigned in March 1987 from the ministry he built after admittingthat he had a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn and that cashpayments were made to silence her.</TEXT></DOC>
