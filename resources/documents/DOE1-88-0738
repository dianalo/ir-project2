If these new machinesare placed in critical positions in organizations facing highly uncertainenvironments and constrained in time and money, normal organizationalefforts to obtain the most from scare resources will produce increasedorganizational complexity. Increasing complexity of any sort increasesthe range of associated unknowns. With higher technical complexity incritical roles, the uncertainty of constrained organizations rises. Theability to muster the right response in the right amount of time to respondto environmental demands, especially crises, easily and often subtlydeclines. Along with nuclear, air-traffic, emergency, and financial systems,militaries face highly uncertain environments. The new complex weaponsare analogous to the new highly advanced machines being placed in criticalpositions in other organizations. For the military, however, loss ofpublic support in peace time can be reductions in money, autonomy, ormissions imposed by Congress. In wartime, however, the loses will bein battles, lives, and public confidence, and, for a society, the lossof confidence could easily mean the early use of nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
