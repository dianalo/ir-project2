Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the groupincluded coup members as well as their relatives.   ``We have a number of refugees in Miami that were flown in,''Fitzwater said. ``I can't identify who they are or where they arefor personal safety reasons.'' He said the action was taken underPresident Bush's authority.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said 42Panamanians were flown to Miami and admitted on humanitariangrounds. Some are relatives of Maj. Moises Giroldi, a top coupleader killed after the takeover failed, she said.   Giroldi's widow, Adela Bonilla Giroldi, was conspicuously absentMonday from her husband's funeral in Panama City.   The Washington Post reported that those given refuge alsoincluded Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-rankingparticipant in the coup to escape capture, and Capt. FranciscoAlvarez, who was arrested and jailed last year for taking part in afailed 1988 plot against Noriega.   Alvarez was said to have been released from jail three weeks ago.   Ms. Tutwiler said the Panamanians are being received by the U.S.Catholic Conference and ``the U.S. Immigration and NaturalizationService is prepared to review aplications for political asylum ifsuch requests are made.''   Meanwhile, Fitzwater continued to defend the U.S. role and thedecision not to send in U.S. military forces to help deposePanamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void ofinformation, the spokesman said Bush ``had plenty of information,he made the decision that he thought was best and the decision westill think is right. We don't have any questioning about thecorrectness of that decision.''   Fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaintsabout congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularlyin Panama.   Saying that Bush wants a good relationship with Congress, hesaid, ``We don't have any specific complaints.''   Asked if the United States was planning additional economicsanctions against Panama to increase pressure on Noriega, Fitzwatersaid, ``We don't have any plan'' to do that.   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a review of theevents during the coup now reveals that there was ``confusion'' anddissension among the coup plotters, and that there was someargument about what to do with Noriega.   Williams said it is now clear that Giroldi, the coup leader,``had no intention, ever,'' of turning Noriega over to the UnitedStates and that an officer who wanted to turn Noriega over to theUnited States argued with Giroldi about it.   The spokesman declined to identify the officer or say where heis now.   Williams said the officer was one of those who met later withMaj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, second in command of the U.S. forces inthe area.   But Williams said he could not say whether that officer madeclear to Cisneros that there was a dissident faction among thePanamanian officers who wanted to turn Noriega over.   The Pentagon spokesman said it isn't entirely clear to whatextent the people claiming to hold Noriega really had him undertheir control.   ``You have someone who was one of the coup plotters, saying,`Well we ought to (turn Noriega over to the United States).' Hedoesn't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates (to the UnitedStates) that the people holding General Noriega still have nointention of turning him over to the United States,'' Williams said.   ``There was never a request for us to come and get him, theynever offered him to us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
