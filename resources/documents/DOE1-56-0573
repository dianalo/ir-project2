<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0573 </DOCNO><TEXT>A systematic investigation of the thermal behaviour of an assembled purerare earth cobalt SmCo/sub 5/ (REC) structure as used in undulators andwigglers is presented. The irreversible losses of magnetization of theblocks were measured as a function of temperature up to 160/sup 0/C.The program included different magnetic states of the magnets, i.e. largegap, small gap (6 mm) and for comparison also single blocks. Significantdifferences were observed. An interpretation of the data in terms ofdifferent working point conditions of the magnet materials is given.Also the effect of the magnetic moment losses on the BESSY electron beamis estimated. We conclude that annealing temperatures of the assembledmagnet structure should not exceed 100/sup 0/C.</TEXT></DOC>
