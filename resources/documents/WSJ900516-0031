The maneuvering appears to be part of an effort to strikea legislative alliance with the powerful chairman. It alsoreflects Budget Director Richard Darman's penchant forpork-barrel politics even as he argues for a line-item vetoto reduce the deficit. The proposed facility -- a nationalfingerprint repository for the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation -- could cost at least twice the initial $185million inserted by Mr. Byrd. In remarks early this month,Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made reference to the itemas a example of how Congress adds unrequested appropriationsto spending bills.</LP><TEXT>   Though state and local police forces have lobbied for afingerprint facility, no money was requested by theadministration in either the current supplemental 1990spending bill of more than $3.3 billion or the FBI's budgetfor fiscal 1991, beginning Oct. 1. In a letter this month tothe House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Darman listed theByrd amendment among the many &quot;unrequested provisions&quot; addingto discretionary spending. But his office has now sanctionedan appeal by FBI Director William Sessions for the money.   Mr. Sessions, artfully choosing his words, describes theitem as an &quot;emergency supplemental&quot; to avoid &quot;the direconsequences of a lack of one central system.&quot; The letter wascleared with the Office of Management and Budget andsubstantially strengthens Mr. Byrd's position as talks resumetoday with the House on the underlying bill.   The Central America funding -- $420 million for Panama and$300 million for Nicaragua -- isn't in dispute. But a majorquestion is whether the appropriations panels will attachnecessary legislative waivers sought by the State Departmentso the money can be quickly distributed. President Bushpersonally telephoned House Speaker Thomas Foley this week,but House liberals have balked at releasing the CentralAmerica funds until the administration agrees to imposeconditions on separate military aid to El Salvador.   Mr. Foley signaled a willingness yesterday to movesubstantially toward the administration's position, but hemay have conceded more than many Democrats are prepared toaccept. The question could be tested in a floor fight asearly as tomorrow and -- whatever alliances are struck withMr. Byrd in the appropriations negotiations -- a finalarbiter is House Rules Committee Chairman Joseph Moakley, whocan slow the Panama and Nicaragua funding if no agreement isreached on El Salvador. &quot;They will still have to come to me,&quot;said the Massachusetts Democrat.</TEXT></DOC>
