Prices fell Thursday for the third consecutive day,dimming hopes that the market would recover from this month'sslide. The Nikkei 225-stock index fell 638.71 points, or2.82%, to 21991.19. Since Tuesday, the average has lost845.48 points, after gaining 1333.77 in the preceding threetrading days. Volume was estimated at 200 million shares,little changed from 203.5 million Wednesday. Declinersoutnumbered advancers 926-81, with 103 issues unchanged. Inearly trading Friday, the Nikkei was up 134.91 to 22126.10.The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,which fell 14.77 points Wednesday, skidded 35.75, or 2.1%, to1668.26. In early trading Friday, the index was up 1.12points to 1,669.38.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said the drop stemmed largely from a decisionTuesday by Japanese regulators to raise margin requirementsto 30% from 25% on the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya exchanges fortrading stock futures and options. The prospect of thatmove's damping activity in the futures market sparked asell-off that was then felt in the underlying stock market.   &quot;There's been a lot of negative impact from the newrequirement on futures and options,&quot; said Shigeru Akiba,director of yen equity trading at UBS Phillips andamp; DrewInternational. &quot;I don't know why they wanted to do this.&quot;   Traders said Thursday's expiration of the Decemberstock-index options contract added to the bearish sentiment,and the expiration of futures and options contracts in NewYork Friday is expected to lend an air of caution to tradingin Tokyo.   In addition, the Tokyo market remains hampered by a pooroutlook for corporate profits in the 1992 first quarter, saidKathy Matsui, investment strategist at Barclays de Zoete WeddSecurities (Japan). &quot;Nobody sees a bottom for profits yet,&quot;she said. &quot;It doesn't look good {in the} short term.&quot;   Even the holidays are unwelcome. Volume is expected toremain scant until the Tokyo market reopens Jan. 6, after itsDec. 31-Jan. 3 New Year holiday. Markets also will be closedhere Monday, and foreign investors, recently important buyersof Japanese equities, will probably be absent during theChristmas holiday next week.   European bourses were gloomy, too, as the German centralbank decided to raise its benchmark lending rates.   The Bundesbank's move worsened the sour sentiment inLondon, already depressed by Tokyo's fall and worries aboutthe U.S. economy in the absence of any good economic orcorporate news. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex lost 22.0 points to 2391.6. The FT 30-stock indexslumped 19.0 points, or 1%, to 1814.7. Volume was 815.3million shares, compared with 662.4 million a day earlier.   A computer-driven sell program of 75 million shares atmidday also hammered the London market. With the German raterise, few London investors had any reasons to turn toequities, citing a blow to consumer confidence that coulddelay a consumer-led recovery of Britain's economy far intonext year. The German move followed release of more poorBritish data on unemployment, individual earnings andmanufacturing, also increasing the risk of that countryraising interest rates. Wall Street's early soggyperformance, bad prospects for British dividend growth and abrokerage firm's decision to wipe all retail issues off its&quot;buy&quot; list all added to London's bearishness.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index fell 11.98 points to1561.77 in listless trading. Most blue-chips declined, partlybecause of short-covering on the German Futures and OptionsExchange ahead of the DAX futures and options expirationsFriday. Stocks weren't affected by the German central bank'srate-boost decision, announced after the market closed,though participants welcomed the Bundesbank's tightermonetary policy to check inflation and provide for ahealthier economic recovery next year that would benefitequities.   But the rate action depressed other European stocks. Itsocked Stockholm prices further after a weak opening, andSwedish equities fell sharply in heavy trading. Amsterdamshares' broad drop also was attributed to fears of higherinterest rates. Paris equities lost heavily on concern thatFrance will have to raise its rates or see its currencyweaken. Zurich shares' slide also was blamed on the Germandecision. Madrid stocks ended lower for the fourthconsecutive session. Milan shares dropped on apprehensionabout a faltering U.S. economic recovery. Separately, Italy'sConsob stock market regulatory agency revoked a ban imposedNov. 18 on short-selling of all shares traded on the Milanexchange.   Across Asian and Pacific bourses, stocks put in a mixedperformance in light activity, as many professional investorshave discontinued activities for the year. Sydney shares roseahead of a ballot for the Australian prime minister's office,though prices retreated from highs on worse-than-expectedlocal housing data and the Tokyo bourse's poor showing.Wellington share prices gained broadly as weakness in the NewZealand dollar encouraged support for export-related issuesand other stocks that derive significant income fromoverseas.   Among corporate developments, in Tokyo, Kobe Steel fell 9yen, or 2.1%, to 415 yen ($3.23), amid a continuing marketretreat by steel shares. Kobe unveiled medium-term andlong-term business plans, featuring a sharp expansion of anew division including information electronics and factoryautomation and robotics. Kobe forecast unconsolidated pretaxprofit of 118 billion yen ($919.7 million) in the year endingMarch 31, 1994, more than doubling from 58 billion yenexpected in the year ending next March 31; it predictedparent company sales of 1.67 trillion yen, compared with1.325 trillion yen. In the long-term plan for the year 2000,the company predicted 189 billion yen in unconsolidatedpretax profit and 2.1 trillion yen in sales. Kobe, which hasdiversified into aluminum and machinery operations, willcontinue its restructuring, expanding non-steel lines whilereducing its dependency on steel.   In Frankfurt, Degussa rose 2.80 marks, or 1%, to 280.50marks ($178.71). The chemical company's group pretax profitfor the year ended Sept. 30 plunged 44% to 179 million marks($114 million) on a 4.1% drop in sales to 13.35 billionmarks. But the earnings drop wasn't as steep as some analystshad expected. The company also outlined measures to cutcosts.   In Paris, Source Perrier jumped 36 French francs, or 2.8%,to 1,304 francs ($243.13). The stock raced up on the Frenchbourse regulators' ruling that Exor, Geneval and Omincotogether control more than 33.3% of the mineral water andcheese group through a 1987 agreement, obliging them to filea takeover bid for the rest of Perrier.
