People are scrutinizing the record $25 billion leveraged buyoutof RJR Nabisco to see whether the heavy debts involved in thistrendy form of takeover will hurt companies' spending on newtechnology.   Oreos look simple enough, but getting them to screw apart thesame way every time takes advanced engineering and ovens. In theknowledge economy, technology is built invisibly into the mostunlikely products, from Ritz Bits to Salem Slims Lights, which comein an eye-catching, beveled box.   Shortly before the RJR Nabisco battle, the company toldstockholders it had upped research and development spending by 19percent. It called technology the cornerstone of future growth.   Since the buyout led by the New York investment firm KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., RJR's new management says it remains committedto research and development but won't say what changes, if any, willbe made.   Randamp;D is less important in RJR Nabisco's businesses than in, say,computers or pharmaceuticals. Food and tobacco are two of thelowest-ranking industries in terms of Randamp;D as a percentage of sales,according to Business Week's Randamp;D Scoreboard last year.   Still, analysts say, a stunted Randamp;D program could stop the companyfrom creating a successful smokeless cigarette, a fat-free frozendinner, or crumble-proof packaging for cookies.   So far, there's little hard evidence to document the effect ofbig buyouts on research. Contributing to the dearth of informationis that companies involved in large LBOs tend to go private, andfinancial figures become scarce.   But there is a growing perception that companies cut back onresearch immediately after a leveraged buyout. If that's so,debt-financed megadeals could have a big impact on the knowledgeeconomy.   ``What's happening in LBOs is that they take on pretty extensivedebt. In the short term they have to make cuts,'' said Fred Allvine,a professor in the College of Management at Georgia Institute ofTechnology.   ``Very often, they try to cut the fat out of personnel. Then theylook at research and development _ the benefits are hard to measure.It's one of the intangibles they cut back because LBOs have to beconcerned with payback in the short run.''   RJR Nabisco spokeswoman Polly Howes said research is ``continuingto function. There are new products to develop and improvements tomake. But to speculate on what will happen is premature.''   The company has major research centers at its Nabisco BrandsInc., Del Monte Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. divisions.   In its 1987 annual report to shareholders, RJR Nabisco calledresearch and development essential to the future of the company andsaid it had spent $204 million on it in 1987. No figures areavailable for 1988.   Much of RJR Nabisco's recent research and development has been inplant modernization. It also sank about $200 million into thedevelopment of Premier, the so-called smokeless cigarette thatbombed in test marketing last year. The company has said it willkeep working on a smokeless cigarette.   The Brookings Institution, the National Science Foundation, theUniversity of California at Berkeley and the University of Chicagoare among the institutions that have conducted studies looking atleveraged buyouts.   ``Legitimate economists are all over the map on this,'' saidMargaret Blair, senior research analyst at Brookings in Washington.   A NSF study said growth in corporate research and developmentspending has ``all but disappeared'' in the last five years. Theincrease in leveraged buyouts has been a major reason, the studysaid.   It found a 12.8 percent decline in research and developmentspending in companies involved in leveraged buyouts. But MelissaPollock of the NSF cautioned against sweeping assumptions based onthe study, noting it looked only at eight small deals for one year,not enough for definitive conclusions.   A study of leveraged buyouts released earlier this year byKohlberg Kravis disputed the notion that research suffers. But thestudy also said buyouts should not involve companies that require aheavy research investment.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
