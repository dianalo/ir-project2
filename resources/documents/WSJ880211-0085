Senator Jesse Helms, former NATO Cmdr. Bernard Rogers and Henry Kissinger keep raising doubts about its strategic value. George Bush's stumble in Iowa raises doubts about its political value. The West Germans showed at last weekend's Wehrkunde conference that INF has only increased their domestic political pressure to edge away from NATO. Can anyone recall any arguments for this treaty?    And now even the Democrats are acting up. The pas de deux danced the past week by Secretary of State Shultz and Senator Sam Nunn has been dreadful political ballet, with the Reagan administration discovering what happens when you choose to dance with your political enemies. The price Senate Democrats such as Mr. Nunn and Joe Biden want for INF ratification is further diminishment of executive power over foreign and defense policy. Mr. Shultz at least seems happy to pay the first installment. Predictably, the final bill will be dismemberment of the President's strategic defense initiative.    The latest dispute concerns Senator Nunn's demand that the administration agree to an expanded Senate role in interpreting and implementing treaties. Mr. Nunn thought Mr. Shultz had agreed to his demands, but the secretary of state reneged after Senate Republicans complained that they were both unconstitutional and a raw grab for power. Mr. Nunn retaliated by threatening to hold up INF until he had reviewed every little piece of the mile-high negotiating record. Mr. Shultz finally cried uncle in a letter to Mr. Nunn Tuesday night. Yesterday in Paris Mr. Nunn issued a victory statement.    Mr. Nunn's demands go well beyond any Senate role imagined in the Constitution. &quot;Advise and consent&quot; has always meant the Senate has the right to reject or ratify the text of a treaty negotiated by the executive, but Mr. Nunn is demanding that any future interpretation that conflicts with Senate testimony &quot;cannot be adopted without the approval of the Senate.&quot; In effect, Mr. Nunn wants the administration to negotiate two treaties -- one with the Soviets, and one with the Senate Democrats. Never mind that the Soviets would be bound only by the formal treaty.    Senate Republicans are understandably furious. As Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter, no enemy of arms control, put it in a letter to Mr. Shultz this Monday: &quot;Under international law, only those limited materials in the INF negotiating record which were exchanged between the two sides {the U.S. and the Soviet Union} are admissible as evidence of the Treaty's meaning. The bulk of the INF record -- U.S. materials never provided to the Soviets -- cannot illuminate the obligations to which we and the Soviets are bound.&quot;    Mr. Nunn's objective is not to bind the Soviets, of course, but to bind the executive branch. His real target isn't the INF treaty; it's that old dispute over how to interpret the 1972 ABM treaty. Mr. Nunn wants to get an administration commitment on INF interpretation so he can wave it as proof that his own &quot;narrow&quot; ABM interpretation is correct. The real mystery here is why the Reagan administration would want to help Mr. Nunn achieve his goals. With his Tuesday letter, Secretary Shultz gave Mr. Nunn the ammo to attack his legal adviser Abraham Sofaer, who argued for the &quot;broad&quot; ABM meaning.    The whole point of the Democrats' defense of the narrow interpretation is to stop space tests for SDI. In the ABM treaty, the U.S. negotiators wanted to outlaw missile defense and lock both sides into the posture of mutual assured destruction. They claimed they succeeded in this objective, but Judge Sofaer says the record shows the Soviets never agreed to it; if they didn't, why should we?    In trying to appease Mr. Nunn the administration may not even have bought off all of the Democrats. Senator Biden has declared he'll attempt to go further than Mr. Nunn and seek to attach a formal &quot;condition&quot; to the treaty that would affirm the Senate's power to make executive testimony on the treaty binding. We wonder how many Senate Republicans, ignored by the White House in this dispute, will now lift a hand to fight this &quot;killer amendment.&quot;    It's natural that treaty debates should be political, because even a treaty as modest as INF raises serious issues about the national interest. Messrs. Nunn and Biden, however, don't give a hoot about INF substance; all they want is to beat up the administration and sap executive authority so they can have their own way on any issue they please. With the Reagan administration so willing to give in, perhaps George Shultz should now negotiate a START agreement with Sam Nunn before he sits down with the Soviets. </TEXT></DOC>
