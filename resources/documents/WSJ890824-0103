The suit also alleges that, in some cases, Exxon's activities have worsened the environmental damage.    Unlike the more than 150 lawsuits already filed against Exxon in connection with the March 24 Exxon Valdez super-tanker oil spill, the latest suit doesn't seek monetary damages but attempts to transfer control over the cleanup from Exxon to a court. The action follows a suit this month by the National Wildlife Federation that seeks to require Exxon to establish an independent fund to pay for studies of environmental effects of the spill.    A spokesman for Exxon withheld comment, saying the company hadn't yet seen the latest suit.    The environmentalists' suit is part of a larger effort to press Exxon into more vigorous actions as the onset of winter next month in Alaska threatens to bring cleanup activities to a halt. Exxon contends that rough winter weather makes cleanup attempts too hazardous. But the company has said it will keep a small force in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska to help protect fish hatcheries from drifting oil.    Besides Trustees for Alaska, plaintiffs in the suit include Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, National Audubon Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Greenpeace U.S.A. </TEXT></DOC>
