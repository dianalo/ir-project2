In a report submitted to the congressional Joint EconomicCommittee, the CIA predicted that China's surplus with theU.S. could rise to $12 billion this year from $10.4 billionin 1990, despite Beijing's promises to ease import restraintsand buy more U.S. products. The report also said the CIAdetected &quot;little appetite&quot; for economic reform in Chinadespite the Bush administration's efforts to encourageBeijing to return to its freer trade policies of the early1980s.</LP><TEXT>   This assessment is certain to fan congressional oppositionto extending China's most-favored-nation statusunconditionally. Many lawmakers already object to continuingChina's favorable trade status because of the country'ssuppression of its domestic-democracy advocates and becauseof its role as arms supplier to unstable regimes around theworld.   Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D, N.M.), who chaired a jointcommitteee hearing Friday, complained that the U.S. seems tobe &quot;totally helpless&quot; in getting China to pursue free trade.&quot;It looks like the United States is one of the biggest chumpsin the Western world,&quot; he said.   The U.S. now absorbs nearly a quarter of all Chineseexports, but other nations also are feeling Beijing's exportsurge. The CIA reported that China's trade surplus with theEuropean Community more than doubled to $4.9 billion lastyear, while its trade surplus with Japan rose at almost thesame rate, to $5.2 billion. In response to Tokyo's complaintsabout this imbalanced trade, the Chinese have promised tomore than double their purchases of Japanese steel in thesecond half of 1991.   The CIA foresees China's import policies vacillatingbetween &quot;periods of liberalization and tight centralcontrol.&quot; Even if Beijing yields to demands that it buy moreforeign goods, it is likely to continue discouraging importsof luxury goods or of other products that can be supplieddomestically, the agency said.   China trade surplus is swelling partly because of theapparent shift of light manufacturing capacity from Taiwanand Hong Kong to the mainland, the agency said. ScuttlingChina's most-favored-nation status would thus hurt a numberof Taiwanese and Hong Kong investors, in addition to Chineseworkers.</TEXT></DOC>
