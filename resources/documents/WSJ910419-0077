The 56-year-old Mr. Leslie is the co-founder of Leslie'sPoolmart Inc. and a driving force that helped turn thesupplier of pool products into a $50-million-a-yearenterprise. Now he's trying to destroy the company.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I have vowed to make them go belly up,&quot; says Mr. Leslie.With that aim in mind, he is building a new pool-supplycompany, complete with dozens of former Poolmart employeesand a business strategy that draws a big bullseye over hisformer firm.   Poolmart officials counter that the company has been doingjust fine since Mr. Leslie was ousted as part of a leveragedbuy-out in 1988. They decline to comment in detail because ofa pending initial public offering.   The story of Mr. Leslie's falling out with the firm thatstill bears his name is, in many ways, the stuff ofentrepreneurial nightmares, a dispute that illustrates justhow sour a partnership can go and how much of a role emotioncan play in business decisions.   In 1963, Mr. Leslie and his partner, Raymond Cesmat,scraped together $3,000 and founded Leslie's Poolmart. Aftera decade of ups and downs, the company &quot;started making moneyhand over fist,&quot; Mr. Leslie says. By the mid-1980s, he says,he was paying himself a salary of some $500,000 a year, plusplenty of perks.   Then marital discord entered the picture. As part of adivorce proceeding, Mr. Cesmat decided he needed to sell hisinterest in the company. Mr. Leslie was interested in buyingbut the two partners couldn't agree on a price.   In 1987, Mr. Cesmat filed a petition to dissolve thecorporation, which as a 50% owner, he was allowed to do underCalifornia law. The court appointed a temporary thirddirector -- along with Messrs. Leslie and Cesmat -- andpossible outside buyers were contacted.   When prospective buyers visited, &quot;I'd tell them that ifthey bought the company, I'd go into business against themand pulverize them,&quot; Mr. Leslie recalls. &quot;I built thiscompany and I wasn't going to see anybody else get hold ofit.&quot;   That cost the partners millions of dollars in the eventualsale, Mr. Cesmat says bitterly. Given Mr. Leslie's threats,&quot;there wasn't any way to sell the operation for top dollar,&quot;says Mr. Cesmat, who stayed on as consultant with the companyafter the leveraged buy-out.   Dozens of employees, including most of the seniormanagement at the 500-person-firm, threatened to quit if Mr.Leslie wasn't around. &quot;Over the years, he was loyal to us sowe wanted to be loyal to him,&quot; says Benjamin Vasquez, whojoined Poolmart in 1968.   Matters came to a head in May 1988, when Mr. Cesmat andthe interim director turned over management of the company toan investment group that eventually purchased Poolmart'sstock from the two owners for about $17.5 million. Mr.Leslie, still fighting the sale, was fired as chairman andchief executive. That same evening the new management,accompanied by security guards, took over the headquartersbuilding in nearby Chatsworth.   Word of Mr. Leslie's ouster spread quickly. The next dayhundreds of employees stayed off the job, effectivelyshutting down much of the company. Workers even picketedcompany stores, demanding Mr. Leslie's return.   Meanwhile, Mr. Leslie was on the phone giving companysuppliers his opinion of the new management. &quot;I told them Ididn't think there was any way these clowns could run thecompany,&quot; recalls Mr. Leslie, though he concedes he probablyused stronger language at the time.   Each day, in a ritual that lasted seven months, supportersof Mr. Leslie met at his house to help in a fight to win backthe company. Some worked on a contingency plan to start a newcompany.   &quot;It was a very traumatic time,&quot; recalls Patrick Coskran,one of Mr. Leslie's supporters. Besides being out of work,Mr. Leslie and his supporters were slapped with a $45 millionlawsuit by the new management for their role in the walkoutthat partially closed the company for several weeks.   Even with some out-of-pocket help from Mr. Leslie, manyemployees had to dig into savings and retirement accounts tosupport themselves, Mr. Coskran says. But Mr. Leslie promisedthey would eventually have jobs, either at Poolmart or a newcompany. &quot;So we decided we were going to see this thingthrough with Phil,&quot; says Herbert Inouye, another official whowalked.   At the end of 1988, the company settled its litigationagainst Mr. Leslie and the workers in return for his droppinghis fight against the sale. Mr. Leslie also was paid about $1million less for his share in the company than had beenoffered previously.   Mr. Leslie then immediately launched his next attack onPoolmart in the marketplace. From his share of the saleproceeds, he gave about $600,000 in back pay to the workerswho had stuck with him. He offered two dozen of them jobs atSandy's Pool Supply Inc., in which he had just bought a 50%interest. The number of former Poolmart employees at Sandy'snow stands at over 40, he says.   As chief executive, Mr. Leslie has expanded Sandy's to 21stores from three. Most of the outlets are near enough toPoolmart stores to be direct competitors, Mr. Leslie says. Hesays he's also in the process of throwing his old company outof three locations where he owns the buildings.   He started a competing mail-order business at Sandy's. Heconvinced Poolmart to withdraw a lawsuit claiming he hadfilched part of its mailing list. Mr. Leslie has even tried-- unsuccessfully -- to interest local regulators ininvestigating Poolmart for possible health and safetyviolations. Poolmart officials angrily insist there isnothing to investigate.   But Mr. Leslie hopes every little bit hurts. He assertshis efforts have pushed down margins at some Poolmart storesand cut into its mail-order business.   In 1987, Mr. Leslie's last full year with the company,Poolmart had net income of $2.3 million on sales of $57million. But burdened by the work stoppage and the new LBOdebt, Poolmart racked up a total of $6.5 million in losses inthe following two years. Last year, however, it showed a$35,000 profit on sales of $73 million. And results couldimprove markedly if the company successfully completes thepending public stock offering to raise at least $15 millionto retire most of the LBO debt.   In its offering circular, Poolmart, which operates over 90stores, says it doesn't expect Mr. Leslie to renew its storeleases on the buildings he owns, but says adequate alternatesites are readily available. The document acknowledges Mr.Leslie's new company as one of a number of competitors, butdoesn't elaborate on what, if any, impact Sandy's is havingon Poolmart.   Poolmart clearly doesn't appreciate Mr. Leslie'sbad-mouthing the company during its stock sale. FrankDunlevy, a managing director of Montgomery Securities, leadunderwriter for the offering, tells a reporter, &quot;It's noaccident that Mr. Leslie is talking to you at this time.&quot;   True enough, says Mr. Leslie. It is one more opportunity&quot;to try to pound the daylights out of these guys,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
