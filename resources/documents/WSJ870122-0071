In its Fed application, the banking concern said it proposed to establish a separate subsidiary to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue securities, mortgage-related securities, consumer receivable-related securities and commercial paper.    Security Pacific said it believes the proposed activities are legal if done through a subsidiary mostly engaged in banking-related activities. It said the proposed activities wouldn't constitute more than 15% of the new unit's business.    Security Pacific said its application is similar to previous filings by Citicorp, Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. The Fed plans to hold hearings on the subject beginning Feb. 3, and Security Pacific said it will testify.    The Fed hopes to decide the Citicorp, Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan applications by April. </TEXT></DOC>
