In Polyconomics's study &quot;Mexico 2000,&quot; Icalculated that in 1988, Mexicans paid only 15% of the taxesthe law theoretically required them to pay; Mexican officialshave not challenged this estimate. That is quite differentfrom arguing that tax reforms would sextuple governmentrevenues; rather, the theoretical tax gap was so big becausemany tax rates were uncollectably high. This calculation is a&quot;reductio ad absurdum,&quot; not a forecast of future revenues.   Mexico's tax gap has narrowed considerably since then,through lower rates and higher collections. I believe thatrevenues would increase sharply through the tax reforms Mr.Asman discusses, but hardly by such a huge factor.</LP><TEXT>   David P. Goldman   Senior Economist   Polyconomics Inc.
