Occidental oil from the Alpha, Claymore and Scapa fields in theBritish sector of the North Sea had flowed through the huge Alphaplatform, which exploded in flames on July 6, 1988, and wasdestroyed.   The big oil company said last August that it hoped to resumeNorth Sea production by the end of the year. But it was not untilSaturday that it began pumping oil from the Scapa field through theClaymore platform at about 17,000 barrels per day, according to theannouncement Monday.   Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said production is expected toreach about 100,000 barrels per day later this year.   The company said it had installed underwater emergency shutdownvalves on all platforms leading to and from the Claymore platformand had taken other safety measures in accordance with industryguidelines issued by the United Kingdom Department of Energy.   Occidental has offered $187 million in compensation to thefamilies of the victims, but negotiations continue with theirattorneys.   Occidental's second-quarter earnings, announced last week, fellto $26 million from $78 million in 1988, due in large part toexploration and production losses from the North Sea disaster.</TEXT></DOC>
