Relatives of the dead wailed and recited holy chants as rescuerslabored in the debris in Saturia, one of more than 20 smallvillages in central Bangladesh hit hard by the storm.

The tornado swept into the Manikganj area, 25 miles northwest ofDhaka, on Wednesday night, blowing away people, animals and houses.Another tornado reportedly hit the Narsingdi district, 25 mileseast of the capital, killing five people and injuring 500.   Saturia was perhaps the hardest hit.   ``The tornado swooped on the area like an elephant trunk andwithin minutes nothing except the dead and injured was left,'' saidFaruk Ahmed, a district official.

A group of wailing and sobbing people carried a body to a burialspot behind a crumbled building.   ``I was here during the devastating flood last year in whichmore than 20 persons had died. But I have not seen anything sodevastating as the tornado,'' Ahmed said.   In the nearby village of Tilli Char, at least 80 people, someseriously hurt, waited for medical attention outside a tin schoolshed being used as a hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
