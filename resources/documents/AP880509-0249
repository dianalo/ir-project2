The Tahiti I gives Maxtor an edge over other companies such asTandy Corp., Sony Corp., Sharp Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.'sVerbatim Corp. that are trying to use the laser technology ofcompact disks for storing computerized information, analysts said.   ``They have the most advanced product that's yet beenannounced,'' said Robert Katzive, vice president of Disk TrendInc., a market research firm based in Mountain View, Calif.   A high-capacity, erasable compact disk that works with theMaxtor player was announced by Philips and Du Pont Optical, a jointventure of Du Pont Co. and NV Philips of the Netherlands. Othercompanies will also supply disks.   The system was demonstrated Monday at the Comdex spring computertrade show in Atlanta.   Compact disks, although popular for music, have had troublecatching on in data storage because they could not be rewritten andit took much longer to find pieces of data stored on them.   Maxtor said its Tahiti I, which uses 5\-inch disks, could find apiece of data on a disk in an average of less than 30 thousandthsof a second. That makes it more than three times as fast as mostother compact disk drives and competitive with all but the fastestmagnetic hard-disk drives.   The Tahiti I can also erase and rewrite a disk many timeswithout causing deterioration.   Maxtor, based in San Jose, Calif., is a leader in thetraditional kind of data-storage devices, which use magnetic headsinstead of lasers to read and write information on disks. Compactdisks have the advantage of much greater storage capacity.   ``The whole industry is going to watch to see if in fact theyare on time on that (September delivery date),'' Katzive said.``But people who have discounted Maxtor in the past have eventuallyregretted it.''   Maxtor said its Tahiti I would sell wholesale for about $2,500.A smaller and slower model, the Fiji I, uses 3{-inch disks and willsell wholesale for under $1,000, Maxtor said.   Maxtor said the technology for the Fiji I was jointly developedwith another company, which it did not name. Disks for that devicewill be supplied by Seiko-Epson and other companies.   More than 50 computer companies planned product announcementsduring the four-day Comdex trade show that opened in AtlantaMonday. The event will draw about 60,000 visitors to the massiveGeorgia World Congress Center and the nearby Atlanta Apparel Mart,where more than 850 manufacturers will be pushing their wares _hard and soft.   Attention at the show was expected to focus on clones ofInternational Business Machine Corp.'s Personal System-2 computer.   Tandy Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. already have announced theirPS-2 clones, and those and others were expected to be on display.</TEXT></DOC>
