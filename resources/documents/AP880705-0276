Rewritable laser disks are considered part of the future of thecomputer business. They are close cousins of the compact disks usedfor music, except they are set up for computer information and canbe erased and written on repeatedly.   The system assembled by New York-based Advanced GraphicApplications Inc. is the first of its kind on the U.S. market, saidEd Rothchild, chairman of Rothchild Associates, a SanFrancisco-based consulting firm.   Advanced Graphic Applications, which buys the components fromother companies, wrote software that allows the data-storagedevices to be connected easily to personal computers using thepopular MS-DOS operating system.   ``It's significant that they're offering a plug-and-playsolution,'' Rothchild said. But, he added, ``They will have lots ofcompetitors.''   For now, the 40-employee company has a jump on companies such asSony Corp., Maxtor Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.'s Verbatim unit,which have not put together complete systems that are ready forsale.   Sharp Corp. announced a complete system in December, but onlyfor the Japanese market, Rothchild said. He said some companies maybe hanging back, waiting to see what industry standards develop.   Rewritable laser disks are capable of storing 650 megabytes ofdata, or nearly 300,000 typewritten pages of information, which ismany times more than can be held on fixed hard disks. Moreover,unlike hard disks they can be taken out and used in other computers.   The laser disk drives already on the market, led byInternational Business Machines Corp.'s top-selling model, canwrite information once but cannot erase and rewrite. IBM's model ismade for it by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.   The disk drive in the new Discus Rewritable system is made byOlympus Corp. of Japan and the disks themselves are made byMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.   Advanced Graphic Applications said it was taking orders on the$4,995 system for November delivery.</TEXT></DOC>
