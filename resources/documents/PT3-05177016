J. Cancer 42:798-802, 1988. </PAR><PAR>  The production of monoclonal antibodies against drugs, such as Doxorubicin      and generally other anti-tumour anthracyclines, which are able to      interfere with the immune system, turned out to be difficult, requiring      the introduction of innovative procedures in the immunization process of      the animals used as splenocyte source. </PAR><PAR>  Particularly, it has been noticed that only resorting to a short      immunization cycle and only in animals that were also subjected to another      antigenic stimulus it is possible to induce the formation of splenocytes      which can be fused to give monoclonal antibodies against Doxorubicin and      Doxorubicin derivatives. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-mentioned paper published in Int. J. Cancer the main features      of a monoclonal antibody, abbreviated as MAD2, exhibiting a different      affinity degree against several anthracycline derivatives, the highest      affinity being anyway noticed against Doxorubicinol, a Doxorubicin      metabolite, and Doxorubicin itself, are described in detail. </PAR><PAR>  The availability of a monoclonal antibody recognizing different epitopes on      the anthracycline molecule would allow the development of analytical      methods for a whole class of substances and, moreover, would constitute a      useful tool for the study of drug-receptor interactions, also including      phenomena occurring as toxic or unwanted effects. </PAR><PAR>  Said problems have been solved by the monoclonal antibody of the present      invention, secreted by the hybridoma deposited at European Collection of      Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC), PHLS Centre for Applied Microbiology andamp;      Research, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wilts, SP4, 0JG, U.K., on Jan. 10th,      1990, under accession number 90011003. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAR>  The antibody object of the invention, hereinafter also named with the      abbreviation MAD11, which can be prepared with the same somatic      hybridization already described for MAD2 antibody, is able to recognize      different antigenic determinants, particularly the one located at the      positions C.sub.4 -C.sub.5 of the anthracyclinone residue, in contrast to      the hitherto described antibody (MAD2) which recognizes the determinant      constituted by positions C.sub.9 -C.sub.11 of the Doxorubicin molecule,      whose structural formula with relative numeration is hereinbelow reported:      ##STR1## </PAR><PAR>  The ring D, which is 4-methoxy substituted, is a constant characteristic of      almost all well-known anthracycline derivatives and this explains the wide      recognition spectrum of the antibody of the invention. As already      mentioned, such characteristic is advantageous for the above-mentioned      aims. </PAR><PAR>  The cross reactivity of MAD 11 was evaluated by inhibition tests,      incubating (1 hour at 37.degree. C.) a constant amount of antibody with      different amounts of compounds structurally related to Doxorubicin. Then,      the samples were incubated for 45 minutes at 37.degree. C. in Doxorubicin      coated wells and the binding was evaluated by adding .sup.125      I-radiolabelled mouse anti-Ig antibodies (Amersham Lab.). The curves,      calculated as the mean value of at least 3 tests, resulted superimposable      for Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, Doxorubicinol, 5-imino-Doxorubicin,      11-deoxy-Daunorubicin, 4'-epi-Doxorubicin and 4'-deoxy-Doxorubicin.      Instead it was noticed a substantially different inhibition behaviour for      two compounds lacking of the 4-methoxy groups, namely Daunosamin and      4-demethoxy-Daunorubicin. </PAR><PAR>  The antibody of the invention may be prepared according to the known      procedure previously described for MAD 2 antibody. </PAR><PAR>  50 .mu.g of Doxorubicin-Bovine-Serum-Albumine (BSA) conjugate emulsified      with complete Freund's adjuvant were injected in BALB/c mice, (previously      conditioned by an unrelated antigen), at day 0 and 15 by subcutaneous      route. On day 25, (i.e. three days before the fusion) a third      administration of the conjugate at the same dose was carried out      intra-peritoneally. </PAR><PAR>  Cell fusion was accomplished using immunized spleen cells and mouse myeloma      P.sub.3/ NSO cells with 40% (v/v) polyethylene glycol Mr 1000 (Merck,      Darmstadt, West Germany). </PAR><PAR>  Growing hybridomas were tested for immunoglobulin production using      immunofluorescence (IF) assay as reported in Cancer Res. 43:1295-1300,      1983. The Ig containing supernatants were screened for anti-Doxorubicin      antibody by a RIA technique on 96-well plates seeded with 50 .mu.l/well of      Doxorubicin (2.5.times.10.sup.-6 M) or BSA as negative controls, diluted      in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) (PBS)      supplemented with Tween 20 (0.05%) was used as diluting and washing      buffer. </PAR><PAR>  The antibodies producing hybridomas which reacted with Doxorubicin but not      with BSA alone were cloned by the method of limiting dilution and      subsequently expanded in BALB/c mice primed with pristane      (tetramethylpentadecane). </PAR><PAR>  The antibody isolated from hybridoma N. 90011003 was purified by affinity      chromatography on a Protein-A-Sepharose CL4B (Pharmacia) column as      described by EY et al (Immunochem. 15, 429-436, 1978). </PAR><PAR>  The antibody, eluted at pH 5.5, after dialysis against PBS was subjected to      radiolabelling by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination. 1 mCi CiNa.sup.125      I (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, UK), 24 .mu.g of      lactoperoxidase (Calbiochem, Behring, La Jolla, Calif.) and 8 .mu.l of      0.03% H.sub.2 O.sub.2 were added to 50 .mu.g of monoclonal antibody. After      10 minutes at room temperature the reaction was stopped by desalting the      mixture on a Bio Gel Pg column (Bio Rad, Richmond, Calif.). </PAR><PAR>  The labelled antibody was titrated by serial dilution (10.sup.6 to 7800      cpm/well) on Doxorubicin coated wells, incubating for 3 hours at 4.degree.      C. </PAR><PAR>  An affinity value of the antibody of 1.7.times.10.sup.-8 M.sup.-1, was      obtained by scatchard analysis. </PAR><PAR>  The antibody MAD 11 was shown to belong to the IgG2 class unlike the      antibody MAD2 which belongs to the IgG1 class, as resulted from direct      immunofluorescence assay on hybridoma cells. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
