<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0795 </DOCNO><TEXT>A shielding analysis for next generation of fusion devices (ETR/INTOR)was performed to study the dose equivalent outside the reactor buildingduring operation including the contribution from neutrons and photonsscattered back by collisions with air nuclei (skyshine component). Twodifferent three-dimensional geometrical models for a tokamak fusion reactorbased on INTOR design parameters were developed for this study. In thefirst geometrical model, the reactor geometry and the spatial distributionof the deuterium-tritium neutron source were simplified for a parametricsurvey. The second geometrical model employed an explicit representationof the toroidal geometry of the reactor chamber and the spatial distributionof the neutron source. The MCNP general Monte Carlo code for neutronand photon transport was used to perform all the calculations. The energydistribution of the neutron source was used explicitly in the calculationswith ENDF/B-V data. The dose equivalent results were analyzed as a functionof the concrete roof thickness of the reactor building and the locationoutside the reactor building.</TEXT></DOC>
