Groups of young men blocked pedestrians and busloads of workersfrom reporting to their jobs in Stepanakert, the main city of theNagorno-Karabakh region, the government newspaper Izvestiareported. It said authorities used mobile loudspeakers and leafletsto urge an end to the strike.   The state-controlled media said the ethnic unrest was damagingthe region's economy.   About three-quarters of the 157,000 residents ofNagorno-Karabakh, which has been part of neighboring Azerbaijansince 1923, are ethnic Armenians.   The official radio in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, said``extremely fanatical elements'' incited disturbances Saturdayevening in Nagorno-Karabakh.   It did not describe the disturbances or say exactly where theyoccurred in the disputed territory. The British Broadcasting Corp.monitored the broadcast in London.   Sporadic strikes and protests have been reported inNagorno-Karabakh since Feb. 13. The latest labor trouble is said tohave begun Wednesday after Moscow refused Armenian demands to annexthe region, about the size of Delaware.   In a telephone conversation, the manager of Stepanakert's onlyhotel, the Karabakh, said all but essential services were halted.   ``The bread and milk plants are working. The others are not.Everyone is sitting at home,'' he said.   About 30 percent of public transport was shut down inStepanakert, a city of about 33,000, The manager reported. Hedescribed himself as an ethnic Armenian but would not give his name.   An Izvestia dispatch from Stepanakert said workers stayed awayfrom factories producing silk, shoes and electronic goods, studentsboycotted the teachers' college and mothers kept their childrenhome from kindergarten.   Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaijan, also werecaught up in the trouble, it said.   ``Ethnic Azeri workers arrived at the entrances to theirbusinesses but ... announced: Unless the Armenians come, we willnot work,'' Izvestia reported.   Communist Party officials in Stepanakert called workers toweekend meetings and urged them to resume their jobs, thegovernment paper said. Appeals distributed by leaflets andbroadcasts Monday said the city owed the government seven millionrubles ($11.2 million) in lost revenue.   The hotel manager said party meetings continued Monday. Hepredicted the strike would end Tuesday but Sergei Grigoryants, aMoscow human rights activist who is half Armenian, said it wasscheduled to run through Friday.   Pravda, the national party daily, said Monday the ``difficultstate of affairs'' in Nagorno-Karabakh had damaged the economy ofAzerbaijan as a whole.   Losses to the automotive and transport industries were theequivalent of about $2.4 million in February and March, and therailway industry lost about $120,000, the paper said.   It revealed little about how the money was lost but quoted arailway official in Azerbaijan as saying freight cars had not beenunloaded. The official, Garik Sarkisyan, said the situation was``thoroughly bad'' and ``loss of time and money has become theusual thing.''   There were no strikes or protests Monday in Yerevan, capital ofArmenia, according to an Armenian Interior Ministry official, ahotel executive and Armenian nationalist Hovik Vassilian, allinterviewed by telephone.   Izvestia said, however, that at least one Yerevan factory washaving trouble getting supplies from Sumgait, a city in Azerbaijanon the Caspian Sea north of Baku where at least 32 people werekilled in ethnic riots Feb. 28.   A van-assembly plant in Yerevan sent trucks to Sumgait for sidewindows but were not allowed into the city. Izvestia said. It didnot make clear who barred the truck or why.   Moscow dissidents in touch with Armenian sources over theweekend described Yerevan as ``a dead city.'' People stayed home toprotest a crackdown on demonstrations that had been planned forSaturday, they said.   On Wednesday, the government announced a plan for improvingsocial and economic conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, but it does notinclude annexation to Armenia.   On Monday, Pravda said the improvements hinge on whether thestrike ends.   ``Any most realistic and well-considered program cannot beimplemented if people do not come to feel a high personalresponsibility for the destiny and development of the area and donot get down to work,'' it said. ``The machine tools should notstay idle, railway cars should continue to be unloaded and fieldwork should go on.''</TEXT></DOC>
