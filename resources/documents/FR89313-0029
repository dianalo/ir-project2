L. No. 100-86,101 Stat. 552, 659. Title X of CEBA changes the existing laws with respectto the indorsement and payment of checks drawn on the United States Treasury.At present, Treasury checks may be negotiated at any time after they areissued. Under CEBA, Treasury is not required to pay a Treasury check issuedon or after the effective date of the legislation unless it is negotiatedto a financial institution within 12 months after the date of issuanceof the check. Treasury is not required to pay a Treasury check issued beforethe effective date of the legislation unless it is negotiated to a financialinstitution within 12 months after the effective date. The legislationprovides for the cancellation of Treasury checks which are outstandingfor more than one year.Title X of CEBA changes the existing laws concerning the filing of claimson account of Treasury checks. Under existing law, a claimant may bringa claim on a Treasury check for 6 years from the date of issuance. UnderCEBA, a claim is barred unless presented to the agency that authorizedthe issuance of the check within one year after the date of issuance ofthe check. Claims on checks issued before the effective date of the legislationmust be filed within one year after the effective date. The new law alsoreduces the time period during which Treasury may reclaim the amount ofa check which has been paid over a forged or unauthorized indorsement.Congress provided that the amendments contained in Sections 1002, 1003,and 1004 of Title X of CEBA would become effective 6 months after enactmentor on such later date as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. OnFebruary 8, 1988, Treasury published a Policy statement in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 3584) which extended the effective dateof the statute to October 1, 1989. Section 1005 of Title X of CEBA authorizesthe Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe rules, regulations and proceduresas he deems necessary to implement the amendments made by Sections 1002,1003 and 1004, including the recertification of Treasury checks which havebeen cancelled or for which a claim has been asserted or barred. In theproposed rule, Treasury amends the existing regulations concerning thepayment of checks and check claims to implement the changes required bythe statute. The proposed rule also provides explicit authority for agencyrecertification of payments. It is anticipated that the Final rule willbe effective on October 1, 1989, which is the same date that the statutoryprovisions become effective.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Proposed Rule</ITAG>Part 235Part 235 governs the issuance of settlement checks for checks drawn onthe United States Treasury and drawn on designated depositaries that havebeen negotiated and paid on a forged or unauthorized indorsement. TitleX of CEBA addresses Treasury checks only and is silent on the subject ofdepositary checks. Therefore, the regulation preserves the existing authorityin Part 235 for the issuance of settlement checks for checks drawn on depositaries.The authority to issue replacement checks for forged Treasury checks isfound in Part 245 of the proposed rule.Part 240Part 240 governs the payment and indorsement of Treasury checks. Both andSection;240.3_<T3>Limitations on payments</T3> and andSection; 240.4_<T3>Cancellation and distribution of the proceeds of checks</T3> are new.The time limitations on the payment of Treasury checks are contained inandSection; 240.3. The regulation requires all Treasury checks issued afterOctober 1, 1989 to bear the legend, ``VOID AFTER ONE YEAR.'' Sections 240.3(c),(d) and (e) restate Treasury's existing rights with respect to Treasurychecks: (1) Treasury has the right to examine checks and refuse paymentof any check; (2) Treasury checks are deemed paid only after first examinationby Treasury has been completed; and (3) If Treasury has notice of a questionof law of fact about whether a check is properly payable, Treasury maydefer payment until the Comptroller General settles the question.Section 240.4 provides for the cancellation of checks which have been outstandingmore than one year. The proceeds of checks issued on or after October 1,1989 which are subsequently cancelled shall be returned to the agency whichauthorized the issuance of the check. The proceeds of checks issued beforeOctober 1, 1989 which are subsequently cancelled shall be applied as providedin Title X of CEBA (31 U.S.C. 3334) to eliminate the balances in accountsthat represent uncollectible accounts receivable and other costs associatedwith the payment of checks and check claims by the Department of Treasuryon behalf of all payment certifying agencies. Any remaining proceeds shallbe deposited to the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.Section 240.6 is renamed <T3>Reclamation of amounts of paid checks</T3> to reflect the usage ofthe term ``reclamation'' by Treasury for an action by Treasury to recoverfrom the presenting bank or other endorser the amount of a check that hasbeen paid over a forged or unauthorized endorsement. Section 240.6(d) containsthe new time limits on reclamation actions. Treasury may reclaim withinone year after the date of payment. The date of payment to the date onwhich the Federal Reserve Bank gives provisional credit for the item tothe member bank or clearing bank. The one year period for reclamationsis extended by 180 days if a timely check claim is filed with the agencythat authorized the issuance of the check.The other changes in Part 240 are relatively minor. There are definitionsfor two additional terms_``Certifying official'' and ``Commissioner''.In addition, several sections in the existing Part 240 have been renumberedto accomodate the new material, but the text of these sections remainsunchanged. Sections 240.11 through 240.15 concerning Indorsement of Checksis essentially unchanged from the existing regulation. However, the proposedrule in andSection; 240.11(f) deletes a provision in the existing andSection;240.10(f) permitting the presentation of Social Security benefit checksto the Treasury Regional Financial Center in certain cases. The provisionis being deleted because, after the effective date, all claims on Treasurychecks must originate with the agency that authorized the issuance of thecheck. Part 245The proposed rule would change Part 245 substantially. The title of thepart would become ``Claims on Account of Treasury Checks,'' which moreaccurately reflects the subject matter of the part.The central feature of Part 245 is contained in andSection; 245.5_<T3>Recertification of Payment.</T3> Section 1005 of CEBA authorizes theSecretary of Treasury to write regulations implementing the amendmentsmade by sections 1002, 1003 and 1004 of the law, including recertificationof Treasury checks which have been cancelled or for which a claim has beenasserted or barred. Under existing law, Treasury can, subject to certainconditions, issue substitute checks when the original check is lost, destroyed,mutilated or defaced. 31 U.S.C. 3331. When the original check is forged,Treasury can, under existing law, issue a settlement check. 31 U.S.C. 3343.The Introductory section explains that Part 245 covers the issuance ofreplacement checks when (a) the original check has been lost, stolen, destroyed,or mutilated, (b) the original check has been negotiated and paid on aforged or unauthorized indorsement, and (c) the original check has beencancelled.The proposed rule gives Federal agencies broad authority to recertify paymentswhen there is a claim of non-receipt, loss, destruction, mutilation ordefacement of a Treasury check. The regulation provides a certifying agencymay recertify a new payment at any time after receipt of a claim. Therefore,Treasury will only issue a second check, which is called a ``replacementcheck,'' pursuant to the recertification of the payment by the certifyingagency. After the effective date, Treasury will no longer issue settlementchecks or substitute checks.Section 245.3 contains the basic time limit for filing a claim on a Treasurycheck. A claim must be filed within one year after the date of issuanceof the check. Claims on checks issued before October 1, 1989, must be filedbefore October 1, 1990. In addition, the regulation states that claimsmust originate with the agency that authorized the issuance of the check.However, a claim by an indorser may be presented directly to Treasury.After the effective date, Treasury will maintain checks and check recordsfor 18 months from the date of issuance. During that 18 month period, Treasurywill provide both information on the status of the check and a copy ofthe check to the agency that authorized its issuance. After 18 months,Treasury will transfer custody of the checks and check records to the agencythat autorized the issuance of the check for its use in the settlementof any claim for an obligation represented by a check.Part 248The proposed rule contains minor changes to Part 248. Part 248 preservesthe existing authority to issue substitutes for lost, stolen, or destroyedchecks drawn on foreign depositary banks. Title X of CEBA does not addressdepositary checks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Treasury Department has determined that the proposed regulation isnot a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR13193, February 19, 1981). It is not likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initialand final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604) are notapplicable to this proposal because the proposed rule, if promulgated asa final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The proposal will not impose, or otherwise cause,a significant increase in reporting, recordkeeping, or other complianceburdens on a substantial number of small entities. The proposal is notexpected to have significant secondary or incidental effects on a substantialnumber of small entities.Accordingly, it is hereby certified under the provisions of Section 3 ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that this proposed rule,if promulgated as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)),the collection of information contained in this proposed rule has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review. Comments onthe collection of information should be sent to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Financial Management Service, withcopies to the Financial Management Service at the address previously specified.The collection of information in this regulation is in 31 CFR 245.4. Theproposed rule requires that a person making a claim on a Treasury checkprovide information concerning the check to the government agency whichauthorized the issuance of the check. The information will be used by theagency to determine whether the claimant is entitled to a replacement check.The likely respondents are individuals.The proposed rule imposes no new collection of information requirementnor does it increase the collection of information burden. The reportingburden is attributable to the various agencies that receive the informationfrom check claimants. The estimated total reporting burden for all governmentagencies is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">Estimated total annual reporting burden: 160,320 hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Estimated average annual burden per respondent: .167 hour.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Estimated number of respondents: 960,000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>31 CFR Part 235Banks, Banking, Claims, Forgery.31 CFR Part 240Banks, Banking, Forgery.31 CFR Part 245Banks, Banking, Claims.31 CFR Part 248Banks, Banking, Claims, Foreign banking.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Treasury proposes to amend Title31, Chapter II, Subchapter A of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 235_ISSUANCE OF SETTLEMENT CHECKS FOR FORGED CHECKS DRAWN ONDESIGNATED DEPOSITARIES</ITAG>1.

Such an acceptable indorsement shall includethe signature of the indorser and sufficient wording to indicate that theindorser is indorsing on behalf of the named payee or payees, pursuantto authority expressly conferred by or under law or other regulation. Anexample would be: ``John Jones by Mary Jones''. This example states theminimum indication acceptable. However, andSection;andSection; 240.12(a)(1),240.13(a)(1) and 240.15(d) specify the addition of an indication in specifiedsituations of the actual capacity in which the person other than the namedpayee is indorsing.
