Like blacks and Hispanics before them, Asians in the UnitedStates have become a hot market for advertisers, triggering a mediablitz that aims to penetrate cultural differences within the groupand tap a wellspring of discretionary income.   ``We've gone up 100 percent for the past five years in a row,''said advertising executive Holmes Stoner, whose Artesa MediaServices specializes in Asian and Hispanic advertising.   His firm's billings for advertising to Filipinos, Chinese,Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese and other Asian-American groups rangebetween $350,000 and $400,000, up from $35,000 to $50,000 just fiveyears ago, Stoner said.   Much of the advertising is for ethnic products, local merchants,real estate agents and other businesses catering to U.S. Asians.But more mainstream companies are testing campaigns in Korean,Chinese, Japanese and other Asian languages.   ``Companies that are driven by numbers say it is too small asegment to contend with,'' said Paul Sladkus, a New Yorkadvertising representative for 30 Asian print and broadcast medianationwide. ``Other companies are looking at them very seriously asnew consumers.''   General Motors, ATandamp;T, New York Life, United Airlines and RemyMartin cognac are among advertisers who have crossed over withappeals geared to Asian-American consumers.   The reason? Although Asian-Americans are a relatively smallpiece of the U.S. population, their steep growth rate and favorabledemographics make them blue-chip consumers for many products.   The advertising upswing has touched off sharp growth inAsian-targeted media, especially in Los Angeles and Orangecounties, which topped the nation with 550,000 Asian-Americans asof the 1980 census, when the national figure was 3.5 million.   That was up from 1.4 million in 1970, according to an AmericanManagement Association report that projected Asian-Americans willtotal 6.5 million by 1990 and 10 million by 2000.   ``We used to have two Chinese (newspaper) dailies'' in LosAngeles, said Stoner. ``Now we have six, three full-bore Koreandailies, three Japanese dailies and even a Vietnamese daily.''   Though broadcasting has not developed as sharply, some radiostations and Los Angeles television station KSCI broadcast programsin Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese and Cambodian.   ``Cable (television) is the next step,'' said Stoner. ``And asof 1989 there will be pay television in their languages in everymajor (Asian-American) metropolitan area in the country: New York,Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Seattle-Vancouver.''   Jerry Walters, whose Los Angeles agency researches theAsian-American market for major advertising campaigns, said about75 percent of Asian-Americans were born outside the country,``except for the Japanese, which are 20 percent first generation.''   Newcomers are said to be more responsive to advertising aboutwhat to buy and where to find it.   With larger household sizes and more workers in the home, medianfamily income for almost all Asian-American groups is better thanaverage. They also have more education and better jobs thannational norms.   But differences in language, culture, nationality andassimilation level can make reaching and persuading Asian-Americansa tough job for advertisers. Different languages mean they cannotbe targeted with just one appeal, as Hispanics are in Spanish.   ``Many times the current copy just doesn't fly with the Asianpopulation,'' said Walters. ``The word `Chevy' was not recognizedby first-generation Koreans. So we translated it to `It's aChevrolet. America's finest line of cars.'''   Other campaigns lose something in the translation or communicatethe wrong message. Walters said Playboy magazine ran a New Year'sgreeting in Chinese that had the characters in the wrong order.   Some overseas campaigns ran into even more trouble. ColonelSanders ``finger-lickin' good'' fried chicken slogan once wastranslated ``something like `eat your fingers off''' and PepsiCola's ``come alive'' generation became ``wakes your ancestors upfrom the dead,'' Walters said.   Some agencies have solved that problem by tailoring ads to suitthe peculiarities of different subgroups.   And even while wooing new consumers, Madison Avenue still couldimprove its image of Asians in mainstream advertising, said DougAlligood, BBDO's vice president for special markets in New York.   ``Advertisers are approving a lot of ads that are inquestionable taste, the Japanese in particular,'' said Alligood.``Japanese men with little round glasses and buck teeth. There's noroom for that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday June 2</NOTE></DOC>
