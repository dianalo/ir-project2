The EC Commission's deadline for some form of airline deregulation is the end of this month. The commission's original intent was to boost competitiveness among European airlines and, thus, lower fares, increase convenient flights and spur the creation of new airlines.    But critics of the current package say that if it were adopted without substantial changes that it would be worse for consumers than no agreement at all.    Each time the ministers meet, the proposals are diluted further in the hope that an agreement can be reached, the critics say, and after frequent meetings during the past 2 1/2 years, the original proposals written by the EC Commission barely resemble the current package. </TEXT></DOC>
