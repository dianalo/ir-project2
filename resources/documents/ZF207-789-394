 Cartographicdatabases have expanded enormously with the availability of morepowerful microcomputers; geographically-oriented business data hasbecome widely available, and mapping software has become easier touse and more powerful.andP;  Firms use geographic data to study salesterritories and other boundaries and for site selection and fleetrouting.andP;  The amount of data on one map is a major area of GISexpansion.andP;  Most GIS software is mouse- and menu-driven andoptimized to deal with the large quantities of data involved.andO;Electronic maps are also used for such applications as 'what-if'modeling.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MapsComputer graphicsGeographic Information SystemsDemography.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CARTOGRAPHERS OF A WORLD OF DATA THROUGH THE PICTURE window on the 52nd floorof Boston's tallest building, Jim Vanecko, a director of marketing researchfor the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, enjoys a spectacular viewof some of his company's potential customers.andP;  Straight ahead, the SouthEnd's gentrified brownstone gradually give way to Roxbury's gritty inner-cityprojects.andP;  to theeast lie the blue-collar triple-deckers of South Boston.andP;  Tothe west, past Fenway Park, is the college-student turf of Allston andBrighton, and, further on, the affluent western suburbs of Brookline andNewton.andM;All in all, not a bad vantage point for a guy whose living depends on knowingwho's out there and how to bring them the appropriate financial products.andM;Yet for a more useful view of the urban landscape, Vanecko and his marketresearch team don't look out the window.andP;  They gaze at the screen of a PS/2Model 80, which glows with a digitized map and holds three compact discs fullof demographic data.andM;What's the average household's credit-card balance down there, mapped by zipcode?andP;  The marketers ask the software, and soon a patchwork of colors paintsthe high-resolution screen, clearly showing the disparities among Boston'sneighbors.andP;  Which spots have the most people with $500,000 in homeowner'sinsurance?andP;  A new tapestry of information covers the mapped city streets.andM;Using a mouse to draw a box around one seemingly insurance-heavy zone,Hancock researcher can then ask their map to render data on the reallyimportant questions: &quot;OK, now, exactly who lives in this area, broken down bythe type of lifestyle they lead?andP;  And how many of them have our homeowner'spolicies?&quot;andM;MAPS MADE ON PC SCREENS were once simply for decoration.andP;  Type in somenumbers from a report that lists snowblower sales by region, create arainbow-colored graphic, impress the boss.andP;  But these days, PC maps,bolstered by increasingly powerful hardware, declining data-storage costs,and more abundant business data, are more than just catchy ways to show offwhat you may already know.andP;  They help marketers, distribution managers, urbanplanners, and election campaigners unearth new meaning from megabytes ofotherwise inscrutable statistics.andP;  As the front ends of what are calledgeographic information systems (GISs), maps have become tools that helpinterpret data, not just present them in lots of pretty colors.andM;&quot;In the information industry, there's just so much raw data out there thatpeople can't make sense of it all,&quot; says Rich Zinne, director of mappingservices at National Decision Systems, in Encinitas, California, maker of theInfomark demographics system that Hancock's marketers use.andP;  In the same waythat PC-generated bar charts have made data accessible to businesspeople,maps help people comprehend ideas they might not get from the data otherwise,he says.andM;&quot;Spreadsheets buried people in tables that were hard to digest, so the nextlogical development was to turn those tables into pictures,&quot; adds FrankHanigan, a consultant and editor of GIS Forum, a monthly news-letter ongeographic information systems.andP;  &quot;Mapping is just another form of businessgraphics.&quot;andM;Mapping in itself, of course, is nothing new.andP;  It's one of th first thingspeople did with paper and, before that, with shells and pebbles.andP;  Policedepartments have tracked crime patterns on wall maps with pushpins at leastsince the early days of TV detective shows.andP;  In business, pebble countershave depicted marketing trends or routes for delivery trucks the same way fordecades.andM;In early days of the computer era, putting pins or transparencies overpreprinted maps was the only way to display geographical data, even ifcorporate mainframes crunched the numbers.andP;  Later, GISs designed formainframes and minicomputers emerged, uniting the mapmaking andnumber-crunching functions--the first and best-selling being ARC/INFO,released by Environmental Systems Research Institute, of Redlands,California, in 1981.andM;But GISs for large systems lacked much of the immediacy and the ad hoc querycapability PC users depend on.andM;PCs got mapping capability early in their evolution from such packages asAshton-Tate's Map-Master and STSC's Atlas-Graphics.andP;  These widely usedgraphics programs are packaged with cartographic data about the territoriesyou might want to depict.andP;  Mechanisms for entering business data tocorrespond with desired boundaries are also  included.andP;  These packages createsnazzy graphics (their shading of different regions is called thematicmapping, because it is intended to help highlight a theme in the data), butthe maps they make remain fairly static after they've been created.andP;  No extradata sit behind a presentation map waiting to be queried.andM;AS PCs HAVE GAINED POWER, three things have happened to desktop mapping.andO;First, cartographic databases that describe the land's geography haveexpanded in detail and variety.andP;  Second, geographically oriented businessdata have become available everywhere.andP;  Finally, the PC software thatintegrates cartographic and demographic databases continues to become morepowerful and easy to use.andM;Cartographic data consist primarily of boundaries, of which there are morethan you might think.andP;  This land has been so sliced up and gerrymandered bydata analysts that hundreds of people cross official boundaries every dayjust by taking out the garbage.andP;  Boundaries include political divisions suchas states, counties, and congressional districts; postal zip code areas; U.S.andO;census-defined block groups and tracts; Metropolitan Statistical Areas(MSAs); and television rating companies' media zones such as Arbitron's Areasof Dominant Influence (ADIs) and Nielsen's Designated Market Areas (DMAs).andM;Every company, of course, also has its own boundaries, such as its salesterritories, trade areas for retail stores, pizza-delivery zones, or whathave you.andP;  Most PC-based geographic information systems let users digitizetheir own boundaries into the data, some by drawing circles or polygonsonscreen with a mouse.andM;But there's more to cartographic data than boundaries.andP;  Businesspeople whoare trying to figure out where they should site a new shoe store or in whatorder they should make customer deliveries need precise data on the geographywithin the boundaries: the city blocks with the ranges of addresses theyinclude, the highways, side streets, bodies of water, railroads, and thelike.andP;  Each of these segments of information must be &quot;intelligent&quot; enough totell software what other pieces it's connected to.andM;Because cartographic information about the United States is finite, more orless, the real data boom has been in the amount of business and demographicdata you can put on one map.andP;  The business world, with its product scanningand consumer polling, keeps getting better at tracking what we buy, eat,drink, read, watch, vote for, wear on our feet, and expect to wear on ourfeet six months from now.andM;Want to know how many males over age 35 own rifles and do aerobics, mapped bycensus block group, in Los Angeles County?andP;  Or where the Chinese restaurantsin New York City are, charted by zip code?andP;  Or how psychiatrists aredistributed across Pecos County, Texas?andP;  Answers to those questions, as wellas projections on how they might be answered in five years, can be purchasedfrom a demographic research firm and are just a few keystrokes away from a PCmap.andM;Most GISs also accept a company's internal sales and customer data in ASCIIformat.andP;  MapInfo, from the MapInfo Corporation, of Troy, New York,understands dBASE files, too.andP;  MapInfo and TruckStops, a fleet-routingpackage from MicroAnalytics, of Arlington, Virginia, will even take streetaddresses from a database and &quot;geo-code&quot; them, assigning longitude andlatitude coordinates to place them on a map.andM;It's no surprise that all this cartographic and demographic data can take upquite a bit of storage space.andP;  For instance, if you want to route your truckfleet through Chicago with the help of TruckStops, be sure to clear out atleast 10MB on your hard disk.andP;  Hundred-megabyte hard disks are common fordemographic mapping PC workstations.andP;  National Decision Systems has developeda proprietary technology that links three CDROM discs--more than a gigabyteof data--to a PS/2 simultaneously.andM;NONE OF YOUR MOUNTAINS of data would make much sense without some of the mostelaborate PC software you're bound to come across.andP;  PC-based GIS packagestend to be mouse- and menu-driven and are optimized to deal swiftly withmassive quantities of data.andP;  And the software does illuminate informationabout the world that might be hidden in the data.andM;CACI-Federal, a Fairfax, Virginia-based vendor for PC demographics software,uses this marketing scenario to show how a business might use CACI's MarketAmerica demographics software, which has Atlas-Graphics map-drawingcapabilities.andP;  A bank has to choose from three prospective locations for anew branch.andP;  At first glance, the total population around the three proposedsites looks equally distributed, making a choice based on that variableimpossible.andP;  But when bank officials superimpose onto the map a distributionof their targeted customers--&quot;young fast-track adults&quot;--the map reveals alopsided proportion of them gathered around one particular site.andM;Jim O'Neill, formerly director of the market analysis division ofCACI-Federal, says this is the kind of observation you couldn't make &quot;withoutyour own version of the world sitting right there in memory.andP;  It justwouldn't be evident.&quot;andM;In New Mexico, dispatchers for the Albuquerque Ambulance Service no longerrespond to calls by guessing which of their drivers might be closest to theaccident site.andP;  Now, they sit before Compaq 386 machines running softwarefrom Etak that displays Albuquerque street maps and the real-time locationand status of each ambulance.andP;  When an emergency call comes in, a dispatchertypes the caller's address into the keyboard and a star appears on theonscreen map.andP;  If the caller isn't sure where he is, the dispatcher can lookaround on his map and help figure out the location by prompting forlandmarks: &quot;Is it near the highway?&quot;andM;The dispatcher then uses his PC screen to identify the closest available rigand transmits the pickup location by radio to a small computerized map insidethe selected ambulance.andP;  The driver switches on the siren and drives towardthe star.andM;Packages that solve business problems such as fleet-routing andsite-selection take PC GISs to their greatest heights.andP;  These integratecartographics, demographics, a company's own information about its resourcesand its customers and their needs, plus information on external conditions(such as roads under construction) to solve complex geographic problems.andP;  Themap serves both as a front end for entering geographic variables and as aback end for displaying results.andM;Haz-Trans, for example, a specialized PC program developed at VECTOR (theVanderbilt Engineering Center for Transportation Operations and Research, atVanderbilt University, in Nashville), helps corporations devise optimalroutes for transporting hazardous materials among their plants and wastesites.andP;  It accounts for transporation costs, road conditions, localregulations, and the population put at risk in case of an accident.andP;  Usersenter the location of the toxic wastes or chemicals and their destination,indicate whether they want the cheapest or the safest route (or something inbetween), and let the software develop a transportation plan, which isdisplayed onscreen.andM;An added model under development for the package would simulate humanexposures to various toxins in case of a spill, depicting a chemical &quot;plume&quot;over a selected area of the map, says Mark Abkowitz, VECTOR's administrativedirector.andM;LITTLE IN THE REAL WORLD can't be put up on a PC map and analyzed nowadays.andO;In a sense, as maps get more power and data behind them, they're simply doinga better job at what has been their purpose since the days of pebbles andshells: describing the earth in pictorial form.andP;  Finally, pictures aregetting sophisticated enough to depict an increasingly complex earth.andM;&quot;More and more, mapping is mirroring reality,&quot; says Dick Raines, chiefoperating officer at the Claritas Corporation, of Alexandria, Virginia, whichsells the Compass PC demographics workstation.andM;Of course, those hard-to-refold posters from the gasoline company still comein handy when you're lost somewhere between L.A.andP;  and San Francisco.andP;  Butchances are that once you've used a computerized map, one that can answerquestions and solve problems for you, you'll never want to sail off the edgeof an old flat map again.andM;Don STeinberg is a freelance writer who lives in a geodemographic area justeast of our offices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
