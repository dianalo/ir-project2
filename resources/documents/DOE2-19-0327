The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphereis undoubtedly increasing and there has been a measurable increase inthe world's global mean surface air temperature spread over several decades.The theory that the two are linked through the greenhouse effect is nowwidely accepted but it is surrounded by highly complex scientific argumentsand counter arguments as to its significance and precise effect and theseare outlined. It is concluded, in particular, that at present there isinsufficient evidence of the relationship between fossil fuel combustionand global warming to warrant abandoning it as the main source of heatand power.</TEXT></DOC>
