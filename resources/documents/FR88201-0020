On September 1, 1987, a Notice of Proposed Rulemakingwas accordingly published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>52 FR 33210. The September 1 notice proposedrules which would prohibit Title X projects from counseling or referringproject clients for abortion as a method of family planning. The proposedrules also required grantees to separate their Title X project_physicallyand financially_from any abortion activities. Finally, the rules proposedcompliance standards for family planning projects funded under Title Xto specifically prohibit certain actions that promote or encourage abortionas a method of family planning, such as the use of project funds for lobbyingfor abortion, developing and disseminating materials advocating abortion,or taking legal action to make abortion available as a method of familyplanning. Proposed 42 CFR 59.8-59.10.The Department requested public comment on the proposed provisions. Approximately75,000 comments were received during the 60-day comment period. Of thesecomments, a majority favored the proposed policies. The Department hascarefully considered the issues raised by the public. A description anddicussion of these issues precedes the final rules set out below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Few issues facing our society today are more divisive than that of abortion.Those who oppose abortion do so on the ground that it is nothing less thanthe killing of an innocent human life and, as such, is not only the unconscionabledestruction of an individual life but also sets the stage for the devaluationof life on a much broader scale. Those who favor the choice of abortionview it as an immediate and positive option for pregnant women in crisisand consider any governmental regulation of abortion to be a wrongful intrusionby the State into a very personal decision. Indeed, the volume and highly charged nature of the public comments receivedon this regulatory proposal emphasize the polar divisions of national opinionon this issue. Because the rules below address such a controversial issue,it is imperative that these final rules be precisely understood. The extendeddiscusssion of the legal framework circumscribing the Department's regulatoryauthority and the detailed explanation of the Department's actions beloware provided for this reason.Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 by Pub. L.91-572. It authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to, amongother things, make grants to public and private nonprofit entities to establishand operate family planning projects. Section 1001(a) of the Public HealthService Act, 42 U.S.C. 300(a). Section 1008 of Title X, 42 U.S.C. 300a-6,contains the following prohibition, which has not been altered since enactedin 1970:<ITAG tagnum="21">None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programswhere abortion is a method of family planning.</ITAG>This language clearly creates a wall of separation between Title X programsand abortion as a method of family planning. It embodies a view that abortionis inappropriate as a method of family planning. Indeed, as the SupremeCourt has recognized abortion is ``inherently different from other medicalprocedures, because no other procedure involves the purposeful terminationof a potential life.'' <T3>Harris </T3>v. <T3>McRae, </T3>448 U.S.297, 325 (1980). In <T3>McRae, </T3>the Supreme Court stated that because there is a ``legitimatecongressional interest in protecting potential life,'' Congress may declineto subsidize abortions, even though it may not erect legal obstacles tothe exercise of that choice. <T3>Id. </T3>Section 1008 and the rule below express just such a decisionand thus fall squarely within the range of choices that the Supreme Courthas recognized that the government may legitimately make. It is important to recognize that section 1008 extends to all activitiesconducted by the federally funded project, not just the use of federalfunds for abortions within the project. When a statute focuses only onthe acutal use of federal funds, mere allocation of costs through appropriatebookkeeping entries may be appropriate. In section 1008, however, Congresscrafted a broader prohibition, and that prohibition should be given effect.Moreover, it is clear that Congress designed the Title X program to providedpreventive family planning and infertility services, not to provide allpossible medical services, including services for the care of pregnantwomen. (Compare section 1001 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 300 and section 330of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 254c.) This design is consistent with the statutoryprohibition of section 1008. The legislative history of Title X bears out this interpretation. The mostsignificant expression of congressional intent in this connection is containedin the Conference Report accompanying S. 2108, which contains the followingstatement:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is, and has been, the intent of both Houses that the funds authorizedunder this legislation be used only to support <T3>preventive </T3>family planning services, population research, infertilityservices,\1\<NOTE/> and other related medical, information and education activities.The conferees have adopted the language contained in section 1008, whichprohibits the use of such funds for abortion in order to make clear thisintent.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The statutory requirements for infertility services wasnot added until the 1978 amendments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Conf. Rep. No. 91-1667, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 8-9 (1970).In addition, Congressman John D. Dingell, the principal sponsor of section1008, made the following statement on the floor of the House:<ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation before this body. I set forthin my extended remarks the reasons why I offered to the amendment whichprohibited abortion as a method of family planning * * *. With the ``prohibitionof abortion'' the committee members clearly intended that <T3>abortion is not to be encouraged or promoted in any way </T3>throughthis legislation. Programs which include abortion as a method of familyplanning are not eligible for funds allocated through this Act.\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 116 Cong. Rec. 37375 (1970). Thus, as clearly contemplated by Title X and its legislative history, ``familyplanning'' as circumscribed by section 1008, permits only activities relatedto facilitating or preventing pregnancy, not for terminating it. Initital Implementation Through Advisory Opinions Critical to an understanding of the rules below is an understanding ofthe past history of the Title X program. The Department has, since 1972,interpreted section 1008 not only as prohibiting the provision of abortionbut also as prohibiting Title X projects from in any way promoting or encouragingabortion as a method of family planning. Further, based on the legislativehistory, the Department has also, since 1972, interpreted section 1008as requiring that the Title X program be ``separate and distinct'' fromany abortion activities of a grantee.Initially, the Department's interpretation of the language of section 1008was limited to opinions of its Office of General Counsel (OGC). After quotingthe passage from the Conference Report and the statement of CongressmanDingell, cited above, the first such OGC opinion concluded that ``it isapparent that the Congressional intent was to prohibit a broader scopeof activity than a literal reading of section 1008 would require.'' \4\<NOTE/> In these opinions, however, the Department generally tookthe view that activity which did not have the immediate effect of promotingabortion or which did not have the principal purpose or effect of promotingabortion was permitted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``Abortions as a Method of Family Planning_Section 1008of the Public Health Services Act'' (April 20, 1971). The 1981 GuidelinesIn 1981, the Department issued revised Title X program guidelines, ``ProgramGuidelines for Project Grants for Family Planning Services.'' As with previouseditions of the guidelines, they did not incorporate prior OGC opinionsproviding guidance on abortion counseling, referral and program separation.However, while the pre-1981 OGC opinions had been directed to provisionof guidance on which abortion related activities were <T3>permissible </T3>within the section 1008 prohibition, the guidelineswent a step further and <T3>required </T3>Title X projects to engage in abortion-related activitiesunder certain circumstances. These guidelines for the first time requirednondirective ``options counsleling'' on pregnancy termination (abortion),prenatal care, and adoption and foster care when a woman with an unintendedpregnancy requests information on her options, followed by referral forthese services if she so requests. These guidelines were premised on aview that ``non-directive'' counseling and referral for abortion were notinconsistent with the statute and were justified as a matter of policyin that such activities did not have the effect of promoting or encouragingabortion. It should be noted that although OGC opinions continued to interpretsection 1008 as prohibiting any abortion referrals beyond ``mere referral,''that is, providing a list of names and addresses without in any furtherway assisting the woman in obtaining an abortion (such as by providingtransportation or arranging appointments), this policy was not reflectedin the 1981 program guidelines, thereby creating an appearance of treatingeach option identically. Upon review of the guidelines, however, the Department for serveral reasonsno longer believes that these approaches were correct. First, with regardto the consistency of the guidelines with the statute, counseling and referralfor abortion are prohibited by section 1008. The Department does not believethat the current guidelines can be viewed as consistent with section 1008on the ground that they only involve counseling and referral, not the actualperformance of abortions. Counseling and other informational services aresome of the principal family planning services provided by Title X programs,and section 1008 is applicable to all aspects of the program. Because counselingand referral activities are integral parts of the provision of any methodof family planning, to interpret section 1008 as applicable only to theperformance of abortion would be inconsistent with the broad prohibitionagainst use of abortion as a method of family planning. As discussed above,``family planning,'' as clearly contemplated by Title X and its legislativehistory, refers to activities relating to facilitating or preventing pregnancy,not to terminating it. The current guidelines, however, require granteesto involve themselves in activities specifically related to the terminationof pregnancies. This creates a conflict between the guidelines and thestatutory prohibition on Title X programs using abortion as a method offamily planning. In addition, the Department does not believe that the requirement thatthe counseling must be ``nondirective'' is sufficient to render the guidelinesconsistent with the statute. Counseling in a Title X program, whether directiveor nondirective, which results in abortion as a method of family planningsimply cannot be squared with the language of section 1008, regardlessof whether the actual abortion occurs in another program operated by thegrantee or in an unrelated program. Finally, the 1981 guidelines are highly questionable simply as a matterof statutory policy. The policy that section 1008 reflects is that abortionis not to be encouraged or promoted in any way; nowhere in the statuteis any countervailing policy reflected. Nonetheless, the current guidelinesrequire Title X programs to counsel and refer regarding abortion. Whetheror not such a requirement is consistent with the express prohibition issection 1008, it is less sound as a matter of policy than the rules beingpromulgated today. In sum, upon reexamination of the issue, the Departmentis unable to conclude that the current guidelines are consistent with thestatute. Thus, one basis for the regulations being promulgated today isto bring program practices into conformity with the language of the statute.Rational Basis for the New RegulationEven if the abortion counseling and referral provided for by the currentguidelines were not prohibited by the express language of section 1008,the Department has concluded, as a matter of its experience with TitleX, its responsibility to administer the program as provided by Congress,and its general administrative discretion, that the provisions of the currentguidelines do not faithfully and effectively maintain the prohibition containedin section 1008. In the first place, the language of the guidelines pertainingto section 1008 is so brief and so broadly worded that it fails to offer``clear and operational guidance'' to grantees about how to preserve thedistinction between Title X programs and abortion as a method of familyplanning. Second, in 1982, both the Department's Office of the InspectorGeneral (OIG) and the General Accounting Office (GAO) urged the Departmentto give more specific, formalized direction to programs about the extentof prohibition on abortion as a method of family planning.The OIG, after auditing thirty-two Title X clinics, found that the Department'sfailure to provide specific program guidance regarding the scope of section1008 had created confusion about precisely which activities were proscribedby the section, and had resulted in variations in practice by grantees.In particular, the GAO, in a report based on an audit of fourteen TitleX clinics, found that the clinics were relying on the Department's policyof permitting both Title X family planning services and separately funded,abortion-related activities to be provided at a single site.5<NOTE/> In the report, GAO found that some of these providers hadengaged in a number of practices that were questionable in light of section1008. These included clinic counseling practices which did not presentalternatives to abortion,6<NOTE/> clinic referral practices which went beyond HHS referralpolicy,7<NOTE/> and clinic literature promoting abortion as a back-up methodof family planning.8<NOTE/> Further, the GAO found ``questionable'' lobbying expenses,including some instances where clinics had used Title X funds to pay duesto organizations that lobbied and two instances where small amounts ofprograms funds has been used directly for lobbying. GAO observed that thespecifics of the Department's abortion policy were contained only in legalopinions issued by its Office of General Counsel:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>5Comp. Gen. Rep. No. GAO/HRD-82-106, ``Restrictions on Abortionand Lobbying Activities in Family Planning Programs Need Clarification,''p. 22 (1982) (hereafter referred to as ``the GAO Report''.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>6At one clinic discussed in the report, women were requiredto complete paperwork before their pregnancy tests and preselect how theyintended to deal with their pregnancy. If they chose to continue the pregnancy,they were counseled on that option. If they checked abortion, they werecounseled only on that choice. Six other clinics, which did not requireprepregnancy test decisions, did not routinely counsel women on other alternativesif they had decided on abortion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>7Four clinics provided clients with brochures prepared byabortion clinics. At two clinics, clients seeking abortions were allowedto use the telephone to make appointments for abortions. At one clinic,appointments for abortion were made for clients who did not speak English.At one clinic, the Title X recipients provided women loans for abortionsfor nonprogram funds; however, administrative costs associated with thereferral and loans were charged to Title X program costs. The GAO Reportalso noted OIG's discovery that several Title X clinics in Indiana hadprovided and witnessed the signing of consent forms required by an abortionclinic.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>8One Texas clinic showed all clients a film about birth controlmethods and sterilization that included a section that presented abortionas a legal alternative in the event of an unwanted pregnancy. Four clinicsprovided or made available to all clients entering the family planningprogram handout material that discussed abortion. Typically this materiallisted various birth control methods with the barrier method and earlyabortion in the event of a failure as an alternative method.<ITAG tagnum="21">In effect, HHS' regulations that spell out overall policy and implementprovisions of the law and corresponding program guidelines that elaborateon the law and regulations in operational terms do not contain the specificpolicy guidance concerning section 1008 needed by title X recipients.9<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>9The GAO Report, p. 14-15.Accordingly, GAO stated that,<ITAG tagnum="21">We recommend that the Secretary establish clear operational guidanceby incorporating into the title X program regulations and guidelines HHS'position on the scope of the restriction in section 1008.10<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>10The GAO Report, p. 22.Public comments received by the Department on the proposed regulationsfurther demonstrate the problems inherent in ``nondirective counseling''and lend weight to concerns raised by the OIG audit and GAO report. Manycomments argued that the practice or nondirective counseling has been thesubject of widespread abuse, with many providers foregoing any balanceddiscussion of options in favor of pressuring women, particularly teenagers,into obtaining abortions. Numerous comments were received from women whosaid that they were never presented with any favorable or neutral informationon any other option. Many of these commenters specifically mentioned experienceswith particular Title X grantees or projects. A typical complaint was thatthe counseling that they had received was one-sided, with the fetus dehumanizedas a ``lump of tissue,'' ``fetal tissue,'' or ``uterine contents,'' andwith no information presented as to gestational characteristics and stageof development, so that they were not given adequate information on whichto make an informed choice regarding abortion. These commenters typicallystated that they had experienced severe and long-lasting regret over thedecision to abort, and also stated that they were given no counseling atthe time they made their decision to abort as to the remorse and guiltthey might later feel:<ITAG tagnum="21">I have experienced the one-sidedness of * * *'s ``counseling'' andhave seen the consciences of friend's (sic) shattered by what they nowknow was the wrong choice. Too many people are literally encouraged touse abortion as a birth control device because of its availability. * ** has never discussed the alternative side with anyone I know. I don'tfeel guilty or presumptive calling their efforts exploitive. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These clinics do not provide adequate information to pregnant women.There is no ``choice'' involved in regard to abortion. It is the <T3>only </T3>solution offered. I know this from experience and have spokento many women who have shared that experience. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Please indulge me a little longer to say this, <T3>they lied to me. </T3>My third abortion required hospitalization andthis was not done for the others.

They focus the emphasis ofthe Title X program on its traditional mission: The provision of preventivefamily planning services specifically designed to enable individuals todetermine the number and spacing of their children, while clarifying thatpregnant women must be referred to appropriate prenatal care services.H. Rep. No. 91-1472, 91st Cong., 2nd Sess. (1970), reprinted at 3 U.S.Code Cong. andamp; Adm. News 5071 (1970). In addition, they require thatgrantees maintain program integrity and separation. The regulations, however,do not restrict the use of funds outside the Title X program or imposerestrictions on funds provided under other federal programs. Nor do theyprevent a woman from seeking and obtaining an abortion outside the TitleX program. They thus make no attempt to establish abortion restrictionsbeyond the parameters of a Title X project. Although the rules below thus adhere to the broad policies laid out inthe proposed rules, a number of changes in particular provisions have beenmade in response to concerns raised by the public comments. A summary ofthese comments, an explanation of the changes to the final rules, and theDepartment's responses to the remainder of the comments are set out below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>I. Definitions The proposed rules set out a series of definitions to be added to the regulatorydefinitions at 42 CFR 59.2. The additional definitions proposed were ofthe terms ``family planning'', ``grantee'', ``organization'', ``program''and ``project'', and ``Title X''. While the suggested definitions of theterms ``grantee,'' ``organization,'' and ``Title X'' elicited very littlecomment, the remaining definitions were the subject of extensive debate.In addition, a few comments suggested that other terms be defined to clarifythe proposed rules. <ITAG tagnum="81"> A. Comments. </ITAG>1. ``<T3>Family planning</T3>'': As proposed, this term was defined as_<ITAG tagnum="20">the process of establishing objectives for the number and spacingof a family's children, and selecting the means (including natural familyplanning methods, adoption, infertility services and general reproductivehealth care, abstinence and contraception) by which those objectives maybe achieved. As such, family planning does not include medical servicesor counseling after pregnancy is diagnosed (including prenatal or postpartumcare or counseling), or abortion-related services. As it relates to thestatutory prohibition on the inclusion of abortion as a method of familyplanning, proper family planning should reduce the incidence of abortion.</ITAG>Numerous providers and provider organizations objected to this definition.A large number of comments took issue with the first sentence of the definition.First, some commenters pointed out that by limiting the definition of ``familyplanning'' to services provided to ``families,'' the Department would beexcluding from coverage single individuals, whom Congress intended to beserved. Other comments objected to the items included in the parentheticalexpression in the first sentence of the definition. Many providers arguedthat listing ``contraception'' at the end of the list of family planningmethods de-emphasizes its importance in Title X, and converts Title X intoa program that is principally designed to encourage abstinence and promoteadoption, contrary to Congress's intent. The inclusion of ``adoption''as a method of family planning elicited a mix of comments. Some providersthought its inclusion inappropriate and inconsistent with the overall missionof Title X, while others favored its inclusion. A few comments pointedout that adoption and infertility services do not fit in conceptually withpreventive methods of family planning. A few commenters were concernedthat the reference to infertility services in the parenthetical expressionnot be construed as connoting approval of <T3>in vitro</T3> fertilization, surrogate motherhood, and the like. Finally,concern was expressed that the definition in general and the first sentencein particular would preclude Title X projects from continuing to providethe range of health services_ such as physical examinations, gynecologicalservices, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, screeningfor breast cancer_ that they have traditionally provided. A common objection was to the exclusion of prenatal care from the rangeof services offered by Title X clinics. Citing the 1970 Senate committeereport, they argued that Title X projects were intended to be providersof comprehensive family planning services and that family planning involvesmore than birth control. Many providers argued that the time at which pregnancyis diagnosed is the optimal time to educate pregnant clients as to propernutrition and the importance of avoiding high-risk behavior_such as smoking,consumption of alcohol, drug abuse, and management of weight gain_as earlypregnancy is when organogenesis is proceeding most rapidly. These commentsasserted that terminating the Title X project's involvement with the clientat this point would have significant adverse public health consequences(such as an increase in low birth weight, maternal and infant health complications,and infant mortality), as the disadvantaged status (<T3>i.e.,</T3> youth, poverty, low education) of most of the program'sclientele makes it unlikely that they will obtain adequate prenatal carefrom other sources in a timely fashion. A number of providers argued thatfor many Title X clients, the Title X project constitutes their only sourceof health care due to factors such as geographic isolation, unwillingnessof other providers to accept non-paying clients, or the inability of theclients to arrange for care themselves. It was argued that the effect ofthe definition will be to create a dual system of health care in whichthe poor served by Title X clinics are relegated to inferior health care,while the population that can afford to pay for care will continue to obtainprenatal care.Similar concerns were noted with respect to the exclusion of postpartumcare from the definition of family planning. In addition, some commenterscontended that the exclusion of postpartum care is inconsistent with thestatute. First, many health professionals and providers argued that propermedical practice dictates that family planning counseling and selectionof a family planning method be done postpartum, as that is when it is mostlikely to be effective; exclusion of services at that point, they argued,would be thus inconsistent with the statutory emphasis on the provisionof ``comprehensive  * * * and effective family planning services * * *''.Second, several comments argued that the legislative history itself indicatesthat projects are supposed to provide family planning services to women``shortly after childbirth,'' quoting the 1970 House and Conference Reports.Numerous comments objected to the use of the phrase ``abortion-relatedservices'' in the exclusionary portion of the definition of ``family planning''on the ground that the former term was vague and overbroad. In addition,it was argued that the exclusion of ``abortion-related services'' makesthe definition inconsistent in that abortion is excluded as a method offamily planning, while there are repeated references in the remainder ofthe regulation to ``abortion as a method of family planning.'' Supporters of the regulations generally favored adoption of the definitionas proposed. However, a few reservations were expressed concerning itscoverage. It was suggested that the limitation on the provision of abortion-relatedservices and prenatal and adoption services for pregnant women be explainedto clarify that although prenatal and adoption services are not preventivefamily planning services, they are not subject to the same stigma as abortionservices, which are specifically prohibited by the statute. It was thereforesuggested that the regulations should permit and support efficient andformalized referral processes to assure access to prenatal and adoptionservices. It was also suggested that the proposed definition was stillinadequate, in that it would not permit crisis pregnancy centers to befunded as Title X grantees, since abortion counseling which discouragesabortion is not within the definition. 2. ``<T3>Program'' and ``project''</T3>: This proposed definition elicited anumber of comments, primarily from supporters of the proposed rules. Ingeneral, these comments objected to equating the terms program and project,contending that the definition of ``program'' as applied to receipt ofTitle X funds was not consistent with the ordinary usage and meaning ofthe term and allowed grantees artificially to manipulate compliance. Thecommenters argued that the Department's longstanding interpretation ofthe terms as being interchangeable for the purposes of administration ofsection 1008 is wrong and permits projects funded under Title X to evadethe restrictions of section 1008 by simple bookkeeping maneuvers. Proponentswanted to strengthen the regulation to prevent grantees from simply omittingcertain items from their grant proposal while in fact including prohibitedactivities within the program. 3.<T3> Other definitions:</T3> In addition, a few comments suggested thatother terms used in the proposed regulations should be defined in orderto clarify the scope of the regulatory policies. Among the terms that weresuggested for definition were ``abortion,'' ``abortion-related services,''``prenatal services,'' ``low-income family,'' and ``medically indicated.''With respect to the term ``abortion,'' questions were raised about itsmeaning, and it was suggested that procedures such as ``menstrual regulation,''``menstrual extraction,'' and ``endometrial aspiration'' be included inany definition of abortion since these are euphemisms for proecedures whichare actually abortions. The term ``abortion-related services'' was widelycriticized as vague; comments asserted that it could include services suchas housekeeping or laundry if shared by the abortion component of a medicalfacility. With respect to the term ``prenatal services,'' it was suggestedthat the term be defined to include services to protect both maternal andfetal health and that referrals not be allowed where the provider is primarilya provider of abortion services. It was suggested that the current regulatorydefinition of ``low-income family'' be changed to delete the provisionwhich requires that unemancipated minors who wish to receive services ona confidential basis be considered on the basis of their own resources.It was suggested that the term ``medically indicated'' be clearly definedto prohibit referral for abortion or abortion-related services except wherethe life of the mother is in imminent danger as in the case of an ectopicpregnancy, or defined to prohibit any referral for abortion. With respectto the term ``organization,'' proponents of the regulation argued thatit was unclear and appeared to treat as separate organizations an organization'sactivities in several States, creating a cumbersome situation for the grantee.They suggested that the definition be clarified to cover a legal entitychartered in one State and authorized to do business in several States.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Response </ITAG>1. ``<T3>Family planning</T3>'': The Department acknowledges that the definitionhas caused misunderstanding in several respects and has revised the proposeddefinition of this term accordingly. First, it was never the Department'sintention to suggest that contraception is to be de-emphasized in the TitleX program; to make that perfectly clear, it has placed the term ``contraception''at the beginning of the list of services to be provided in the second sentenceof the definition. In addition, it agrees that exclusion of postpartumservices was inappropriate to the extent that it appeared to exclude provisionof preventive methods of family planning in the postpartum period, andhas accordingly eliminated the exclusion from the definition. With respectto the comments criticizing the use of the word ``families,'' the definitionhas been conformed more closely to the language of Title X, clarifyingthat the eligibility of individuals will not be affected by the regulation.Finally, with respect to the argument that the definition of family planningwas logically inconsistent with the rest of the regulation because of theexclusion of ``abortion-related services,'' it has modified the definitionof the term to make clear that while abortion may, in a statutory sense,constitute ``a method of family planning,'' it is an impermissible methodin programs supported by funds appropriated under the title. Although the Department has not accepted the suggestions that it deletethe references to ``adoption'' and ``infertility services'' in their entiretyfrom the definition of ``family planning,'' it has modified the definitionin response to the concerns raised. Both approaches constitute legitimatemeans of determining family size and spacing, but adoption is simply onemeans of addressing the broader problem of infertility. Thus, the term``infertility services'' in the definition has been changed to make thisrelationship clear. With respect to the criticism that the definition shouldbe limited to preventive methods of family planning only, it is clear thatCongress intended the term ``family planning'' to be broader in scope thansimply contraception, as infertility services are included as one of themandatory services listed in section 1001(a) of the Act. With respect tothe comments suggesting that inclusion of infertility services should notpermit funding of in vitro fertilization, surrogate motherhood and similarmethods of providing children to childless couples, the Department continuesto construe the term, as it has in the past, as requiring only the provisionby the Title X project of what are known as ``Level I'' services (<T3>i.e., </T3>initial infertility interview, education, examination, appropriatelaboratory testing, counseling and appropriate referral). The Department notes that a number of the objections to the proposed definitionwere premised on a misinterpretation of its scope. The Department agreesthat family planning is broader than just the provision of contraceptiveservices, but it disagrees that either the proposed definition or the definitionbelow so restrict the term; see, in particular, the inclusion of ``generalreproductive health care'' and ``infertility services'' in the definition.Moreover, it is not correct that the proposed definition would excludephysical examinations, screening for breast cancer or treatment of gynecologicalproblems. All of these services continue to be authorized under the definition,either concomitant to providing contraceptive services or as ``generalreproductive health care.'' In addition, services not related to pregnancywhich are necessary to general reproductive health care, such as treatmentfor sexually transmitted diseases, continue to be authorized under thedefinition. While the Department concurs in comments regarding the importance of earlyaccess to high quality prenatal care, it does not believe that Title Xwas intended to provide prenatal care, and therefore does not accept thesuggestion that the exclusion of prenatal care from the definition of ``familyplanning'' be dropped. It disagrees with the argument that the exclusionis inconsistent with the statute. The 1970 Conference Report to Pub. L.91-572 makes it abundantly clear that while medical services are clearlypermitted under Title X, they are authorized only when related to populationresearch, infertility services of preventive family planning services.The exclusion of prenatal care is consistent with this concept.In addition, provision of prenatal services, like the requirement for pregnancyoptions counseling, was not included in program guidelines prior to 1981.Moreover, under the 1981 program guidelines, prenatal services (other thaninitial diagnosis and counseling) may only be provided by Title X projectsin very specific and limited circumstances and with prior approval fromthe relevant regional office of the Department. Since 1981, very few TitleX projects have requested or received this authority. At the present time,for instance, we are aware of only two grantees in one region that havereceived approval to provide extended prenatal services as part of theirTitle X projects. Thus, it is not correct, as contended by some commenters,that prenatal services have traditionally been a major component of theTitle X program. Nor does the Department agree with the commenters thatthe exclusion represents unsound public health policy, so long as it isclear that the Title X project must facilitate obtaining the prenatal carenecessary for a healthy pregnancy. Because Title X has never funded substantialamounts of prenatal care and thus availability of prenatal services wouldbe unaffected by these provisions, the Department does not agree that lowincome clients will receive inferior care to what they are now receiving.Indeed, the provisions emphasize the importance of helping clients to receiveappropriate prenatal care through referral. The Department concurs in comments that the regulations should clarifythat, although beyond the scope of Title X, prenatal services and adoptionservices for pregnant clients do not fall under the same statutory prohibitionthat abortion services do. The regulation thus clarifies that, while TitleX does not fund prenatal care, Title X projects are required to facilitateaccess to prenatal care and social services, including adoption services,that might be needed by the pregnant client to promote her well-being andthat of her child, while making it abundantly clear that the project isnot permitted to promote abortion by facilitating access to abortion throughthe referral process. See the definition of ``prenatal care'' at andSection;andSection;59.2and 59.8 below. Finally, the Department rejects the argument that these regulations areobjectionable because they create a ``two-tier'' system of health care,<T3>i.e., </T3>clients of Title X programs, many of whom are low-income,are prohibited from receiving abortion counseling and referral, while wealthywomen can obtain these services from their own physicians. In section 1008Congress chose to prohibit the provision of abortion services by TitleX programs. This choice_like any choice to impose restrictions on the useof federal funds_necessarily creates a ``two-tier'' system to the extentthat any legally obtainable service is available in the marketplace andunavailable in the federal program where such services are prohibited bylaw. Commenters may believe that this is unsound as a matter of socialpolicy because they believe the federal government should fund all medicalcare. If so, however, their remedy lies with Congress, not with the Departmentwhich manifestly lacks the legal authority to implement such a social policy.2. <T3>``Program'' or ``project''</T3>: The Department believes that it isnot supportable, in light of the legislative history in the 1970 ConferenceReport, to read the term ``program'' in section 1008 as relating to thefunded organization as a whole, as urged by some comments. The Departmentagrees that a Title X project must be separate and distinct from abortionactivity and that ``simply omitting offending items from their grant proposals''does not constitute sufficient compliance with this precept. Indeed, thisis the rationale for promulgation of andSection;59.9 below. However, in response to the confusion expressed by many commenters on thisissue, the Department has changed the rules below to provide a separatedefinition of the term ``program''' and ``project'' that recognizes thegeneric meaning of those terms as use in the statute and their commonlyunderstood usage in the grantee community. Two new terms, ``Title X program''and ``Title X project,'' have been added corresponding to the originaldefinition of program and project in the proposed rules. These latter terms,as defined below, carry substantially the same meaning as originally proposedand clarify the scope of the regulatory requirements. However, to clarifya point that apparently confused many commenters, a sentence has been addedin the latter definition relating to what constitutes Title X project funds.The Department's concern is that all funds allocated to the Title X programor project_whether they are direct Title X grant funds, program or grant-relatedincome, or matching fund_be spent in compliance with section 1008 and thatthe program be separate and distinct from prohibited abortion activities.The definition in the final regulation accomplishes this statutory mandate.The above definitional changes necessitated minor conforming changes tothe existing regulations. These changes are set out at items 4 and 6 inthe rules below. 3. <T3>Other definitions: </T3>The Department has defined the term ``prenatalcare'' in response to the public comments on this issue. It has not includedany other definitions as it does not agree that they are needed or appropriatehere. It has deleted the definition of the term ``organization'' becauseit believes the definition is self-evident and unnecessary. The Departmenthas not defined the term ``medically indicated'' because, as used in andSection;59.5(b)(1),it refers to an infinite variety of physical conditions aside from pregnancy,making further definition infeasible. As the proposed rules did not addressthe issue of defining the term ``low income family,'' the definition remainsunchanged. The term ``abortion-related services'' has not been definedbecause it is no longer employed in the text of the rules below. The Departmenthas not defined the term ``abortion'' because it believes the meaning isclear. II. Standards of Compliance The proposed rules provided that a project may not receive funds unlessit provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that it does not includeabortion as a method of family planning. Such assurances must include representations(supported by documentary evidence where the Secretary requests) as tocompliance with each of the requirements of the proposed regulations. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comments </ITAG>Some commenters suggested that provisions be added which would prohibitthe funding of a program where there are special risks that Title X fundswill be used for abortion-related activities due to abortion advocacy activitiesof the organization. They maintained that recognition of organizationshaving special risks, and denial of funding where such risks exist, willfacilitate the implementation of the Title X program as Congress originallyintended. Commenters then went on to list serveral examples of specialrisks associated with grants to advocacy organizations, including situationswhich would place an abortion advocacy organization in a government-sponsoredposition of great influence with persons of special vulnerability, facilitateabortion in conflict with the purpose of the Title X program, or make personnelchoices for reasons foreign to the purpose of the grant. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. </ITAG><T3>Response</T3>The Department notes that the suggested provisions relating to advocacyorganizations were derived from the Public Health Service's (PHS) GrantsAdministration Manual policy relating to ``Exceptional Organizations,''a policy which has recently been revised by the Department. While the Departmentagrees with the concept behind the proposed provision, it believes thatit is more appropriate to deal with the issue on a broader PHS-wide level.Furthermore, the Department believes that the risks associated with fundingadvocacy organizations will be substantially mitigated through implementationof the requirement of separation between Title X programs and activitiesprohibited under section 1008 and the rules pursuant thereto.III. CounselingSection 59.8 of the proposed rules provided, among other things, that aproject which<ITAG tagnum="20">provides counseling * * * for abortion services as a method of familyplanning is not eligible to receive funds under this subpart. In addition,because Title X funds are intended only for family planning, services relatedto pregnancy care after pregnancy is diagnosed may not be provided withTitle X funds.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Proposed andSection; 59.8(a). In addition, proposed andSection; 59.8(b)set out three examples interpreting the regulatory language relating tocounseling: proposed andSection; 59.8(b)(1) related to the provision of prenatalservices by the Title X project, which was termed impermissible; proposedandSection; 59.8(b)(3) related to counseling for infertility and adoptionfor an infertile couple, which was termed permissible; and proposed andSection;59.8(b)(4) related to the provision by the project of a brochure and afilm that include sections on abortion, which was deemed to render theproject ineligible for Title X funds.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. </ITAG><T3>Comments</T3>These provisions elicited the most extensive comments of any provisionsof the proposed rules. Thousands of comments were received in oppositionto the proposed provisions, while thousands likewise were received supportingthe proposed policies. The main issues addressed by opponents and proponentsare summarized below.Opponents of the counseling provisions advanced the following objections:(1) They would require providers to engage in unethical and unprofessionalcounduct; (2) they would require providers to treat Title X patients, bothfor contraceptive services and at the point of pregnancy diagnosis, withoutinformed consent; (3) because of the two preceding factors, Title X projectswould be exposed to increased risk of tort liability, an increase in insurancecosts or inability to obtain insurance, and a decreased ability to hireor retain competent family planning professionals; (4) these factors wouldin turn mean that, as a practical matter, present Title X projects wouldbe forced to relinquish their title X funds, resulting in a net loss ofservices to the Title X client population; (5) there is no evidence toshow that the proposed provisions are needed; (6) the proposed provisionsare inconsistent with Title X; (7) the proposed provisions violate theFirst Amendment rights of providers and health professionals in that theyconstitute viewpoint discrimination and restriction of free speech; and(8) the proposed provisions impermissibly burden women's exercise of theirright to an abortion and violate the due process rights of physicians andother health professionals to practice their profession.Proponents of the regulations, on the other hand, argued that the proposedprovisions are needed to strengthen the implementation of section 1008.They contended that Title X is in effect promoting abortion through currentguidelines and practice, and the provisions would substantially correctthis. They also contended that the counseling requirements in current guidelineswrongfully require organizations to engage in abortion-related activitiesin order to become a Title X grantee. Further, they maintained that suchguideline requirements have been abused by Title X providers, who havein fact pressured pregnant women, particularly teenagers, to choose abortion.They maintained that the consequent loss of life involved, together withthe emotional and physical effects on the women who aborted, are unacceptablein a program which was intended to have no connection with abortion atall, much less with the promotion or facilitation of abortion.1. <T3>Medical ethics:</T3> Numerous providers, provider organizations, andhealth professionals argued that the proposed restriction of abortion counselingis countrary to sound medical practice and the canons of medical ethics.Basically, they contended that medical ethics require that a physicianprovide his patient with a full discussion of his view of her medical circumstancesin order to enable her to make an informed choice as to treatment; nursesand social workers stated similar concerns. In this regard, a number ofcomments quoted the following statement from the 1982 Report of the President'sCommission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and in Biomedicaland Behavioral Research;<ITAG tagnum="20">a physician is obligated to mention all alternative treatments, includingthose he or she does not provide or favor, so long as they are supportedby respectable medical opinion.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Also cited were the American Medical Association's (AMA) principlesof medical ethics, which state that patients ``are entitled to accept orreject a health care intervention on the basis of their own personal values,''and the <T3>Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Service,</T3> Sixth Edition, (<T3>Standards</T3>) of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,which state:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the physician's responsibility to inform the patient of thesurgical or medical procedure being recommended. In most cases, the explanationshould include the necessity of the treatment, the management alternatives,the reasonably foreseeable risks and hazards involved, the chances of recoveryand the likelihood of desired outcome. Adequate opportunity should be providedto encourage and answer questions.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It was asserted that the proposed provisions would require providersto violate the canons of ethics governing their professions and therebyexpose them to liability for malpractice. In this regard, opponents ofthe provisions stated that the provisions would require them to treat womendifferently depending on their medical circumstances. For example, theprovision was commonly interpreted as meaning that a nonpregnant womanwho has a severe diabetic or hypertensive condition could, under the provision,be counseled with respect to management of the condition, while a pregnantwoman could not be.It was also argued that the provision would require physicians to remainsilent when confronted with a pregnant patient with medical conditionswhich may be exacerbated by pregnancy, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis,lupus, or AIDS. These commenters apparently interpreted the provision asprecluding any further discussion of medical symptoms or any other matteronce pregnancy is diagnosed. Other commenters maintained that since therisks associated with both pregnancy and abortion increase substantiallyonce the eighth week of pregnancy has passed, it is unethical to withholdinformation about both at the time pregnancy is diagnosed.Proponents of the provisions, however, disputed that prohibiting discussionof abortion is unethical and instead contended that the requirements for``options counseling'' in current guidelines are the ethical problem. Itwas noted, for example, that the House of Delegates of the AMA has consistentlyconfirmed the right of practitioners to abstain from involvement in abortions.In this regard, it was argued that the ethical standard inherent in theAMA standards and elsewhere is not that a physician must counsel or refer,but rather that the physician <T3>need not</T3> counsel or refer for abortion. It was noted that lawsin approximately 40 states protect the right of medical personnel not toparticipate in medical procedures such as abortion on the basis of conscience.Some maintained that as providers in a preventive family planning program,Title X providers are not qualified to provide services after pregnancyis confirmed.Numerous commenters argued that the policy of requiring Title X providersto perform nondirective counseling that has been applicable in the pastviolates medical ethics by excluding from the program organizations which,for moral or religious reasons, refuse to counsel or refer women for abortions.In addition, many comments argued that the practice of nondirective counselinghas been subject to widespread abuse, with many providers foregoing anybalanced discussion of options in favor of pressuring women, particularlyteenagers, to obtain abortions.Other comments argued that by requiring ``options counseling,'' the TitleX guidelines promote a moral relativism which holds that all options areequally valid morally, without providing for the expression of moral argumentsopposed to abortion or discussion of potential psychological consequencesof abortion. This, it is argued, results in abortion being presented asthe easiest, quickest, and least harmful solution when in fact it may notbe, and when it should in any event not be so presented in a program thathas a statutory bias against abortion as a method of family planning.2. <T3>Informed consent</T3>: Opponents of the proposed provisions expressedsimilar concerns relating to the issue of obtaining informed consent soas to minimize the likelihood of malpractice claims. While most of thecomments relating to the issue of informed consent raised the liabilityconcerns discussed in the preceding section, a number of additional concernswere also raised. A number of grantees and provider organizations arguedthat prohibiting provision of information relating to abortion precludesobtaining an informed consent from the patient, either with respect tocontinuation of pregnancy or with respect to selection of a method of birthcontrol. This, it was argued, would place grantees in the position of violatinglaws relating to informed consent of over 40 states; specifically mentionedwere California, Maryland, Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, and Wisconsin.Proponents of the regulations, on the other hand, argued that the requirementof informed consent, in jurisdictions where it applies, applies only tomedical treatment, not to counseling which leads to referral. Since theproposed rules provided that pregnant women would not receive treatmentfor pregnancy in the Title X project, the requirement to obtain informedconsent for services relating to pregnancy does not arise. They also arguedthat the informed consent laws of various states would not present a problemfor Title X providers, as they would be superseded, pursuant to the SupremacyClause of the Constitution, to the extent they imposed requirements inconsistentwith Federal regulation. Those who stated that they had an abortion andhad not been counseled about its effects argued that they could not haveinformed consent because they had not been given complete information.3. <T3>Liability and licensure risks</T3>: Because of the foregoing factors,many providers and provider organizations argued that the proposed provisionspresent unacceptable risks for providers. Specifically, they argued thatfailure to disclose relevant risks and considerations to individuals, eitherin the process of counseling regarding the selection of a method of birthcontrol or concerning pregnancy once pregnancy is diagnosed, would subjectthem to liability for malpractice on several possible tort grounds: defectiveconsent, abandonment, negligent failure to disclose, ``wrongful birth''/``wrongfullife''. Cases such as <T3>Canterbury </T3>v. <T3>Spence, </T3>464 F. 2d 772 (D.C. Cir., 1972), <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>Bradford</T3>, 606 P. 2d 554 (Okla., 1979), <T3>Betesh </T3>v. <T3>U.S.</T3>, 400 F. Supp. 238 (D.D.C., 1974) were cited as examples ofthe types of tort liability to which the proposed provisions would exposeproviders. Accordingly, some commenters asserted that they would probably face suitif they complied with the proposed provisions, and, moreover, might findthat they were uninsurable. It was also argued that compliance with theproposed provisions would place health professionals (particularly physicians)in many jurisdictions at risk of losing their licenses. For example, theAttorney General for the State of Massachusetts stated that physicianscould lose their licenses in Massachusetts if they complied with the regulations.It was argued that health professionals would find these risks unacceptable.Thus, it was claimed that the regulations would mean that Title X providerswould be unable to attract or retain competent professional staff. Proponents of the regulations, on the other hand, argued that the sameSupremacy Clause considerations described in the preceding section wouldprotect providers from successful suit. They accordingly argued that theproposed regulations should not increase providers' liability and licensurerisks. 4. <T3>Impact on Title X client population</T3>: Opponents of the proposedprovisions thus argued, based on the above reasons, that the net effectof the proposed provisions relating to counseling would be to force currentTitle X providers to reject Title X funds entirely. A number of commentsargued that the proposed provisions are inconsistent with requirementsapplicable under other State and federal programs (such as the programsof grants to migrant and community health centers under sections 329 and330 of the Public Health Service Act and block grants to States for maternaland child health programs under Title V of the Social Security Act). Commentersmaking this point contended that they would have to elect between sourcesof funding; they typically stated that they would reject Title X funds.Thus, it was argued, a net loss of services to the population currentlyserved by Title X would result. Planned Parenthood of Pierce County, Washington,for instance, said that if it rejected Title X funds, approximately 5,000low income women in that county would be placed at risk of unwanted pregnancies;Planned Parenthood of Chicago said that if it rejected Title X funds, ``tensof thousands'' of teenage and low income women would be placed at risk.Proponents, however, asserted that the regulations would have a positiveimpact on Title X clients and their babies by helping protect pregnantclients, particularly adolescents, from receiving incomplete counselingthat in effect promoted abortion and facilitated obtaining an abortion,to the client's (and, obviously, the unborn child's) long-term emotionaland physical detriment. Some commenters noted that privacy and confidentialityrequirements surrounding counseling make it difficult, if not impossible,to reflect the substance of counseling in auditable records in order todiscern whether or not in fact clients, especially highly vulnerable andimpressionable teens, are being coerced into abortion decisions. Otherproponents argued that the regulations would protect women from pregnancycounseling by unqualified personnel since most Title X programs do nothave the time to provide the intense support required during the earlystages of a problem pregnancy. Proponents noted that decisions about familiesinvolve more than just medical counseling and that given the potentiallyserious consequences of abortion, women are best served by providers outsidethe Title X program who may counsel in greater depth about pregnancy.5. <T3>Rational basis for regulations:</T3> Related to the above concernswas the criticism articulated in many comments that the proposed provisionsare irrational or are simply not needed. Some comments contended that thetheory advanced to justify the proposed prohibition of counseling_thatcounseling and referral ``encourage or promote'' abortion_is incorrect.In particular, many of these comments took issue with the statement thatthe provision of information on abortion is pointless absent the expectationthat some of those informed will act upon the information and that thepurpose of counseling programs is to provide information upon which a courseof action will be based on the ground that it equated the provision ofinformation on mutually exclusive choices with promotion of a particularchoice. It was argued that, under the theory advanced in the proposed rules,counseling teenagers about contraceptive methods or suicide would neverbe appropriate. Furthermore, with respect to the issue of evidence, numerousgrantees stated that they have always been and are presently in compliancewith the requirement to separate their Title X projects from their abortion-relatedprojects. A number of these comments challenged the evidentiary basis forthe Department's action, arguing that the 1982 GAO and Inspector Generalreports cited in support of the proposed rules in fact established thatthe audited grantees had not spent Title X funds in contravention of section1008.Proponents of the proposed rules, on the other hand, overwhelmingly thoughtthat the proposed restrictions were needed. As noted in the Rational BasisSection and in section IIIA1 above, many individuals wrote in relatingpersonal experience of abuse of the counseling process. Numerous otherindividuals and groups argued that nondirective counseling is inappropriatein a program in which abortion is a prohibited method of family planningand in which it is clearly viewed as an undesirable alternative to childbirth.Others argued that these counseling practices promote the use of abortionas a method of family planning by helping a pregnant woman obtain an abortion.They expressed the opinion that safeguards were needed to ensure that pregnantwomen are not pressured into having abortions by Title X-funded projects.Others argued that Title X projects should actively discourage women fromobtaining abortions by providing full information describing the abortionprocedure and its potential physical, emotional and psychological effects,as well as providing full information on fetal development.6. <T3>Statutory authority:</T3> Hundreds of comments questioned the statutoryauthority for the proposed prohibition of abortion counseling. Numerouscomments suggested that the provisions would prevent informed consent andare, therefore, inconsistent with the requirement of sections 1001 and1007 of the Act that services be ``voluntary.'' It was also argued thatsection 1008 itself defines abortion as a method of family planning (albeitone for which funds under the title are not available) and that thereforethe statement in the legislative history of the 1970 act that ``informationwould be provided on the full range of family planning methods,'' meansthat abortion counseling must be provided notwithstanding the prohibition.Representative Dingell criticized the use of his 1970 floor statementsas support for the proposed restrictions on counseling and referral. Hiscomments focused in particular on what he saw as the failure of the Departmentto take account of the evolution of the law, that is, the Supreme Court'sdecision in <T3>Row </T3>v. <T3>Wade,</T3> 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and its progeny. It was also arguedthat the proposed provision is inconsistent with the Department's own regulationsin the food and drug area, which the comments contend require manufacturersof oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices to provide patient packageinserts explaining the risks of the respective contraceptive methods, includingsome information on abortion. Numerous providers contended that, underthe regulations, they would be prohibited from prescribing or dispensingcontraceptives containing such inserts which would, as a practical matter,have the effect of restricting the methods available under Title X to barriermethods, foams, and natural family planning. Therefore, it was argued,such a restriction is contrary to the mandate of Title X that projectsoffer a ``broad range'' of family planning methods. Finally, it was arguedthat there is no legal authority for changing the current Title X guidelines,which require that counseling on abortion, prenatal care, adoption andfoster care be provided to pregnant women.These comments maintained that the guidelines are clearly known by Congress,which has implicitly approved of them in successive reauthorizations ofthe program and explicitly approved them in language in the ConferenceReport on Departmental appropriation for FY 1987, Pub. L. 99-1005.Proponents, on the other hand, generally argued that the policies embodiedin the present Title X guidelines contravene section 1008, and that theproposed restrictions on counseling are statutorily required or at a minimumwould better effectuate the section 1008 prohibition. As noted above, theyexpressed the view that abortion or options counseling results in the promotionof abortion, and is therefore inappropriate in a preventive family planningprogram which its authors clearly intended to have no connection with abortionother than to reduce the incidence thereof. The guidelines, it was argued,had converted Title X from a program in which abortion was supposed tobe prohibited into a program which in fact promotes abortion as a methodof family planning. It was also noted that, during the 1978 reauthorizationof the program, an amendment to prohibit abortion counseling and referralwas rejected as unnecessary given the prohibition of section 1008. Further,the primary purpose of Title X as being a preventive family planning programwas reiterated.7. <T3>First Amendment:</T3> A common argument against the proposed provisionswere that they constitute unconstitutional viewpoint-based discrimination.According to the comments, under cases such as <T3>F.C.C. </T3>v. <T3>League of Women Voters,</T3> 468 U.S. 364 (1984), <T3>Perry</T3> v. <T3>Sindermann,</T3> 408 U.S. 593 (1972), and <T3>Speiser </T3>v. <T3>Randall,</T3> 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958), the government may not interferewith the exercise of the right of free speech. The comments argued thatthis principle applies not only to direct interference, but also to indirectinterference, such as attaching unconstitutional conditions to a governmentalbenefit, penalizing advocacy of a certain viewpoint, or selectively grantingbenefits only to those advocating particular viewpoints. The comments contendedthat the proposed provisions contravene this principle by prohibiting TitleX funds from going to organizations that seek to provide all viewpointsabout potential options, including the abortion option, while permittingfunding under Title X of organizations that have or express solely theviewpoint that abortion is not an option in the management of pregnancy.A related argument was that the proposed provisions violate the First Amendmentrights of Title X health care professionals to express their views andthe rights of their clients to obtain information from their doctors. <T3>Perry </T3>v. <T3>Sindermann, supra; Lamont </T3>v. <T3>Postmaster </T3><T3>General,</T3> 381 U.S. 301, 308 (1965) (Brennan, J., concurring). Citing<T3>Board of </T3><T3>Education </T3><T3>(Island Trees)</T3> v. <T3>Pico,</T3> 457 U.S. 853 (1982) and <T3>Griswold </T3>v. <T3>Connecticut,</T3> 381 U.S. 479 (1965), some comments took the positionthat the proposed provisions represent an impermissible attempt by thegovernment to ``restrict the spectrum of available knowledge'' about familyplanning and abortion.Proponents of the proposed restrictions generally argued that they werefully constitutional and in no way violated the First Amendment as interpretedby the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Regan</T3> v. <T3>Taxation Without Representation,</T3> 461 U.S. 540 (1983). In <T3>Regan</T3> the Court upheld as constitutional an internal revenue statutegranting tax exemption for certain nonprofit organizations that do notengage in substantial lobbying activities. It was argued that the <T3>Regan</T3> decision establishes the principle that a governmental decisionnot to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringeupon the right and that the government may adopt classifications with respectto subsidizing the exercise of First Amendment rights, so long as the classificationsbear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose. Sincethe decision in <T3>Harris </T3>v. <T3>McRae, supra,</T3> establishes that the government may choose to promotechildbirth, the proposed policies are constitutional.8. <T3>Unconstitutional interference with right to abortion, right to practicemedicine:</T3> A number of comments argued that the proposed provisionsprohibiting counseling regarding abortion are unconstitutional in thatthey impermissibly burden a woman's right to obtain abortion and interferewith the doctor-patient relationship safeguarded by <T3>Roe</T3> v. <T3>Wade, supra.</T3> It was argued that the proposed provisions are invalidon the same basis as the Akron, Ohio ordinance struck down in <T3>City of Akron </T3>v. <T3>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</T3> 462 U.S. 416 (1983),in that both limit the presentation of information to pregnant women relativeto the abortion decision so as to discourage them from choosing abortion.Thus, under the rationale of <T3>City of Akron,</T3> it was claimed that the proposed provisions bothimpermissibly interfere with the woman's right to make an informed choiceand impermissibly intrude upon her physician's right to provide medicaladvice and treatment. It was asserted, in connection with this line ofreasoning, that the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Harris</T3> v. <T3>McRae</T3> does not insulate counseling restrictions from constitutionalattack, as that decision only relates to a governmental decision to subsidizethe operation itself; restrictions on counseling, by contrast, were saidto directly interfere with the freedom of choice protected under <T3>Roe </T3>v. <T3>Wade.</T3> The decision in <T3>Planned Parenthood Ass'n.</T3>)<T3> Chicago Area </T3>v. <T3>Kempiners,</T3> 531 F. Supp. 320, 326 (N.D. Ill. 1981), vacated andremanded on other grounds, 700 F.2d 115 (7 Cir. 1983), <T3>aff'd on rehearing,</T3> 568 F. Supp. 1490 (N.D. Ill. 1983) was citedin support of this proposition. Many comments noted, in this regard, therecent decision in <T3>Reproductive Health Services </T3>v. <T3>Webster,</T3> 662 F. Supp. 407 (W.D. Mo., March 17, 1987), in whicha Federal district court concluded that restrictions on a state-supportedclinic counseling and referring for abortion were unconstitutional insofaras they applied to women who paid the full cost of their treatment:<ITAG tagnum="21">Patients who fully pay for their services would be denied access tomedical information which may affect their decision whether to continuethe pregnancy, perhaps enduring health risks. Here the State is not askedto subsidize abortions or the exercise of First Amendment rights. 662 F.Supp. at 427.</ITAG>These comments contended that this reasoning applies to Title X clinics,as a significant percentage of the clients served by Title X projects arefull-pay. Proponents of the regulations took the position that the proposed provisionson counseling are constitutional. According to the proponents, the SupremeCourt ruled in <T3>Harris </T3>v. <T3>McRae, supra, </T3>that the government may constitutionally decideto subsidize childbirth over abortion, and the mere denial of governmentsubsidy for abortion does not constitute a constitutionally impermissibleobstacle to the exercise of the right to abortion. Thus, they argued, thisnecessarily means that the government may likewise subsidize speech andactions designed to further childbirth and decline to subsidize speechand actions that facilitate abortion. Such remedies are necessary to endthe confusion which exists where clients, especially adolescents, may seethe interaction between federally funded projects and abortion services.Proponents wanted to sever the ``symbolic union'' between the federal programand private programs which promote or provide abortions. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Response </ITAG>The Department recognizes the problems created by the proposed provisionwith respect to patient package inserts for contraceptives and otherwiselimiting the provision of information which is medically necessary to understandingthe relative risks of different methods of contraception in the courseof selecting a method of family planning; it has therefore modified therequirements and examples accordingly. See 42 CFR 59.8(a)(4) and 59.8(b)(6)below. However, it disagrees with the remaining comments opposing the proposedrestrictions on counseling and therefore the provisions otherwise remainsubstantially as proposed. The Department notes that many of the objectionsstated appear to be based on a misinterpretation of the scope and applicationof the counseling restriction. It has accordingly clarified the provisions.The explanation below likewise attempts to clarify the provisions, andalso sets out the Department's reasons for rejecting the remaining commentsopposing the provisions. 1. <T3>Medical ethics: </T3>The Department believes that much of the oppositionto the proposed restriction on counseling proceeds from a misunderstandingas to what is prohibited by the provision and what is not. It was not theintent of the provision to restrict the ability of health professionalsto communicate to a patient any information they discover in the courseof physical examination or otherwise about her medical condition. Contraryto the assumption of most commenters, doctors would not be precluded bythe provision from informing a woman, pregnant or nonpregnant, that shehas a tumor, AIDS, a diabetic or hypertensive condition, lupus, and soon. The provision thus does not preclude a health professional from disclosingto the woman any physical findings he or she has made regarding her conditionand communicating his or her assessment of the urgency of the need fortreatment, consistent with the exercise of his or her professional judgment.By the same token, however, there would appear to be no ethical imperativefor a health professional at a Title X clinic which will, by definition,not be providing treatment services to counsel a woman who displays a medicalcondition unrelated to family planning as to the medical management ofthat condition. Nor, it should be noted, is Title X money available forthe treatment of medical conditions unrelated to family planning. The sameconsiderations apply where pregnancy is diagnosed. See andSection;andSection;59.8(a)(2) and 59.8(a)(3) below. Rather, as has traditionally been thecase in the Title X program and as is required by 42 CFR 59.5(b)(1) and59.8(a)(2) below, the medically responsible course is to ensure that thewoman is referred to the appropriate specialist for treatment of the condition,with adequate followup provided. In the Department's view, the foregoing considerations address the ethicalobjections to the proposed provisions. The Department notes that if anyrequirement is established with regard to abortion counseling, it willconflict with someone's ethical beliefs. The approach of the proposed regulations,however, is more consistent with section 1008. Moreover, it is apparentthat there is no absolute ethical imperative upon physicians to counselor refer for abortion, as evidenced by the ``conscience'' exceptions citedby proponents of the provision. Opponents contend that the proposed rulesare contrary to the findings of the President's Commission for the Studyof Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.However, the Commission also found that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Patients are not entitled to insist that health care practitionersfurnish them services when to do so would breach the bounds of acceptablepractice or violate a professional's own deeply held moral beliefs or woulddraw on a limited resource to which the patient has no binding claim. (<T3>Making Health Care Decisions, </T3>Vol. 1, p. 3.)</ITAG>Although abortion may be considered to be within the bounds of acceptablemedical practice, it may potentially conflict with the professional's deeplyheld moral beliefs. Moreover, since Title X resources are clearly limited,the patient has no claim to the services relating to the provisions ofabortion. The Commission went on the say that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, a professional who has been flexible about possible avenuesof treatment as his/her standards allow is not generally obligated to accedeto the patient in a way that violates the bounds of acceptable medicalpractice or the provider's own deeply held moral beliefs. <T3>id.</T3> (Vol. 1, p. 38.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similarly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistssupport the physician is right ``[t]o refuse to render treatment whichis inconsistent with the Fellow's own moral code.'' (<T3>Standards,</T3> p. 99.) 2. <T3>Informed consent</T3>: The Department disagrees with the numerous commentsobjecting to the proposed restriction on counseling for abortion as restrictinga pregnant woman's ability to give informed consent. As a general matter,a requirement for informed consent only arises where a course of treatmentis proposed. See, <T3>Canterbury</T3> v. <T3>Spence,</T3> <T3>supra.</T3> Section 59.8(a) below makes clear that where a woman isdiagnosed as pregnant, the only appropriate action is a referral for appropriatetreatment (which, as noted above, would include treatment for other conditionsunrelated to pregnancy). Since the Title X project is not providing treatmentrelated to pregnancy (or, indeed, for other conditions unrelated to familyplanning), it has no need to obtain consent to such treatment. Rather,it becomes the responsibility of the provider to whom the woman is referredto obtain appropriate consent to services: as the <T3>Standards</T3> of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistsstate, ``[i]t is the physician's responsibility to inform the patient ofthe nature of the surgical or medical procedure being recommended. In mostcases, the explanation should include the <T3>necessity </T3>of the <T3>treatment * * *'' </T3>(emphasis added) (<T3>Standards, </T3>p. 84). This situation is in essence no different thanthe situation that currently exists in the Title X program with respectto services that are not offered by the project. In the Department's view,this issue is thus not a problem, and the concerns expressed by providersregarding violating State laws requiring informed consent with respectto their treatment of pregnant women are therefore misplaced. A conceptually different issue is presented with respect to the issue ofinformed consent to family planning services, since in the context theTitle X project is the provider of treatment services. However, as notedabove, the Department has modified the rule to make it clear that projectsare not prohibited from providing the factual information necessary toassess the risks and benefits of various methods of family planning whichis provided by means of the patient package inserts accompanying variousforms of contraception. Thus, the projects remain in substantially thesame posture they have always been in with respect to the provision ofinformation at this stage: they may provide the factual information necessaryto assess risks of a particular contraceptive method as set out in thepatient package inserts, but may not promote or encourage abortion as amethod of family planning. Indeed, the Department notes and concurs inCongressman Dingell's floor statement of November 16, 1970, in which hestated, ``the prevalence of abortion as a substitute or backup method offamily planning can reduce the effectiveness of family planning programs.''Cong. Rec., daily ed., p 37375 (Nov. 16, 1970). This clarification thusresponds to the concerns raised regarding provision of complete informationon the risks of various forms of contraception. At the same time, it ensuresthat the project in no way promotes abortion and that, at the point atwhich abortion becomes more than a hypothetical issue (pregnancy), theproject refers the woman for prenatal pregnancy care rather than providing``options counseling,'' which could violate section 1008 by influencingher choice toward abortion. 3. <T3>Liability and licensure risks</T3>: For the reasons stated in the precedingsections, the Department is of the view that the ``parade of horribles''depicted in many of the comments with respect to the risk of tort liabilityand loss of licensure is invalid. In fact, physicians are excepted fromdisclosing common, known or usual information or risks to treatment. See,<T3>Bly</T3> v. <T3>Rhoads,</T3> 222 S.E. 2d 783 (Va. 1976). Abortion is clearly a commonand known procedure, and Title X is not the sole source of informationabout it. Indeed, since Title X projects are already prohibited under thepresent regulations and guidelines from taking any affirmative action tofacilitate abortion, many of the ``risks'' attributed to the asserted failureof the provisions to make abortion available have already been assumed.Moreover, the <T3>Canterbury</T3> case cited by many of the opponents does not presuadethe Department that the rules below significantly increase the risk ofliability: the court in <T3>Canterbury</T3> held that liability will not lie unless a plaintiffcan establish that a reasonable person would have taken a different courseof action had full disclosure been made, an extremely difficult burdenunder the rules below, given the referral requirements. In addition, tothe extent these regulations are inconsistent with the provisions of Statelaw regarding counseling and informed consent, they may, in some circumstances,supersede State law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. See,for example, <T3>Leslie Miller, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>State of Arkansas,</T3> 352 U.S. 187 (1956); <T3>Planned Parenthood of Billings, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>The State of Montana</T3>, 648 F. Supp. 47 (D. Mont. 1986). Thus, providerpreceptions notwithstanding, the Department does not anticipate that theregulations below will place Title X providers at risk.4. <T3>Impact on Title X client population: </T3>The Department recognizesthat the regulations below may result in some realignment of Title X providers,as providers who disagree with the regulations drop out of the programand other providers enter it. However, it notes that most of the commentstaking this position appeared to be concerned principally with what wasperceived to be a prohibition on providing patient package inserts fororal contraceptives and IUDs, a policy which, as explained both above andbelow, is not contained in the rules below. The Department is thus unpersuadedthat such a realignment will occur, or if any realignment in fact occurs,that it will have a significant negative impact on the Title X client population.Indeed, the Department intends that the rules have a positive impact onthe Title X population by helping to assure that scarce resources are allocatedto preventive family planning and infertility services, not to assistingpregnant clients to obtain an abortion.5. <T3>Rational basis for regulations: </T3>With respect to the comments criticizingthe theoretical basis for the restriction on counseling, the Departmentthinks they are misplaced. Indeed, the comments concerning contraceptivecounseling support the Department's point, as both the purpose of and thedemonstrated effect of contraceptive counseling is to promote the use ofcontraception. Some commenters attempted to apply the Department's analysison counseling to a hypothetical example of preventing teen suicides. Thehypothetical example in fact reveals the flaw in the critics' arguments.Given the state's interest in protecting life, Congress might well establishprograms to provide teenagers or others with ``directive'' counseling onsuicide_that is, counseling that encourages teenagers not to commit suicide.However, if Congress enacted a statutory grant program to provide mentalhealth services to reduce the incidence of mental illness, including suicide,and included a provision that ``none of the funds appropriated under thistitle shall be used in programs where suicide is a method of alleviatingmental illness,'' the Department assumes that no one would argue that sucha statute permitted_much less required_that the provision of ``nondirective''counseling to the depressed adolescent would include suicide as one ofthe options followed by ``mere referral'' to organizations such as theHemlock Society for those who indicated that they wanted to choose thesuicide option. If the Department is correct as to the interpretation thatwould be given such a hypothetical statutory prohibition on suicide, itcannot see why the same statutory language acquires a different meaningwhen ``abortion'' is substituted for ``suicide.''It may well be that, based on differing assessments of the relative moralityof abortion and suicide, some might find nondirective options counselingconcerning abortion morally acceptable while they would find nondirectiveoptions counseling concerning suicide unacceptable. Such a distinction,however, would reflect their moral choice, not their interpretation ofstatutory language_it certainly would not be based on any belief that nondirectiveoptions counseling would be any less likely to promote or encourage abortionthat it would be to promote or encourage suicide.The Department's responsibility, however, is not to make moral choicesof this sort_it is to implement the choice that Congress made in enactingsection 1008. As indicated earlier, upon reexamination of the statutorylanguage, the Department is simply unable to conclude that the type ofcounseling and referral that has been required by the program guidelineshas not had the effect of promoting or encouraging abortion in violationof the statutory prohibition in section 1008.In addition, the Department disagrees with the contention that the 1982GAO Report does not substantiate the need for the provisions below. Asnoted above, GAO found that grantees were engaging in questionable activitiesrelating to counseling and referral and ascribed this in major part tothe lack of concrete guidance from the Department. The comments from womenwho have received abortions quoted above embody the concern articulatedby GAO and indicate that the policy of the present guidelines requiringTitle X grantees to provide nondirective counseling on all options on requestmay have been violated. Moreover, given that the Title X projects do notprovide pregnancy services, it is unnecessary for them to provide counselingwith respect to such services. In light of these concerns, the Departmenthas concluded that the best way to safeguard Title X funds from being usedto promote or facilitate abortion as a method of family planning is toprohibit counseling regarding abortion and ensure that pregnant clientsare referred for prenatal services for the care of the pregnancy.6. <T3>Statutory authority</T3>: After considering the comments relating tothe provision of factual information relative to the choice of a birthcontrol method, the Department has modified the regulation. See andSection;59.8(a)(4). below. As noted in the discussion at IB1 above, it was never the Department'sintention to restrict the range of contraceptives available from TitleX projects, and the modification of andSection;59.8(a) makes clear this intent.Nor are the criticisms on informed consent grounds pertinent, particularlyin light of the changes discussed above. As noted in the discussion atIIIB2 above, the issue of informed consent as it relates to pregnant womenis beside the point, because Title X does not provide treatment for pregnancy.With respect to the provision of services to nonpregnant women, the policyremains unchanged from that which has previously applied. These changeseliminate any concern that regulations might be inconsistent with the statutoryrequirements relating to the provision of services on a voluntary basis.The Department dissagrees with the contention that the provisions constitutean additional and unlawful condition on eligibility for grants. Since,in the Department's view, section 1008 authorizes the provisions, theyby definition do not impose conditions that are inconsistent with the statute.The Department also disagrees with the comments criticizing the restrictionson counseling (as well as referral) as not supported by the legislativehistory of the 1970 Act. With respect to the reference to ``information* * * activities'' in the Conference Report, cited by many opponents ofthe provisions, it notes that the precise reference is to information activitiesthat are ``related'' to, among other things, ``preventive family planningservices.'' Conf. Rep. No. 91-1667, 91st Cong., 2nd Sess. 8-9 (1970). Counselingconcerning abortion is manifestly not related to preventive family planningservices. Furthermore, regarding Representative Dingell's challenge tothe Department's interpretation of his floor statements as made in 1970,that challenge appears to be based principally on the asserted failureof the proposed regulations to take account subsequent developments inthe medico-legal environment. While the Department recognizes that therehave been developments in both the medical and legal communities regardingabortion that could lead legislators to change their minds as to what restrictionsare appropriate on federally funded programs, it disagrees with RepresentativeDingell as to what legal conclusions flow from those developments. Section1008 remains in force precisely as enacted in 1970. If Congress believedthat subsequent developments have rendered its restrictions obsolete, itcould have amended it; it has not done so. Moreover, the Department does not agree that congressional actions subsequentto 1970 constitute a form of legislative ratification of its policy ofrequiring abortion counseling and referral by Title X grantees such thatit is now required by law to maintain that policy in force. Although Congresshas enacted several unrelated amendments to the family planning provisionsof Title X and has authorized funding six times, the relevant provisionsof Title X have remained unchanged since 1970. Thus, the commenters' agrumentsthat the Department is now required as a matter of law to maintain itspolicy of requiring abortion counseling and referral appears to rest largelyon inferences drawn from Congress' failure to enact a statutory amendmentaffirmatively rejecting that policy. Aside from the factual errors of this argument, discussed below, this argumentrests on the mistaken legal premise that Congress' failure to enact a statutoryamendment affirmatively rejecting this policy constitutes a ratificationof the policy. In general, the courts have been reluctant to permit suchan inference to be drawn from the legislature's failure to act. See, <T3>e.g.</T3>, <T3>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>State Farm Automobile Insurance Co.</T3>, 463 U.S. 29 (1983). Indeed,even where Congress has acted affirmatively to the extent of publishinga committee report to subsequent legislation which interprets prior law,the Court has been unwilling to accord it great weight. As the SupremeCourt observed in <T3>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n. </T3>v. <T3>GTE Sylvania, Inc.</T3>, 447 U.S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980), ``even whenit would otherwise be useful, subsequent legislative history will rarelyoverride a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned fromits language and legislative history prior to its enactment.''Moreover, the factual premise of this argument_that Congress has adoptedthe policy requiring abortion counseling and referral_is wrong. Many commentersdescribed the history of Title X as reflecting seventeen years of consistentadministrative policy which was well known and accepted by Congress. Thefacts, however, are quite different. Initially, it should be noted thatthe Department's policy on abortion counseling and referral developed inan evolutionary manner during the 1970s. Only in 1981 was that policy incorporatedand indeed expanded in guidelines. The available evidence regarding Congress'knowledge and reaction to those policies does not reflect full knowledgeand acceptance of them. Rather, in the Department's view, the availableevidence indicates_in the earlier years_considerable congressional confusionas to what the Department's administrative policies were, and, thereafter,as those policies became more well known, considerable political controversyas to their correctness both as a matter of law and as a matter of socialpolicy. The Department does not believe it is appropriate to provide a comprehensiveanalysis of the legislative history of Title X subsequent to 1970 in thispreamble. However, by way of illustration, the Department does think itwould be useful to focus on one event that was probably given the mostemphasis by the commenters who argued that the subsequent legislative eventspreclude the promulgation of these regulations_the 1978 defeat, by a 232-137vote in the House of Representatives of an amendment to Title X proposedby Representative Dornan. 124 Cong. Rec. 37048 (1978). The defeated amendment provided that: ``No grant or contract authorizedby this Title may be made or entered into with <T3>an entity </T3>which directly or indirectly provides abortion, abortioncounseling, or abortion referral services.'' <T3>Id. </T3>(emphasis added). As the underscored language indicates, Rep.Dornan's amendment would have done much more than reverse HHS' then currentpolicy of permitting abortion counseling and referral by Title X granteesin the Title X program; in addition to that, it would have banned entitiesthat provided abortion counseling and referral with non-Federal funds inseparate programs from participating in Title X. Indeed, in initially introducingthis amendment, Rep. Dornan stressed the fact that it provided a ban onparticipation of entities_such as Planned Parenthood_which provided thedescribed abortion-related services. See Cong. Rec. 31241-2 (1989). Subsequently, however, when Rep. Dornan again offered his amendment, hedid raise the issue of HHS' abortion counseling and referral policy, stating``it has come to my attention there are at least 117 hospitals and clinicsreceiving Title X family planning money where abortion is a method of familyplanning * * *''. <T3>Id. </T3>at 37046. A colloquy then ensued in which Rep. Rogers_whowas the sponsor of the reauthorization of Title X_vehemently rejected thestatement that Title X clinics were providing abortion counseling and referral.<ITAG tagnum="21">Abortion is not a method of family planning. Abortion comes afterpregnancy_after pregnancy. And the gentlemen misses the point of what weare doing in Title X. It is before_before. It is to let people know howto avoid pregnancy. We cannot use any funds for abortion. The amendmentis not needed. I urge its defeat. <T3>Id.</T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">When Rep. Dornan again referred to the 117 Title X clinics that hewas informed were providing abortion counseling and referral, Rep. Rogersagain denied the truth of this statement, suggesting, among other things,that ``you may have a hospital that may be running a family planning sectionin one wing and maybe they do an abortion in that hospital to save thelife of the mother.'' <T3>Id</T3>. Thus, what occurred in 1978 was: (1) The House defeated an amendment thatwould have done something far different and far more sweeping than theprohibition on abortion counseling and referral contained in the regulationsbeing promulgated today, and (2) did so after having been emphaticallymisinformed by the sponsor of the reauthorization legislation that theamendment was unnecessary.\8\<NOTE/> The Department does not believe that this episode can beconstrued as evidence of an adoption by the House of Representatives (muchless Congress as a whole) of the Department's policy at that time. Indeed,what it appears to reflect is congressional confusion as to what was occurringin the Title X program. At the very least, it simply provides support forthe view that an administrative agency or a court should look to legislationenacted by Congress to determine what Congress' intent is, and not tryto draw inferences about that intent from other sources. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ That Rep. Rogers was so mistaken as to the Department'sinterpretation of section 1008 strongly suggests that this interpretationwas not widely known in Congress_at least in 1978_as some commenters haveclaimed.Congress, of course, recently did enact in the Continuing Resolution forfiscal year 1987 legislation arguably bearing on the Title X guidelines.Specifically, a Conference Report to an unenacted HHS appropriations billwas incorporated by reference into the continuing resolution for fiscalyear 1987 (Pub. L. No. 99-464, section 101(b)(4)(e), 100 Stat. 1187 (1986)).Some commenters asserted that the ``incorporated'' Conference Report containsa restriction on administrative change in the Title X guidelines duringfiscal year 1987. The Department disagrees with that interpretation ofthe Conference Report.Even assuming, however, that the Continuing Resolution, in effect, ``codified''the current Title X guidelines for fiscal year 1987 by forbidding the Departmentfrom changing them during that period (<T3>i.e., </T3>until October 1, 1987), the Department does not believethat that fact would lead to the conclusion advanced by several commentersopposed to the proposal_that the legislation represents a definite manifestationof congressional intent to permanently adopt HHS' current Title X abortioncounseling and referral guidelines. Indeed, it seems to the Departmentthat such an interpretation would contravene the asserted meaning of thelegislation by converting what was purportedly intended as temporary, one-yeardelay in amendment of the guidelines into a permanent incorporation ofthem into the statute. In this connection, the Department notes that languageanalogous to the language of the 1987 Continuing Resoluation was droppedin the 1988 Continuing Resolution. There is no question, of course, that Congress has now become acutely awareof Title X. The treatment of abortion in connection with Title X has becomea matter of sharp political controversy in recent years. Some members ofCongress believe that the policies set out in the current guidelines arecorrect as a matter of statutory interpretation and administrative policy;other members of Congress believe that the current Department guidelinesare incorrect as a matter of law and policy. Unless and until Congressenacts new legislation, however, Title X remains in effect as law, andthe Department's obligation is to interpret existing law and_based on itsexperience in administering the program_to exercise its delegated administrativeauthority by adopting the policies that best effectuate the statute. 7. <T3>First Amendment: </T3>The Department disagrees with the comments challengingthe proposed limitations on counseling on First Amendment grounds. To beginwith, it should be noted that Congress has broad authority to determinethe purpose, terms, and conditions under which grants are made. <T3>Buckley </T3>v. <T3>Valeo, </T3>424 U.S. 1, 90-91 (1976). In particular, Congress, underthe <T3>McRae </T3>case, <T3>supra, </T3>and under <T3>Maher </T3>v. <T3>Roe, </T3>432 U.S. 464 (1977), may make a choice favoring childbirthover abortion and may implement that choice through the allocation of publicfunds. The fact that speech in the form of counseling is involved in aprogram such as Title X does not disable Congress from making that choice.Thus, no issue of viewpoint discrimination is posed here such as mightbe presented were the government to fund a widespread public relationscampaign taking one view. The <T3>League of Women Voters </T3>case, which was frequently cited by criticsof the proposed rules, does not change this analysis. In <T3>League of Women Voters, </T3>the Supreme Court found unconstitutionala statute that prohibited editorializing by any broadcast station thatreceived Federal funds. The Court expressed concern that all editorializingwas prohibited, even that financed by private funds; it stated, however,that if a statute allowed a station to establish an affiliate which couldeditorialize with nonfederal funds, it would satisfy constitutional scrutiny.468 U.S. at 400, n. 27. The result reached by the Court in the <T3>Regan </T3>case, cited by many supporters of the proposed rules, confirmsthis position. In <T3>Regan, </T3>the court upheld the constitutionality of a section ofthe tax code prohibiting taxpayers from deducting as charitable contributionsgifts to nonprofit organizations that engage in lobbying. The Court upheldthe tax statute because nonprofit organizations had available an alternativeavenue for conducting lobbying activities through formation of affilateorganizations under a separate section of the code. The rules below clearlymeet the tests of these cases. Indeed, as discussed both above and in thefollowing sections, the rules below do not go as far as the statutes atissue in those cases, as they do not require the formation of a separateorganization to conduct various abortion activities; they merely restrictwhat an organization may do, with Title X project funds, within the confinesof its Title X project activities. With respect to the claim of many comments that the counseling restrictionsof the proposed rules would violate the First Amendment rights of healthcare professionals and their patients, the Department disagrees that thecases cited in support of this claim bear on the case at hand. The proposedrules, and the final rules below, do not establish universally applicablepenal provisions which interfere with an individual's right to free speech,as was the case in <T3>Griswold, supra. </T3>They place no restrictions on the disseminationof information by health professionals about abortion, except in the contextof the federally funded project. This distinguishes the instant rules fromthe Illinois law declared unconstitutional in <T3>Kempiners, supra, </T3>which created a total ban on funding to organizationsthat did abortion counseling or referral. Nor is this a case like thoseinvolved in <T3>Sherbert </T3>v. <T3>Verner, </T3>374 U.S. 398 (1963) and <T3>Speiser </T3>v. <T3>Randall, supra, </T3>in which a governmental benefit that is availableto all other similarly situated persons is denied solely because of theexercise of their First Amendment rights. Title X confers no entitlementto benefits upon individual organizations; it is a discretionary grantprogram. Moreover, the fact that an organization's grant application doesnot include abortion activities will not automatically entitle it to receiptof grant funds. In any event, as noted by Judge Cudahy in his concurringopinion in the remand by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in<T3>Kempiners, </T3>the Constitution does not require ``equal time'' onthe payment of public funds to subsidize a point of view. 700 F. 2d 1115,at 1128. 8.<T3> Unconstitutional interference with right to abortion, right to practicemedicine:</T3> The Department disagrees with the contention of numerouscritics of the proposed rules that the proposed restrictions on counseling(as well as the other restrictions of proposed andSection; 59.8 and andSection;59.10) impermissibly burden a woman's right to obtain an abortion, as wellas a physician's right to practice. It notes, as an initial matter, thatthere is no significant difference in constitutional principle betweena physician's right to practice and a patient's right to his services.See,<T3> Harris</T3> v.<T3> McRae,</T3> 448 U.S. at 318, n. 21;<T3> Whalen</T3> v.<T3> Roe,</T3> 429 U.S. 589, 605, n. 33 (1977). The regulations below arenot like the statutes struck down in<T3> Colautti</T3> v.<T3> Franklin,</T3> 439 U.S. 379 (1979),<T3> Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</T3> v.<T3> Danforth,</T3> 428 U.S. 52 (1976), and<T3> City of Akron, supra.</T3> In each of these cases, the law at issueimposed mandatory disclosure and informational requirements upon physicianscounseling in the abortion context, requirements that were enforced throughcriminal and administrative sanctions. Even the Illinois statute at issuein<T3> Kempiners, supra,</T3> was considered by Judge Cudahy not to impermissiblyburden a woman's right to an abortion, as she remained free, under thatstatute, to seek the services of organizations not funded by governmentfunds or to seek counseling from friends, family, and so on. <T3>Kempiners,</T3> 700 F.2d at 1127. Similarly, the statutes that werestruck down in<T3> Reproductive Health Services</T3> v.<T3> Webster, supra,</T3> prohibited not only the use of <T3>any</T3> public funds for abortions and abortion counseling but alsothe performance of such activities by<T3> any</T3> public employees or in<T3> any</T3> public facilities. 662 F. Supp. at 424. The rules below arefar less broad. The rules below, in fact, do not prevent a health professionalor a provider organization from discussing, promoting, or otherwise encouraginga woman to have an abortion as a general matter; they simply do not permitthem to do so within a Title X project. As such, they do not suffer fromthe constitutional infirmities of the laws at issue in the cases reliedupon by the opponents of the proposed rules.<T3>IV. Referral </T3>Section 59.8(a) of the proposed rules provided, among other things, thata project which_<ITAG tagnum="20">provides * * * referral for abortion services as a method of familyplanning is not eligible to receive funds under this subpart * * *. Whereappropriate, medical or social service referrals for non-Title X supportedservices shall be made by providing a full list of available health careproviders of appropriate prenatal medical care and delivery services fromwhich a family planning client may select. Such referrals may not, however,be used as an indirect means to encourage or promote abortion in violationof section 1008, such as consciously weighting the list of referrals infavor of health care providers and/or facilities which provide abortions.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The example provided in proposed andSection; 59.8(b)(2) to illustratethis requirement concerned the case of a pregnant woman whom the projectdiagnoses as having an ectopic pregnancy; it was stated that she shouldbe immediately provided with a list of appropriate hospitals and physicians,and that such a referral would be permissible under the statute. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comments </ITAG>As with the provisions on counseling, the proposed provisions relatingto referral were the subject of numerous comments. Opponents criticizedthe provisions on the ground that a prohibition on referral for abortionwould prevent projects from insuring that women confronted with life-threateningconditions received proper emergency treatment, that it violated medicalethics, that it would slow access to abortions and to prenatal care, thatit was vague and unclear, and that it was illegal. Proponents, on the otherhand, argued that the provisions would correct the ethical problems presentedby the 1981 guidelines and bring them into conformity with section 1008.1.<T3> Emergency referrals:</T3> Opponents of the proposed provisions uniformlyobjected to these proposed policies. A major objection, based in largepart on the ectopic pregnancy example, was that the provision was far toobroad. Numerous providers contended that, as drafted, the provision wouldplace them in the untenable position of not being able to provide appropriatetreatment or referrals for life-threatening conditions. It was repeatedlystated that the medically appropriate response, where an ectopic pregnancyor other life-threatening condition is diagnosed, is to make immediatearrangements for appropriate emergency treatment. These comments statedthat simply providing a list of referrals would be improper, as well assubject the provider to various tort actions. 2.<T3> Referrals for prenatal care:</T3> A related and very common criticismof the proposed provision was that it would subject pregnant women to astandard of care inferior to that available to nonpregnant women. The exampletypically cited was of the woman who is diagnosed as having a breast lump:it was asserted that if she is not pregnant, she can be referred to anoncologist for examination and treatment if it proves to be malignant;on the other hand, it was asserted that if she is pregnant, under the proposedprovision she could only be referred for prenatal care, thereby buildingin a possibly critical delay in the treatment of a cancerous condition.The same argument was made by various commenters with respect to a rangeof other conditions, such as cervical cancer, breast cancer, AIDS, minorgynecological problems, and so on. According to the providers, such a disparityin the standard of care is medically indefensible and would create majorliability risks for them. In addition, several comments argued that sucha policy is inconsistent with the legislative history of the 1970 act,which indicates that Title X projects were intended to be providers ofcomprehensive health care and not simply dispensers of contraceptives.The proposed change in policy regarding referral for abortion itself wasalso attacked as constituting unsound public health policy. It was arguedthat the requirement that women desiring abortions be given a list of providersof prenatal care and delivery services would build in a delay in obtainingservices. It was asserted that this would result in an increase in later,riskier abortions, an increase in prenatal complications and infant mortalitydue to the delay in prenatal care, and an increase in women (particularlyteenagers) being effectively deprived of the choice to elect abortionsbecause of the time limits on availability and their own comparative inabilityto negotiate the health care system. A few providers suggested that theprovision would have the counterproductive result of wasting valuable timefor those few Title X clients who need genetic counseling and for whom<T3>in utero</T3> treatment of the fetus is a possibility.Proponents of the proposed provisions, on the other hand, thought theywere needed. They stated that under the 1981 guidelines, a Title X granteemust make abortion referrals, which they contended fosters a policy ofencouraging abortion since, under the guidelines, projects must identifyproviders of acceptable quality, ensure that the services are obtainedby the client and in some instances, aid the client in identifying potentialresources for reimbursement. Such activities, it was argued, entangle theprogram with abortion and therefore require projects to indirectly supportwhat the Federal government cannot directly support. Some maintained thatthe requirement to refer for abortion has resulted in the implementationof a pro-abortion program, because groups which refuse to refer for abortionare excluded, thereby causing an overall bias toward abortion.Proponents also argued that the proposed provisions do not threaten theethical responsibilities of family planning providers to render high qualitycare to their clients. They maintained that claims that health care providershave an ethical obligation to counsel clients on abortion and to arrangeabortions is a novel interpretation of the canons of medical ethics, asevidenced by the fact that the House of Delegates of the AMA has consistentlyaffirmed the right of physicians to abstain from any involvement in abortion.In support of the argument that there is no legal or ethical requirementto refer for abortion, proponents pointed to various ``conscience clauses''established by various state and Federal statutes, which generally providethat physicians and other medical personnel may not be required to provide,counsel or refer for abortion if contrary to the individual's moral beliefs.It was pointed out that if there were an absolute ethical duty to referfor abortions, thousands of physicians would be unable to practice ethically,as they refuse to refer for abortion; the fact that such physicians canpractice was cited as evidencing the lack of an ethical imperative to referfor abortion.3. <T3>``Conscious weighting''</T3>: Numerous comments also questioned thescope and advisability of the provision prohibiting ``conscious weighting''of the referral list. Both proponents and opponents of the proposed rulesquestioned whether they would permit or require a facility to provide areferral list that entirely omitted any abortion providers. In this regard,a number of providers, particularly from rural areas, asked whether theprovision would preclude inclusion on the list of facilities such as hospitalswhich perform abortions; it was pointed out that in many areas of the country(Michigan and Tennessee were cited as examples), hospitals are often themain or only source of prenatal care for indigent women, so that if theprovision requires excluding them, such women would be left without a sourceof prenatal care. Questions were also raised as to whether the list couldbe specifically tailored to indicates providers' specialties (such as geneticscreening and counseling, experience in handling certain types of high-riskpregnancies) or their willingness to accept low-income clients and clientson welfare, so as to reduce the delay in obtaining services. With respectto indigent women, a number of providers argued that the only medicallyresponsible course is to provide preliminary prenatal care until the womanhas lined up another provider who will accept her for prenatal care; tofail to do so would constitute the tort of ``abandonment.''4. <T3>Legal authority: </T3>The proposed provisions relating to referralwere also opposed as illegal. Opponents of the provision suggested thatit is inconsistent with the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit in <T3>Valley Family Planning </T3>v. <T3>State of North Dakota</T3>, 661 F. 2d 99 (8 Cir. 1981), asserting thatthat decision relied on and upheld an earlier Departmental opinion construing42 CFR 59.5(b)(1) as requiring, and section 1008 of the statute as notprecluding, referral for abortion where ``medically indicated.'' Opponentsalso argued that the proposed provisions are unconstitutional, both asa restriction on the free speech of providers and as placing another obstaclein the path of a woman's exercise of her right to abortion.Proponents of the proposed provisions, on the other hand, argued that theyare legal. It was argued that the restrictions regarding referral are essentialto ensure that the statutory purpose that abortion not be promoted withTitle X funds be met, and the GAO findings were cited as evidence of abuseof the referral process. In this regard, several took the position that<T3>Valley Family Planning </T3>would be irrelevant under the proposedregulatory scheme, since that decision simply relied on an opinion construingthe prior requirements. They also maintained that the arguments supportingthe constitutionality of the counseling provisions likewise support theconstitutionality of the referral provisions.<ITAG tagnum="81"/>B. ResponseThe Department agrees with and has accepted several of the points raisedby the comments on this issue, as reflected in the revised provisions appearingat andSection;59.8 (a)(2) and (3) and andSection;59.8(b)(2) below.1. <T3>Emergency referrals: </T3>The ectopic pregnancy example has been amendedto provide for immediate provision of appropriate referral for emergencytreatment, to make clear that Title X providers are in fact obligated toprovide referrals for immediate and appropriate medical care when confrontedwith a life-threatening medical condition. See andSection;59.8(b)(2) below.In any cases in which emergency referrals are needed, the Title X projectmust expedite the referral and take whatever steps are necessary and appropriateto insure that the client receives the services needed quickly. See andSection;59.8(a)(2) below.2. <T3>Referral for prenatal care: </T3>In addition, the provisions belowhave been modified to make clear a point that was apparently misunderstoodby many commenters, <T3>i.e., </T3>that Title X providers are not precluded from making_andindeed are obligated to make_appropriate referrals with respect to treatmentof conditions that are diagnosed in the course of examining pregnant TitleX clients. Thus, in general, clients with medical conditions requiringtreatment_whether pregnant or not_must be referred under the rules belowto an appropriate provider of the needed medical care. If the conditionis one that is related to pregnancy, the requirements of andSection;59.8(a)apply; if the condition is one that is not related to pregnancy, andSection;59.5(b)(1)continues to apply. See, in this regard, the discussion at sections IB1and IIIB1 above.These changes and clarifications of the proposed policies thus respondto most of the comments on the referral issue. As for the comments arguingthat the policy builds an unacceptable delay into the process of obtainingboth prenatal care and abortion, where chosen, the Department does notagree that substantial delays will result under the rules below. It hasaddressed the issue of delay in prenatal care by requiring that projectsprovide information designed to protect maternal and fetal health untila provider of prenatal care is secured for the client. This will permitinformation regarding good health practices during pregnancy (<T3>e.g., </T3>warning the pregnant woman about the risks of substanceabuse, counseling regarding proper nutrition, rest, and so on) to be providedby the project.However, the Department rejects the contention of many comments that thepolicies below will expose poor and young women to substantially greaterrisk or delay in obtaining services related to pregnancy outcome. Thiscontention is based on the assumption of delay or client loss in the referralprocess. However, such a risk has always existed in the Title X program,as it has never provided <T3>any </T3>pregnancy outcome services, whether abortion services or deliveryservices. All that the referral requirements below do is move what hasalways been, where pregnancy is diagnosed, an inevitable referral slightlyahead in time. Moreover, there is no <T3>a priori </T3>reason why a properly operating referral process cannotoperate just as efficiently if it refers at the time pregnancy is diagnosedas it can if it first provides options counseling and then refers.Because Title X projects do not offer the complete continuum of care frompregnancy diagnosis to childbirth, there may have been and may continueto be some unavoidable delays in individual cases. The only certain wayto eliminate any gap in time would be to award Title X funds only to organizationswhich provide the entire spectrum of obstetric and gynecological servicesincluding delivery services.With respect to an abortion, moreover, these comments evidence a substantialmisunderstanding of (and to the extent they come from Title X providers,probable noncompliance with) the Title X requirements. Contrary to theclaims of many providers, Title X has never permitted more than ``merereferral,'' that is, the provision of the name and telephone number ofa provider for abortion; the extensive facilitation of abortion (such assetting up appointments, making transportation arrangements, making arrangementsfor payment of the abortion) that so many of these comments assume to becommon practice have never been permissible in the Title X program. Whilethe rules below no longer permit ``mere'' referral for abortion, this isconsistent with the statute which clearly intended that abortion not befacilitated through the Title X program. Those who seek abortions mustdo so outside of the program. The Title X program has never been involvedin ensuring rapid and easy access to abortion services so that a laterterm abortion could be avoided. Some delay in an individual decision choosingabortion is not unusual in medical practice, nor is it in all cases inadvisable.ACOG, for example, recommends that a woman ``should be allowed sufficienttime for reflection prior to making an informed decision.'' (<T3>Standards, </T3>p. 63.)For the reasons above, the Department does not believe that access to abortionswill be affected as a result of the change in policy. Nevertheless, itshould be clear that given the prohibition of section 1008, the Departmentcannot now nor ever has been able to facilitate the selection or obtainingof abortion as a method of family planning. Therefore, to the extent abortionsare not selected as a consequence of this policy, it believes such a resultis consonant with the congressional purpose underlying section 1008, whichclearly disfavors the choice of abortion as a method of family planning.3. <T3>``Conscious weighting''</T3>: With respect to the comments questioningthe meaning of the prohibition on ``conscious weighting'' of the referrallists, the Department thinks that most of the provider concerns are misplaced.As proposed, the prohibition was very narrow: It precluded only consciousweighting of the list in favor of abortion providers. As such, it was silentwith respect to other characteristics of the list such as breakdown byarea of specialty, acceptance of Medicaid and other relevant variablesand such breakdowns were therefore not precluded. Indeed, section 59.8(a)(2)requires referral to ``available'' providers of prenatal care, includingproviders appropriate to the Title X clientele, who are primarily low income.Nor does the Department view the ``conscious weighting'' provision as prohibitingthe inclusion of facilities, such as hospitals, in which abortions areperformed if they are also major providers of prenatal care and other servicesand the referral is specifically made to the providers of prenatal careservices. Rather, what is prohibited is inclusion on the list of providersthat, as their main function, provide abortions and the deliberate exclusionin the composition of the list of providers that do not provide abortionsor referrals for abortion. However, to make clear that the requirementrelates solely to the actual composition of the list and does not relateto the project's intent, it has deleted the word ``conscious'' from andSection;59.8(a) below. In addition, the Department has added language to make clearthat the project may not direct clients to prenatal providers on the referrallist who also perform abortions.4. <T3>Legal authority</T3>: The Department also rejects the contention thatthe referral requirements are illegal. As regards the <T3>Valley Family Planning</T3> decision, it notes that the Court of Appealsfor the Eighth Circuit did not purport to limit the Secretary's authorityto prescribe standards implementing section 1008; rather, pursuant to theSupremacy Clause of the Constitution, it simply applied the regulatorystandards then in effect to supersede contrary State law. Moreover, thebasic premise of that regulatory standard_that referrals where a life-threateningcondition is diagnosed are not prohibited by section 1008 and are regulatorilyrequired whether or not the treatment ultimately is abortion_is unaffectedby the rules below, as the discussion at the first paragraph of this sectionmakes clear. The Department interpretation upon which <T3>Valley Family Planning</T3> was partially based did not state thatreferral is required on demand, neither did it find that referral is alwaysrequired; rather, it held only that it was required under the regulationswhen medically necessary, such as when the life of the mother is endangered.Nor does the Department agree that the referral provisions of the rulesbelow are constitutionally infirm. With regard to the First Amendment problemswhich many comments asserted exist, there is analytically no differencein First Amendment terms between the restrictions on counseling and therestrictions on referral. Thus, the points made at IIIB7 above apply tothese claims as well. As to the claim that prohibiting projects from makingreferrals for abortion constitutes an unconstitutional interference withthe woman's right to obtain and the doctor's right to refer for abortion,the points made at IIIB8 apply to this claim also.V. Program IntegritySection 59.9(a) of the proposed rules provided that a Title X project must_<ITAG tagnum="20">be kept entirely separate and distinct, financially and physically,from any abortion-related activities. This requirement includes maintainingseparate financial, accounting personnel and medical record systems andseparately maintaining other project functions and physical facilities(including office space, equipment, stationary and the like) in such amanner as to clearly separate Title X-funded activities from abortion-relatedactivities. This requirement prohibits, by way of example, common waiting,consultation, examination and treatment areas; shared telephone numbersand receptionists, common names for eligible and ineligible programs; andcommon office entrances and exists. Although common street or mailing addresseswill presumptively constitute a failure to separate adequately Title X-fundedprograms from other programs which include abortion as a method of familyplanning, grant applicants may seek to establish the reasonableness ofsuch arrangemnts in exceptional cases where, as in the example of a largemetropolitan hospital with abortion and family planning services locatedin different wings, the fact of physical separation is otherwise establishedand no use of appropriated funds in an ineligible program is likely.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Proposed andSection; 59.9(b) set out four examples of fact patternswhich failed to comply with the proposed requirements and one example ofa fact pattern that complied.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comments  </ITAG>1. <T3>Cost:</T3> The most common objection to the proposed co-siting restrictionswas cost. Many comments, particularly those from State and local governmentalorganizations, argued that the proposed restrictions would require a substantialinvestment in duplicate facilities, personnel and so on, which would renderTitle X funds uneconomic to accept. The particular concern in this regardwas typically stated to be the phrase ``abortion-related services.'' Thecomments typically criticized this phrase as extremely vague, but assumedthat the phrase covered any services in which abortion is mentioned, suchas genetic screening and counseling or the provision of handouts mentioningabortion, and not just the actual performance of abortions. One State healthdepartment questioned whether the term ``abortion-related services'' coveredsuch services as laundry, housekeeping, security, and data processing servicesthat are shared by the abortion component of, for example, a large metropolitanhospital.  A number of public organizations stated that the practical effect of therequirements would be to bar them from participating in the Title X program.They contended that they do not have the financial ability to establishduplicate clinical facilities, provide separate parking lots (as appearedto be required in the example at proposed andSection;59.9(b)(1)), or evenestablish separate entrances and exits. Moreover, many stated that theyare required by law to provide services through existing public hospitalsand clinics, in which they also conduct a variety of activities in whichabortion is mentioned, abortion counseling is done, or abortions are provided,frequently because of court orders mandating such activity. Several publicorganizations argued that the only organizations that would be able toremain in the program under the proposed requirements are the single ordual-purpose private organizations, such as Planned Parenthood affiliates,which would have the financial capability and legal flexibility to establishseparate facilities. The requirements were seen as impacting particularlyseverely on rural areas, where existing resources are scarce and wheredistance is a major barrier to service. Because of such considerations,it was argued, the emphasis has been on establishing multi-purpose sitesof rural health care, with which the requirements would be at odds.  Private providers likewise criticized the proposed provisions as too costly.A number argued that the net effect of separating their Title X operationsfrom any abortion-related activities they conduct would be an increasein cost for <T3>both </T3>operations. These comments took the position that a cross-subsidyexisted, with Title X benefitting from economies of scale due to bulk purchasingof supplies, sharing or overhead costs, and so on. A few providers andprovider organizations submitted estimates of the cost of complying withthis provision, which ranged up to $150 million for the program as a whole.Based on such cost estimates, a number of comments argued that the Departmentdid not comply with Executive Order 12291 in that it did not conduct aregulatory impact analysis of the proposed requirements, and maintainedthat the proposed requirements exceeded the impact threshold of the ExecutiveOrder. It was argued, moreover, that it is inappropriate as a matter ofpublic policy to require Title X funds to be spent on such items as pavingparking lots, which some assumed the proposed provisions to require, andconstructing new doorways and lobbies rather than on the provision of directhealth care services.   2. <T3>Continuity of care: </T3>The co-siting requirements were also criticizedon public health grounds, principally on the basis that they would impactnegatively on continuity of care between family planning and abortion.Numerous comments, particularly from public providers, argued that thetrend in public health has been to locate related services together, tofacilitate full utilization by clients of needed services. For this reason,it was stated, even in ``large, metropolitan hospitals,'' abortion counselingservices are frequently located in the same corridor or wing as familyplanning services. Such arrangements also decrease the rate of repeat abortions,it was argued, by making contraceptive counseling and services readilyavailable to women who have had or are about to have abortions. As a practicalmatter, therefore, it was asserted that it will often not be possible torelocate Title X services and, in any event, doing so would not be consistentwith contemporary public health thinking. It was also argued that the proposedrequirements, if complied with, would have at least a short-term impacton continuity of care, occasioned by the change attendant on moving tonew facilities, hiring new personnel, and so on. A public agency in NewYork for instance, indicated that family planning providers in that statewould have to seek approval under New York's certificate of need law toestablish duplicative services, which could temporarily impair the abilityof the Title X projects to provide services or close them down permanently,if the certificate of need were not obtained. Several commenters expressedconcern that the requirement of proposed andSection;59.9 would interferewith the activities of other federally funded programs in which abortioninformation may be provided.       3. <T3>Separation of medical, personnel and financial systems</T3>: A relatedcriticism was frequently expressed with regard to the proposed requirementto establish separate ``medical records systems.'' Many providers and providerorganizations argued that the requirement would be impractical for multifunctionhealth care facilities, such as hospitals or county health departments,which maintain centralized medical records systems. They also maintainedthat such a requirement would interfere with continuity of care by fragmentinga patient's medical records. They stated that this could lead to poor medicalmanagement of the patient's care by the project or elsewhere in the organizationif complete records are not obtained. The proposed requirement was thusgenerally criticized as inconsistent with proper medical procedure. The requirement for separate personnel systems was attacked on simlar grounds.Public organizations generally argued that they could not comply with theproposed requirement, given the legal structure of most governmental personnelsystems in which employees of many governmental agencies are employed underthe same personnel system. Other provisions, criticizing the example atproposed andSection; 59.9(b)(2), argued that it was improper to regulatewhat a physician or other health professional, who may be employed by theproject on a part-time basis, does with the rest of his time. The proposed requirement for separate accounting systems elicited similarcriticisms. A number of comments recognized that it is reasonable, andconsistent with customary and longstanding Department practice, to requireTitle X grantees to maintain separate accounting records. However, it wasrepeatedly stated that requiring separate accounting systems is infeasiblefor most large organizations, particularly governmental ones. For example,the state health department of New Jersey endorsed the reasonableness ofrequiring physical and financial separation of abortion and family planningservices in a hospital, but argued that the common practice of having distinct``cost centers'' in hospitals should be sufficient to meet the requirementfor financial separation. These comments thus urged that both the policyand the example at proposed andSection; 59.9(b)(4) be changed. 4. <T3>Treatment of large, metropolitan hospitals: </T3>The proposed provisionwhich used the example of ``a large, metropolitan hospital'' was critizedon several grounds. A number of comments argued that it was vague. Othercomments argued that it was arbitrary, in that there is no reason to exceptmetropolitan hospitals from the requirement that does not also apply torural hospitals, which may be the only provider of services in an area,or to hospitals which are constructed without wings but have some othertype of physical separation. As noted above, a number of comments alsostated that metropolitan hospitals typically locate abortion-related servicesin the same area of the facility as family planning services and not inseparate wings. It was also argued that the proposal, together with therequirement for separate entrances and exits, does not take into accountthe concerns of inner city hospitals, which frequently restrict the numberof entrances and exits for security reasons. For these reasons, many publicproviders expressed the view that the waiver for large metropolitan hospitalswould be of very little help and that the co-siting requirements wouldforce them to forego Title X funds. 5. <T3>Legal authority</T3>: The proposed physical separation requirementswere attacked as illegal on several grounds. Numerous comments argued thatthere is no evidence that they are needed, asserting that the InspectorGeneral and GAO audits failed to show that Title X grantees had intermingledproject and abortion-related activities in any way. In this regard, itwas argued that there is no evidence supporting the presumption of illegalitywith respect to common street or mailing addresses. It was also arguedthat the requirements greatly exceed what is needed to assure that TitleX funds are not used for abortion-related purposes, and thus are invalid.The decisions in the litigation involving the State of Arizona and PlannedParenthood of Central and Northern Arizona (see, <T3>e.q., Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona </T3>v. <T3>The State of Arizona</T3>, 789 F. 2d. 1348 (9 Cir. 1986), aff'd U.S.<T2>XX</T2>, 107 S. Ct. 391 (1986)) and <T3>Planned Parenthood of Billings, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>The State of Montana, supra, </T3>were cited in support of this argument.Finally, some comments also contended that the proposed requirements violatethe First Amendment, based on the decision in <T3>League of Women Voters, supra</T3>. In that decision, it was argued,the Supreme Court established the principle that the government may notrequire the recipient of a Federal benefit (in that case, a broadcast license)to establish an ``entirely separate facility'' to exercise its First Amendmentrights, even though it could decline to subsidize the exercise of thoserights with Federal funds. The proposed co-siting requirements, it wasargued, constitute a requirement to establish an ``entirely separate facility''analogous to that considered and rejected by the Supreme Court and is thusinvalid.Proponents of the regulations uniformly supported the proposed physicalseparation requirements. Many argued that physical intermingling of TitleX projects with abortion facilities necessarily has the effect of subsidizingthe latter, contrary to Congressional intent. Others contended that lackof physical separation necessarily leads to the public perception thatthe government is supporting abortion as a method of family planning, whichis contrary to the intent of section 1008 that Title X funds not be usedto promote abortion as a method of family planning. Because Title X clientsdo not see the accounting and other ``paper'' indices of separation, itwas argued, physical separation is the only reasonable means to clarifythat Title X projects may not include abortion and that the federal governmentinsists on a clear adherence to its policy against spending federal moneyto facilitate abortions. In this regard, it was evident from the commentsof hundreds of individuals that they confused the Title X projects withabortion providers or assumed that Title X projects were generally abortionproviders. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Response</ITAG>The Department has carefully considered the comments received concerningthe proposed separation requirements and has made a number of changes tothe requirements in light of the comments received. In essence, the newrules adopt an approach that will enable the Department to make case-by-casedeterminations as to whether a given Title X project is physically andfinancially separate from prohibited activities. As stated in the proposedrules, meeting the requirement of section 1008 mandates that Title X programsbe organized so that they are physically and financially separate fromother activities which are prohibited from inclusion in a Title X program.Having a program that is separate from such activities is a necessary predicateto any determination that abortion is not being included as a method offamily planning in the Title X program. Under the rules below, the separationmust be objective; that is, if the Title X program cannot be distinguishedfrom prohibited activities conducted by the grantee or others, the statutorymandate has not been met. Thus, the rule below provides that, while accountingseparation is necessary, it is not sufficient. There must also be a visibleseparation between the Title X program and other activities which are prohibitedfrom inclusion in the Title X program. To determine whether sufficientseparation exists in a particular case, the Department will weigh the relevantfactors. The regulation identifies four non-exclusion factors relevantto such a determination. See andSection;59.9 below. However, because therule below adopts a ``facts and circumstances approach,'' it is felt thatproviding examples would be misleading, in that examples are unlikely toreplicate the complex circumstances and conditions that the Departmentwill be considering when making the individual determinations called forby the rule. Accordingly, unlike proposed andSection;59.9, andSection;59.9below contains no examples. In light of these changes to the proposed rule, the Department makes thefollowing responses to the public comments. 1. <T3>Cost.</T3> Because of the adoption of a case-by-case determinationapproach in the rules below, it is not possible to determine with any precisionthe costs that grantees will face in accommodating to the rules. However,the Department would note that most of the actual or apparent requirementsof proposed andSection;59.9 that caused the most concern regarding costs,such as the stated requirement for separate entrances and exits and theapparent (although unintended) requirement to repave parking lots, no longerconstitute <T3>per se</T3> tests under rules below. Certainly, the Department at thispoint does not have complete data about each of the 4,000 clinics presentlyin the program so that it could determine how much, if any, expense eachwould incur to maintain program integrity. Indeed, the Department has inpart chosen a case-by-case approach so as to be able to implement thispolicy with a greater understanding and sensitivity to the costs imposed.In any event, because the rules no longer contain the rigid physical separationrequirements of the proposed rules, it does not agree that the ``worstcase'' estimates submitted of approximately $50,000 per clinic are likelyto be realized for many clinics. Accordingly, the Department is not persuadedthat the rules below will substantially impact upon rural health care providers.The Department also is unpersuaded by the provider arguments that TitleX benefits from lack of separation from abortion facilities due to theeconomies of scale that are realized. Indeed, such comments only underscorethe problem of commingling the Title X services with abortion services,both in the difficulty of ensuring that no subsidy in the other directionoccurs, but also in creating the appearance, if not the reality, of federalsupport of abortion. Further, current program policy allows grant fundsto be used for the one-time costs associated with relocating a Title Xclinic for the express purpose of complying with the rules below.2. <T3>Continuity of care: </T3>The above changes also respond to severalof the provider concerns with continuity of care, as do the related changeddiscussed in the following section. The example typically cited_the TitleX clinic that is located at the same site as a project funded under anotherprogram that provides genetic screening and counseling_may not be affectedby the requirements revised, if the project can show that the later project'sactivities meet the separation indicia of andSection; 59.9 below. To theextent the rules below minimize continuity between family planning andabortion, this is a result which the Department views as consistent withsection 1008.3. <T3>Separation of medical records, personnel, and financial and accountingsystems: </T3>The requirements relating to separate financial and accounting,personnel, and medical records systems have been eliminated in responseto the concerns raised in the public comments. See andSection; 59.9 below.However, in order to ensure financial separation of abortion from TitleX and consistent with past practice as well as in recognition of the customaryfinancial management practices of health care providers, andSection; 59.9below provides that one of the indicia of separation to be considered isthe existence of separate accounting <T3>records </T3>that are separate from those of any abortion activityit conducts. This, it should be emphasized, represents no change from longstandingprogram practice. With respect to the issue of shared personnel, andSection;59.9 below establishes the existence of separate personnel as one of theregulatory indicia of separation. However, as noted above with respectto this section, the existence of this factor_like the existence of anyof the factors set out in andSection; 59.9_in a particular case is not a<T3>per se </T3>disqualification, but rather must be considered in lightof the facts and circumstances of the project as a whole. Where sharingof personnel exists, but the project can demonstrate on an overall basisthat it is objectively separated from prohibited activities, the Departmentwill determine that the project is in compliance with andSection; 59.9. Accordingly,the Department does not believe that the concerns raised with respect tothe ability of medical personnel to act outside their employment by theproject are valid. These changes thus address and should allay many ofthe cost concerns expressed by the public comments.4. <T3>Treatment of large, metropolitan hospitals: </T3>The Department hasdeleted the language relating to large hospitals. It agrees that this languagewas unclear and suggested criteria that were never intended to apply. Moreover,the approach adopted below makes such a provision no longer necessary.5. <T3>Legal authority: </T3>The legal authority for these regulations isdiscussed extensively elsewhere in this preamble and does not need to berepeated here. In brief, section 1008 prohibits the use of title X fundsin programs that include abortion as a method of family planning. Thus,section 1008 is broader than a mere restriction on the use of federal funds,and clearly authorizes the Department to set out rules to implement itsmandate that Title X programs not include prohibited activities. Basedon the need to implement the mandate of the statute and the Departmentsexperience in administering the program, the Department has concluded thatgreater guidance and specificity is needed with regard to program separateness.Section 59.9's case-by-case approach will allow the Department to implementthe statutory mandate of program separateness with sensitivity to the circumstancesof each program. Thus, adopting the case-by-case approach reflects theDepartment's efforts to reconcile the commands of the statute with theconcerns expressed by commenters. As such, it reflects a rasonable exerciseof the Department's authority to promulgate rules for the administrationof the Title X program. With repsect to the constitutional claims raisedby some commenters, the Department disagrees that the cases cited, particularly<T3>League of Women Voters, supra, </T3>preclude the policies below, forthe reasons more fully discussed previously and below.VI. Advocacy of AbortionProposed andSection; 59.10 set out a number of restrictions designed to ensurethat Title X grantees do not promote or encourage abortion as a methodof family planning with Title X funds. Under proposed andSection; 59.10(a),a Title X project could_<ITAG tagnum="20">take no action which encourages, promotes, or advocates abortion asa method of family planning, or which assists a woman in obtaining an abortionas a method of family planning. Actions are considered to encourage, promote,or advocate abortion as a method of family planning if they in any wayhave the effect of facilitating obtaining abortion as a method of familyplanning.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The proposed rule prohibited certain specific actions: lobbying, providingspeakers promoting abortion and paying dues to abortion advocacy organizations(proposed andSection; 59.9(a)(1)); using legal action to make abortion availableas a method of family planning (proposed andSection; 59.9(a)(2)); and developingor disseminating materials advocating abortion as a method of family planning(proposed andSection; 59.9(a)(3)). Five examples were provided. The followingfour were termed impermissible under the statute: providing a brochureadvertising an abortion clinic, paying dues to an organization which devotesa substantial part of its activities to lobbying Congress for liberalizedabortion laws, displaying posters encouraging clients to write legislatorsto vote in favor of abortion, and assisting clients in making appointmentsat abortion clinics; the fifth example, concerning the activities of theTitle X project's personnel outside of the project in writing legislatorsin support of pro-choice legislation, was termed permissible. See proposedandSection; 59.10(b).<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comments</ITAG>1.<T3> Provision of abortion materials: </T3>The majority of comments opposingproposed andSection; 59.10 criticized the prohibition of proposed andSection;59.10(a) relating to assisting a woman to obtain a family planning abortionand actions that ``in any way have the effect of facilitating obtainingabortion,'' together with proposed andSection; 59.10(a)(3) relating to thedevelopment and dissemination of materials (including printed matter andaudiovisual materials) advocating abortion as a method of family planning.The usual criticism was that these provisions are overbroad, in that theyfail to distinguish between the provision of factual information and advocacyof abortion. It was argued that the provisions would prohibit Title X granteesfrom disseminating such things as patient package inserts included in oralcontraceptive packages and the patient information required by the Foodand Drug Administration regarding the IUD, or even keeping copies of thetelephone yellow pages which contain advertisements by abortion clinics.A national medical organization suggested that the ``assisting'' and ``facilitating''language of proposed andSection; 59.10(a) would preclude Title X projectsfrom providing copies of a patient's medical records on request, if therequest came from an abortion facility, which conflicts with the principlethat patients have a right to their medical records.A series of related legal objections were also raised. The same criticismsrelating to informed consent and voluntary acceptance of services thatwere articulated with respect to the proposed counseling provisions werelikewise stated with respect to proposed andSection; 59.10. In addition,many opponents argued that these provisions are unconstitutionally vaguein failing to make clear exactly what the limits on expression are, sothat a provider could never be certain whether it had violated them ornot. It was also argued by a number of organizations that the provisionsviolate the First Amendment in constituting viewpoint-based discrimination(by forbidding pro-abortion but not anti-abortion speech) and by requiringgrantees to relinquish their right to speech that is protected under <T3>Griswold </T3>v. <T3>Connecticut, supra. </T3>It was further argued that these restrictionson speech are not permissible on the theory that a benefit, rather thana right, is denied, as the government may not condition receipt of a benefitupon the relinquishment of First Amendment rights, as such a conditionwould have a chilling effect on the exercise of those rights. <T3>Perry </T3>v. <T3>Sindermann, supra, Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona</T3>v. <T3>The State of Arizona, supra, </T3>and <T3>Alan Guttmacher Institute </T3>v. <T3>McPherson, </T3>616 F. Supp. 195, 202 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) were cited insupport of this argument.Supporters of the proposed provisions, on the other hand, generally expressedthe view that they were appropriate and needed. They contended that advocacyof abortion is not a proper governmental function and is certainly nota ``family planning'' service which should be subsidized with federal funds.With regard to constitutional concerns, it was argued that the provisionsare constitutional because the constitutional guarantees under the FirstAmendment do not apply to the government; those acting as agents of thegovernment have no greater rights than the government itself, and accordinglythe government may lawfully restrict what they say on its behalf. Alsocited in support of the constitutionality of these provisions was <T3>Regan </T3>v. <T3>Taxation Without Representation, supra.</T3>2. <T3>Dues payment, lobbying and litigation: </T3>The remaining provisionsof proposed andSection; 59.10 attracted somewhat less comment. A generalcriticism of these provisions was that they would prevent Title X granteeswho are pro-abortion from exercising their First Amendment rights. In thisregard, the provisions were criticized as politically motivated and notpolitically neutral; it was argued that they permit Title X funds to beused to support pro-life political, legal and lobbying activities, butprohibit such use of funds for the contrary point of view. In addition,a number of specific criticisms of the provisions were expressed. The restrictionon payment of dues to organizations that advocate abortion was objectedto as depriving grantees of access to needed professional information andservices, as well as being an unconstitutional restriction of their rightto free association under the First Amendment. The restrictions on lobbyingwere generally criticized as unnecessary: several comments argued thatIRS requirements and OMB Circular No. A-122 already limit lobbying by grantees,and stated that there is no evidence that grantees are not complying withthese requirements. It was also asserted that the lobbying restrictionsviolated the First Amendment. Similar arguments were made with respectto the restriction on litigation which, in addition, was criticized asvague. Questions were raised as to whether a grantee, which in its non-projectactivities provides abortions, could defend itself under this provisionin any malpractice actions arising out of such abortions.Proponents of the proposed provisions generally took the position that,if anything, they did not go far enough. In this regard, it was arguedthat it is inconsistent to restrict a grantee from advocating abortionif the parent organization is permitted to do so on the ground that thefederal funds ``free up'' funds of the parent organization for such advocacyactivity. In addition, one comment took the position that the example atproposed andSection; 59.10(b)(2) was inconsistent with the logic of the regulationas a whole: If the point of the provisions is to separate Title X fundsfrom abortion advocacy, then payment of dues to an organization that devotes<T3>any</T3> part of its activities to lobbying for abortion should beprohibited. The proponents of the provisions also took the position that,since the restrictions only apply to the Title X project itself, they areconstitutional. <T3>Regan</T3> v. <T3>Taxation Without Representation, supra, </T3>was cited in support ofthis argument, as, it was noted, that case specifically concerned the availabilityof a tax exemption with regard to lobbying activities; in that case, theorganization's tax exemption was denied because a substantial part of itsactivities were devoted to lobbying.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Response</ITAG>The Department has considered the comments received, but for the reasonsstated below, has not accepted them. Accordingly, andSection; 59.10 belowremains substantially as proposed.1. <T3>Provision of abortion materials:</T3> The Department notes that manyof the comments criticizing these provisions proceed from a misunderstandingof the requirements or have been addressed in connection with revisionsto the rest of the regulation. As noted in the discussion at sections IIIB1and IIIB2 above, it is not the intent of these regulations to restrictthe provision of information to Title X clients necessary to assess therisks and benefits of different methods of contraception. See andSection;59.8(a)(4) above. Similarly, keeping the yellow pages in the project officeand provision of medical records to another medical provider would notbe proscribed, as they are not actions that directly ``assist'' a womanto obtain an abortion.With respect to the legal criticisms of these provisions, the Departmentdoes not believe that they have merit. It notes, as an initial matter,that with the exception of the provision relating to payment of dues, thepolicies at proposed andSection; 59.10(a) represent the long-standing interpretationof section 1008 by this Department, of which the grantee community shouldbe aware and is currently bound. What the final rules below do is reduceto readily accessible written, regulatory form compliance standards whichwere articulated in an OGC opinion written in 1978 and a matter of publicrecord since 1980. It is difficult to understand how, with these policiesreduced to written, regulatory form and with concrete applications of themprovided as in the proposed rules and the final rules below, the regulatoryframework can be challenged as ``vague,'' when the <T3>status quo,</T3> which the opponents of the regulations uniformly seekto continue, is not. The criticisms made on informed consent and ``voluntariness''grounds are, with respect to the provisions of andSection; 59.10, irrelevant,as those provisions in general do not relate to treatment, <T3>per se</T3>. However, to the extent that the requirements of andSection;59.10 do impinge on treatment, these concerns are addressed at sectionIIIB2 above. With respect to the claims that andSection; 59.10 is unconstitutional,the Department disagrees that these claims have merit. These provisionsare constitutional under the standards set forth in <T3>Regan</T3> v. <T3>Taxation Without Representation, supra,</T3> and <T3>League of Women Voters, supra,</T3> because they do not prohibit organizationsfrom establishing affiliates that provide abortion materials. They permitan organization to operate both a Title X project and a project that wouldeducate women on abortion as long as they are separate and distinct.2. <T3>Dues payment, lobbying, and litigation: </T3>The Department disagreeswith the comments criticizing the proposed policies as not politicallyneutral. It is true that andSection; 59.10, like the remainder of the rulesbelow, does exhibit a bias in favor of childbirth and against abortionas a method of family planning. However, this bias is explicit in the statuteitself, and is not a creation of this Department or this Administration.Moreover, as noted above, virtually all of the policies in andSection; 59.10represent program requirements that antedate the present Administration.Thus, it considers these criticisms to be unfounded.With respect to the specific objections to the provisions relating to duespayment, lobbying and litigation, the Department disagrees that they havemerit. It should be noted in this regard that the requirements apply onlyto the project. Thus, if a grantee organization believes that its interestsare best served by belonging to an organization that advocates abortion,it is free to join; it simply may not use project funds for payment ofdues. Similarly, if it wishes to lobby for the passage of pro-abortionlegislation, it may, so long as project funds (including project personnelworking on project time) are not used. The same principle applies withrespect to the restriction on litigation, and thus the answer to the malpracticeconcern raised by some providers is that the organization may of coursedefend itself. See the examples at andSection; 59.10(b) below.The Department has thus not accepted the criticism expressed by some supportersof the rule, <T3>i.e., </T3>that the restrictions of andSection; 59.10 should apply tothe organization in its entirely rather than just to the Title X-supportedproject. It does not agree that it has the statutory authority to imposesuch a policy, as section 1008 by its terms applies solely to programssupported with Title X funds; therefore, activities lying outside the projectare not covered by the statutory prohibition. Moreover, such a policy wouldraise potential constitutional concerns. By the same token, since the restrictionsat issue affect only the project, and not the organization as a whole,they come squarely within the <T3>Regan </T3>case, <T3>supra, </T3>and the claim that they violate the First Amendment iswithout merit.VII. <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be performedfor any ``major rule,'' as defined in the Executive Order. Although therules below establish standards of performance for all Title X programs,only the requirements under andSection; 59.9, <T3>Maintenance of program integrity, </T3>may have effects of the typeand/or magnitude covered by Executive Order 12291. As discussed above,in reponse to comments about costs of complying with the rules, the Departmenthas changed the rules to require appropriate and objective separation betweenthe Title X program and activities prohibited under the subpart. The Departmentat this point does not have complete data about each of the 4,000 clinicspresently in the program to determine how much, if any, expenses each willhave to incur to maintain program integrity as mandated by Congress. However,since the rules no longer contain the rigid physical separation requirementsof the proposed rules, the Department does not believe that the costs associatedwith implementation of the requirements contained in andSection; 59.9 willeven begin to approach the level of $100 million. The Secretary has determined,therefore, that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined underE.O. 12291 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more, or otherwise meet the criteria for which a regulatoryimpact analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6) requires the federal governmentto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small entities. Although the rules below establish standards of performancefor all Title X programs, only the requirements under andSection; 59.9, <T3>Maintenance of program integrity, </T3>may have effects of the typecovered by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. With one exception, the effectof the rules is to eliminate existing requirements or permissive provisionsconcerning the provision of abortion-related services, and as a resultthe rules should to this extent produce a reduction in costs for TitleX programs. The exception is at andSection; 59.9, relating to separationof services prohibited under this subpart from the Title X program. Forthe reasons discussed above, the Secretary certifies, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b),enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), that theserules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Executive Order 12612</ITAG>Executive Order 12612 requires that a Federalism Assessment be preparedin any cases in which proposed policies have significant federalism implicationsas defined in the Executive Order. Among the types of actions which canhave such implications are federal regulatory actions which preempt Statelaw. As discussed above, the Department does not intend or interpret theserules as imposing additional costs or burdens on the States or preemptingState laws and has argued that these rules will not have any of those effects,nor are they inconsistent with any of the principles, criteria or requirementsestablished by this Executive Order. To the extent there are any additionalcosts for the operation of Title X programs resulting from these regulations,these costs are small, (see the discussion of Executive Order 12291, above)and are costs which will affect only the expenditure of Title X programfunds. To the extend that these rules may have any effect, undetected bythis analysis, which would create any federalism impact, the Departmentmaintains that these regulations are necessary to ensure the integrityof the Title X program and appropriate enforcement of section 1008. Therefore,these rules comply with the letter and spirit of Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The final rules do not impose a burden of information collection underthe Paperwork Reduction Act. Information collection requirements whichwere included in andSection; 59.9 of the proposed rules have been deleted.The requirement established at andSection; 59.7 will be administered in sucha way that it will not create any paperwork burden. Applicants for grantswill be asked merely to sign an assurance of compliance with the requirementsin andSection; 59.8 through andSection; 59.10. Additional documentary evidencewill be requested of an applicant or grantee only on a case-by-case basisin situations where such information is deemed necessary by the Secretary.The final rules do not contain any information collection requirementssubject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Family Impact </ITAG>The final rules have been reviewed in conformance with E.O. 12606. Theeffect of the final rules is to establish standards of compliance concerningthe separation of abortion services from the national family planning program.The final rules were assessed under the seven criteria in section 1 ofE.O. 12606. We conclude that the rules below will not have a significantpotential negative impact on family well-being, based on the followingdeterminations: 1. <T3>Impact on stability of the family: </T3>Although program services areprovided without regard to, among other things, age, sex, number of pregnancies,or marital status, it is inherent in the character of the services providedunder the program that other family members, such as a spouse, will beaffected by the services. The limitations on project involvement with abortionin the rules below are intended to convey to the public the Department'sconcern for the well-being of both mothers and their unborn children. 2. <T3>Impact on parental influence:</T3> The rules below will lessen theinfluence of service providers and create an increased opportunity forparental influence on the education, nurture, and supervision of theirchildren. Approximately 1,000,000 adolescents are served by Title X. Ofthose who become pregnant, Title X will no longer counsel or refer themfor abortion. This increases the likelihood of adolescents seeking parentaladvice when faced with pregnancy and reinforces that the seeking of parentaladvice and involvement is preferable to government services. 3. <T3>Governmental intrusion on family activities: </T3>The rules below prohibitTitle X projects from counseling once pregnancy is diagnosed and requirereferral for services. Insofar as this policy affects teenage clients ofTitle X projects, it thus diminishes the role of federally funded entitiesin influencing the childbearing decision and may serve to increase theparental role. 4. <T3>Impact on family earnings:</T3> The rules below will have no impacton family earnings, as they relate solely to receipt of health servicesunder governmentally funded programs and not to income-producing activitiesof individuals. There should likewise be no impact on family budgets inthe aggregate, as the decrease of services in some areas (<T3>e.g.</T3>, prenatal services) will be replaced by increased servicesin other areas (<T3>e.g.</T3>, preventive family planning services). 5. <T3>Feasibility of less Federal government involvement:</T3> The rulesbelow principally involve establishing standards for compliance with afederal statute by recipients of federal grant funds. The monitoring activitiescalled for could not be discharged by a non-federal entity. 6. <T3>Message of the rules regarding the status of the family:</T3> One messageto the public is that family planning is separable from abortion and thatthe government supports, through its funding, programs that enable familiesto plan the number and spacing of their children, either through preventivemethods of family planning or through management of infertility problems,but not through elimination of unborn children by abortion. In reviewingthe public comments, the Department was impressed that both supportersand opponents of the proposed rules seemed to agree that Title X has inthe past linked family planning and abortion; the rules below break thislink and dispel any perception that Title X funds may be used to supportabortion services and activities. 7. <T3>Message of the rules to young people concerning their behavior andsocial norms:</T3> The message to young people is that the federal governmentdoes not sanction abortion as a method of family planning and that it willnot provide funding for actions that help young women with an unintendedpregnancy to obtain an abortion.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 59</ITAG>Family planning_birth control, Grant programs_health, Health facilities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.

She must also be provided with information necessary to protectthe health of mother and unborn child until such time as the referral appointmentis kept. In cases in which emergency care is required, however, the TitleX project shall be required only to refer the client immediately to anappropriate provider of emergency medical services.(3) A Title X project may not use prenatal, social service or emergencymedical or other referrals as an indirect means of encouraging or promotingabortion as a method of family planning, such as by weighing the list ofreferrals in favor of health care providers which perform abortions, byincluding on the list of referral providers health care providers whoseprincipal business is the provision of abortions, by excluding availableproviders who do not provide abortions, or by ``steering'' clients to providerswho offer abortion as a method of family planning.

Referral arrangements for emergencymedical care are immediately provided. Such action is in compliance withthe requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.(3) A pregnant woman asks the Title X project to provide her with a listof abortion providers in the area. The Title X project tells her that itdoes not refer for abortion but provides her a list which includes, amongother health care providers, a local clinic which principally providesabortions. Inclusion of the clinic on the list is inconsistent with paragraph(a)(3) of this section.(4) A pregnant woman asks the Title X project to provide her with a listof abortion providers in the area. The project tells her that it does notrefer for abortion and provides her a list which consists of hospitalsand clinics and other providers which provide prenatal care and also provideabortions. None of the entries on the list are providers that principallyprovide abortions. Although there are several appropriate providers ofprenatal care in the area which do not provide or refer for abortions,none of these providers are included on the list. Provision of the listis inconsistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.(5) A pregnant woman requests information on abortion and asks the TitleX project to refer her to an abortion provider. The project counselor tellsher that the project does not consider abortion an appropriate method offamily planning and therefore does not counsel or refer for abortion. Thecounselor further tells the client that the project can help her to obtainprenatal care and necessary social services, and provides her with a listof such providers from which the client may choose. Such actions are consistentwith paragraph (a) of this section.(6) Title X project staff provide contraceptive counseling to a clientin order to assist her in selecting a contraceptive method. In discussingoral contraceptives, the project counselor provides the client with informationcontained in the patient package insert accompanying a brand of oral contraceptives,referring to abortion only in the context of a discussion of the relativesafety of various contraceptive methods and in no way promoting abortionas a method of family planning. The provision of this information doesnot constitute abortion counseling or referral.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 59.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Maintenance of program integrity.</ITAG>A Title X project must be organized so that it is physically and financiallyseparate, as determined in accordance with the review established in thissection, from activities which are prohibited under section 1008 of theAct and andSection; 59.8 and andSection; 59.10 of these regulations from inclusionin the Title X program. In order to be physically and financially separate,a Title X project must have an objective integrity and independence fromprohibited activities. Mere bookkeeping separation of Title X funds fromother monies is not sufficient. The Secretary will determine whether suchobjective integrity and independence exist based on a review of facts andcircumstances. Factors relevant to this determination shall include (butare not limited to): (a) The existence of separate accounting records;(b) The degree of separation from facilities (<T3>e.g.,</T3> treatment, consultation, examination, and waiting rooms)in which prohibited activities occur and the extent of such prohibitedactivities;(c) The existence of separate personnel;(d) The extent to which signs and other forms of identification of theTitle X project are present and signs and material promoting abortion areabsent.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 59.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Prohibition on activities that encourage, promote or advocate abortion.</ITAG>(a) A Title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate abortion asa method of family planning. This requirement prohibits actions to assistwomen to obtain abortions or increase the availability or accessibilityof abortion for family planning purposes. Prohibited actions include theuse of Title X project funds for the following:(1) Lobbying for the passage of legislation to increase in any way theavailability of abortion as a method of family planning;(2) Providing speakers to promote the use of abortion as a method of familyplanning;(3) Paying dues to any group that as a significant part of its activitiesadvocates abortion as a method of family planning;(4) Using legal action to make abortion available in any way as a methodof family planning; and(5) Developing or disseminating in any way materials (including printedmatter and audiovisual materials) advocating abortion as a method of familyplanning.(b) <T3>Examples. </T3>(1) Clients at a Title X project are given brochuresadvertising an abortion clinic. Provision of the brochure violates subparagraph(a) of this section.(2) A Title X project makes an appointment for a pregnant client with anabortion clinic. The Title X project has violated paragraph (a) of thissection.(3) A Title X project pays dues to a state association which, among otheractivities, lobbies at state and local levels for the passage of legislationto protect and expand the legal availability of abortion as a method offamily planning. The association spends a significant amount of its annualbudget on such activity. Payment of dues to the association violates paragraph(a)(3) of this section.(4) An organization conducts a number of activities, including operatinga Title X project. The organization uses non-project funds to pay duesto an association which, among other activities, engages in lobbying toprotect and expand the legal availability of abortion as a method of familyplanning. The association spends a significant amount of its annual budgeton such activity. Payment of dues to the association by the organizationdoes not violate paragraph (a)(3) of this section.(5) An organization that operates a Title X project engages in lobbyingto increase the legal availability of abortion as a method of family planning.The project itself engages in no such activities and the facilities andfunds of the project are kept separate from prohibited activities. Theproject is not in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.(6) Employees of a Title X project write their legislative representativesin support of legislation seeking to expand the legal availability of abortion,using no project funds to do so.
