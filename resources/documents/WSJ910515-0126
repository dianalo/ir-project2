Itis that President Bush, probably more than any other recentpresident, understands the constitutional nature of theoffice he holds and is willing to act, through the veto, inits defense.   The veto power is not explicitly mentioned in theConstitution even though the paragraph in which it is foundis the second-longest in the document. Article I, Section 7discusses how the president, if he does not agree with apiece of legislation, &quot;shall return it, with his Objectionsto that House in which it shall have originated.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Today it is common to think of the veto purely in policyterms. Thus, in 1989, Mr. Bush wanted a minimum wage fourdimes lower than the one Congress voted, so he &quot;returned&quot; thebill. Last fall, he &quot;returned&quot; civil-rights legislation onthe ground that it would foster quotas. Most vetoes in anygiven presidency will be of the policy variety, and themajority of Mr. Bush's 21 vetoes to date (none has beenoverridden) are precisely of that kind. But this wasn't theoriginal reason for the power.   &quot;The primary inducement&quot; for giving the president theveto, wrote Alexander Hamilton in &quot;The Federalist,&quot; was &quot;toenable him to defend himself&quot; against congressional &quot;attackupon the constitutional rights of the executive.&quot; Without theveto, said Hamilton, the president would be &quot;absolutelyunable to defend himself against the depradations&quot; ofCongress. And without the veto -- &quot;a constitutional andeffectual power of self-defense,&quot; Hamilton called it --presidential powers could be assumed by Congress, and thesystem of separated powers would become so much ancienthistory.   The veto thus is a weapon that can fortify the presidentin legislative battles with Congress over his own powers, butit must be emphasized that the veto in this or the policycontext is only so good as any president's willingness to useit. What Mr. Bush was too polite to tell his Princetonaudience was that his predecessor cast only two&quot;self-defense&quot; vetoes, unfortunately failing to veto severalbills that threatened presidential prerogatives. RonaldReagan's weakness in this regard is George Bush's strength.His self-defense vetoes include last year's &quot;return&quot; of theIntelligence Authorization Act, which would have required thepresident to notify Congress in advance of every singleintelligence activity.   As a general matter, the veto -- as nothing else can, noteven a public speech in the television age -- forces Congressto consider the president's point of view if it wants tolegislate on the matter a veto contests. And for Congress tooverride a veto, a two-thirds majority in both houses mustoppose the president. The veto thus is qualified, but clearlyit is an important presidential power, especially when apresident's constitutional rights are at stake.   Indeed, under such circumstances it is arguably his mostimportant power. In 1987, President Reagan opposedreauthorization of the independent counsel statute -- a lawthat constituted an attack upon the constitutional rights ofthe executive. He tried to persuade Congress, through JusticeDepartment testimony, to eliminate certain unconstitutionalfeatures of the bill. That didn't work. Mr. Reagannonetheless signed the bill into law, expressing his hopethat the federal courts would strike it down. That didn'twork either.   In both Congress and the court Mr. Reagan needed majorityvotes (of different kinds, of course) to get his way. Had henot signed the legislation but instead cast a veto, he wouldhave needed only a third of one house plus one member. With aveto, his chances would have been better.   Why Mr. Reagan didn't veto this bill and others aimed athis authority is subject to speculation. But it should beevident that any president who understands the nature of hisoffice must be ready to act in self-defense -- i.e., to veto.After all, who more than himself can a president count on forhis defense?   Of course, as James Madison once observed, it is often thecase that neither Congress nor the president &quot;can pretend toan exclusive or superior right of settling the boundariesbetween their respective powers.&quot; But that doesn't mean thepresident should defer to Congress in settling thoseboundaries. As Mr. Bush has on every important occasion, apresident can act through the veto to put his constitutionalclaim in place. Moreover, even when a president approveslegislation that includes provisions aimed at his powers, hecan explicitly indicate in his signing statement that they donot have the force of law. More often than any recentpresident, Mr. Bush has taken this course, thus ensuringthere can be no question where he stands.   It is a stand ignored by the press. Even when thepresident himself talks publicly about the concept, as he didlast week, the press reaction is to turn to other subjects.Let history nonetheless observe that Mr. Bush said atPrinceton: &quot;The president has a constitutional obligation toprotect his office and to veto {anti-executive} legislation.&quot;As the record so far shows, these words reflect actual deeds.For those wishing to understand Mr. Bush and his presidency,his self-defense record is an essential source ofinformation.   ---   Mr. Eastland is a fellow at the Ethics and Public PolicyCenter in Washington.
