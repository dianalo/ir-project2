Wickes' announcement Wednesday suggested the agreement wouldresult in the departure of chairman Sanford Sigoloff, who broughtthe company out of bankruptcy in 1985 and organized the failedmanagement buyout.   The agreement calls for Blackstone and Wasserstein Perella to pay$11.25 a share in cash for 80 percent of Wickes' 49.8 millionshares. The remaining stock would be converted to preferred stock inWCI Holdings Corp., the company formed to handle the purchase.

The management offer of $12 per share was withdrawn after Wickeslowered its 1988 earnings forecast by $40 million.   Analysts said it appeared the Blackstone-Wasserstein Perellaagreement would end speculation about potential buyers and thepossibility the company could be broken up and some pieces sold.   ``These are reputable people and it looks like a real deal,''said Anthony Pearce-Batten, who tracks Wickes for the investmentfirm Legg Mason, Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore.   Lloyd Kanev of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York saidhis firm was advising clients to sell their shares as it appearedhigher bids were unlikely.
