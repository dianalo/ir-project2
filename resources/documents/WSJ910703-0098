His fall from grace has left him $1.5 million in debtand facing charges that he fraudulently obtained loans frombanks and mortgage companies, as well as gambled awaymillions of dollars. He blames compulsive gambling, which hecalls a &quot;sickness.&quot;   The notion of &quot;compulsive&quot; or &quot;pathological&quot; gambling hasbecome a perennial doctor's note, used to excuse the behaviorof irresponsible gamblers and increase the status and incomeof the gambling doctors who purport to treat it. In 1980, theAmerican Psychiatric Association in its diagnostic manualplaced pathological gambling in one of its categories ofimpulse disorders, behaviors over which the sufferersallegedly have no control.</LP><TEXT>   The public's acceptance of the notion of a disease ofgambling received a big boost in 1983 when the public disdaintoward pro football player Art Schlichter's hefty gamblinglosses was substantially changed into concern by therevelation that Mr. Schlichter was suffering frompsychiatrically certified pathological gambling.   Similarly, when it was disclosed a couple of years agothat Pete Rose had violated baseball's prohibition againstgambling, Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council onCompulsive Gambling of New Jersey, predicted that Mr. Rose&quot;will do for compulsive gambling what Betty Ford did foralcoholism.&quot;   Despite their fervent wish to medicalize gambling, thegambling doctors provide not a shred of evidence that thereis any medical cause for heavy gambling. There is noneurochemical or neurophysiological change causally linked toheavy gambling, only changes (such as increased adrenaline,rise in blood pressure, etc.) that occur as a consequence ofthe excitement of the gambling. Several years ago, a study bythe National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholismshowed, for example, no difference in serotonin levelsbetween compulsive gamblers and normal men.   Thus, no laboratory finding is diagnostic of pathologicalgambling. The &quot;disorder&quot; is &quot;diagnosed&quot; by applying thenonmedical criteria set forth in the American PsychiatricAssociation's diagnostic manual. Thus, for example, if aperson demonstrates a too &quot;frequent preoccupation withgambling,&quot; and his gambling causes neglect of &quot;social oroccupational obligations,&quot; he could qualify as a pathologicalgambler.   Nor is the claim convincing that heavy gamblers have anirresistible compulsion to gamble. The argument is typicallya circular one; namely that no gambler would willinglycontinue gambling in view of the drastic consequences of lossof money, family problems, legal problems, etc.   The argument that excessive gambling is beyond thegambler's control would make sense if he (such gamblers areusually male) anticipated such disastrous consequences, butgamblers anticipate winning, not losing. In addition, lossesare often the culmination of exponentially increasing wagersthat entail the possibility of winning large amounts that canwipe out losses at any time.   The medicalizing of heavy gambling has important financialconsequences. Valerie Lorenz, executive director of theNational Center for Pathological Gambling Inc., wroterecently, &quot;We must provide the funds for treatment for thegambler and the gambler's family . . . funds to educate ourcommunities . . . funds to train mental health providers andto establish gambling treatment programs . . . funds toconduct research to better understand this illness.&quot;   In this time of crisis in health-care costs, questionablepsychiatric &quot;illnesses&quot; add tremendously to those costs. ABlue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland employee said in aninterview that psychiatric costs constitute 18% to 25% of theinsurer's payouts.   Providing help at third-party expense by calling suchbehavior &quot;illness&quot; is simply unjustifiable, and providingsympathy for irresponsible gamblers can have little effectbut to eliminate the stigma that might provide some incentivefor some heavy gamblers to curtail their gambling. A littlemore journalistic skepticism in reports on &quot;compulsivegambling&quot; could also be worthwhile.   ---   Mr. Vatz, a professor of rhetoric and communication atTowson State University in Maryland, is an associatepsychology editor of USA Today Magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
