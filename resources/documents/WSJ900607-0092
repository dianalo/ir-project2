The three-judge panel said the agency's decision was&quot;unlawfully arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and sent the matterback to the FCC for further consideration. The appeals courtcriticized the agency for basing its decision on insufficientinformation. The court's ruling could be a setback for theBell companies. Although there has been relatively littleintegration so far, the Bells believe that combiningregulated and nonregulated operations would improveefficiencies and help to cut costs. The FCC said it wasreviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment.</LP><TEXT>   The 1985 FCC decision, known as Computer III, grew out ofthe agency's efforts to regulate the increasinginterdependence of telephones and computers, and actions toencourage the development of a robust &quot;enhanced-services&quot;industry. Enhanced services generally refer to computer-basedservices that benefit customers, such as storing data withinthe telephone network.   After the Bell System breakup in 1984, the commissionrequired so-called structural separation of unregulated andregulated businesses. In August 1985, however, the commissiondecided to lift that requirement, replacing it with so-callednonstructural safeguards to prevent cross subsidies and otheranti-competitive behavior.   Yesterday, the court vacated two FCC orders: one thatallowed the Bell companies to merge their regulated telephoneoperations with unregulated businesses, and a second thatpre-empted state regulation of telephone companies' provisionof enhanced services.   Spokesmen for some Bell companies, including PacificTelesis Group and Bell South Corp., said company lawyers werestudying the decision and had no immediate comment. Aspokesman for MCI Communications Corp., which had petitionedfor the appeals-court review, said the company &quot;is delightedwith the decision. The regulated and nonregulated Bellcompany subsidiaries should be separate.&quot;   In a summary of its decision, the court noted that the FCCabruptly reversed itself just 14 months after arguing thatthe Bell System breakup didn't reduce the need for separatesubsidiaries. At that time, the FCC presented a new argument:Changes in the telecommunications marketplace cut the risksof Bell companies using revenues from their monopoly phonebusinesses to help their competitive and growingenhanced-services businesses.   The court said the record compiled by the commission inthe Computer III proceeding &quot;yields no support for thecommission's position that market and technological changeshave reduced the danger of cross subsidization&quot; by the Bellcompanies. Thus, it said, it was arbitrary and capricious todrop the requirement for separate units and rely instead oncost-accounting regulations to protect consumers andcompetitors.   Nevertheless, the summary said the commission &quot;made aplausible case&quot; that consumers would benefit from lifting therequirements because the Bell companies could operate moreefficiently and that the growth of technologies that bypassthe local phone networks would reduce the threat that Bellcompanies would discriminate against competitors in providingaccess to their networks.   As for pre-empting the states on regulation ofenhanced-service providers, the court said the agency &quot;failedto carry its burden of showing that its pre-emption ordersare necessary to avoid frustrating its regulatory goals.&quot; Itis unlikely, however, that the agency will determine thatregulation should revert to the states, creating a crazyquilt of rules for enhanced-service providers.</TEXT></DOC>
