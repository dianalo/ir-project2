Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said U.S. officialswill file papers Wednesday in more than a half-dozen countrieswhere, he said, Noriega had hidden ``illegal drug money'' amountingto more than $10 million.   Runkel said the U.S. would try to freeze cash, or liquid assets,which are in European bank accounts. He refused to identify thebanks, although he did say that none of Noriega's money has beentraced to the United States.   The administration was training its legal sights on Panamanianmoney assets as officials remained embroiled in tense negotiationsover Noriega, wanted in this country on drug-trafficking charges.The administration sought to pry Noriega from the custody of thethe Vatican Embassy in Panama City.   In Panama City, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. SouthernCommand, conferred three time on the street outside the embassywith Monsignor Sabastian Laboa, the papal nuncio.   Despite the negotiations, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said thesituation with Noriega might be prolonged for an indefinite periodof time. ``It could be that they'll have a long-term resident intheir embassy in Panama City,'' he said.   The Vatican, which has no extradition treaty with the UnitedStates, refused to simply hand Noriega over to Washington. And ithas maintained that stand since the deposed Panamanian leader,along with what Runkel described as ``10 associate thugs,'' soughtasylum at Papal Nunciature Sunday afternoon.   ``Our position is, we mean to bring him back to the UnitedStates,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. But herefused to rule out the possibility that other options might beconsidered. One scenario is that Noriega might stand trial inPanama. Another had him possibly going to a third country.   ``Everybody is talking to everybody,'' Fitzwater said. But hesaid ``it's too soon to characterize it as progress.''   Although Bush has not talked directly either with Pope John PaulII or with the nunciature in Panama about Noriega, Fitzwater saidU.S. officials have used diplomatic channels to press their demand.   ``We told them very directly what our feeling were,'' he said.   Fitzwater spoke at the White House as President Bush was havinga working lunch with top advisers at his Camp David, Md., and asthe chief Pentagon spokesman said conditions had stabilized inPanama.   Bush was briefed by Cheney, newly returned from a visit to U.S.troops in Panama, along with national security adviser BrentScowcroft and Gen. Colin D. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff.   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams revealed that whenNoriega turned himself in Sunday, he was ``said to be so exhaustedfrom the chase that he could barely speak.'' Williams said Noriegahad been on the run since the U.S. operations began six daysearlier, and said he never was in command of the Panamanian DefenseForces which resisted U.S. soldiers.   A task force composed of officials from the departments ofState, Justice and Defense, as well as National Security Council,was formed to tackle the negotiations on Noriega's fate. The groupconducted most of its meetings in telephone conferences.   The United States has rejected the idea that Noriega might beentitled to political asylum. Under international law, such asylumcan only be granted on the grounds that a person is subject topersecution because of religious or political views, Runkel said.   ``Noriega does not fit either category,'' he said. ``His fearsare of prosecution in the United States on two indictments.''   Fitzwater said the United States had offered Noriega a deal asrecently as October if he would step down, but Noriega refused. TheUnited States will not compromise with Noriega now, he said.   Meantime, one U.S. official, speaking on condition he not beidentified, said the pope's representatives have contacted severalLatin American and European countries in hopes one will agree totake Noriega.   ``He has no place to go yet,'' the official said. ``No one wantshim.''   Officials said there was no way Noriega could flee from thenunciature because it is surrounded by U.S. troops intending toremain in place as long as Noriega is inside.   ``There's no way he can get out,'' Cheney said in an interviewon ABC-TV. ``But by the same token, we do not have the authority togo in and take him out because of international law.''   Cheney, back from a Christmas Day tour of Panama where visitedan estimated 26,000 troops, said the situation in the country was``much quieter than it's been'' since the U.S. invasion last week.   Despite occasional sniping incidents, Cheney said the``overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy.'' Cheney said the``U.S. military did its job,'' and now ``the lawyers and thediplomats have to take over.''   If the situation in Panama continues to improve, Cheney said,the United States might speed up the withdrawal of troops. He gaveno timetable, though.   Williams said Panamanian citizens have been turning weapons overto U.S. troops and revealing the whereabouts of large weaponscaches.   ``The best I can tell you is that about 33,000 weapons have nowbeen captured, discovered, or turned in,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
