<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-0255 </DOCNO><TEXT>There have been many studies of the vibrational and optical propertiesof a-Si and a-Ge that have correlated systematic variations of theseproperties with films grown and/or annealing temperatures, and have attributedthese variations to changes the local atomic structure and intrinsicnetwork disorder that are correlated with the thermal history of a particularsample. The most frequently proposed atomic structure parameter associatedwith this intrinsic disorder has been the width of the bond angle distribution.The authors attempted to isolate the effects of bond angle disorder onthe vibrational and electronic properties of a-Si using a Bethe Latticestructure that avoids some of the uncertainties introduced by the uncontrolledvariation in other atom structure parameters. Using this approach, theyshow that increases in the width of the bond angle distribution can accountfor trends in the calculated vibrational and optical properties withthermal history that are in good qualitative agreement with trends reportedin the experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
