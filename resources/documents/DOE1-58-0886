<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-58-0886 </DOCNO><TEXT>Surface analysis including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), coreelectron energy-loss (CEEL), and temperature programmed oxidation--XPShave been used to characterize the fines from a tar sand oil obtainedby extraction of a western tar sand, a shale oil obtained by retort ofa western shale, and a coal liquid produced by direct liquefaction ofa sub-bituminous coal. Our results identify the modes of interactioninvolved between different organic and mineral types. In tar sand fines,the major mineral component is clay. The dominant organic interactionwith the clay phase is with N-rich asphaltenes. In shale, the major mineralcomponent is Ca and Ca/Mg carbonates while clay represents a minor component.The major bonding between the organic and mineral phases is a cation--carboxylateinteraction. However, the clay continues to bind up a substantial fractionof the N-rich organics although it represents a minor phase. In coalliquid, the fines consist of a heterogeneous mix of organic and mineralphases. The mineral particles, in particular Fe, are strongly associatedwith organics. CEEL analysis of the organics shows highly aromatic structure.Comparing organics on fines with coal feed indicates hydrogen incorporationduring coal liquefaction.</TEXT></DOC>
