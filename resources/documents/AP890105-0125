Meanwhile, sources close to Bush who spoke on the condition ofanonymity said that two top contenders for the other unfilled spot,the newly created job of drug czar, are former education secretaryWilliam J. Bennett and Texas industrialist Ross Perot.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said today Bush had offered himthe drug post on Tuesday, but he turned it down in a half-hourmeeting this morning with the president-elect. DeConcini was electedin November to a third six-year term and said he did not want toleave the Senate so soon after the election.   ``I am very flattered and humbled by his confidence,'' DeConcinisaid at a news conference. ``It was very tempting to me, based on myinterests.''   DeConcini, who was critical of Bush's role overseeing anti-drugefforts for the Reagan administration, today praised his grasp ofthe issue.   When reminded of his opinions during the presidential campaign,DeConcini replied: ``Time has a lot to do with one's attitudes.''   DeConcini said Bush offered him the post Tuesday morning beforeCapitol Hill ceremonies marking the opening of the new Congress andasked him to keep it confidential. The senator said Bush releasedhim from that pledge this morning.   DeConcini suggested a couple of people for the post, includingRep. Glenn English, D-Okla., but Bush made no commitment, saying hehad no one else in mind for the job.   Schlesinger, energy secretary under President Carter and defensesecretary under President Ford, had earlier been mentioned as aleading candidate for the energy post.   The vice president and Schlesinger met last week to discussenergy issues but ``the job was not offered,'' said a senior Bushtransition official who insisted upon not being identified.   Schlesinger reportedly ran into opposition among influentialRepublicans for his ties to the Carter administration and anabrasive style, the sources said.   Sources said that former Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore remained atop contender on Bush's short list for the energy post.   Aides to Bush said that while he would like to wrap up hisCabinet selection as soon as possible, it was unlikely anyadditional announcements would come as early as today.   Bush on Wednesday took obvious delight in his last official dutyas presiding officer of the Senate. Ruling over a joint session ofCongress convened to count electoral votes, the vice president wasable to formally announce his own presidential victory.   He declared the final tally from the Electoral College ballotscast last month, giving ``George Bush of the state of Texas'' 426votes to Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis' 111 and a maverickelectoral vote cast in West Virginia for Lloyd Bentsen forpresident. The final tally reflected Bush's 40-state sweep in theNovember election.   It had been 152 years since a vice president had been able toperform such a task. Grinning broadly, Bush rapped the gavel anddeclared ``the joint session dissolved.'' Congress will notreconvene until Jan. 20, when Bush and Vice President-elect DanQuayle are inaugurated.   The last vice president to preside over his own presidentialelection certification was Martin Van Buren in 1837. This is onlythe fourth time a sitting vice president has been elected presidentin history. The others were John Adams (George Washington's vicepresident) and James Madison (Thomas Jefferson's).   The stray vote for Bentsen came from West Virginia, where oneDukakis elector flipped her ballot, putting the Texas senator firstand the Massachusetts governor second.   Bush injected a note of humor in the roll call when Rep. FrankAnnunzio, D-Ill., one of four official vote counters, announced onlythat Arkansas had cast six votes for president.   ``The chair wonders who won that one,'' Bush observed dryly.   As the chamber erupted in laughter and applause, Annunzioresponded, ``It's obvious that they all know the answer to thatone.''   While on Capitol Hill, Bush met privately with Sens. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and had lunch with Rep. RobertDornan, R-Calif.   Dornan, an early Bush supporter, said they discussed both theenergy and drug posts over turkey sandwiches in the Senate diningroom, but that Bush did not indicate whom he might select for either.   Dornan said he told Bush his own choice for drug czar was Bennett.   Dornan said Bush likely invited him to lunch because ``I was thefirst member of either the House or the Senate to endorse him. We'vedeveloped a good relationship.''</TEXT></DOC>
