The Big Board said short interest fell 7.1% to 436,966,248 shares from 470,578,343 shares a month earlier. A year ago, short interest was 331.4 million shares.    The Amex said short interest fell 2,083,094 shares, or 6.2%, to a revised 31,026,717 shares. A year ago, Amex short interest was 32,953,082 shares.    A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock. While a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.    The seller in a short sale expects to be able to purchase an equal number of shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven't been purchased for return to lenders.    Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.    In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company's stock is to be exchanged for that of another, or for a new issue, in a proposed merger. The profit opportunity arises when the stocks sell at disparate prices.    An arbitrager may make a per-share profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.    Big Board short-sellers increased their already sizable positions in LTV Corp., the steel, aerospace and energy concern that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, and Viacom International, which has been the subject of a takeover bid. But, in a well-timed move, they decreased their position in American Motors Corp., whose board earlier this week approved a sweetened merger bid by Chrysler Corp. for the equivalent of $4.50 a share. The earlier offer was $4 a share.    The level of negative betting fell last month. The Big Board short interest ratio was 2.37 times average trading volume, compared with the previous month's 2.58. May's ratio is the lowest in a year.    Adjusted to remove issues that are subject to arbitrage and examining those issues that are fully &quot;at risk,&quot; the ratio for the period rose to 1.92 average daily trading volume from 1.78 last month. The adjusted ratio is designed to reflect the degree of pessimism in the short interest figures.    Philip Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn., said the most recent figure is indicative of a market low. &quot;When you get fear to an extreme level, and I view this as extreme, it's usually coincident with market bottoms,&quot; he said. &quot;Since the primary trend is bullish now, I think this means the end of the corrective phase.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
