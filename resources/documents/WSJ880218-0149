The Midland Cogeneration Venture got approval from the Michigan Air Pollution Control Commission to start building natural-gas turbine generators and other permanent facilities this spring. The state commission sets emission control standards.    A cogeneration plant simultaneously produces electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source.    CMS Energy, parent of Consumers Power Co., is the majority partner in the venture formed to convert Consumer Powers' idled nuclear plant in Midland, Mich., into a cogeneration facility. CMS Energy has a 49% stake in the $2 billion plant, which was abandoned as a nuclear facility because of skyrocketing costs and production delays.    The cogeneration plant is scheduled to supply steam and electricity to Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical Co., a venture partner, and to electric customers of Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power, Michigan's largest utility, beginning in 1990.    Other partners in the Midland Cogeneration Venture are subsidiaries of Houston-based Coastal Corp.; Baden, Switzerland-based BBC Boveri Inc.; Irvine, Calif.-based Fluor Corp.; and Houston-based Panhandle Eastern Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
