A target of the inquiry, according to futures industry attorneys and officials, is Jeffrey G. Donnelly, a stock-index futures trader who was expelled by the Chicago Merc in March and fined $100,000 on a charge of fraudulent trading.    An exchange committee said Mr. Donnelly was involved in improper trading of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. 500 stock-index futures from 1984 through last summer. Industry officials said profit from the trades involved exceeded $500,000.    A Chicago Merc spokesman confirmed yesterday that the exchange complied this year with a grand jury subpoena for records concerning the disciplinary case against Mr. Donnelly. He declined to elaborate.    Mr. Donnelly couldn't be reached for comment. An attorney for Mr. Donnelly, William Phelan, declined to comment.    Industry attorneys said it isn't clear whether the grand jury is investigating other possible trading abuses at the Chicago Merc. Another trader, John D. Riss, was fined $50,000 and expelled at the same time as Mr. Donnelly for alleged trading infractions.    The Chicago Merc has levied fines totaling more than $500,000 on traders this year as part of a crackdown on alleged trading abuses in its Sandamp;P 500 stock-index futures pit.    At least four traders are scheduled to appear before an exchange disciplinary committee in the next few weeks in connection with Mr. Donnelly's alleged improper trading, industry attorneys and officials said.    The Merc's tougher enforcement stance was adopted in the face of rising criticism from Wall Street customers and others about alleged trading abuses and poor pricing by traders in the Sandamp;P 500 pit.    In addition to fines and other disciplinary actions, the exchange recently approved rule changes aimed at sharply curtailing certain trading practices, notably allowing brokers to trade for both their own and customers' accounts.    The exchange committee alleged in March that Mr. Donnelly circumvented &quot;restrictions placed on his personal trading&quot; by his employer from 1984 through 1986. The committee directed him to repay his trading profit to his employer, which wasn't named in the disciplinary action.    Mr. Donnelly was employed by a unit of Chicago Research andamp; Trading Group, a closely held futures and options trading concern, during the period covered by the exchange's finding. He was dismissed by the company last year before the exchange made the allegations against him.    An attorney in the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago declined to comment on the existence of a grand jury investigation. Federal Bureau of Investigation officials also declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
