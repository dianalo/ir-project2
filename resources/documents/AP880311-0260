President Vinicio Cerezo turned down guerrilla proposals fortalks as ``a good-for-nothing petition.'' A few days before he didthat, the Roman Catholic archbishop, Prospero Penados del Barrio,accepted a request from the rebels to mediate between the two sides.   The rebels, the church and most political parties have urged theresumption of talks between the government and rebels in Madrid,Spain, last October _ the first in the 27-year-old war.   But Gen. Hector Gramajo, the defense minister, repeated themilitary's insistence that the rebels abandon their weapons first.   ``The army is very close to achieving a total victory,'' he said.   A few days before the October talks began in Madrid with theGuatemalan National Revolutionary Union, the umbrella for threeguerrilla forces, the army announced new operations in therebel-controlled northern part of Quiche province and on thesouthern side of Lake Atitlan, where the rebels have been mostentrenched.   Establishing a cease-fire is one of the commitments Guatemalaagreed to in signing the Central American peace plan last Aug. 7along with Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras.   Gramajo maintained, however, that with an amnesty that requiresrebels to disarm and participate in the political process, ``thereis no need for talks.''   The rebels refute Gramajo's claims that they have only 500 to700 now under arms, down from 2,500 to 3,000 in 1986, and that themilitary offensive is a success. In the early 1980s, rebel strengthwas estimated at 4,000 to 6,000 combatants.   ``There is a flareup in the war in Guatemala, basically becauseof the army offensive,'' said one of the guerrilla respresentativeswho went to Madrid in October, speaking on condition of anonymity.He called the army's current offensive the ``biggest ever instrictly military terms.''   The army has thrown most of its strength of 43,000 personnel,including air support, into the effort, mainly focused on Quiche.   The guerrilla organization claims 3,500 combatants in its threearmies _ the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, the group fighting inQuiche, a northwestern province; the Organization of the People inArms, generally in the Lake Atitlan area and west to San Marcos,and the Rebel Armed Forces in the northern Peten panhandle province.   Gramajo placed the army's casualties from September tomid-February at 83, while the rebel source put them at 700 fromOctober through December. Neither side gave rebel casualties, whichgenerally are lower because guerrillas use ambushes and othertactics that avoid direct combat.   One of the army's main targets is what it considers the rebelsupport population in northern Quiche _ thousands of campesinos,most of them Indians, who have hidden from the army for as long asseven years.   They remained behind when thousands of others fled intoneighboring Mexico or cities in the early 1980s, when more than 400villages were destroyed and tens of thousands of civilians killedin the northwest highlands.   Highlands residents, diplomats and human rights groups claim thearmy did most of the killing. The army blames the guerrillas.   The rebels say they are fighting for what they call realdemocracy and national sovereignty and against social injustice andpoverty.,   The most visible effect of the offensive in northern Quichearound the area of Nebaj is the hundreds of refugees being broughtto the army base there. Gramajo says a sign of the army's successis its ``rescue'' of 2,200 of the 4,000 peasants in the area.   Although the army is allowing them to return to a few villagesnear Nebaj where it has re-established permanent posts and isputting in roads, the refugees must first receive three months ofarmy ``re-education'' in ``patriotism and nationalism,'' officerssaid.   Villagers farther north remain closed to them.   ``Right now they can't return to those places,'' the civilianaffairs officer at the base said. ``The army is going to have moresuccess the fewer the people who are there.''   One refugee identifying himself only as Diego said some refugeesare captured by the army and others turn themselves in whensoldiers appear.   ``We saw, well, that there was no way out because the army wascovering all the points,'' he said in a whisper outside awood-plank army barracks at Nebaj.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs March 17</NOTE></DOC>
