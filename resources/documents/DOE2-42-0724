The general objective of this study is toimprove and extend a generalized two-dimensional, pulverized coal combustionand gasification code (PCGC-2) for application to large-scale, practicalconfigurations, and to evaluate and implement the resulting code on anindustrial scale. This report summarizes work conducted during the thirdyear of this contract. Details of the work accomplished during each ofthe first two years of this project has been reported in previous annualreports (Smith and Smoot, May 1986, May 1987). The work reported in thisannual summary is given by task and includes only tasks worked duringthis period. 57 refs., 26 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
