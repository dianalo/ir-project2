Sharansky, a former Soviet refusnik, was joined by an officialof a resettlement agency in complaining about excessive censorship.   The ban on publication of immigration figures was imposed March1 amid mounting Arab protests the influx could lead to more Jewishsettlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, hometo 1.7 million Palestinians.   Sharansky, who heads the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, said todaysome self-censorship might be needed to ensure the security of theimmigrants.   But he said, ``We need more support from world Jewry and, tomake bureaucrats work more effectively, we need more publicpressure. We can't do it under conditions of censorship.''   Sharansky and other Israeli activists have said the Jewish stateis not preparing enough housing and jobs for the arriving Soviets.   Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for the Jewish Agency, which sharesresponsibility with the government for resettling immigrants, saidhis group appealed to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to have thecensorship guidelines limited to two issues _ long-term immigrationprojections and new transit routes.   ``The process of fund-raising, especially in our OperationExodus campaign for the Soviets, depends a great deal on a constantflow of accurate information about the immigration,'' Ben-Ari said.``We are already having difficulties,''   Operation Exodus aims to raise $200 million in each of the nextthree years from Jews in the United States and Europe.   In early March, Israel's military censor declared all materialon the immigration of Soviet Jews had to be submitted to the censorprior to publication.   Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, said todaydespite that the broad wording of the censorship rule, it wasactually limited to two items, the number of immigrants and routesof getting to Israel.   ``American Jewry knows full well we are speaking of a big drama,a big operation,'' Olmert said. ``Whether the number is `x' or `y'isn't necessarily the most important item right now.''   The immigration surge began last year, when 12,000 Soviet Jewscame to Israel, spurred by eased exit policies in the Soviet Unionand tighter U.S. immigration rules. Israeli leaders have said theyexpect up to 750,000 Soviet immigrants this decade.   Arab groups have protested the influx, and the Islamic Jihad forthe Liberation of Palestine said last week it would target airlinesand airports involved in the immigration.   On Monday, the 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conferenceissued a statement in Saudi Arabia calling on Arab states ``to useall possible means and methods'' to prevent Soviet Jews from movingto the occupied territories.   The Arab outcry began after Shamir said in mid-January the waveof immigration required ``the Land of Israel, a large and strongIsrael.'' Palestinians interpreted the statement as meaning Israelintended to keep the occupied territories, which were captured fromJordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   Shamir later said the immigrants were not being directed to theterritories.</TEXT></DOC>
