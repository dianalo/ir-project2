Itwill not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;will not result in a major increase in costs or prices to consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local agencies, or geographic regions; andwill not have a significant adverse impact on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.This part applies to Federal government agencies. In accordance with theRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, it is hereby certified that this proposedrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.This rule does not contain information requirements that are subject tothe Paper Work Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) and OMB implementingregulations 5 CFR 1320.The regulation in this part provides guidance to federal agencies whichmay or may not take an action which could be subject to environmental documentationrequirements. The guidance has no environmental consequences and it isdetermined, under FEMA's regulation published in 44 CFR 10.8, that it isnot necessary to prepare either an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement.In promulgating these rules, FEMA has considered the President's ExecutiveOrder on Federalism issued on October 26, 1987 (E.O. 12612, 52 FR 41685).The purpose of the order is to assure the appropriate division of governmentalresponsibilities between national government and the States. Among otherprovisions, this rule implements the requirements that agency rules bein accordance with the so-called common rule, adopted by FEMA at 44 CFRPart 13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements to State and local Governments. The problem dealt with in thispart is national in scope. In view of the joint federal-state responsibilityfor civil defense, and FEMA's role under the Federal Civil Defense Actof 1950, as amended, the regulation in this Part is determined to conformFEMA assistance to Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR 334</ITAG>National defense, Emergency Graduated Mobilization Response.Accordingly, Subchapter E Chapter 1, Title 44, Code of Federal Regulationsproposes to be amended by adding a new Part 334 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 334_GRADUATED MOBILIZATION RESPONSE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.1 Purpose</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.2 Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.3 Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.4 Definitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.5 GMR system description</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">334.6 Department and agency responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 50 U.S.C. 404; 50 U.S.C.

Accordingly, each Federal department and agency shallprepare its national security emergency preparedness plans and programsto respond adequately and in a timely manner to all national security emergencies.(b) As part of emergency response, the GMR system should be incorporatedin each department's and agency's emergency preparedness plans and programsto provide appropriate and effective response options for considerationin reacting to ambiguous and specific warnings.(c) Emergency resource preparedness planning is essential to ensure thatthe nation is adequately prepared to respond to potential national emergencies.Such emergency resource preparedness planning requires an exchange of informationand planning factors among the various departments and agencies responsiblefor different resource preparedness activities.(d) To carry out their emergency planning activities, civilian departmentand agencies require the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potentialmilitary demands that would be made on the economy in a full range of possiblenational security emergencies. Similarly, DOD planning should be conductedusing planning regimes consistent with the policies and plans of the civilianresource departments and agencies.(e) Under section 104(c) of Executive Order 12656, FEMA is responsiblefor coordinating the implementation of national emergency preparednesspolicy with Federal departments and agencies and with state and local governmentsand, therfore, is responsible for developing a system of planning proceduresfor integrating the emergency preparedness actions of Federal, State andlocal governments.(f) Federal departments and agencies shall design their preparedness measuresto permit a rapid and effective transition from routine to emergency operations,and to make effective use of the period following initial indication ofa probable national security emergency. This will include:(1) Development of a system of emergency actions that defines alternatives,processes, and issues to be considered during various stages of nationalsecurity emergencies; and (2) Identification of actions that could be taken at the Federal and locallevels of government in the early stages of a national security emergencyor pending national security emergency to mitigate the impact of or reducesignificantly the leadtime associated with full emergency action implementation.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;334.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Background</ITAG>The GMR system is designed to take into account the need to mobilize theNation's resources in response to a wide range of crisis or emergency situations.GMR is a flexible decision making process of preparedness and responseactions which are appropriate to warning indicators or an event. Thus,GMR allows the government, as a whole, to take small or large, often reversible,steps to increase its national security emergency preparedness posture.(b) Crises, especially those resulting in major military activities, alwayshave some political or economic context. As the risks of military actionincrease, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer periodof time to increase their military power. These preparations shape thenature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing ofoccurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicatorsof threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on thenature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warningindicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrialsectors.(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planningand actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use itto reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence shouldfail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phasedactions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essentialcivilian requirements. The GMR system integrates the potential strengthof the national economy into U.S. national security strategy.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;334.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions</ITAG>(a) <T3>Graduated Mobilization Response </T3>(GMR) is a system for integratingmobilization actions designed to respond to ambiguous and/or specific warnings.These actions are designed to mitigate the impact of an event or crisisand reduce significantly the lead time associated with a full nationalsecurity emergency action implementation.(b) <T3>National security emergency </T3>is any occurrence, including naturaldisaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency,that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the UnitedStates.(c) <T3>Mobilization </T3>is the process of marshalling resources, both civiland military, to respond to and manage a national security emergency.(d) <T3>GMR Plans </T3>are those agency documents that describe, in general,the actions that an agency could take in the early stages of a nationalsecurity emergency, or upon receipt of warning information about a possiblenational security emergency. These actions would be designed to mitigatethe impact of, or reduce significantly, the lead times associated withfull emergency action implementation. Such plans are required by section201(4)(b) of Executive Order 12656.(e) <T3>A Costed Option Package </T3>is a document that describes in detaila particular action that an agency could take in the early stages of anational security emergency. The general content of a GMR costed optionpackage includes alternative response options; the resource implicationsof each option; shortfalls, costs, timeframes and political feasibility.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 334.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">GMR system description.</ITAG>The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity (additionalintermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a federal departmentor agency might divide ``Crisis Management'' into two, three, or more levelsas suits its needs:(a) <T3>Stage 3, Planning and Preparation. </T3>During the planning and preparationstage, federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintaincapability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities inaccordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types ofproblems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along withpossible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertkento overcome identified problems.(b) <T3>Stage 2, Crisis Management. </T3>During the crisis management stage,GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light ofan actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional dataon selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. CostedOption Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the responseoption measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility.For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources maybe required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurementof essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used evenif the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparednessactions would be considered for implementation at this time.(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming,but the Costed Option Packages may also request new funding.(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency,it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items forfuture use.(c) <T3>Stage 1, National Emergency/War. </T3>During national emergency orwar, declared by the Congress or the President, mobilization of all nationalresources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilizationeffort. As military requirements increase, the national resources wouldincreasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This wouldinvolve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetimeto defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production.Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacitymay also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required formost Federal departments and agencies having national security emergencyresponsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 334.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Department and agency responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) During Stage 3, each department and agency with mobilization responsibilitieswill develop costed option packages for the actions that it considers necessaryin the early warning period. The actions would be steps that could be takento improve the nation's ability to mobilize, should a crisis worsen orhostilities occur.(b) Each department and agency should choose response options appropriateto the crisis or emergency situation. GMR plans should contain a menu ofcosted option packages that provide details of alternative measures thatmay be used in an emergency situation.(c) FEMA will provide guidance pursuant to Executive Order 12656 and willcoordinate GMR plans and option packages of DOD and the civilian departmentsand agencies to ensure consistency and to identify areas where additionalplanning or investment is needed.(d) Departments and agencies should rely on early warning information developedby the intelligence community and policy statements of the President forguiding their appropriate responses under the GMR system.(e) During Stage 2, departments and agencies will coordinate their recommendationsfor action with the National Security Council (NSC) to ensure consistencywith the overall national strategy. FEMA will assist the NSC in this coordination.(f) Plans developed by the departments and agencies under this guidancemay be shared, as appropriate, with States, local governments and the privatesector to provide a baseline for their development of supporting plans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Julius W.
