When the energy crisis of the 1970soccurred, the national laboratories and industry began to work togetheron problems related to the production of energy from oil, gas, and geothermalresources. The alliance was successful because of the complementary strengthsof its components. While the national labs offered advanced hardwareand software, large-scale testing facilities, and a multidisciplinaryapproach, industry's perspective on economics and the marketplace providedthe effort with a focus. The result was the development and commercializationof geotechnologies running the gamut from exploration and drilling toextraction and processing. This article describes some of these developments.</TEXT></DOC>
