Mubarak, chairman of the Organization of African Unity,challenged the guerrilla-backed African National Congress and therival Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa to become oneliberation organization.   ``We stand ready to bring together both organizations inconditions acceptable to their leaders,'' he told the OAU's ad hocCommittee on Southern Africa.   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidMubarak was seeking agreement on a common African policy towardSouth Africa, possibly modifying some radical demands by theliberation movements as preconditions for talks with the Pretoriagovernment.   Today's summit was scheduled to discuss proposals for a newapproach to South Africa's racial policies from the two movements,but no details of the written proposals have been released.   Seven heads of state of the 13 African leaders normallyrepresented on the committee attended the opening session in Harare.   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said the leaders of SouthAfrica's voteless black majority were ready to engage in seriousnegotiations with the white-dominated government.   But ``they and the people of free Africa must be convinced thatthe regime is serious about wanting to negotiate,'' Mugabe said.   Mugabe said mediation efforts to end conflicts in theblack-governed former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambiquehad made positive progress.   But because of ``very difficult and delicate conditions'' theseinitiatives needed more backing from the 50-member OAU and otherworld nations, the Zimbabwean leader said.   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla organizationfighting in South Africa, has in the past resisted calls for it tomerge with the Pan Africanist Congress to end long standingantagonism between the two groups.   Both groups use armed resistance against the white-ledgovernment. However, the Pan Africanist Congress favors blackself-reliance in the struggle for political rights, while the ANCsupports a multiracial approach.   Speaking for South African liberation movements, PresidentZephania Mothopeng of the Pan Africanist Congress said limiteddialogue so far between South Africa's 26 million blacks and 6million whites who hold political power led only to ``cosmetic''changes to apartheid.   ``At present, that type of negotiation is out,'' he said.   The summit also was expected to consider a proposed U.N.resolution setting a framework for a South African settlementinitiative along the lines that guided U.N.-supervised independenceelections in Namibia scheduled for November.   Some OAU leaders are opposed to that idea, believing it wouldminimize Africa's role in any settlement plan, diplomats said.   The 16-member ad hoc committee, chaired by Mubarak, comprisesAlgeria, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mali,Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the AfricanNational Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and the South-WestAfrica People's Organization of Namibia.   On Tuesday, the eight-nation special peace committee on Angolawill review efforts toward peace in that territory.   A summit of heads of five Portuguese-speaking African statesconvenes on Wednesday and the leaders of a nine-nation economicgrouping of Southern African nations meets Thursday in Harare.</TEXT></DOC>
