(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Kentucky Court of Appeals today orderedthe state Board of Claims to hold hearings on a group of claimsfiled against the state after the 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Clubfire that killed 165 people.   The board had dismissed the claims without notice in 1987, sayingit had the ``inherent'' power to do so and that it would not havebeen liable to the claimants, anyway.   But the appeals court said in a precedent-setting opinion thatthe board and similar administrative agencies, unlike courts, ``haveno `inherent' powers.''   ``The Board of Claims is entirely a creature of the legislature.... There is no explicit grant of authority (in Kentucky law) givingthe board the power to take on an adversarial role and dismissclaims'' on its own motion, the court said in a 2-1 ruling.   The board was created by the General Assembly to handle damageclaims against state agencies, which under the Kentucky Constitutioncannot be sued for negligence.   The fire on May 28, 1977, led to years of litigation againstdozens of companies that manufactured materials used in theconstruction or furnishing of the club at Southgate, just across theOhio River from Cincinnati, Ohio.   In July 1985, General Electric Co. became the last of 14defendants in a federal civil suit against aluminum wiringmanufacturers to reach settlements totaling $14 million. Settlementsby other defendants had totaled $30 million by 1984.   The appeals court upheld Campbell Circuit Court, which earlierhad consolidated the claims by the estates of seven people into asingle case and ordered it back to the board for hearing. The boardappealed that ruling.   Failure to give the claimants notice of dismissal or to allowthem to respond with legal arguments was a violation of theconstitutional guarantee of due legal process, the appellate panelsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
