The complex in an aqueous solution has an absorption maximumat about 432 nm and the coloration is stable for at least 24 hours. Thiscoloration is applied to the spectrophotometric determination of scandium.the recommended procedure ie as follows. To a dilute hydrochloric acidsolution containing up to 30 {mu}g of scandium, was added 1 ml of 20w/v% sodium acetate solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to6.0+-0.1 with dilute sodium hydroxide solution or hydrochloric acid.Five ml of 0.5 w/v% zephiramine solution and 2 ml of 0.3 w/v% HSS solutionin DMF were added to the solution. Then the mixture was diluted to 25ml with water. After standing for 30 minutes, the absorbance was measuredat 432 nm against the reagent blank. Beer's law was obeyed over the rangeof 0{similar_to}30 {mu}g/25 ml of scandium. The relative standard deviation(n=5) on the absorbance for 15 {mu}g of scandium was 0.38%. The molarabsorptivity was 2.55 x 10/sup 4/ l mol/sup -1/ cm/sup -1/ and Sandell'ssensitivity was 1.76 x 10/sup -3/ {mu}g Sc/cm/sup 2/. Aluminum (III),gallium (III) and indium (III) interfered seriously. However, scandiumcould be separated by extraction procedure with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzenefrom these interfering ions. According to this method, small amountsof scandium in synthetic samples could be successfully determined.</TEXT></DOC>
