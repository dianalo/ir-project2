The optimum blade angle of attack is justbeneath stall at the upwind side of the wind turbine, but is well beneathstall at the downwind side. The performance using the optimum pitch controllaw is compared with the performance using a pitch control law restrictedto two harmonics, but optimized within this restriction. For the tipspeed ratio, the second order harmonic pitch control is near to optimum.This is illustrated by the example of a model turbine with high solidity({sigma} = 0.30). For moderate tip speed ratio, the second order harmonicpitch control is deficient at the downwind side of the turbine. Thisis illustrated by the example of the Pinson turbine, which has a moderatesolidity ({sigma} =0.25). Finally, for the model turbine, a comparisonis made between experiments and calculations for an optimized secondorder harmonic pitch control.</TEXT></DOC>
