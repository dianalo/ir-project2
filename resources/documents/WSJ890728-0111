Hoylake Investments Ltd., the unit of Sir James' Anglo Group PLC that is bidding for B.A.T, said Hoylake and Anglo &quot;deplore&quot; the tobacco-based conglomerate's use of &quot;a detective agency.&quot; Hoylake added that Anglo Group director Lord Peter Rawlinson has resigned from the European advisory committee of New York-based Kroll.    Kroll is known in takeover battles for seeking damaging information about the business careers of its clients' adversaries. In this case, B.A.T could submit findings to insurance regulators in both the U.S. and Britain who must approve the fitness of insurance-company buyers.    B.A.T said it hired Kroll to determine the true owners of several &quot;nominee companies&quot; with interests in Hoylake. A B.A.T spokesman said Kroll's research would be limited to business-related information about Hoylake group members, and wouldn't extend to their private lives. </TEXT></DOC>
