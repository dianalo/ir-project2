The mission, made up of the foreign ministers of Ecuador,Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, also met Friday with Panama's defacto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Endara and first vice presidential candidate Ricardo AriasCalderon said the sticking point had been Noriega's refusal tonegotiate with the opposition.   Endara said he would not take power if Noriega remained ascommander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, but Noriega calledquestions about his possible retirement ``stupid.''   Earlier Friday, Noriega told reporters that the military wouldnot be drawn into negotiations and that a solution to the politicalcrisis should come from talks between the opposition andpro-government parties.   ``They both claim they won,'' Noriega told reporters.   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez said the OAS missionhad succeeded in giving Noriega and the opposition each other'spoint of view, but that a solution ``will require an enormouseffort from the Panamanian people.''   The OAS delegation seeks to end the impasse created when thegovernment nullified the May 7 presidential election.   The opposition, led by Endara, won the elections overpro-government candidate Carlos Duque by a 3-1 margin, according tointernational observers. Noriega's troops seized the vote talliesand the election was nullified three days later.   Noriega said Friday: ``The key to the problem lies with thecontending political parties. The opposition has declined to talkto Duque.   ``If the opposition remains intransigent, the Defense Forces arenot going to slip on a banana peel'' and be drawn into the dispute.``The two sides have to start talking.''   Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate with civiliansbecause the Defense Forces, which Noriega commands, hold the realpower in Panama.   ``Nothing positive can come out of a negotiation between Duqueand Endara because Duque doesn't have a single drop of power,''Endara said Friday in a telephone interview with The AssociatedPress.   ``We are willing to talk to Noriega about an institutionalsolution, but for this it is vital that Noriega retire.''   When asked to say who had won, Noriega said, ``That's up to theElectoral Tribunal,'' which nullified the vote. ``I'm just anotherPanamanian among 2,394,000.''   Endara noted that, in a resolution passed before the mission wassent, the OAS called for ``a transfer of power as soon aspossible.''   ``They didn't talk about the presidency, but about power,''Endara said. ``That power that is now in military hands.''   The OAS mission came to Noriega's offices at Fort Amador, southof Panama City, and waited 15 minutes before the general camestrolling down the street with a half-dozen staff officers,munching on a mango.   ``Panamanian mango,'' he remarked, taking a bite. ``You shouldtry it.''   Noriega's offices back onto a U.S. naval station and arecater-corner from the U.S. Southern Command's logistics andpersonnel offices.   Noriega, who also spent 2{ hours with the delegation Wednesday,said he repeated that Panama's problems were caused by the``interfering hands'' of the United States.   Since President Bush sent 1,900 more troops to augment securityat Panama Canal installations, he said, ``Panamanian troops havebeen instructed not to get trapped into a provocation. We also askPanamanian citizens not to do anything provocative.''   Noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges in theUnited States, which he describes as part of a U.S. plot to renegeon treaties that cede the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.   He said the OAS had made some proposals, but he would not revealthem.   ``There are 100,000 formulas,'' he said. When asked if he wouldstep down, he replied: ``Don't ask stupid questions.''   At Wednesday's meeting, the OAS was told Noriega's retirementwas a matter for the Defense Forces to consider, not the oppositionor the OAS.   On Friday, Noriega called the international press``disinformers'' and agents of imperialism.   ``You are the ones who have made me out to be a dictator,'' hesaid to an unruly crowd of reporters, photographers and televisioncameramen. ``You say it's a dictatorship, but right here we haveanarchy.''</TEXT></DOC>
