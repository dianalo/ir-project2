This paper addresses the solids loading problemand presents an analytical approach to the design of shale shakers, basedon a dynamic model for solids conveyance off the screen and fluid flowthrough the screen. First, the solids loading is derived as a functionof shaker geometry, solids-conveying speed, bit penetration rate, holesize, drilling fluid flow rate, particle size distribution of drilledsolids, and screen opening size. Second, the solids-conveyance modelis developed, based on the physics of the problem, accounting for theadhesive forces resulting from wet solids. The effect of various parameters,such as vibration pattern and normal acceleration on solids conveyance,is discussed. The solids-conveyance model can give the optimum set ofshaker design parameters for efficient solids conveyance off the screen.For a given shaker, the solids conveying speed predicted by the modelcan also be used to obtain the flow capacity of the shaker in the presenceof solids. Experimental and field results relevant to this study arealso discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
