<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0084 </DOCNO><TEXT>Canadian operational experience in the Arctic and Atlantic coast is reviewedfrom the viewpoint of the incidence of brittle fracture in hull plating.Against this background information, fracture concepts and testing methodologyare discussed in some detail, relating field experience to the notchtoughness characteristics of the grade of steel involved in a fractureor arrest event. It is suggested for Arctic Class vessels irrespectiveof length, and that hull strengths in areas of potential ice-damage shouldbe sufficient to resist severe denting. Quantitative proposals on designtemperatures and material selection criteria are presented as a functionof Arctic Class of vessel. 4 refs., 13 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
