Net was $12.1 million, or 37 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.    Revenue for the quarter ended July 29 increased 13% to $101.8 million from $90.4 million for the comparable 1988 period.    The company attributed the net decline to several factors, including its continuing transition to software products from certain hardware products.    For the nine months, Novell had net of $34.3 million, or $1.03 cents a share, up 20% from $28.6 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 29% to $310.8 million from $241.2 million.    By comparison, 3Com Corp., Novell's biggest rival, said last week that it expects to report a profit for its fiscal-first quarter, rather than the loss it had expected.    The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of computer-networking products estimated &quot;positive earnings per share&quot; with sales projected at $89 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31. The company attributed its turnaround to good sales last month and a good response by customers to new products.    In national over-the-counter trading, Novell closed at $26.125 a share, up $1.125. Last month, Novell had said quarter net might be below 35 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
