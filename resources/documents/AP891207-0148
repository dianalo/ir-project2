WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party got together with theopposition Thursday, after 40 years of ruling East Germany withStalinist orthodoxy, and they agreed to rewrite the constitutionand hold free elections in May.   The first talks between party and opposition delegations wereheld after publication of the new Communist program, and producedagreement to recommend that Parliament schedule elections May 6.   They also agreed on the need for a new constitution, but nodetails were released.   About 2,500 people marched to the site of the talks in aLutheran Church building and chanted, ``Free elections! Freeelections!''   Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, chief of state security, said angrycitizens had stormed secret police facilities in four cities,inflicting ``numerous slight injuries to our colleagues.''   He said the situation was at ``the threshold of escalation,''and aggressive acts against his forces could ``have unforeseeableconsequences for the country.''   The government has warned against growing violence, but fewcases have been documented. Opposition leaders in Suhl claimedpolice dispersed angry citizens with tear gas.   In an interview on state television, Communist Premier HansModrow appealed for calm while sympathizing with people angered byreports of ousted officials thwarting investigations of allegedcorruption.   Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden, representing the Communistsat the talks, joined other officials in calling on citizens to actresponsibly.   ``I understand the motivation, but such a process can get out ofcontrol,'' he said.   Berghofer expressed concern about short, politically motivatedstrikes occurring at state enterprises. The West German newspaperBild quoted him as saying there was a ``potential for violence onboth sides.''   East German news media reported riots in some prisons by inmatesdemanding amnesty.   Rudolf Seiters, chief aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of WestGermany, spoke to reporters in Bonn of ``tendencies towardincreasing aggression'' in East Germany. Hans-Jochen Vogel, leaderof the opposition Social Democrats, expressed similar concern.   In what may have been intended as a preventative measure, theEast Berlin secret police force invited activists from severalpro-democracy groups for a tour of their headquarters and talkswith security officials.   East Germany has undergone a virtual revolution in less than twomonths, ousting the old leaders, then the replacements, and openingits borders. Some former leaders have been charged with corruption.   As in the the rest of Eastern Europe at a time of rapid change,the future political course is unclear.   The Communist Party opens an emergency congress Friday to revampits structure and shed the last vestiges o Stalinism.   Markus Meckel, a spokesman for the newly formed SocialDemocratic Party, told reporters Thursday the Communists planned tochange their name to the Socialist Party, as the Hungarians did inOctober.   In its new program, published Thursday by the official newsagency ADN, the party calls for ``alternative democraticsocialism'' and accepts blame for the current political andeconomic turmoil.   It advocates closer cooperation with West Germany, but warnsagainst reunification as a threat to stability.   ``We support free and secret elections as early as possible, ata time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' the programsays, but does not suggest an election date.   All ``newly formed democratic political movements and forces''work together until the elections, the program says, in a referenceto New Forum and other opposition movements that have sprung up inrecent weeks.   Since the leadership resigned en masse on Sunday, the party hasbeen guided by a committee of 25 reformers, who devised the newprogram.   Many topics raised at the first party-opposition meetingThursday also are likely to be addressed at the Communist Partycongress.   Modrow had been expected attend the talks with 13 other partiesand social groups. His absence may indicate reluctance to take aprominent role in party affairs, since Modrow has more popularsupport than other ranking party members.   Long debates over who could take part and what would be on theagenda left little time for negotiating at the session.   Manfred Gerlach, the country's interim president, urged thegathering to propose a new voting law and suggested May or June forfree elections. Gerlach, a non-Communist who leads the LiberalDemocratic Party, was named president Wednesday to replace EgonKrenz.   Groups represented in the forum, including a half-dozenpro-reform groups that still lack official recognition, agreed inadvance that it had no power to make national policy but could makeproposals to the legislature.   Pro-democracy rallies that swelled to hundreds of thousandsafter the Oct. 7 celebration of East Germany's 40th year forcedHonecker to step down as party chief Oct. 18. He was replaced byKrenz, a long-time associate who in turn was hounded intoresignation Sunday.   Successes scored by pro-democracy activists have emboldened manycitizen organizations pressing for further change. New committeeshave been formed to make sure authorities prevent those accused ofcorruption from absconding with incriminating evidence or stateproperty.   Citizens have occupied state security facilities in at least sixcities, and authorities claimed Wednesday there were indications ofassaults being planned on military facilities.   Activists in Leipzig, Gera, Dresden, Cottbus, Suhl and Rostockhave taken over secret police facilities, angered by reports thatsome officials suspected of graft and corruption have destroyedfiles or made off with valuables.</TEXT></DOC>
