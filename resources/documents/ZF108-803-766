The July 1 revisions are the first major step by CoCom followingthe events of the last year.andP;  There's another CoCom meeting coming up inSeptember where the list may be pared to a much shorter  Core List&quot;  -totally eliminating some categories of special-purpose equipment rather thansimply lowering the hurdles - but any decisions aren't likely to be reacheduntil early next year.andP;  Much vill depend on the speed of the variouscountries' moves towards political liberation generally and implementation ofinternal export/import regulations in cooperation with CoCom specifically.andM;Yes, CoCom has reduced its grip.andP;  But don't ship anything until you'veconsulted your lawyer! Standards concern more than just operating systems andgraphical user interfaces.andP;  Take code pages (a fancy term for the part of theoperating system that implements character sets; see box), a fundamental ifpesky problem in Central Europe that has now been resolved in principlealthough it will take costly conversion and time to effect in practice.andO;Simply, each Central European country has one or more of its own standardsfor extending the Roman alphabet and representing its character set  - allthe diacritical marks in Czech and Slovak (Czechoslovakia), Slovene andCroatian (Yugoslavia), and others, the umlauts and double s in German, theslashes in Polish, and so forth.andP;  (Bulgarian, Serbian and Ukrainian useCyrillic characters, but not quite the same ones as Russian or as eachother.) All told, Central Europe uses about 80 extra characters that we lackin the US.andM;Early this summer, a number of companies led by Ashton-Tate and Microsoftheld a 25-person workshop in Budapest to resolve the issue and settled onIBM's code page 852.andP;  Co-organizer Paul Robson of Microsoft stresses that thenumber attending was limited not to keep people out but to avoid &quot;death bycommittee&quot; - or as Philippe Kahn pronounces it, &quot;death by comedy.&quot;andO;Participants included units of Aldus, HP (the printer folks), IBM, Lotus,Cherry Keyboard, MSP Ltd. and Infoservice of Poland, Novotrade of Hungary,Infosport of Bulgaria, Abakus of Czechoslovakia, Unicom of Yugoslavia, theLeningrad Institute of Informatics and JV Dialogue of Moscow (Microsoft'sSoviet distributor, although no longer exclusive).andP;  Robson is now attemptingto spread the word to vendors who weren't there.andM;Why 852? Basically, by defaultandM;When everyone was using typewriters (and not communicating much outside thehome country anyway), proliferation of code pages didn't much matter, but nowit does.andP;  The disparities hinder international correspondence, e-mail andother data transfer.andP;  So, while the installed base of each of many potentiallocal would-be &quot;standards&quot; is still relatively small, the group has startedthe move for all vendors to rally round a single standard that encompassesall the countries' characters.andP;  That means that most local vendors will haveto change to a &quot;standard&quot; almost no one is using  - IBM's 852 (also calledLatin 2).andP;  As a multi-national vendor, IBM already had a single format in usein all these countries, although it has not gained wide acceptance outsideIBM.andP;  The result is that the burden of changing is fairly evenly distributed- and even IBM doesn't get much direct benefit since it doesn't sell muchapplications software anyway.andM;The decision was fairly controversial, however, since each country has itsown favorites, and since the equivalent standard for Cyrillic, IBM 855, was anon-starter in the Soviet market; see box.andP;  Robson recalls, &quot;I went to themeeting totally opposed to 852,11 as did many of the other participants.andP;  Butafter sitting through four one-hour sessions, one to a country, everyoneconcluded that the mess was horrifying and that 852 might actually be anacceptable compromise.andP;  Not only were the solutions different from country tocountry, they were different within countries, especially in Czechoslovakiaand Yugoslavia, with their different national groups.andP;  In Yugoslavia therewas a different code page in each village,&quot; says Robson.andP;  So even though 852also lacks the same graphics characters (the corners) as 855, this is not anunnecessary drawback as it was in IBM 855, the Cyrillic code page.andM;So that's where it is now.andP;  (Either Robson, who is Eastern Europe marketingand localization manager, or Christian Wedell, Microsoft Germany generalmanager, will give a brief progress report at the East-West High-Tech Forum.)andO;The problem is that many printers don't yet support 852; they support one ofthe code pages of the many vendors described below who perform customlocalization services.andP;  Standards generally don't get set in a vacuum; theyget set by people rushing to escape from too many standards to the relativesafety of a clear move in a single direction.andP;  We're not a bunch of Westerncompanies issuing a mandate,&quot; Robson hastens to point out.andP;  No, they're asmall group settling on an arbitrary foundation so that the industry as awhole can start building a coherent superstructure of compatible applicationsfor communication across borders as well as across vendor platforms.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
