Until recently many U.S. and British investigatorsbelieved the suitcase containing the bomb was unwittinglychecked on board by a passenger named Khaled Jaafar. Mr.Jaafar, a young man living in Detroit, was returning to theU.S. on the plane after visiting relatives in Lebanon. Someinvestigators thought that Mr. Jaafar checked the bag onboard believing it contained drugs but that terrorists hadsubstituted the bomb. Mr. Jaafar died in the crash.</LP><TEXT>   In a civil hearing, John S. Mowat, a top judicial officialof the Scottish area where the Pan Am jet fell, found thatMr. Jaafar had checked two bags, but neither contained eitherthe bomb or any trace of drugs.   In his report, Mr. Mowat said British regulations hadfailed to ensure that transfer baggage was properly checkedto prevent an unaccompanied bag from getting on board. Hesaid that it would have been &quot;reasonable&quot; to require morestringent checks of transfer baggage at London's Heathrowairport, and that the airline shouldn't have relied solely onX-ray machines to check baggage.   Mr. Mowat found that the suitcase concealing the bomb,unaccompanied by any passenger, was put on a Pan Am 727 jetin Frankfurt for the Frankfurt-London leg of the flight, andthen transferred to a Pan Am 747 jumbo jet for the flight toNew York. Mr. Mowat also found that the bomb &quot;probably&quot; hadbeen sent on another carrier to Frankfurt, where it wastransferred to Pan Am. A number of investigators now believethat the unaccompanied bag was sent to Frankfurt via AirMalta, an allegation that Air Malta has denied.   The bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, onDec. 21, 1988, killed 270.</TEXT></DOC>
