The university announced a $5 million trust that will be used solely to offer salary supplements to teachers selected on the basis of merit by an independent committee of academics. The supplements, renewable on a three-year basis, could amount to as much as 50% of the professor's current annual salary. A professor earning $36,000, for example, could be given an $18,000 supplement annually for three years.    &quot;Faculty salaries nationwide are low,&quot; said William T. Young, chairman of the board of Transylvania curators. &quot;By raising the salary dramatically, we think we can bring in the best.&quot;    The program is called the Bingham Awards for Teaching Excellence and is named after Barry Bingham Sr. and his wife, Mary, former owners of the Louisville Courier-Journal and the Louisville Times. The Binghams donated $3 million to establish the trust. The additional $2 million was donated by various contributors to the program.    Recipients of the Bingham awards will be chosen by an outside selection committee of educators. This group also will review the recipient's performance at the end of the three years to determine whether the supplement should be renewed. If not, the professor would revert to the university's normal salary schedule.    Mr. Young said he expects one-third of the current teaching staff of 62 will be involved in the merit program within a few years.    John D. Maguire, president of the Claremont University Center and Graduate School, said most colleges and universities evaluate a teacher's performance by the number of articles published by the professor. &quot;Here we have a university asserting that a group of master teachers are quite capable of identifying superior teaching ability in others,&quot; he said. &quot;Any liberal arts college can make a quantum leap in quality by doing this. I don't know why no one else is doing it.&quot;    John Chandler, president of the 600-member Association of American Colleges, said that colleges, faced with a dwindling supply of teacher candidates, are scrambling for the top candidates. Messrs. Maguire and Chandler are trustees of the Bingham fund administering the award program. </TEXT></DOC>
