Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citizens here have embraced few issues like the effort to save venerable Tiger Stadium from a wrecker's ball.    Literally.    On April 20, hundreds of Detroit Tigers fans plan to give their crumbling ballpark a big hug on its 76th birthday. Beyond expending affection on an inanimate object, they hope to sway Mayor Coleman A. Young from his plans for a $200 million techno-dome, featuring luxury box seats and a retractable roof.    &quot;People love Tiger Stadium, there's true affection here,&quot; says Frank Rashid, a college English teacher who helped found the Tiger Stadium Fan Club seven months ago. &quot;Destroying the old place would ruin baseball and ruin the city's image, and anybody thinking about it will face strong opposition.&quot;    Indeed, a recent Detroit Free Press poll found 64% of Detroit-area residents would rather renovate Tiger Stadium than build something new. Radio station WCSX-FM is sponsoring a petition drive hoping to get 100,000 signatures. Meanwhile, the Tiger Stadium Fan Club says it has 2,000 supporters and about $10,000 in contributions.    Organizers know exactly how many people they will need to ring Tiger Stadium for the Great Embrace: &quot;At least 800, with 50 to 100 volunteers to coordinate everybody,&quot; Mr. Rashid says.    Once a ring has formed around the stadium 1 1/2 hours before game time, the hug will officially begin, although the group isn't requiring participants to cling to the building. &quot;We don't want people to think of this as an unnatural act,&quot; Mr. Rashid notes. A few strains of &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; and maybe &quot;Happy Birthday,&quot; and the public display of affection will end.    None of this is impressing Mayor Young. &quot;We're rebuilding a new city and there comes a time when we need a new stadium,&quot; Mr. Young insisted at a press conference. He later told reporters, &quot;It's obvious the damn thing is falling down.&quot;    Tiger Stadium lovers don't deny major renovations are needed. Tigers owner Tom Monaghan says the repair bill could hit $100 million, although critics say that estimate could be influenced by the team's desire to sell more, and higher-priced, tickets. The issue &quot;needs some solid thinking,&quot; says team President Jim Campbell, &quot;and all of the hugging and squeezing in the world won't make the place any bigger.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
