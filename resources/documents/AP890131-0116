JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   William Reilly, designated to head theEnvironmental Protection Agency, promised today aggressive andtimely enforcement of environmental laws, saying the environment canbe protected without hindering economic growth.   Reilly's nomination by President Bush as head of the federalgovernment's key environmental agency is expected to win earlySenate approval. His appearance today before the Environment andPublic Works Committee prompted bipartisan praise from members.   Sen. Quentin Burdick, R-N.D., committee chairman, called Reilly,who is president of the World Wildlife Fund, ``a person ... whoappreciates that a great nation must be a good steward of its land,its air, its water and its natural resources.''   ``I'm pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers,''said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., noting that Reilly wasintroduced to the panel by no fewer than five senators from threestates.   Reilly told the senators that while he plans to enforceenvironmental laws aggressively ``whenever it is warranted tosafeguard public health and environmental quality'' he also willseek to deal with environmental problems through consensus andcooperation.   ``We no longer have the time or luxury of allowing thebitterness, the polarization, the wasted resources and otherexcesses'' that have marked the conflicts in recent yeas betweenenvironmentalists and industry.   Reilly said he has spent his career in the environmental movement``advocating environmental protection and economic growth'' andadded that he was ``convinced we can find it.''   Reilly ticked off a list of priority issues facing the EPA suchas finding ways to come to grips with the problems of acid rain,depletion of the earth's ozone layer, global warming, oceanpollution and cleaning up toxic waste dumps.   But he said the problems posed by acid rain are ``ahead ofeverything else'' and promised early EPA action to developlegislation aimed at dealing with the issue.   ``We expect to offer a comprehensive proposal for congressionalconsideration as soon as possible'' aimed at achieving a``substantial reduction of acid rain by the end of the century,''Reilly said.   Several senators noted Reilly's desire to deal with environmentalissues through consensus and expressed concern that the approachmight lead to inaction on part of the EPA.   ``Will you conciliate, mediate, negotiate away our environmentallaws?'' asked Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who nevertheless expressedsupport for Reilly's nomination.   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged Reilly to be ``anenvironmental advocate'' in the Bush administration and allow theEPA not to be a ``reluctant combatant as it often has been'' in theReagan administration.   ``You can count on me being an advocate,'' replied Reilly.</TEXT></DOC>
