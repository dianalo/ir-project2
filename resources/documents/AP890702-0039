It was four Sundays ago that the People's Liberation Army blastedthrough hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians and flattened thetent city that had sprung up on Tiananmen, the heart of the movementfor democratic reforms.   Martial law authorities opened the Gate and two parks adjacent toit to tourists Saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the foundingof the Chinese Communist Party.   Only a few dozen soldiers with automatic rifles ringed the100-acre square Sunday afternoon. The square was scrubbed clean ofall traces of the hundreds of thousands who crossed it during thepopular uprising.   The student, one of three representatives from his school whotook part in meetings of the banned Beijing Autonomous StudentUnion, studies social sciences at a well-known college in theChinese capital. He did not want his name used.   He spent many nights in a sleeping bag and then a makeshift tenton Tiananmen after students began their occupation of it May 13.   Now he says he and fellow students are still reeling from theviolence of June 3-4. The government says up to 300 died, butChinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say up to 3,000lost their lives.   ``My classmates who took part in the movement _ writing posters,marching at school, chanting slogans _ were completely stunned bythe outcome,'' he said.   Some, he said, are quietly accepting the government line thattroops were needed to quell the ``counterrevolutionary turmoil,''because they want to join the Communist Party to further theircareers.   ``If a man and woman are equally qualified for a job, work unitswill want the man, but if the woman is a party member, they'll wanther,'' he said. ``It means the person was good in school, is in goodhealth, has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in theworld.''   The student said he had been planning to apply for partymembership this year but scrapped the idea after the crackdown.   ``I can criticize the student movement, given that the resultswere hardly what we wanted. But I can't bring myself to tramplepeople underfoot. That's what you have to do to be a party memberthese days,'' he said.   During the protests, which began in mid-April, ``I thought it wassomething we must do,'' he said. ``But the result was something thatshould never ever have happened. I haven't been able to reconcilethis with myself yet.   ``We didn't think enough. We were very optimistic. We were makingnoise, being heard, we thought we were adding a little democracy toour system. Now, people have died.''   He thinks the crackdown has beaten student voices into silence,at least for a few years.   ``The warm spirit of the students has been crushed, they have nopolitical energy,'' he said, his eyes downcast. ``If anyonecontinues this movement it will be after Deng Xiaoping dies, and itwon't be my generation of students.''</TEXT></DOC>
