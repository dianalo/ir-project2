A Wall Street Journal/NBC News telephone poll of 1,198 individuals nationwide last Thursday found that 44% supported more government regulation, 38% opposed it and 18% weren't sure. The respondents were asked: &quot;Given what you know about insider trading on Wall Street, do you think the federal government should do more to regulate the financial industry, or do you think further government regulations would hurt the stock market's ability to operate efficiently?&quot;    Among those respondents who said they'd heard or read about the insider-trading scandal, 50% supported more regulation, 41% opposed it and 9% weren't sure. But among respondents who weren't aware of the scandal -- 43% of the sample -- 36% supported more regulation, an equal number opposed it and 28% weren't sure.    On another current financial issue, 79% of the respondents favored restriction of foreigners' equity investment here and only 16% thought foreigners should be allowed to buy as much stock as they want in U.S. firms.    And, asked about a proposed federal tax on securities sales, half the respondents opposed such a measure, while 34% favored it. Among investor respondents, 66% were opposed and only 26% were in favor; among non-investors, the tally was 41% against, 39% in favor.    Chances are 19 of 20 that if all U.S. households with telephones had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the results would differ from the poll findings by no more than three percentage points in either direction. </TEXT></DOC>
