Carluccicautioned Tuesday against strict protectionist legislation to helpthe declining U.S. defense industry, saying the country can't ``goit alone'' technologically.   ``If we protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, wereduce the incentive to invest in modern facilities and advancedtechnologies, and we deprive ourselves of access to advances intechnology being achieved in foreign countries,'' Carlucci told theSenate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.   Congress is weighing renewal of the Defense Production Act, whichexpires Sept. 30. The 39-year-old act gives the federal governmentauthority to subsidize industries, including those that producegoods for the Pentagon. It also gives the president the power tolimit or prohibit the acquisition of foreign products.   In the House, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, has introduced anamendment that would limit participation of foreign comapanies indefense manufacturing and provide financial assistance tomedium-size and small defense companies.   Recent studies have shown a decline in domestic sources ofdefense production. Specifically, the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies found that from 1987 to 1982 the number ofcompanies suppling goods to the Defense Department dropped from118,000 to 38,000.   Adm. Bobby Inman, former deputy director of the CIA, told theSenate panel that immediate action is necessary because of theerosion of the defense industrial base.   ``I should have put my money into T-bills instead of defenseproduction activities,'' Inman said.   But the former CIA official said the House legislation is an``unwise approach,'' and suggested limiting the use of domestic-onlysuppliers on specific items.   Robert B. Costello, former undersecretary for defenseacquisition, told the Senate committee that since the U.S. defenseindustry uses foreign parts and technology, the Pentagon cannotarbitrarily ban the use of any foreign supplied material.   Carlucci said a move toward protectionism ``invites retaliation.It could be disastrous to our national security, if we assume we can`go it alone' technologically.''   Asked by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., if an presidential advisorycommittee was needed, Carlucci said such a panel would not solve theproblem.   ``The government should take a more active role in encouragingadoption of improved manufacturing processess throughout ourindustrial base, not just among defense contractors,'' Carlucci said.   He also suggested favorable tax policies and long-term investmentin defense programs.</TEXT></DOC>
