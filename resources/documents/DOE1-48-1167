It outlines thepotential of wind energy and how that potential varies with time andgeography. Devices for converting the kinetic energy of flowing air intomore convenient forms such as mechanical and electrical energy are describedfrom the traditional massive Dutch windmill to the modern slender windturbines that are still undergoing research and development. End usesfor converted wind energy are considered together with means of satisfyingdemand patterns using a randomly variable supply. Basic cost considerationsin adopting a wind power system are analyzed. Current Canadian wind powerresearch programs are briefly described. 12 refs., 19 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
