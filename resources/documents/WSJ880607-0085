The government crackdown in January 1987 on those rallies, which had swept across some 15 universities nationwide, ignited a severe conservative backlash against &quot;bourgeois liberalism,&quot; code for unwanted Western ideas. Since then, many students have privately expressed their discontent but have been cowed by the Communist Party's promise of stern punishment against further demonstrations.    But student leaders speaking to an emotionally charged crowd last night articulated the need for democracy, human rights and a free press and criticized the privilege and corruption of the Communist Party. The students seemed to reach a consensus that they should hold a political rally tomorrow at Tiananmen Square.    The call to protest came just three days after Beijing University students marched peacefully through the streets of the capital to protest poor security following the murder of a colleague. Since then, students have plastered hundreds of &quot;dazibao,&quot; or large-character posters, on campus walls.    The first ones euologized Chai Qingfeng, the slain student, and criticized inadequate security conditions. More-recent posters have criticized Chinese officials, including senior leader Deng Xiaoping, and called for students to take to the streets to demand democratic freedoms.    Some students said the current tense atmosphere might be the start of a new wave of political demonstrations. Others said it all might fizzle because of weak overall leadership. The march Friday was organized by the university's geophysics department, which Mr. Chai had attended. But as the protest evolves into something more overtly political, it isn't clear which individuals or groups will have the courage to lead rallies that strictly defy government bans.    &quot;Qingfeng's murder has given us an excuse to vent our true feelings,' said a 23-year-old mathematics student who has spent the past several nights talking to colleagues about how students can try to obtain political liberalization. &quot;What students really want is what we have always wanted -- democracy, free speech, improvements in education.'    Students traditionally have been at the forefront of Chinese political movements. Besides calling for political liberalization, many students today also criticize the government's policy of assigning graduates to state jobs, limits on opportunities to study overseas and the state's poor treatment of intellectuals.    Last night, the Beijing University students crushed forward to listen to speakers who ignored a handful of plain-clothes police present. Nearby, dozens of students crowded under the dim lighting of bare bulbs to read a long line of wall posters, some of which were splattered with red ink to symbolize the murder of Mr. Chai.    &quot;For too long we've been silent,&quot; said a poster in bold black characters that had been penned on a copy of the university student newspaper. &quot;Now the time has come to protest against our corrupt government.&quot;    On the outside of a cafeteria, a large poster implicitly criticized Mr. Deng for staying in power too long, thereby repeating Chairman Mao's mistake. &quot;Right ear,&quot; it said, referring to a nickname for Mr. Deng based on the Chinese character for his surname, &quot;do you really believe in this Marxism-Leninism stuff?&quot;    As the students' meeting broke up early this morning, dozens remained on the campus grounds to join in smaller, informal discussions about political issues. A definite plan of action wasn't determined, but most students said they expected to stage a sit-in demonstration at Tiananmen Square on Wednesday -- a course that many viewed as a relatively safe next step.    &quot;If we just march, we'll be stopped by the police,' said a voice from the crowd, prompting nods of agreement. &quot;We should do this gradually, first by staging a sit-in. Then, later, we can hit the streets.&quot;    Whatever the exact details, many students seemed eager to protest again, to pick up the movement where it abruptly left off in January 1987. &quot;Whoever sits on the sidelines should be subject to ridicule,&quot; said a much-read poster plastered on campus walls Sunday night. </TEXT></DOC>
