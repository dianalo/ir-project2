The attack on the army convoy Wednesday afternoon was the worstagainst an Israeli target in Lebanon since Israel withdrew most ofits occupation troops from the country three years ago.   ``I am sure that the state of Israel and its army will notremain still until we reach the source of the evil, the source ofthe attack,'' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israel radio.``What must be clear to Hezbollah is that it will receive its justpunishment.''   ``Israel's just and secure hand will reach the killers, each andevery one of them,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said.   Israel's inner cabinet, the country's top decision-making body,met today to discuss the attack, which occurred Wednesday when asuicide assassin drove a bomb-laden truck between two Israeliconvoys.   In Beirut, the military wing of Hezbollah, or The Party of God,claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had mobilized itsforces for an Israeli reprisal.   Hezbollah has been demanding action to force Israel to withdrawits troops from south Lebanon.   But Islamic Resistance, a loose coalition of pro-IranianLebanese groups, also claimed responsibility for the attack.   Israeli radio stations reported Shiite Moslems in south Lebanonfleeing to the north in fear of an Israeli attack. The reports didnot elaborate.   Despite the tensions, the ``Good Fence,'' crossing point atMetullah was re-opened this morning and Lebanese workers werepermitted to head to jobs in northern Israel's Galilee.   However, soldiers refused to let reporters through the gate toLebanon to examine the site of Wednesday's blast.   The army said the bomb exploded 300 yards north of the ``GoodFence'' border crossing at 1:25 p.m. as two groups of Israelimilitary vehicles passed each other, one headed home and the otherinto Lebanon.   ``It was a very powerful charge,'' said Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled,head of Israel's northern command.   ``There was something large, black, and black smoke came out,and many things flew in the air. Our van was burning, about toexplode,'' an unidentified injured soldier said on army radio.   An Israeli officer said a white Toyota truck, driven by an Arabexploded between the two convoys.   ``The commanders got out to talk. The Toyota came in between thetwo groups of vehicles and exploded,'' the officer said oncondition of anonymity.   Seven soldiers died and eight soldiers and two Lebanese womenwere wounded, the army said.   The blast left a 15-foot-wide crater. Witnesses said they sawpools of blood. Trees were scorched.   The body of the assassin was not found and his vehicle wasunrecognizable.   Israel television quoted army experts as saying the truckcontained up to 330 pounds of explosives. Blasts were heard fourmiles away and broke windows in this small border town.   Wounded soldiers were taken to Israeli hospitals and the armysaid one was in critical condition.   The army command identified five of the dead as Capt. RonVerner, 22; Sgt. Shalom Ben-Ami, 23; Sgt. Moris Dahan, 31; Cpl.Saguy Blau, 19, and Pvt. Yakov Ben-Shaanan, 44.   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christianmilitia, interrogated hundreds of Shiite Moslems in southernLebanon Wednesday, Israel radio said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the incident neverthelessproved the value of Israel's self-declared security zone, a buffersix to 10 miles deep in south Lebanon.   The last major car bomb attack occurred near the border crossingon March 10, 1985, shortly before most Israeli troops werewithdrawn after three years of occupation. The attack, claimed bythe pro-Syrian Lebanese Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, killed12 Israeli soldiers and wounded 14.   Israel created the ``Good Fence'' in 1976 to provide medical andother aid to refugees from Lebanon's civil war. It is used todaymostly by Lebanese workers who travel to Israel daily.</TEXT></DOC>
