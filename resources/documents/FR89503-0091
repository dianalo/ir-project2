Theestimated weighted-average dumping margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. We also determine that criticalcircumstances exist with respect to imports of certain classes or kindsof AFBs from Italy, as outlined in the Critical Circumstances section ofthis notice.We also determine that spherical plain bearings, and parts thereof, fromItaly are not being, nor are likely to be, sold in the United States atless than fair value. The Department has determined that there are no producersor exporters of spherical plain bearings in Italy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45361, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. All respondents and the petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in Italy andthe United States during November 1988 and January 1989. A public hearingwas held on February 16, 1989. Petitioner, respondents, and other interestedparties have filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. In our preliminary determinations, we indicated that we were unable toidentify any producers or exporters of spherical plain bearings from Italy.At verification, we found no evidence that spherical plain bearings werebeing manufactured or exported by any of the companies under investigationor any other company located in Italy. Therefore, we are issuing a negativedetermination for this class or kind of AFBs from Italy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); spherical roller bearings; mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings); cylindrical roller bearings,mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (cylindrical roller bearings);needle roller bearings, mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (needleroller bearings); and spherical plain bearings, mounted or unmounted, andparts thereof (including rod end bearings) (spherical plain bearings).For a complete description of these products, see Appendix A to the ``FinalDeterminations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the FederalRepublic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as Appendix A) which ispublished in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constituted five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues timely raised by partiesto the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigationsinvolving AFBs from nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addressesall general issues raised during these investigations and our treatmentof these topics. The general issues discussed therein are listed below.1. Class or Kind of Merchandise 2. Standing 3. Products Covered 4. Basis for Cost of Production Investigations 5. Market Viability 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements 7. Critical Circumstances 8. Administrative Protective Order Issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining commentsare addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1987 through March 31,1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from Italy to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the United States Price andForeign Market Value sections of this notice.For reasons discussed in the Best Information Available section of AppendixB, we have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, thatthe use of best information available is appropriate for SKF for ball bearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements: 1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent; 2. This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and 3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer. Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements Section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of FAG's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for containerization,foreign inland and ocean freight, import brokerage, import duties, marineand foreign inland insurance, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. inland insurance,in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions,where appropriate, for discounts and rebates. We made further deductionswhere appropriate, for credit, repacking in the United States, third partypayments, warranty expenses, commissions, and indirect selling expenses(including product liability premiums, inventory carrying costs, advertising,technical services, and other miscellaneous indirect selling expenses incurredin the home market and in the United States) pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act. We have excluded from our calculation of United States price sales of bearingsby FAG to the U.S. government for military/defense procurement. (<T3>See, </T3>Government Procurement section of Appendix B.) We have included sales of allegedly obsolete or discontinued AFBs in ourcalculations. (<T3>See,</T3> Miscellaneous section in Appendix B.) B. <T3>SKF: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. II. Spherical Roller Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our purchase price comparison. All of FAG's sales used in our analysis were purchase price transactions.We calculated purchase price based on delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. Wemade no deductions from purchase price because the merchandise was soldon an ex-factory basis. We added the amount of value-added taxes whichwould have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported. B. <T3>ICSA: </T3>ICSA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our ESP comparison. All of ICSA sales used in our analysis were ESP transactions. We calculatedESP based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance,ocean freight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions for discounts and rebates.We made further deductions for commissions, credit, and technical services.Pursuant to sections 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act, we also deducted indirectselling expenses (including advertising, inventory carrying costs, indirectnon-U.S. selling expenses, technical services expenses for personnel, andother miscellaneous indirect selling expenses). Based on verified information,we recalculated inventory carrying costs to account for time in Europeaninventory and time in transit. We added the amount of value-added taxeswhich would have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported.III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF reported that no products sold in the United States wereidentical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, pursuant to theAlternative Reporting Requirements described in Appendix B, we limitedour analysis to sales of those products accounting for the top 33 percent,by volume, of products sold to the United States. All of SKF's sales were purchase price transactions. We calculated purchaseprice based on packed, ex-factory prices to unrelated customers in theUnited States. We added duty drawback in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(B)of the Act. IV. Needle Roller Bearings A. <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF reported that no products sold in the United States wereidentical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, pursuant to theAlternative Reporting Requirements described in Appendix B, we limitedour analysis to sales of those products accounting for the top 33 percent,by volume, of products sold to the United States. All of SKF's sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for needleroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, duty, inland freight, marine insurance, andocean freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions for discounts and rebates. We added duty drawback, in accordancewith section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate,for credit, repacking expenses in the United States, technical serviceexpenses, warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses (including productliability premiums, inventory carrying costs, and other miscellaneous indirectselling expenses) pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act. Weadded ``other expenses'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>price corrections). <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with Section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices and constructed value (CV). The calculationof foreign market value for each class or kind of merchandise for eachrespondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG</T3>: Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Based on the petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP on the basis of FAG's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs, and general and administrative expenses. The COP datasubmitted by FAG was relied upon, except in the following instances wherethe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1) Depreciation expense recorded for machinery manufactured by the parentwas increased to reflect the fair market value of the machinery purchasedfrom the parent company because the transfer price was lower than the fairmarket value. (Only applies to ball bearings) (2) Amortization of corporate organization costs, omitted by FAG-Italy,was included in Gandamp;A expenses. (Applies to both ball and spherical rollerbearings) (3) The actual cost of parts transferred from the parent to FAG Italy wasadjusted to correct computer programming errors and an error made in calculatingcost of goods sold by the parent company. (Only applies to ball bearings)(4) Financial expenses were adjusted to reflect the net interest expenserelated to operations of the consolidated FAG Group. (Applies to both balland spherical roller bearings) (5) The transfer prices of spherical roller bearings purchased by FAG-Italyfrom its joint venture were adjusted to reflect the loss experienced bythe joint venture. (Only applies to spherical roller bearings) (6) The write-off of ball bearing inventory, included in general and administrativeexpenses, was reclassified to the cost of manufacturing because in thiscase, we could identify this write-off directly with the products underinvestigation. (Only applies to ball bearings)In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act, we used CV as the basisfor foreign market value because there were insufficient sales above theCOP. CV was calculated on the basis of FAG's materials and fabricationcosts, plus general expenses and profit. Since FAG's general expenses exceededthe statutory minimum of ten percent of materials and fabrication costs,we used FAG's general expenses. Since profit was less than the statutoryminimum of eight percent, we used the statutory minimum for profit. Imputedcredit and inventory carrying costs were included in selling expenses.Therefore, interest expense reflected in the company books was reducedfor a portion of the expense related to these costs in order to avoid doublecounting. The actual cost of producing parts transferred from the parentcompany's plant to the Umbra plant was used instead of the transfer pricereported in the submission. All of the changes made to the COP were alsomade to those cost elements in the CV. We added U.S. packing. We deductedall direct selling expenses and indirect selling expenses, up to the amountof the ESP offset. We also made an adjustment to foreign market value for revenue earned onhedging operations to account for differences between FAG's actual exchangerate return and the Federal Reserve rate employed by the Department. (<T3>See</T3>, Miscellaneous section in Appendix B.) B. <T3>SKF</T3>: <T3>See</T3>, Best Information Available section in Appendix B. II. Spherical Roller Bearings A. <T3>FAG</T3>: Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of sphericalroller bearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on the petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP for spherical roller bearings in the same way that wedid for ball bearings. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We calculated the CV forspherical roller bearings in the same way that we did for ball bearings.Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost to permit the useof these sales as the basis for determining foreign market value, we calculatedforeign market value based on packed, candamp;f or c.i.f. prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. We made deductions from the home market price,where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance, home market packing,and discounts and rebates. We made an addition for interest revenue. Weadded U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved purchase price sales, we made circumstanceof sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit and warranty expensesin accordance with 19 CFR 353.15. We made an adjustment for differences in circumstances of sale for value-addedtax paid on home market sales which was not included in the price reported.B. <T3>ICSA</T3>: We calculated foreign market value based on ESP deliveredprices to unrelated customers. We added interest revenue to each transaction.We made deductions from the home market price, where appropriate, for packing,rebates, inland freight, and insurance. We added U.S. packing to the homemarket price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price where appropriate for credit and commissions. In accordancewith 19 CFR 353.15(c), we also deducted indirect selling expenses (includingtechnical services, advertising, inventory carrying costs, and other miscellaneousindirect selling expenses). We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market prices for thevalue-added tax we computed to the United States price. Based on verified information, we modified the following expenses: inlandfreight, and insurance. (<T3>See</T3>, Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.) III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF's home market is viable for cylindrical roller bearingsbased on class or kind. However, because there were neither identical norsimilar products to serve as the basis for FMV, we based FMV on CV. (Asstated earlier, since the class or kind was viable, we did not use thirdcountry sales for FMV.) For the CV the Department relied on the informationsubmitted by the respondent except for the following changes: (1) Interestexpense was adjusted to reflect the net financial expenses related to operationsof the SKF consolidated corporation, (2) general expenses for first quarter1988 were adjusted to reflect SKF-Italy's share of actual research anddevelopment expenses incurred by a related company, (3) general expenseswere adjusted to correct an error in allocation and to include a portionof the headquarter expenses which had not been allocated to the subsidiaries,(4) general expenses were adjusted to eliminate the deduction for dutydrawbacks received since these are added to the U.S. price, (5) we usedweight-averaged U.S. selling expenses because there were no home marketselling expenses available. We added U.S. packing and, because all salesto the United States were purchase price, we made a circumstance of saleadjustment for differences in credit between the two markets. IV. Needle Roller Bearings A. <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF's home market is viable for needle roller bearings basedon class or kind. However, there were neither identical nor similar productsto serve as the basis for FMV. Consequently, we based FMV on CV. (As statedearlier, since the class or kind was viable, we did not use third countrysales for FMV.) We used the same methodology described above for SKF'ssales of cylindrical roller bearings. Because all sales to the United Stateswere ESP, we made deductions for credit, inventory carrying costs, indirectselling expenses, and product liability premiums.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Italy. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. We were unable to verify the shipment data providedby SKF. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of Appendix B.) Therefore,as best information available, we are assuming that imports of ball bearings,cylindrical and needle roller bearings from SKF have been massive overa relatively short period of time. Based on our analysis of the monthlyshipment data submitted by other Italian respondents, and the best informationavailable for SKF, we have found that imports of the following classesor kinds of merchandise from the companies listed below have been massiveover a relatively short period of time. 1. Ball Bearings_SKF 2. Spherical Roller Bearings_FAG, ICSA 3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_SKF 4. Needle Roller Bearings_SKF</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise. We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by Italian manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 735(a)(3)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy </T3>(52FR 24198, June 29, 1987). However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. <T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR12552, April 15, 1988). Since SKF and FAG sell in the United States throughrelated companies, and their margins are sufficiently high, we find thatthe requirements of section 735(a)(3)(A) are met for these companies withrespect to the classes or kinds listed below. Therefore, the followingchart sets forth our company-specific determinations with respect to theexistence of critical circumstances for each company and each class orkind of merchandise from Italy.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1>Critical circumstances</H1> Ball bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Spherical Roller Bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">FAG <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">ICSA <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Cylindrical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Needle roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Spherical plain bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">SKF <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>Except where noted, we verified the information used in making our finaldeterminations in accordance with section 776(b) of the Act.

Our verification resultsare outlined in the public versions of the verification reports which areon file in the Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments </ITAG>As noted above, all comments raised by parties to the proceedings in theantidumping duty investigations on AFBs from nine countries are discussedin Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of the subject merchandise from Italy, as defined in the``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice, that are entered, orwithdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In those situations where we have found affirmativecritical circumstances in both our preliminary determinations and finaldeterminations, the retroactive suspension of liquidation ordered in ourpreliminary determinations will remain in effect. In those situations wherewe have found affirmative critical circumstances only in these final determinations,we are instructing the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of suchentries that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after the date which is 90 days prior to the date of publicationof the notice of the preliminary determinations in these investigationsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.
