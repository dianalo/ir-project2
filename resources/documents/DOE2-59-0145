Data, characterizing effectivenessof sodium purification of /sup 22/Na, /sup 110m/Ag, /sup 60/Co, /sup124/Sb, /sup 65/Zn, /sup 134/Cs, /sup 136/Cs, /sup 137/Cs and /sup 131/Iand changing in time effectiveness of /sup 137/Cs capture by a cold trapare presented. It is shown, that effectiveness of Cs isotope captureby a cold trap is determined by content of inactive impurities (carbonand hydrogen) in sodium. That is why, cold traps are not effective topurify coolant of Cs and to prove sodium coolant normal technology. Thelaboratory and loop experiments to develop more effective purificationmethods, based on usage of zeolites, different graphite materials, zirconiumphosphate, thermally and chemically treated stainless steels, were carriedout. Conclusion is made, that the problem of coolant purification ofCs isotopes is solved in essence after the development of graphite traps.7 refs.; 10 figs.; 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
