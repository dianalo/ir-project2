We intend to continue our computer business under the NCR name and theleadership of NCR's senior management, right where it is in Dayton.andM;&quot;Second, we do not intend, in any way, that NCR's people be diverted fromdedicating all their energies and resources toward NCR's existing programsand customers.&quot;andM;Two days earlier, Exley in a letter to Allen denied that rejection of ATandamp;T'sinitial proposal was a &quot;kneejerk reaction.andM;&quot;The combination of ATandamp;T and NCR makes no sense from a business or strategicview,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;As I explained in detail to your Board of Directors, thehistory of mergers in the computer industry is a history of disasters.andM;&quot;Your clearly hostile attack, your threats, your ultimatum and publicpressure tactics can hardly be expected to create a feeling of confidence inATandamp;T on the part of NCR people.&quot;andM;On the morning of Dec. 5, Exley and the NCR board upped the ante -- claimingthey would be prepared to &quot;commence negotiations&quot; if ATandamp;T offered to pay notless than $125 (U.S.) a share.andP;  The response came in the form of Allen'sletter in which he said he did &quot;not understand how you can maintain -- as youdid at our meeting this afternoon -- that a merger at $125 in ATandamp;T stockwould work, continue NCR's success and be a good deal for your shareholders,but a merger at $90 would be a strategic disaster.andM;&quot;Chuck, all we have is a difference of opinion on price,&quot; Allen said.andP;  &quot;Weshould let your shareholders decide.&quot;andM;If ATandamp;T is successful it will give the company what Brad Casemore, an analystwith Evans Research Corp. in Willowdale, Ont., described as &quot;a hardwarebeachhead&quot; for its System V Unix operating system.andM;&quot;ATandamp;T has wanted a competitive hardware systems vendor for a long time,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;Of the major companies out there right now, NCR is probably the bestsuited for acquisition.&quot;andM;Casemore added that while &quot;it's hard to tell how much animosity there is atthis point, ATandamp;T does not want to inherit an &quot;unhappy company.andM;&quot;Nobody knows how they would react or how far down this bitterness goes,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;Does it go all the way down through the product manager or stop atthe executive suite?andP;  It's hard to say.&quot;andM;Marcel Carrier, president of NCR Canada Ltd. in Toronto, described reactionto date from his employees and customer base as &quot;neutral.andM;&quot;If it (the takeover) is done on a friendly basis, then it could be morepositive than negative,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;If it (becomes) very unfriendly it will be too bad because we may lose somegood players along the way.&quot;andM;With revenues of $6.1 billion in fiscal 1989, NCR employs 61,000 peopleworldwide.andP;  Evans Research estimates NCR Canada had revenues of $288 millionin 1989, placing it seventh on its list of the top 100 computer companies inCanada.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
