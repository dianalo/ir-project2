(AP) -- More than 600 state employees were toput in their last day of work yesterday as the Cuomoadministration went ahead with layoff plans to help eliminatean estimated $1 billion deficit in the state's $50 billionbudget.   Included among the 619 employees to be fired were about300 prison guards and 300 other prison workers.</LP><TEXT>   James Flateau, Gov. Mario Cuomo's spokesman on criminaljustice issues, said yesterday that no problems had beenreported at the prisons because of layoffs.   On Christmas Eve, the leadership of Council 82, the prisonguards' union, met with Corrections Commissioner ThomasCoughlin to discuss the layoffs amid speculation that guardswere considering a strike or some other protest.   Union President Thomas Kennedy said no strike had beencalled.   While he was reluctant to talk about union sentimentregarding some form of protest to the guard layoffs and othercost-cutting actions, he warned that anxiety among guards wasrunning high. He called for intervention by Mr. Cuomo.   &quot;The last time we saw this type of dissatisfaction. . . .,there was a strike in 1979,&quot; Mr. Kennedy said.   At that time, then-Gov. Hugh Carey called the NationalGuard to run the prisons during a 16-day strike by prisonguards upset over negotiations for a new contract.   &quot;We've done everything possible to avert these layoffs,but nobody is listening at the (state) Capitol,&quot; Mr. Kennedysaid after the Monday meeting.   Mr. Flateau said yesterday that Mr. Cuomo has beeninvolved in layoff discussions. &quot;It's disingenuous to say thegovernor has not been involved,&quot; Mr. Flateau said.   Other state workers putting in their last day yesterdayincluded 12 employees at the state Division of Parole andseven Commission on Correction employees.   In all, 2,000 state workers are to be laid off by the endof the fiscal year on March 31. Mr. Cuomo has promised toeliminate 4,000 additional jobs through attrition and earlyretirement incentives. Next year, the governor has said, hemay have to eliminate 12,000 more jobs.   The state has more than 200,000 employees.   Twenty-three more layoffs will take effect Jan. 2. Thosecuts are at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, theDivision of Military and Naval Affairs and the Department ofState, said a spokeswoman for the Governor's Office ofEmployee Relations.</TEXT></DOC>
