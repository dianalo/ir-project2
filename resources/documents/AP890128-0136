Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov discussed Moscow'swithdrawal plans with President Najib and other Afghan officials onFriday and Saturday in Kabul, the official Soviet news agency Tassreported.   Under a United Nations accord, the Soviets have until Feb. 15 toend their nine-year intervention in Afghanistan, but diplomats whorequested anonymity told The Associated Press the withdrawal shouldbe completed within a week.   Iran, which serves as a refuge for more than 1 million Afghans,said its embassy will remain open, and workers on Saturday erectedhalf-inch-thick steel plates around the embassy's eight-foot walls.   Other Moslem and Middle Eastern countries began planning forincreased security around their embassies in the besieged capital.   ``This is not just a concern of the Western nations,'' said oneMoslem diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We couldcount on the Soviets for security. Now we have to figure out what wewill do when they've gone.''   The Soviets have said they intend to keep their mission open, butMoscow's East bloc allies were considering closing. Mostnon-communist nations have ordered their diplomats to leaveAfghanistan by Saturday.   West Germany closed its mission a week ago, the first nation todo so. The United States announced Thursday that it would withdrawits diplomats, and Britain, Japan, France and Austria followed suit.   At a news conference in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,Burhanuddin Rabbani, chief of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group,accused the Soviets of sending warplanes into Afghanistan to bombvillages.   ``The bombing has been very severe for the last three days,leaving hundreds of casualties, and destroying dozens of villages,''he said.   Rabbani appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Peres deCuellar to stop the destruction.   Villages along the strategic 260-mile Salang Highway, which leadsto Kabul from the Soviet border, were among the targets, Rabbanisaid. The road is the main land route for the Red Army's withdrawal.   Western diplomats reported Thursday that Soviets and the eliteAfghan Special Guard bombed and shelled villages on the northern andsouthern ends of Salang Highway on Monday.   They quoted eyewitnesses as saying that hundreds of civilianswere killed in those attacks. The area is dominated by guerrillacommander Ahmad Shah Masood, who belongs to Rabbani's group.   The guerrillas, backed by the United States and Pakistan, havebeen fighting the Afghan government since a Marxist coup in 1978.They are not a party to the U.N. agreement and are expected to closein on Najib's government once the Soviet withdrawal is complete.   For their part, the guerrillas have continued to rocket Kabul andother major cities. They fired four rockets into the capitalSaturday, said a U.N. official who requested anonymity. He said noone was killed in the shelling.   The government's troops fired eight missiles into hillssurrounding the city. There were no reports of casualties.   Two Soviet military transport planes carrying about 60 passengerseach flew out of Kabul on Saturday. Helicopter gunships escorted theaircraft over the snow-covered hills and the planes dropped acascade of flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired bythe guerrillas.   Other Soviet transport planes airlifted emergency food and fuelto the embattled city.   Convoys tailed by tanks hauled flour to silos and fuel togasoline stations, where lines as long as a half-mile began formingbefore dawn.   Shortages have eased since the Soviet airlift began last week,but many Afghans, some wearing only light cotton clothing andsandals, waited for hours in freezing weather for bread andgasoline. Many went home without either.  </TEXT></DOC>
