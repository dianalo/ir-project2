The company said the investor group proposes to acquire the company by converting each of Beaman's outstanding shares of common stock into a right to receive $7 a share. A special committee of the company's board recommended the extension; it didn't say why it was needed.    The company said it has been advised by the investor group that it received preliminary financing to complete the transaction, which is also contingent upon &quot;satisfactory&quot; results from Beaman's third quarter operations. A special shareholders meeting to consider the buy-out is scheduled Jan. 30, and Dec. 16 has been set as the record date for shareholders allowed to vote at the meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
