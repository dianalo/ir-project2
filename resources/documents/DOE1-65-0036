The technology is viewed as beingtoo expensive, complex, and unreliable. However, solar greenhouse researchsponsored by Agriculture Canada has produced promising results. Successfulsolar greenhouse studies have been done at the Research and Plant QuarantineStation in Saancichton, British Columbia. Three different solar greenhouseshave been constructed. The first is a glass-covered conventional even-spangable greenhouse. It has an earth thermal storage (ETS) heating systemand is equipped with thermal screens. The second is a shed-type structure.It is one half of a conventional prefabricated glass-on-galvanized steelgreenhouse with the north roof eliminated and the north wall insulated.This greenhouse is equipped with an internal solar collector and a rockstorage heating system as well as thermal screens. The third greenhouseis a prefabricated polyethylene quonset house, heated exclusively byan ETS solar heating system. This publication is intended to supply commercialgrowers with some basic information on solar heating. It examines someof the different methods of storing exess solar energy and provides guidelineson the design, cost effectiveness, and reliability of solar greenhousesthat are either new structures or retrofitted conventional ones. Theguidelines are based solely on findings obtained from the experimentsconducted at Saanchiton. The information will help the grower to decidewhether or not to seriously consider installing solar systems. 30 refs.,23 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
