If they have old refrigerators lying around, there's Wisconsin Electric to pay $50 apiece for them. Same with air conditioners and freezers. The company will even pick up the appliances and cart them to the dump.    Appearances aside, the utility isn't going into the junk business. It simply figures there are big savings in getting customers to scrap their old, inefficient machines and buy new, more efficient ones. The strategy ultimately reduces demand for electricity and helps Wisconsin Electric postpone construction of expensive new plants. In fact, the utility now figures that a $3 billion plant it had planned to build won't be needed until after the year 2000.    Wisconsin Electric's tactics are aggressive and innovative -- and a sign of the times. Utilities, factory managers and building owners throughout the U.S. lately have been slashing electricity consumption using a range of new strategies. The trend has become so widespread, says John C. Sawhill, former federal energy administrator, that it constitutes a &quot;quiet revolution&quot; in energy conservation.    By some estimates, the first oil shock of 1973 sparked efficiency programs that have saved the U.S. more than $100 billion. But now the focus has shifted to electricity from oil, and forecasters say new conservation campaigns could translate into savings of up to another $100 billion before the end of the century. Potential gains for the economy are obvious: the less cash needed to power U.S. industry, the more that is available to modernize plants and increase productivity.    &quot;Efficiency is the subject today,&quot; says Stanton Unger, a marketing manager for Cleveland-based Reliance Electric Co. He says sales of high-efficiency motors now account for 33% of Reliance's industrial motor sales, up from 15% just two years ago. And Reliance expects demand for the motors to grow further.    Energy Research Group Inc., a Waltham, Mass., consulting firm, estimates that new, more efficient industrial motors, home appliances and commercial lighting equipment now under development or just coming onto the market will require an average of 10% to 20% less electricity than earlier models. The gains could quickly add up. A utility research group, Applied Economic Research Co., estimates that heightened energy efficiency will cut additional U.S. power needs by 20,000 megawatts between now and the year 2000. That's about 12% of total projected additional demand.    Better efficiency means that America's total electricity bill for the final eight years of this century will be between $40 billion and $76 billion less than it might have been, the group says. About $60 billion to $80 billion would have been needed to finance construction of the plants to generate the extra power that efficiency is expected to save.    In past years, utilities didn't worry about building new plants. Once the construction was complete, regulators just dumped the costs into the rate base and let customers pick up the tab. The utility sat back and happily issued dividend checks. But regulators aren't as predictable as they once were and now are often holding utilities responsible for cost overruns and other construction problems. In addition, many utilities have discovered other, more lucrative ways to invest their money, such as real-estate development. The upshot is that utilities are suddenly embracing conservation with new, if belated, vigor.    Clearly, though, while big energy savings appear to be in the offing, nobody is running to the bank -- at least not yet. For one thing, most homeowners are notoriously slow to recognize the incremental savings available in things such as more efficient light bulbs and appliances. Instead, they are still blissfully wasting enormous amounts of electricity, the experts say. Also, though there may be a couple of exceptions, electricity bills will still be going up, only nowhere near as fast as they might have without the big, new energy-efficiency campaigns.    Some of the new campaigns employ old, mainstay conservation techniques: better insulation, more efficient light bulbs, greater use of daylight. But technological developments are also helping cut power bills.    Consider, for example, electric motors, which account for about half of U.S. power consumption. When Chevron Corp. expanded its Richmond, Calif., refinery in 1984, it installed motors using fatter, lower-resistance copper wire coils. The cores of the motor windings were made of silicon alloy steel formulated to conserve electricity. Today, the annual power bill for the refinery's extension is $630,000, or 3%, less than if standard motors had been used.    &quot;Every dollar saved (by using high-efficiency motors) goes straight to the bottom line,&quot; says Paul S. Hamer, an electrical engineer for Chevron.    Gus S. Nicholas, general manager for engineering at H.J. Heinz Co. in Pittsburgh, hopes for even better results. He recently told several Heinz plant managers to switch to high-efficiency motors when old ones, which have efficiency ratings of only 60% to 70%, need replacing. He figures that his savings on electricity will pay for the added cost of the new motors within about three years.    Lighting is the second-largest draw on electricity, after motors, and therefore a big target of corporate cost-cutters. Today, lighting accounts for 20% of America's power consumption and 40% of the electricity used by the nation's 600,000 commercial buildings. First National Bank of Atlanta tackled its high lighting bills first by determining that its offices were overlighted, a frequent problem in buildings today. It yanked out light fixtures where they weren't needed and reduced wattage elsewhere. That action, along with installing heating thermostat controls, cut electricity consumption by 10% at all of its 40-plus branch offices within four years.    Nonetheless, executives of First National worried that a new 15% rise in local electricity rates would eat up its hard-earned energy savings. So the bank launched a new offensive in &quot;life-costing.&quot; Henceforth, First National, in determining the cost of everything from new compressors to new calculators, will factor in the amount of electricity each item will consume over its life. The bank then will buy the brand with the lowest total price.    Owners of many existing buildings often find themselves restricted to small improvements in energy efficiency, such as lighting changes. But managers of the 2,000 or so commercial buildings currently under construction have more latitude to capitalize on big improvements in conservation technology.    In the basement of Alabama Power Co.'s new headquarters in Birmingham, for example, stands a glass-enclosed water tank as big as a basketball court. Four giant compressors hum nearby. Inside the tank, murky blue-green water bubbles up around ice-covered rods. This $4 million &quot;ice storage&quot; machine saves the utility $90,000 a year by making ice at night -- when bulk power already contracted for would otherwise go unused. Air is then blown over the ice during the day to cool the building.    At nearby Cooper Green Hospital, an innovative conservation strategy borrowed from European industry is at work. Perennially in the red, Cooper Green didn't have a nickel to spend this year on energy efficiency. So, under a &quot;shared savings&quot; program, Cooper Green teamed up with Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc., which agreed to install $500,000 of high-tech, energy-conservation equipment at the hospital free of charge. In return, Cooper Green agreed to give Johnson Controls 75% of resulting cost savings over a five-year period. Cooper Green keeps the other 25% for itself and, after five years, gets 100% of the savings and the equipment as well. Johnson Controls figures it will recover what it put into the venture and then some.    Factories, too, are using more technology in their energy campaigns. Near each of several Du Pont Co. chemical plants around the country is a small, windowless concrete building. Inside, computers save energy by rapidly choosing among several machines powered by oil, gas, coal and electricity to handle various tasks in the plant. The computers calculate which machine is cheapest to activate by assessing a host of variables, including production levels and the time of day.    Then, employees use computer consoles on the factory floor to monitor machinery speed, efficiency and energy consumption. Byron R. Brown, Du Pont's energy-department manager, says the computer systems have shaved up to 15% off the plants' utility bills, a third of that in electricity savings. &quot;We've generally had a better return on this than on trying to penetrate new markets,&quot; he says.    Energy-efficiency improvements also will appear soon in the home as a result of the National Energy Conservation Act, which will require all electrical appliances to meet national minimum efficiency standards. Passed by Congress earlier this year -- with a strong push from the utility industry -- the act seeks to increase appliance efficiency up to 25% by 1992 from current levels. That's likely to mean substantial savings for homeowners. Currently, for example, it costs on average about $300 a year to run a central air conditioner and about $120 a year to run a refrigerator. Michael McCabe, an efficiency expert with the federal Energy Department, says central air conditioners may improve more than 25% in efficiency as a result of the act, refrigerators about 20%.    A hidden plus in the act is, in effect, the elimination of the &quot;contractor's special,&quot; those cheap, invariably inefficient appliances preferred by some developers and landlords. More than one out of five appliances is bought by a developer or a landlord.    Energy efficiency is getting a boost also from a nationwide, home-remodeling craze. The National Association of the Remodeling Industry says roughly 10% of single-family home kitchens in the U.S. have been remodeled in the past three years. And although remodelers often aren't overtly looking for efficiency, they get it anyway when they buy top-of-the-line appliances, home-remodeling firms say.    Betty Martin, for example, recently remodeled the kitchen of her apartment on Park Avenue in New York. Her electricity bill dropped to $47 a month from $68 a month as a result. &quot;I never believed that anything decreased,&quot; she says. &quot;I was shocked.&quot; Yet Ms. Martin didn't sacrifice convenience. Her new refrigerator is twice the size of the 15-year-old one she replaced and features a new automatic icemaker. She also added a microwave oven.    Utilities, meanwhile, are increasingly dangling incentives in front of homeowners, hoping that they will hop on the conservation bandwagon. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in Chicago says 36 utilities this year offered cash awards to customers who bought new, more efficient air conditioners, up from 25 two years ago. Twenty utilities offered awards for new refrigerators, up from nine.    &quot;It's well worth the money,&quot; says Chris Joannides, energy-conservation manager for Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co., based in Newark, N.J. The utility this year sent out rebates totaling more than $4 million, mostly to 36,000 air-conditioner buyers. &quot;We're trying to keep peak load down,&quot; Mr. Joannides says.    No major utility has an efficiency program like Wisconsin Electric's, however. Not only does the utility pay $50 to retire inefficient appliances, but also it gives awards of $40 to $70 for buying new models. It even sells energy-saving fluorescent light bulbs at about one-seventh the price of some stores. The utility has earmarked $84 million for its incentive program and expects to get back twice that much in cost savings over the next 10 years.    &quot;Nobody loses, everybody wins -- everybody saves money,&quot; reasons Fred Trebatoski, the vice president for division operations.    Although utilities such as Wisconsin Electric expect a 10% to 20% gain in electrical efficiency in the near-term, the painful slap of another energy crisis could raise that figure to an extraordinary 50%, some experts say. Given the right motivation, savings could be even higher, other industry analysts believe. Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, for one, says that, at least theoretically, 80% or more of the electricity America now uses could be saved through new conservation strategies and efficiency-enhancing technology.    ---                    Efficiency boost    Typical yearly appliance operating costs.
