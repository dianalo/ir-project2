Lindley Johnson, a program director, said 80 percent to 85percent of the planned experiments for the set of five scientific instrumentsstill could be achieved even if the recorders cannot be fixed.;    &quot;The taperecorders only record data from our secondary experiments,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Itis a little disappointing to our secondary experimenters, but as far asoverall success . . . we're still quite happy with the data that it looks likewe're getting.&quot;;    Four attempts to get the tape recorders working failedSunday night, NASA said. Engineers continued working on the problem today asthe astronauts proceeded as planned with experiments involving the unaffectedinstruments.;    The trouble began hours after Discovery thundered into orbitearly Sunday on an eight-day mission devoted mostly to tests aimed at helpingPentagon scientists develop sensors for tracking and destroying missiles.;   Johnson said both recorders turned on and worked as planned for four hours,then mysteriously failed. He said engineers have traced the problem to therecorders and not related equipment.;    The first exercise canceled, onSunday, was an observation of the Crab nebula, a huge gas cloud in space. Fiveobservations set for today also were called off, said Air Force Capt. MartyHauser. He said officials were unsure whether the sightings would berescheduled for later in the flight.;    Program managers will makeobservations with the three affected instruments later in the mission asplanned regardless of whether the recorders are fixed, Johnson said. The datawill be transmitted instantly from a computer monitor in the flight deck toground controllers when possible, but some of the data will be lost, he said.;   &quot;We're still trouble-shooting. We haven't given up hope on them yet,&quot;flight director Rob Kelso said early today. Engineers are &quot;still in the backscratching their heads.&quot;;    Flight director Ron Dittemore said the recorderswere to be used to gather data from three of five scientific instruments inone of the main payloads.;    All the devices are designed to study naturalphenomena such as atmospheric lights, or aurora, that could mask a missile'spath.;    No problems were reported with the other main cargo, a spacecraftthat will be released in orbit to study the shuttle's exhaust plumes andchemical and gas clouds that can be used to camouflage missiles.;    Theflight is the first non-secret shuttle mission for the Pentagon.;    Commandedby Navy Capt. Michael Coats, the astronauts are splitting 12-hour shifts toget as much work done as possible. The other crew members are L. BlaineHammond Jr., Donald McMonagle, Gregory Harbaugh, Guion Bluford Jr., RichardHieb and Charles Lacy Veach.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Space Center, Houston  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910429  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  505  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 29, 199100120147,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
