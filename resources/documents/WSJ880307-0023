Doe Run is a joint venture of Homestake Mining Co. and St. Joe Minerals Co.; St. Joe is a unit of Fluor Corp.    Doe Run also agreed to give back pay and benefits to certain contract workers who the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said were overexposed to lead and replaced by new workers. Doe Run agreed to the settlement without admitting the OSHA charges.    OSHA last month proposed penalties totaling $2.8 million against Doe Run, alleging 313 violations at the smelter, including 283 willful violations.    In a statement, Doe Run said the reduced payment in the settlement &quot;supports our position that we were not and do not deliberately jeopardize the health or safety of our employees.&quot; It also said that &quot;we commend OSHA for its spirit or cooperation in working out our differences.&quot;    Doe Run said it had agreed to keep more detailed records, improve its communication with the government, and accelerate engineering programs to protect workers from lead exposure.    In San Francisco, a Homestake spokesman declined to comment on the matter, saying &quot;the settlement speaks for itself.&quot;    Separately, OSHA said it has asked the Justice Department to consider bringing criminal charges against Texstar Construction Corp., San Antonio, Texas, an important subcontractor for a Bridgeport, Conn., apartment complex that collapsed last April. The collapse of the twin-tower L'Ambience Plaza project killed 28 workers and injured 10 others, and was the worst construction accident this decade.    OSHA last October proposed a record $5.1 million in civil penalties against five companies engaged in building the complex, including $2.5 million against Texstar, a construction firm that used a technique for lifting entire concrete floor slabs for the Bridgeport project. OSHA said that heavy concrete floor slabs were lifted without adequate bracing, lifting jacks weren't secured and two support columns were removed from the original building design, which may have increased stress on the lifting system.    OSHA said an employer convicted of a criminal charge of willfully violating a workplace safety standard, when the violation causes a worker's death, can be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to six months.    Chris Geckler, vice president of Texstar, vigorously challenged OSHA's assertions. &quot;The conclusions they came up with are not consistent and are inaccurate,&quot; he said. Mr. Geckler said that a report on the accident prepared for OSHA was &quot;inconclusive.&quot;    In addition, Mr. Geckler said, preparers of the report insufficiently inspected data on the accident. &quot;They manipulated numbers to come to their conclusions,&quot; he said, in order to attract publicity ahead of Senate hearings later this month. </TEXT></DOC>
