A lone survivor of the attack, a young man, returned from arefugee camp in Malaysia to identify the four, said Lt. Col. PrakobBanjapong, deputy police superintendant in the southern coastal townof Songkhla.   Charges against the four include murder, robbery, attemptedmurder and attempted rape in the April 16 attack. They face thedeath penalty or life imprisonment if convicted.   In a telephone interview, Prakob said police on Thursday arrestedtwo fishermen, aged 40 and 20, from one of the two boats involved inthe South China Sea slayings. Police found nails on the boat in thearea of the boat's name, indicating the fishermen had tried to coverup the name, he said.   Those two suspects led police to two other men, aged 29 and 22,who were arrested Saturday, Prakob said. Nails also were founddriven into their boat.   He said the four admit they killed the Vietnamese with pistols,knives and hammers.   Refugee relief officials said the pirates intercepted theVietnamese vessel off the Malaysian coast.   They looted the boat, locked up the refugees below and set thevessel on fire, the officials said.   Some refugees managed to jump out, but were shot by the pirates.The 22-year-old man who survived was rescued by another Vietnameseboat, they said.   Pirate attacks against Vietnamese boat people have becomeincreasingly violent.   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, piratesattacked 38 boats since April 30. They killed 11 Vietnamese and left372 others missing, raped 116 and abducted 70.   Prakob said Thai police this year have arrested four othersuspected pirates who await trial for robbery and rape.   The threat of pirates, prison-like refugee camps and days at seawithout food and water have not discouraged the exodus ofVietnamese. More than 1.5 million have fled their homeland since1975.   Nations overwhelmed by an unrelenting flow that has increased byup to 300 percent this year have become less hospitable. They saythe boat people now are fleeing economic hardship, not politicalpersecution, and are calling for forced repatriation.   But, at an international conference in Geneva earlier this month,Vietnam repeated that it will not accept those forced to return.   The meeting ended inconclusively with a plan to screen newarrivals and encourage voluntary returns. If that did not work,alternatives would have to be examined, delegates said.</TEXT></DOC>
