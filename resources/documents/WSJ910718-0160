Dr. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National CancerInstitute here, said in an interview that the plannedexperiment &quot;is the flip side of what we've done in the past.&quot;Before, his team has altered the body's own tumor-fightingwhite blood cells to turn them into stronger anti-cancerweapons. Now, he is proposing to alter the tumor cell itself,so that it prods the body to produce more-potentcancer-killing cells.</LP><TEXT>   Dr. Rosenberg said the proposed test was approved by thehead of the clinical center of the National Institutes ofHealth, NCI's parent agency, but still faces review on July30 by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory comittee, whichreviews all so-called gene-splicing experiments. The testmust also be given a green light by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration.   Dr. Rosenberg's announcement broadens the focus of cancergene-therapy from his old target, the human blood cell, tothe cancer cell itself. As previously reported, his broadplan could embrace everything from tinkering with cancercells to marshal a stronger immune defense, to the creationof a new class of cancer &quot;vaccines&quot; employing specific tumorantigens or proteins.   Under the proposed experiment, Dr. Rosenberg said thefirst phase of this new initiative will involve a sort ofbiological &quot;one-two punch,&quot; first taking tumor cells from apatient, and splicing into them the gene for a knowncancer-fighting protein such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) ortumor-necrosis factor.   Armed with the new gene, those tumor cells would bereinjected into the patient, whose immune system Dr.Rosenberg hopes will respond more vigorously. After threeweeks, he would remove a portion of the patient's lymph-node,harvest its cancer-fighting cells, grow them, and reinfusethem as the second-phase of the therapy.   While Dr. Rosenberg has recently concentrated hisgene-therapy work on malignant melanoma, a skin cancer, hesaid the new experiment might involve any number of tumortypes including colon cancer.   There is no guarantee that such an approach will helppatients, however. In a lecture to young researchers, Dr.Rosenberg stressed the extremely experimental nature of hiswork. All patients considered as volunteers must have failedto respond to conventional treatment.   However, he noted that a handful of complete remissions,obtained in patients previously deemed terminal, gives himhope his treatments should be pursued and refined for broaderuse someday.</TEXT></DOC>
