Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1; Exemption</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I</ITAG>Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia, and City of Dalton, Georgia, (the licensee) are theholders of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-57 and NPF-5, which authorizeoperation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. The licensesprovide, among other things, that they are subject to all rules, regulations,and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.The facility consists of two boiling water reactors at the licensee's sitelocated in Appling County, Georgia.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>On August 5, 1987, the NRC published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a final rule amending 10 CFR 50.54(w). The ruleincreased the amount of on-site property damage insurance required to becarried by NRC's power reactor licensees. The rule also required theselicensees to obtain by October 4, 1988 insurance policies that prioritizedinsurance proceeds for stabilization and decontamination after an accidentand provided for payment of proceeds to an independent trustee who woulddisburse funds for decontamination and cleanup before any other purpose.Subsequent to publication of the rule, the NRC has been informed by insurerswho offer nuclear property insurance that, despite a good faith effortto obtain trustees required by the rule, the decontamination priority andtrusteeship provisions will not be able to be incorporated into policiesby the time required in the rule. In response to these comments and relatedpetitions for rulemaking, the Commission has proposed a revision of 10CFR 50.54(w)(5)(i) extending the implementation schedule for 18 months(53 FR 36338, September 19, 1988). However, since this rulemaking actionwas not completed by October 4, 1988, the Commission is issuing a temporaryexemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.54(w)(5)(i) until completionof the pending rulemaking extending the implementation date specified in10 CFR 50.54(w)(5)(i), but not later than April 1, 1989. Upon completionof such rulemaking, the licensee shall comply with the provisions of suchrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission may, upon application by any interested person or uponits own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulationsof (10 CFR Part 50), which are * * * Authorized by law, will not presentan undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent withthe common defense and security.</ITAG>Further, andSection;50.12(a)(2) provides <T3>inter alia:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission will not consider granting an exemption unless specialcircumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever ** * (v) The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicableregulation and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply withthe regulation.</ITAG>Despite a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of the rule,insurers providing property damage insurance for nuclear power facilitiesand licensees insured by such insurers have not been able to comply withthe regulation and the exemption provides only temporary relief from theapplicable regulation.As noted by the Commission in the Supplementary Information accompanyingthe proposed rule, there are several reasons for concluding that delayingfor a reasonable time the implementation of the stabilization and decontaminationpriority and trusteeship provisions of andSection;50.54(w) will not adverselyaffect protection of public health and safety. First, during the periodof delay, the licensee will still be required to carry $1.06 billion insurance.This is a substantial amount of coverage that provides a significant financialcushion to licensees to decontaminate and clean up after an accident evenwithout the prioritization and trusteeship provisions. Second, nearly 75%of the required coverage is already prioritized under the decontaminationliability and excess property insurance language of the Nuclear ElectricInsurance Limited-II policies. Finally, there is only an extremely smallprobability of a serious accident occurring during the exemption period.Even if a serious accident giving rise to substantial insurance claimswere to occur, NRC would be able to take appropriate enforcement actionto assure adequate cleanup to protect public health and safety and theenvironment.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a),that (1) a temporary exemption as described in Section III. is authorizedby law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety,and is consistent with the common defense and security and (2) in thiscase, special circumstances are present as described in Section III. Therefore,the Commission hereby grants the following exemption:<ITAG tagnum="21">Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia, and City of Dalton, Georgia are exempt from the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.54(w)(5)(i) until the completion of the pending rulemakingextending the implementation date specified in 10 CFR 50.54(w)(5)(i), butnot later than April 1, 1989. Upon completion of such rulemaking the licenseeshall comply with the provisions of such rule.</ITAG>Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the grantingof this exemption will not result in any significant environmental impact(53 FR 39548).<ITAG tagnum="21">This exemption is effective upon issuance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 7th day of October 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven A.
