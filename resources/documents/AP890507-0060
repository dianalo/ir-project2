The squabbling has interfered with her push to implement apopulist socio-economic program focused on local projects toimprove health, education and public works.   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was sworn in as prime minister Dec. 2 to becomethe first woman leader in the modern Moslem world. Her PakistanPeople's Party was popularly elected Nov. 16 in Pakistan's firstfree election in more than a decade.   She rode a wave of sympathy for her father, Prime MinisterZulfikar Ali Bhutto, deposed by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in 1977and later executed on charges of conspiracy to murder a politicalopponent. Zia died in a plane crash in August 1988.   Ms. Bhutto's opponents have done a great deal to curb thesympathy wave since her election.   She ranks a close second in popularity, after bipartisanPresident Ghulam Ishaq Khan, according to a recent Gallup Pollconducted among Pakistan's urban dwellers.   Nevertheless, Ms. Bhutto's nemesis is her opponents in theprovincial governments, who either are challenging her leadershipor deserting coalitions headed by her party, which she describes asa social democratic party.   The Pakistan People's Party, aided by smaller parties andindependents, still controls the powerful National Assembly, orlower house of parliament, but the provincial skirmishes alreadyhave limited her political and economic options.   In Punjab, the biggest and richest province and home to 56percent of the population, Ms. Bhutto mounted two major asssaultsby moving a vote of no confidence against right-wing Chief MinisterNawaz Sharif in the provincial legislative assembly. Both attemptsfell short of a majority.   Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League is the linchpin of thenationwide, eight-party Islamic Democratic Alliance.   ``Bhutto wants to do away with all of her opponents in order tocreate one-party rule in Pakistan,'' charged Sharif.   In volatile Sindh, the southern province the Bhuttos call home,Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah of the Pakistan Peoples Partycommands 84 of 114 votes in the legislative assembly.   But after months of squabbling, a 28-member group called MohajirQaumi Movement consisting of Moslem immigrants from India pulledout of the coalition May 1.   ``Shah failed to protect the lives of immigrant students and(mohajir) population, which is facing violence by the localpopulation in numerous cities,'' said Azim Tariq, chief of theMoslem party.   Newspaper reports say that mohajirs, fearing violence fromnative Sindhis, are deserting their villages and towns andmigrating to major cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad.   The powerful and vocal mohajir movement can cause Ms. Bhutto'sparty plenty of trouble.   She is upset by recurrent violence in Sindh.   ``There is a mini-insurgency,'' she said in a recent speech. Itis like ``a crushed egg, which needs delicate handling to bring itinto its original shape.''   Ethnic riots involving the mohajirs and other groups have leftnearly 700 dead since 1985.   Ms. Bhutto's provincial coalition Cabinet in North West FrontierProvince along the Afghanistan border collapsed on April 27 whenthe pro-Soviet Awami (People's) National Party pulled out.   Leaders of that party said she reneged on a promise to give themthe provincial governorship in exchange for their role as acoalition partner.   ``Bhutto failed to keep each one of her promises,'' said NasimWali Khan, a veteran women's leader of the party.   Ms. Bhutto's provincial Chief Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao stillhas support of 37 legislators _ the largest single bloc _ in ahouse of 86 after the 14-member Awami National Party quit. However,opponents in Ms. Bhutto's party warn that the future loyalties of10 of Sherpao's supporters can waver.   The southwestern province of Baluchistan, also borderingAfghanistan, is in the hands of another group of Bhutto opponents,led by Nawab Akbar Bugti. Bugti is the provincial chief ministerand leader of the Baluchistan National Alliance.   He is supported by the Islamic Democratic Alliance in additionto the right-wing Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam (Islamic Scholars Party).The groups are peeved at Ms. Bhutto's refusal to give Baluchistan alarger share of federal tax revenues and royalties on oil andnatural gas produced in the province.   Pakistan is facing a 12 percent annual inflation rate, comparedto 5 percent last year. The prices of some essential goods havegone up 18 percent.   A wage hike will push prices up further and enlarge the current$2.75 billion federal budget deficit. It equals about 6.7 percentof Pakistan's gross domestic product.   The next national budget, due June 1, may fuel more inflation asindependent economists fear more taxes across the board.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Mohammed Aftab has worked for The AssociatedPress in Pakistan for 32 years.</TEXT></DOC>
