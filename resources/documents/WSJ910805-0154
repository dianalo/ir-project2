The deposits are held by Chinese financial and tradingagencies, primarily at Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce Hong KongLtd., which was closed by the colony's regulators on July 8,according to Chinese banking sources. Some of the depositsalso were placed with BCCI's branch in Shenzhen, a Chineseeconomic zone adjacent to Hong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   According to the Beijing-controlled daily Wen Wei Pao inHong Kong, depositors at the Shenzhen branch, which Chineseauthorities have closed, include some of China's biggestbanks -- Agricultural Bank and Industrial andamp; Commercial Bankamong them. All told, Chinese banking sources estimate, 10%to 20% of BCC Hong Kong's $1.4 billion in frozen depositsbelong to China.   The disclosure that China's central bank entrusted largeamounts of its reserves to BCCI is embarrassing to Beijing.Chinese sources say that the incident exposes financialofficials' ignorance of the hazards of international banking.But they also say that some Chinese officials who worked withBCCI were showered with lavish gifts by the bank'sexecutives.   &quot;They couldn't resist the temptation&quot; of the gifts, says asenior Chinese banker. &quot;There were many warning signals aboutBCCI, but some Chinese officials simply ignored or overlookedthem.&quot;   BCCI was highly successful in cultivating its relationshipwith Beijing, as in other parts of the world. Agha HasanAbedi, the group's ailing Pakistani founder, who stepped downin 1988, played the right ideological tune by promoting BCCIas a Third World bank and a bridge in the Sino-Pakistanirelationship.   In the early 1980s, Mr. Abedi hired a former Pakistaniambassador to China to lift the bank's profile among Chineseofficials. The strategy appeared to pay off when BCCI wasawarded a license to open a representative office in Beijingin 1983. The former diplomat became the bank's first formalrepresentative in the country.   According to a Chinese banker, there was initialresistance from banking authorities to giving BCCI thelicense. &quot;But political pressure coming from outside thebanking system prevailed,&quot; says the banker, who declined tobe more specific. &quot;China was newly opened to the West, andits officials weren't savvy enough to determine which bankwas financially sound.&quot;   In 1985, BCCI was among the first foreign banks to beawarded a license to operate a branch in Shenzhen. Insubsequent years, BCCI's Shenzhen branch was grantedpermission to engage in a variety of businesses, includingforeign-exchange transactions.   BCCI executives also came to be known for their lavishstyle of doing business in China. When the bank opened itsrepresentative office in Beijing, Mr. Abedi and a team ofsenior bank officials arrived in a private jet, according toChinese bankers. BCCI also treated groups of bankingofficials from across China to trips to Europe and month-longtraining seminars in Hong Kong.   In the colony, BCC Hong Kong was among the most aggressivebanks in courting the business of Chinese trading companies.One of the unit's 26 branches is located in the ChinaResources Building, which houses many mainland agencies.Because of its small deposit base, BCC Hong Kong focused ontrade financing rather than term loans, according to a formerBCC Hong Kong official.   This official adds that BCC Hong Kong's list of Chineseclients grew rapidly in part because the bank charged ratesfor its services that undercut most competitors. In addition,the bank was known among Chinese companies for its speed andflexibility. In issuing letters of credit involving huge sumsof money, &quot;we were able to cut through layers of bankingofficials to deliver the document in a matter of hours, butthe same process might take up to three days in some otherbanks,&quot; says the former BCC Hong Kong executive.</TEXT></DOC>
