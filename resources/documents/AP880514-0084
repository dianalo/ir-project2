Bennett told The Associated Press that such an effort may beyears away, ``but after watching some of the people in the stakesfor the presidency, I could do that well.''   ``I won't mention anybody in particular,'' the outspokeneducator said, but he added that he was referring to bothRepublican and Democratic hopefuls.   Bennett, who announced last Monday he is quitting the Cabinet inmid-September to write and lecture, brought up the White Househimself when asked in an interview if he aspired to run for theSenate.   Bennett said he has had overtures about possible Senate racesfrom his native state of New York, his adopted state of NorthCarolina and from Maryland, where he now lives.   But he said neither the Senate, nor the possibility of a collegepresidency, holds any interest for him.   ``Right now, if I were going to run for anything in the future,I'd want to run for president,'' he volunteered.   Asked about the vice presidency, Bennett said, ``I'm not sureI'd make a very good No. 2 man. I like to run things.''   Vice President George Bush, who has already locked up the GOPnomination, says he wants to be ``the education president.'' Hiscampaign has kept its distance from the controversial Bennett, whohas warred with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents.   Bennett did not mention Bush by name, but said, ``We'll probablyhave a good Republican president in '88 who'll be there for acouple of terms. If I do this, this could be way in the future.''   A lifelong Democrat, Bennett switched to the GOP in May 1986, 15months after President Reagan put him in the Cabinet. He has provena big draw at Republican functions across the country.   Asked if he was now wedded to the GOP, the 44-year-old Bennettreplied, ``Probably.''   Only probably?   ``Well, sure. Look, I was a Democrat. I shifted to theRepublican Party because the Democrats left the ranch and desertedtheir principles. I don't see that happening in the RepublicanParty. But I put country above party, always have,'' he said.   ``This will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics,but we were not political. We were principled and a lot of ourprinciples ... went to the heart of what Ronald Reagan stands forand what a lot of liberal Democrats stand against,'' he said.   ``I know that I'm popular with audiences out there in thecountry, and it doesn't seem to make much difference whetherthey're Democrats or Republicans,'' he said.   He said his relations with the education establishment may be attheir worst, but ``I would bet my relations with the Americanpeople are at an all-time high.''   Bennett expressed no regrets about his penchant forcontroversies.   He said he ``probably drove some people crazy'' by speaking outat Cabinet meetings on issues other than education.   He said he decided from the start that ``I may never have a joblike this again, so I'm going to do it all the way.''   Sometimes, ``people rolled their eyes and said, `There he goesagain,''' he related. ``I talked about drugs a lot, use of themilitary, and Justice Ginsburg, AIDS and Nicaragua, but I decided Iwasn't going to leave this job and say, `Darn it! I should havesaid this! Boy if I had it to do all over again!'''   Bennett took it upon himself to call Douglas Ginsburg last Nov.6 to urge him to withdraw as a Supreme Court nominee afterGinsburg's admission that he smoked marijuana while a Harvard lawprofessor. Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration the nextday.   Bennett said he has not considered making such a call to hismentor, Edwin Meese III, the embattled attorney general.   ``No I have not. It's an entirely different situation. ... Whatyou have in the case of Ed (is) lots of allegations, no evidence,''Bennett said.   Asked if he were comfortable with an attorney general underconstant investigation, Bennett replied: ``It would be nicer, itwould be better if business were smoother. But no one feels moreuncomfortable than Ed about getting all this. But that's not asituation I'm going to enter into.''   Asked about the setbacks Reagan has suffered of late, Bennettsaid there have been ``a lot of fly bites, people nipping at him.''   But ``with time, the little things will slip away and the largeimpact will be clear. ... '' he said. ``This is a very great manand a good and important presidency.''</TEXT></DOC>
