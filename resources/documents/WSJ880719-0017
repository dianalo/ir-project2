When everything is dandy in the junk-bond market, bondholders pay little attention to key covenants in company financing documents. In bankers' jargon, the provisions talk about things like conservation of cash flows for interest and debt payments. But markets have grown more volatile. And unsecured lenders have been burned lately by covenants written in recent years that allow borrowers to run down cash or keep piling on debt. Recently, E-II Holdings bonds dived, spurring outcries and litigation, when the company passed to less conservative hands. Earlier this year, Colt Industries bonds sold off sharply on news that the company would raise more debt to go private.    So junk buyers have been flexing their muscles, with some result. American Standard's recent offering has unusually tight covenants addressing overleveraging. UAL Corp. bonds offer a protection from unfavorable mergers that is becoming more common. Issues due this week by SSC Holdings, formerly Stop andamp; Shop, and Viacom International offer a new protection against market risk. To fly, a $2.5 billion bond issue planned by the New York investor Carl Icahn for a takeover fund might need special inducements, investors say.    While there is still excess money chasing junk bonds, &quot;the pendulum might be swinging&quot; more in favor of lenders, says Richard Swingle, a T. Rowe Price Associates money manager who recently formed an association to protect bondholders. Without concessions to lenders, some recent megaborrowers &quot;couldn't have done the size&quot; they wanted, says Gerald Unterman of Solomon Asset Management. For some less credit-worthy issuers, he adds, &quot;it was a question of getting a deal done at all.&quot;    One recent example of the new provisions was the American Standard issue of $1.1 billion of lower-rated bonds through First Boston for a leveraged buy-out. The covenants restrict sale of assets that produce earnings needed for debt service, while limiting additional borrowings to $250 million. Even after paying some senior loans, the company can't leverage up again but must keep reducing debt over time. Thus, if all goes well for American Standard and markets hold up, analysts say, its credit-worthiness and bond prices should improve.    Colt's covenants, which are more typical, let it &quot;releverage&quot; after reducing debt. Colt was taken private last month by management and Morgan Stanley, completing a stock buy-back. The bonds recently have recovered from their sell-off, Mr. Unterman says, because investors &quot;discovered&quot; other covenants that appear to limit debt to amounts that can be serviced by cash flow. But bondholders rightly worry about releveraging that can set them back in the payment queue, says Kelly Dunne, head of First Boston Asset Management's junk-bond investments.    Raiders who might add debt are another nightmare. A $500 million financing in June by First Boston and others for UAL's United Airlines addresses that concern. If the company changes control and its credit rating slips, investors can sell, or &quot;put,&quot; bonds back to the company at 101% of par value. The company has been -- and might again be -- a raider's target. But with puts, a new owner &quot;couldn't just layer on extra debt,&quot; Ms. Dunne says; &quot;he would have to buy in some existing debt first.&quot;    Of course, a company's stockholders might suffer if puts deter would-be acquirers who don't want to retire debt. And some issuers, like Drexel Burnham client SSC, have the right, not the obligation, to call bonds in the event of a merger -- whether investors like it or not. But a Drexel corporate finance specialist says the SSC bonds, &quot;like all our deals,&quot; have covenants that would protect bondholders from an unfavorable acquisition.    Yet E-II, designed by Drexel as a takeover vehicle, doesn't appear to have protected bondholders. The bonds have dropped about 25% since American Brands last month sold E-II to Meshulam Riklis, an apostle of corporate leverage. Some people say covenants governing use of E-II's assets also are weak, permitting Mr. Riklis to remove $925 million of cash. But wounded E-II holders -- and some investment bankers -- claim Mr. Riklis and American Brands ignored restrictive covenants. Mr. Icahn, meanwhile, plans a similar takeover vehicle.    Some Drexel financings protect bondholders from loss of value if the market goes to hell in a handbasket. Viacom's $300 million issue will include $150 million of &quot;reset&quot; notes. In such cases, the coupon will be adjusted, or reset, after a year or two to restore the bonds' value. SSC also will issue resettable notes, as did Sunshine Mining last week.    Investors pay for these bells and whistles. Solomon Asset Management's Mr. Unterman figures Viacom's resettable debt might yield about 0.5% less than its regular bonds of similar seniority, while put options might cut yields 0.25% to 0.5%. But it is worth forfeiting income if the features lessen unexpected losses of principal, he thinks.    Meanwhile, many junk bonds still are being sold with too few restrictive covenants, or with covenants that have big loopholes, says Ed McClendon, a junk-bond specialist at Dean Witter. That won't change until overall profits from junk bonds -- which have been good in 1988 -- shrink or disappear, says T. Rowe Price's Mr. Swingle. &quot;You need a dull market,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
