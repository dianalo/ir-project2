His 40 workers are stretched to the limit, and he has tried without success to get extra help. He has advertised in newspapers, bought time on radio, even put up posters. But with the local economy booming in every sector, he is just one employer among thousands begging for workers. Hong Kong's June unemployment was 1.8% of the labor force, the lowest since the government began to collect such figures in 1975.    &quot;My banker tells me that he is in the same fix,&quot; Mr. Wong says. &quot;I have never experienced anything like this.&quot;    Lifted by an unexpected export surge, Hong Kong is headed for its most prosperous period since 1981. The financial-services and real-estate sectors already benefit from an expected influx of foreign money. But defying most forecasts, export-oriented industries -- the territory's biggest employer -- also are doing well. The result is a full-fledged boom that has increased strains on the economy.    In the plastics industry, soaring demand has created a speculative market in raw materials. Traffic through Hong Kong's container port is racing ahead of projections. In the central business district, offices that stood vacant not long ago are commanding premium rents.    The Hong Kong government now estimates that the colony's gross domestic product, which measures the total value of its goods and services, minus foreign income, will grow 12% this year, up from an earlier official forecast of 6.2%. Last year's 11% growth, well above the 1980s average of 6.9%, came after a flat 1985 and hadn't been expected to last.    The last such boom, between 1979 and 1981, sent property and share prices to dizzying heights. But the global recession that struck in 1982, coupled with investor worries about 1997, when China regains sovereignty over this British colony, turned the boom into bust. Though much improved, global business conditions and local investor confidence remain fragile. As the territory's economy heats up once more, concern is growing that Hong Kong may be flirting with another fall.    &quot;People learn from experience,&quot; says Vincent Cheng, chief economist of Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. &quot;The trouble is, they soon forget.&quot;    Many countries would like to have Hong Kong's worries. The fastest-growing economies among the industrialized nations are crawling along at about a 3% annual expansion. In the Asia-Pacific region, only three economies are expected to achieve double-digit growth this year. And two of them may soon slow: South Korea, because of labor strife, and Taiwan, because of the rising value of its currency. Indeed, a good chunk of Hong Kong's export orders have been switched from Taiwan because Taiwan's rising currency makes its goods more expensive.    Economists credit much of Hong Kong's good fortunes to its exchange-rate link with the U.S. dollar. The link has helped boost the colony's exports, and Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs, in his midyear economic review yesterday, said there weren't any plans to sever it.    The local economy was stagnant two years ago. Exports were shrinking, and the property and stock markets were at a standstill. With people nervous over the 1997 issue, capital was fleeing the territory. But as its currency began sinking with the U.S. dollar in late 1985, Hong Kong became a paradise for foreigners buying its stocks, real estate and manufactured goods.    In the stock market, the early bargain hunters were mostly investment-fund managers from the U.S., Europe and Japan. Flush with profits from markets elsewhere, many bought into the territory's underperforming stock exchange. Local investors, smarting from the market's 1982-84 crash, sat on the fence at first but joined the stampede as foreign demand drove up prices. The result: a bull run.    The Hang Seng index closed yesterday at 3,667.95, up 17.99 on the day and a sixfold increase since it bottomed in 1984. During the previous boom, it peaked on July 17, 1981, at 1,810.20, about half its current level.    Stephen Fung, managing director of New Century Securities Holdings Ltd., a local brokerage, says he has doubled his staff to 40 from last year and still can't keep up. He often works until 5 a.m. to clear the previous day's paperwork.    Property prices, though also buoyant, haven't returned to the peak levels of 1981. That slower pace of recovery is generally seen as a sign that investors, wary of the 1997 transition, continue to shy away from fixed assets. But even that caution is ebbing as local businessmen, flush with profits from share trading and exports, begin looking for alternative investments.    Prosperity also has spilled into the retail sector. Retail-sales volume in the second quarter, historically a slow season, rose 10% from a year earlier.    But as the economy gathers steam, the retailers also are beginning to feel the negative effects of rising rents and accelerating inflation. The government forecasts that its leading consumer-price index will rise 6% this year, faster than 1986's 2.8% growth.    Much of the heat from the booming economy has been absorbed by the export sector. The government yesterday raised its forecast for 1987 export growth to 27% from its February forecast of 11%.    Some local manufacturers have avoided the tight labor market by contracting work to factories in China. Manufacturers also are urging the government to ease immigration rules so they can import workers from neighboring countries. And many companies are improving equipment. The government predicts spending for plant and machinery will grow 25% this year, up from 9.8% last year.    That makes some economists nervous. &quot;What would we do with the extra workers and the extra facilities if exports stop growing next year?&quot; asks Hongkong Bank's Mr. Cheng. &quot;Ultimately, all of Hong Kong will have to pay the price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
