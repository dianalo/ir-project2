(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State Ken Hechler, alifelong bachelor, remembers the most successful love letter heever wrote. Only it was for someone else.   It was during World War II, and one of Hechler's army buddieswas about to lose his girlfriend to another suitor. Sensing thatHechler had a way with words, the soldier hired him _ for $1 _ towrite a letter to win her back.   ``I really poured out my heart,'' Hechler recalled last week.``I wrote the most persuasive love letter I could dream up. I had alot of Shakespeare and Browning and other literary allusions init.''   The soldier, more than satisified with the results, copied it inhis own hand and sent it off to his straying girlfriend.   ``About 10 days later he came up to me very distraught andwaving the letter from the girl and he said, `What am I going to donow? She says she's coming down and wants to get married thisweekend!''   But Hechler had a response to that, too.   ``The dollar just covered the letter, not the consequences,''Hechler said he told his friend.</TEXT><DATELINE>KINGSPORT, Tenn.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Love may be blind, but it need not beunenlightened, according to a new book being published onValentine's Day.   In ``The Psychology of Love,'' 22 psychologists write onsubjects such as styles of love, ways to maintain relationships,the components of love and possible evolutionary origins of lovebehavior.   ``It's not as if there is any one right kind (of love),'' thebook's co-editor, Robert J. Sternberg, a Yale professor ofpsychology, said. ``It's more that you sort of find something thatis right for you.''   Sternberg said the book may help a reader figure out what isright in love for him or her; its contributors are regarded asstrong researchers and theorists, he said.   Sternberg said he and co-editor Michael L. Barnes, a Yalegraduate student of psychology, wanted the book to be of scholarlyinterest, although lay readers may find some chapters easy tocomprehend.</TEXT></DOC>
