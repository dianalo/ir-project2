Early today, a National Guard helicopter rigged to tow the185-ton ``hover-barge'' resumed the 230-mile trip along thedesolate Arctic coast from Prudhoe Bay. It moved about five milesWednesday through sand bars, mud and shallow water.   The 24- to 30-foot-long California gray whales, whose species isendangered, became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migratingsouth.   Eskimo whalers using chain saws in sub-zero temperatures havebeen cutting holes in the thick Arctic Ocean ice to help themammals breathe. They got a boost Wednesday when twobrothers-in-law from Minnesota brought six $400 de-icers to the$500,000 rescue effort.   Greg Ferrian and Rick Skluzacek, of Lakeland, flew to Alaska attheir own expense to demonstrate the devices, invented bySkluzacek's father, when rescue coordinators politely refused theiroffer to help.   Early today, under the skeptical supervision of thecoordinators, they quickly cleared ice and slush from the twobreathing holes, accomplishing in hours what had been taking therescue team, using chain saws, pickaxes and steel bars, a day to do.   The cylindrical de-icer, about 9 inches around and 14 incheslong, floats in the water suspended beneath a styrofoam slab. Asmall, double-blade propeller pulls warmer water up from below andemits it with 34 pounds of thrust.   Within 24 hours, the breathing holes should be about 30 feet by70 feet _ three to four times the original size, Skluzacek said.   The devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becomingfrozen in the winter, Ferrian said.   The tired whales can survive for several more weeks despitebeing battered and bleeding from grating against jagged ice, saidJohn Lien, professor of animal behavior at Memorial University inCanada.   ``They can bleed a barrel and still be fine,'' said Lien, whohas helped free whales from ice for 20 years. ``We're talking abouta big animal here, between five to 20 tons.''   The whales also may have to contend with polar bears. Reportersflying by helicopter Wednesday spotted five prowling the ice a fewmiles from the whales.   ``There are polar bears that are certainly going to be attractedto this,'' said Ron Morris of the National Marine FisheriesService. ``If they're going to take the whales, we're not going tostop them.''   He said polar bears hunt at night, when biologists are usuallythe only people near the breathing holes, 18 miles northeast ofthis Eskimo village.   The whales were named by biologists so the mammals' respirationcould be monitored when they surfaced. One was dubbed ``Bone''because so much of its snout has been scraped away by the ice.Eskimos have given them their own names: Siku (Ice), Putu (Icehole)and Kanik (Snowflake).   A National Weather Service ice analysis showed no open water inthe whales' vicinity. But a lead, or pathway, through the ice hadbeen spotted about five miles from the whales, said Jim Brooks,acting director of the fisheries service in Alaska.   ``There are open water leads throughout the Chukchi Sea andBeaufort Sea, out for a long ways. The ice is always moving. It'svery dynamic,'' he said.   Brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach openwater, about 200 miles southwest, even if they could get to theleads.   ``But the hope is that they will be able to make it through theleads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in theirmigration. But the gray whale is not an ice-adapted animal. It justdoesn't seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as otherspecies of whale,'' he said.   Rescuers sought ways to coax the animals in the direction ofopen water if icebreaking efforts were successful, including usinglights as a lure near two new breathing holes cut for them. But themammals have shown little interest.   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry said tape recordings ofthe sounds of other gray whales were being shipped to Barrow to tryto lure the animals to open water. If they don't respond to that,biologists said, they have tapes of killer whales that might spurthe three young whales to escape.   The barge was not expected to reach Barrow at least until middayFriday, officials said.   ``We're pretty optimistic,'' said Pete Leathard, president ofVeco Inc., the oil service company that owns the propulsionless aircushion vehicle. ``It looks like it will be moving a little fasternow that it's cleared most of the mud and sandbars in the harbor.''   Another National Guard Skycrane helicopter assigned to thetowing mission may be used instead to lift a huge reinforcedconcrete cylinder to Barrow where it will be dropped to smash holesthrough the ice. The slabs are leftover supports from constructionof the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, fitted so they can be carried byhelicopters.   ``That's going to Plan B,'' said Sheryl Deveau, a spokeswomanfor the guard. ``We have a 9,000- and a 14,000-pound concretereinforced slab. ... They'll start dropping that from the Barrowend.''</TEXT></DOC>
