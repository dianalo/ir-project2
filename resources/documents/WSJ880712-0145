Fine Homes said it earned 70 cents a limited partnership unit in the quarter ended June 24. The publicly traded limited partnership said results can't be compared with the previous year because last year it was still a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. In its first quarter, Fine Homes earned 12 cents a unit.    Earnings were $20.7 million on revenue of $215.1 million. For the first half, earnings were $24.3 million, or 82 cents a unit, on revenue of $380.7 million.    Fine Homes also said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Merrill Lynch to extend its use of the Merrill Lynch name beyond 1990, when it originally was scheduled to relinquish use of the name. Now the firm expects to keep using the Merrill Lynch name until Merrill no longer owns a controlling interest.    Larry J. Biederman, chairman and chief executive officer of Fine Homes said in an interview that Fine Homes and Merrill Lynch have revised their original plans for Merrill to reduce its 75% stake to less than 50% by 1990.    &quot;Merrill Lynch will be the majority owner for a longer period of time,&quot; Mr. Biederman said, mainly in response to current stock-market conditions.    &quot;The Merrill Lynch name is extremely important to us,&quot; Mr. Biederman said. &quot;The reality of that is better known to us today than a year ago.&quot;    Mr. Biederman said the board of Fine Homes has made no decision regarding reinstatement of the 11.5-cent cash distribution on its subordinated partnership units held by Merrill Lynch. The distribution on the subordinated units was suspended in last year's fourth quarter. &quot;We could've met the subordinated distribution, but it was Merrill Lynch's opinion that the cash should be reinvested to grow the business,&quot; Mr. Biederman said.    He said the reinvested distributions would be used to make acquisitions of real estate brokers and other businesses. &quot;It's time to grow the business,&quot; he said. &quot;We aren't a truly national company. We believe that we should become a national company not only from a geographical sense but from a product standpoint.&quot;    Possible new businesses include property and casualty insurance as well as expansion of its title company in Minnesota.    Mr. Biederman said Fine Homes has no intention of re-entering the mortgage business. Last year, Fine Homes took a $12 million restructuring charge for dropping out of the mortgage banking business. Fine Homes has since signed an agreement with GMAC Mortgage Corp., a General Motors Co. affiliate, for those services.    The average sale price of residences handled by Fine Homes rose 10% to $160,000 in the second quarter from $145,000 in the year-ago quarter.    Total units sold by Fine Homes in the second quarter dropped 7% to 38,600 from 41,500. For this year's first half, 73,300 units were sold, 2% ahead of last year's 72,200 for the comparable period. Home sales in the second quarter totaled a record $6.3 billion.    (Revised WSJ July 14, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
