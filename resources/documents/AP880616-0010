(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sitting in his tiny store-front officejust down the street from the sprawling grounds of Heritage USA,Jim Bakker predicted he would soon regain control of the PTLMinistry.   ``God doesn't take you halfway and dump you,'' said Bakker, whoresigned from the television ministry last year in the wake of asex scandal and is under investigation by a federal grand jury.``I've been building this place for 15 years. I'm staying until Iget it back.''   Even the ever-optimistic Bakker admitted it will be an uphillclimb for him and his wife, Tammy Faye, to get back PTL. Theyintend to present a reorganization plan for the Christian retreatin U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia, S.C., before June 29.   ``We are also placing an advertisement in a local newspaperasking all former employees who are interested in being a part ofthe Jim and Tammy ministry to come to the office and fill out aform,'' he said Wednesday. ``These are not job applications; it'sjust a survey to see how many are interested.''   Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds has already told PTL officialsto sell land, buildings and other assets to raise enough money tosettle claims against the ministry that could reach $130 million.   Last month, PTL officials worked out a deal with businessmanGeorge Shinn calling for Shinn to buy all or most of PTL's propertyat Heritage USA and lease parts of the ministry to a new church.   Shinn, who owns Charlotte's new National Basketball Associationfranchise and a minor league baseball team, has declined to say howmuch he will offer for the complex. Estimates have ranged from $75million to $100 million.   M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the court-appointed trustee at PTL, hassaid there are several other offers and vowed to treat any proposalfrom Bakker fairly.   ``I'm more convinced at this moment that we will be back atHeritage USA than at any time in nearly a year and a half,'' saidBakker, adding that he hopes to buy some television time to promotehis plan.   Bakker returned to South Carolina in early June and opened anoffice in a shopping mall next door to the headquarters of the``Bring Back Bakkers'' club.   ``I've yet to meet a negative person,'' Bakker said in aninterview Monday in his office decorated with photographs of himand Tammy. ``We came here psychologically prepared for battle. Butpeople have been coming up to us in the restaurants and on thestreet to give us their support.''   Since his return, Bakker said, a car dealer gave him a new carand other offers have been made.   ``They told me they only have one question, `What can we do toget Jim and Tammy back?' '' he said. ``Never before have I had suchan outward expression of support from local business people.''   Not all business owners share that sentiment.   ``There's still too much of a bad taste in people's mouths,''said Sharon Haney, who owns a small leather shop across the streetfrom Heritage USA.   Several blocks away, Marge Wilson, who operates a craft shop,said, ``I don't think Jim can make it work. So many people are sodisgusted. I'm the first to forgive, but ...''   At Heritage USA, the impact of the Bakkers' departure isapparent. The water slide is closed. Shuttle buses that transportvisitors to the various attractions are nearly empty. Main Street,a collection of shops and restaurants, looks like a ghost town.   The park's nearly 1,500 employees of a year ago have been cut bynearly two-thirds, to just over 500.   ``The mood around here used to be a three-ring circus. Now it'slike a cemetery,'' said Barbara Crisp, who has been coming toHeritage USA from Lenoir, N.C., with her husband for six years.   Still, she doesn't know if she wants the Bakkers back.   ``Everyone is deserving of a second chance, but they have tocome back truly repentant,'' she said. ``The thing that disturbs meis when Tammy said, `What did we do wrong?' That boggles my mind.What about the credit cards and selling Heritage three times over?''   The Bakkers also have their fervent supporters.   ``No one can run this place like Jim,'' said Loretta Graves, ofCharlotte, who stopped by during a break from job hunting. ``If Godcan forgive him, I can.''   Bakker declined to give details of his reorganization plan, andhe won't identify any financial backers.   ``We'll present a conservative plan without any pie-in-the-skydeals,'' he said. ``It's built on our track record of the past. Iplan to restore it to where I left it and go beyond.   ``I think we can help people because of what we've beenthrough,'' Bakker said. ``They want to know, `Does the Bible reallywork?' We've been through one of the most devastating times of justabout any public figures in history.''</TEXT></DOC>
