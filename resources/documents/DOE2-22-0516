We believe that the example of N = O self-dual Yang-Mills equationscan serve as an instructive introduction to the subject of harmonic superspaceand this is examined. The rigid N = 2 conformal supersymmetry and itslocal version, i.e. N = 2 conformal supergravity is also discussed. Thepaper is a contribution to the book commemorating the sixtieth birthdayof E.S. Fradkin.</TEXT></DOC>
