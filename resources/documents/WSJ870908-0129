The move to allow these riskier bonds to back high-rated offerings is enthusiastically welcomed by issuers and investment bankers, who say it will expand their financing flexibility. But the change is viewed skeptically by some investors and has sparked a furious debate over whether the agencies' new standards should apply to the collateral backing securities that have already been issued.    At the center of the storm is Moody's Investors Service Inc., which expects to approve its new criteria today and which was bombarded last week with arguments from both sides. &quot;It's touchy,&quot; concedes Douglas Watson, the vice president responsible for the criteria. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., Moody's chief rival, expects to announce its criteria later this month.    The issue is coming to a head quickly. The first junk-bond-backed triple-A issue, a $100 million offering by Imperial Savings Association of San Diego, is expected to come to market this month. Investment bankers and rating agency officials say more will follow soon. &quot;The economics are certainly there,&quot; says one rating agency official. &quot;This could mushroom.&quot;    Collateralized securities, issued primarily by financial institutions, are backed by a pool of assets whose cash flow covers the interest and principal payments due on the securities. Investors rely on the collateral, not the issuer's credit, for assurance of repayment. The bulk of collateralized securities are backed by mortgages, most frequently those guaranteed by the three federally supported housing agencies, but issuers are increasingly using new types of assets such as car loans and credit card receivables.    The $150 billion junk bond market presents a huge new pool of potential collateral, suggesting the rating agencies' move could speed the growth of an already booming market. Because junk bond yields run two to five percentage points above those on triple-A securities, the idea is economically appealing to issuers, especially as it would free their more conventional collateral for other uses.    There's little debate over forthcoming offerings. The fight is about how the rating agencies' new stance could affect existing mortgage-backed securities. Currently, issuers are allowed to substitute other collateral on many of these securities as long as it meets rating agency standards. Once those standards include junk bonds, some fear, investors who thought they had government-backed securities could suddenly find themselves holding junk-bond-backed securities.    &quot;That's a very big leap of faith&quot; to ask of investors, says Laurence D. Fink, co-head of fixed-income sales and trading at First Boston Corp. His firm is urging the rating agencies to forbid retroactive use of their criteria. Otherwise, he argues, investors' fears could drive down prices of all collateralized bonds. &quot;As long as the question remains,&quot; he says, &quot;it will hurt the entire market.&quot;    Mr. Watson of Moody's declines to discuss the retroactivity issue, but late last week sources said the agency was leaning toward limiting the criteria to new offerings.    Gary A. Palmer, head of capital markets at Imperial Savings, acknowledges that some investors are nervous, but contends Mr. Fink should be out educating them instead of &quot;drumming up hysteria.&quot; He says the thrift is &quot;proceeding very gingerly&quot; in terms of substitution, and won't even consider switching collateral in its existing securities until it's clear investors accept the new concept.    Moody's formula for using corporate bonds, whatever their rating, as collateral for triple-A securities is essentially simple. Under the new plan, the agency would require issuers to put up a lot more bonds than the value of the securities they want to issue -- and the riskier the collateral, the higher the level of overcollateralization that would be required.    Sources said the scale runs from about 170% to 210% of issue size. In determining risk, Mr. Watson said, the agency will look at the ratings on the collateral, the diversity and maturity of the pool and the frequency with which the pool is readjusted to reflect changes in value or credit.    Not all investors think Moody's is being conservative enough. &quot;Off the top of my head, I would say you need 250% to 300% overcollateralization&quot; to compensate for the added risk, says Donald G. Taylor, who manages a Fidelity preferred stock fund that includes about $13 million of collateralized preferred issues. Mr. Taylor fears Moody's is &quot;bowing to the power of investment bankers and issuers.&quot;    The collateral underlying mortgage-backed securities is standard and easy to evaluate, Mr. Taylor says. &quot;But you show me 150 junk bond issuers, and I guarantee you, 75% of them I've never heard of.&quot;    James D'Aquila, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which is underwriting the Imperial offering, says investors still need a lot of education. Marketing the offering will involve &quot;very much making investors comfortable with the high-yield market and dousing a lot of rhetoric,&quot; he says.    He argues that the Moody's standards are, in fact, extremely conservative. Even if 20% of a junk bond pool goes into default and loses all its value, pushing down the whole market, he says the pool will still more than cover the securities it's backing.    That high a loss is extremely improbable, he adds. &quot;That's over 30 times the values lost in the high-yield market over the last five years.&quot; According to studies by Edward I. Altman, a professor of finance at New York University, over the past 12 years the default loss on all corporate debt has averaged only 1.6% a year.    Mr. D'Aquila, in fact, throws the gauntlet right back at First Boston. Mortgage securities are a lot more volatile in price than junk bonds, he argues, adding that the strictness of the new criteria means the agencies &quot;have made a security that lives up to its triple-A.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
