The Fed said it found ``important deficiencies'' in the bank'sperformance under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requiresbanks to meet local credit needs, including those of low- andmoderate-income neighborhoods.   Continental's petition to acquire Grand Canyon State Bank inScottsdale, Ariz., was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with Govs.H. Robert Heller and John LaWare opposed. Gov. Edward W. Kelley Jr.did not vote.   ``The bank made no significant effort to ascertain the creditneeds of its communities or to advertise its products to thecommunity,'' the 10-page majority decision said. ``Finally, givenContinental's size, as well as the opportunities available in theChicago area, (the) bank's participation in community developmentand redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory.''   The decision also said the bank made ``substantially inaccurate''statements for a number of years about its compliance with theCommunity Reinvestment Act.   It noted that the bank has since developed a plan that should``make substantial contribution to correcting the pastdeficiencies'' in its compliance with the law.   But it added: ``The board does not believe that commitments bythemselves can serve as a substitute for the established record ofCRA performance required by the statute.''   The board also voiced concern about the bank's plan to expandwhile still financed in part by and subject to the control ofFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., in the wake of a 1984 federalbailout.</TEXT></DOC>
