There has been a need to develop methodologiesfor the separation, purification and characterization of such immunoconjugatesprior to their evaluation both under in vitro and in vivo conditions.During this project period, much of the effort has concentrated on MoAb17-1A which is directed against human colorectal cancer. The observedselective concentration of chlorpromazine in melanotic tissue and itshigh localization in murine melanoma indicated that boronated analoguesof chlorpromazine potentially could be used to deliver sufficient concentrationof boron-10 for BNCT of melanomas. Five boronated promazines have beensynthesized and fully characterized. The phthalocyanines, as with variousporphyrins, have been shown to be incorporated to a significant extentin malignant tumors. As a consequence, we have undertaken the synthesisof boron-containing phthalocyanines. Initial efforts have concentratedon the sulfonation of copper phthalocyanine by chlorosulfonation followedby reaction with aminocarboranes such as p-amino-phenylcarborane. Wehave achieved an average of 18 boron atoms per phthalocyanine molecule.1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
