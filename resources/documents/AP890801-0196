The nominee, career diplomat William Lacy Swing, appeared beforethe Foreign relations Committee at the same time as House membersconcerned about South Africa met to map strategy for possibleadditional sanctions aimed at pressing the South African governmentto dismantle its race policies.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill, in the committee chair, said thecommittee hoped to act on the nomination by Friday.   After the meeting of the House group, a congressional source whospoke on condition that he not be identified said the group wasconsidering two lines of action: Further U.S. sanctions, orcooperation with sanctions under the aegis of the United Nations asproposed by Simon.   Swing, formerly ambassador to Liberia, told the committee, ``Ourposition is that we do not need further sanctions.''   Asked about United Nations sanctions, he said, ``Were we to beinvolved in mandatory U.N. sanctions, clearly we risk thepossibility that we would be hostage to a veto by someone whodidn't share (our) particular assessment of the situation on theground in South Africa.''   At a House Banking international development subcommitteemeeting earlier, a Bush administration spokesman urged that SouthAfrica get more time to repay at least $8 billion of dollars offoreign debt that falls due next June. Other witnesses urged thatno delay be allowed unless South African policies are changed.   ``Some $2.6 billion in unpaid principal remained outstanding toU.S. financial institutions at the end of March 1989,'' said R.Richard Newcomb, director of the U.S. Treasurty's Office of ForeignAassets Control.   ``Were this amount to be simply defaulted on by the SouthAfrican borrowers because U.S. lending institutions were preventedby Congress from participating in further reschedulings, thebenefit to the South African economy is evident.''</TEXT></DOC>
