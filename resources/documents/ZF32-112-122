(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Harvey, Glenn; Haggerty, Michael E.; Avellino, Joseph; Moshier,Bert; Kashmarek, Ken; McCord, Bob.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>--------------------MATH CLASSandM;To the Editor:andM;In your May 27 issue, John Dodge repeats the great Windows math lie thatpermeates coverage of computer operating systems and interfaces.andP;  Whileaddressing Windows support, he acknowledges the product's instability.andO;However, when he calculates the potential for phone support, he assumes thatof the 4 million copies of Windows 3.0 Microsoft has shipped, there are 4million users.andP;  Not true.andP;  Microsoft may have shipped that many copies, butcertainly far fewer are actually in use any percent of the time, much lessthe assumed 25 percent.andM;I know our experience is not uncommon.andP;  We received four copies of Win 3 withnew computer purchases.andP;  After approximately 25 man-hours of experimentationwith Win 3 in conjunction with our network and trusty DOS applications, weerased the program from the hard disks.andP;  I now have four of the 4 millioncopies of Windows stuffed in the back of a file drawer where they never seethe light of day -- or hang our network.andM;Rob Garretson's editorial is much closer to the mark when he states that&quot;while Microsoft was shipping 4 million copies of Windows during the pastyear, it was also selling 15 million DOS licenses.&quot; Virtually all 15 millioncopies of DOS probably are in use on a daily basis.andP;  The press and thesoftware industry would be wise not to be carried away with the hype aboutWindows shipments and check how many people are really using the &quot;easy to useinterface of the future.&quot;andM;Glenn HarveyandM;Manassas, Va.andM;--------------------CAUTION: VIRUS AHEADandM;To the Editor:andM;Can I possibly be the only person who, upon reading about Intel's plans tointroduce re-programmable BIOS ROMs in the May 13 article &quot;New Intel ChipWill Let Users Upgrade BIOS,&quot; was struck by the realization of a potentialfor a new type of viral attack?andP;  Think about it for a moment.andP;  Imagine avirus that could directly attract a system's BIOS code by reprogramming it toperform all sorts of nefarious deeds.andM;Pretty scary thought, isn't it?andM;Let's hope Intel has developed a way to prevent that sort of thing beforethey unleash this otherwise beneficial technology.andM;Michael E. HaggertyandM;Personal Computer ConsultantandM;Springfield InstituteandM;for SavingsandM;Springfield, Mass.andM;--------------------ENHANCED VERSIONandM;To the Editor:andM;Thank you and Eric Rayl for your favorable review of our fax gateway, FacSys3.20, in your May 27 issue.andP;  Your organization always provides a strongservice to your readers.andP;  There is an important issue which I need to addressto make sure your readers are fully appraised.andP;  Please note that you reviewedversion 3.20 of FacSys, while your column and chart notes imply that youreviewed version 3.20E (for Enhanced Evolution).andM;At the time of your review, 3.20E was in beta test and was therefore notincluded in the article.andP;  There are significant improvements from one versionto the next, and Optus has received tremendous compliments from those whohave used the prerelease copy of this major update.andP;  Just one of the manyfeatures included in the new release is the ability to create 200-by-200-dpiimages as per your suggestion.andP;  This also takes care of the Hewlett-Packardemulation issue that you raised.andP;  Installation is now also a snap, eventhough you found it to be simple.andP;  And, finally, notification is sent tousers that a fax was or was not sent.andM;Joseph AvellinoandM;PresidentandM;Optus Software Inc.andM;Somerset, N.J.andM;--------------------TWO MISTAKESandM;To the Editor:andM;I am writing in reference to the article in the May 20 issue entitled &quot;Tiesthat Bind IBM, Microsoft Will be Difficult to Sever.&quot; The article quotes PetePeterson, executive vice president of WordPerfect Corp. as follows: &quot;Theimpact for us has been that we bet wrong -- we bet on OS/2 instead ofWindows.andP;  We'll be nine months late with our Windows product because of thatdecision.&quot;andM;Just my opinion, but Pete Peterson/WordPerfect made two mistakes, not one.andO;The first was not coming out with anything.andP;  They have neither an OS/2 nor aWindows product.andP;  The second is with the latest WP/Windows delay, they won'tbe coming out with WP/Windows until fall 1991.andM;This is the same time frame as when OS/2 2.0 ships and 32-bit word processorsship.andP;  How can WP/Windows keep up with 32-bit word processors?andM;Bert MoshierandM;Cray Research Inc.andM;Eagan, Minn.andM;--------------------SPILLED MILKandM;To the Editor:andM;Regarding your May 20 article &quot;Mac LC Disappoints Apple&quot; sales of the LCshould come as a surprise to no one.andP;  The &quot;lost&quot; sales went to the Classics.andO;When I first reviewed the low-cost Macs, it was obvious that the Classic hada low cost, but also low function.andP;  The LC had some of the right function,but its cost was not that low.andP;  The IIsi was not low-cost at all, but simplydisplaced other Macs in that price range.andM;While John Sculley hoped the LC would be a success with businesses, Applenever attempted to sell it that way.andP;  It was sold to education as thetransition vehicle to move from Apple IIs to Macs.andP;  The configuration waswrong for education and business.andP;  For education, it was too expensive to beused as a network workstation.andP;  Since then, Apple Computer has come out withversions for education only: a single-floppy or two-floppy version.andP;  The costis lower, and the maintenance problem is diminished.andP;  For business, they haveadded more memory to routinely support the larger color monitor.andM;It really seems strange how Apple &quot;hopes&quot; sales will go a certain way.andP;  Tomake a sale, you have to sell.andP;  That means get out and advertise to theintended market about a product they can use.andP;  Don't hope for something tohappen.andP;  Make it happen.andM;Ken KashmarekandM;Eldridge, IowaandM;--------------------LABOR COSTSandM;To the Editor:andM;Bert Sirkin's June 3 Soapbox article almost hit the nail on the head when hetalked about the hidden costs of downsizing.andP;  However, the &quot;hidden expenses&quot;definition put forth by Bert falls well short of reality.andM;Imagine yourself as the president of a Fortune 500 company.andP;  In the past,your employees performed very precise manual tasks.andP;  Now you have decided toexpand to computerized task management by using PCs.andM;The new network is installed, and you are off and running.andP;  But theadvantages PCs were supposed to provide have been neutralized.andP;  Youremployees are forced to spend their time becoming computer wizards.andP;  Time fortask management is greatly reduced as technical requirements begin to occupyemployees' available time.andM;Add the possibility of software license violations that bringing softwarefrom home can pose.andP;  What about end users and their notorious legacy ofattracting computer viruses?andP;  The list of hidden expense and lostproductivity goes on.andM;Effective computer-based task-management strategies reduce the need for usersto become technical.andP;  Trusting users to make their own computer decisions isthe equivalent of turning the company checkbook over to them.andP;  Efficientcompanywide strategies require centralized control with very specific taskdefinitions unhindered by technical requirements.andM;Bob McCordandM;Task Management AnalystandM;Data Management StrategiesandM;Arlington, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
