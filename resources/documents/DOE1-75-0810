Several parameters are constrained by applying the modelto some massive associations. Values of a number of observables are obtained.The approach provided in the paper shows how, qualitatively, the evolutionof a newly formed object, after the gas cloud expulsion, is affectedby the features of the physical environment wherein the formation processtakes place. 39 references.</TEXT></DOC>
