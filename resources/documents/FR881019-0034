Under the existing regulation, CIAP funding may be provided to PHAs underfive categories: (1) Comprehensive modernization; (2) emergency modernization;(3) special purpose modernization; (4) homeownership modernization; and(5) lead based paint modernization. Comprehensive modernization is themain category, reflecting the primary objective of the CIAP: complete rehabilitationof viable public housing projects, to address all physical improvementneeds and make any management improvements needed to sustain the physicalimprovements. The proposed amendments to the existing CIAP regulation are limited toprovisions on special purpose modernization and do not modify the essentialstructure or objectives of the program. These changes implement statutoryamendments to Section 14 of the 1937 Act, included in Section 120 of theHousing and Community Development Act of 1987 (1987 Act). Although Part 968 currently applies to Indian housing, the Department isplanning to consolidate all public housing regulations for Indian housingin Part 905 (see proposed rule, 53 FR 24554, published June 29, 1988).Persons interested in Indian housing should nevertheless comment on thisproposed rule, because the Department intends to incorporate its provisionsin Part 905 without having to publish a separate proposed rule to amendPart 905. In general, the potential availability of funds for special purpose modernizationwould be expanded and PHAs would be afforded more flexibility in addressingspecial purpose needs, as a result of a broader definition of the typesof work eligible for special purpose funding and an authorization for HUDto set aside a portion of available CIAP funds for special purpose use.In addition, the proposed rule includes a number of new conditions forspecial purpose funding, designed to implement the statutory policy bystriking a proper balance between the primary objective of comprehensivemodernization and the considerations which may justify special purposeimprovements in particular situations. All other program requirements under the existing CIAP regulation wouldcontinue to apply to special purpose modernization, unless otherwise statedin the proposed amendments. An example is the requirement for a PHA tocertify that its proposed modernization cannot be funded from current operatingfunds. All types of special purpose modernization would continue to be limitedto physical improvements, as defined in existing andSection;968.4(a). Underthe amended regulation, management improvements would continue to be eligiblefor inclusion in comprehensive modernization programs only. While the proposed rule would make some changes in the existing regulatoryprovisions on PHA planning, there would be no essential change in the five-yearcomprehensive planning requirements. The comprehensive plan would haveto be modified as necessary to address any special purpose needs not alreadyreflected in the plan. The rationale for special purpose modernization is that, in some situations,there may be needs for limited physical improvements which_though not sourgent as those eligible for emergency or lead based paint modernization_meritaction apart from comprehensive modernization. The project might already be in generally sound condition (because it hadnever deteriorated enough to need modernization or because it had previouslybeen modernized) so that the kind of major rehabilitation usually involvedin comprehensive modernization is not needed. Nevertheless, the need mayarise for some limited physical improvements, such as for replacement ofheating equipment or for additional accessibility for elderly and handicappedresidents. In other cases, where major rehabilitation is still needed, there may bean interim need to make limited physical improvements before a completeprogram of comprehensive modernization can be developed, funded and carriedout. For example, under the expanded definition in the proposed rule, specialpurpose modernization might be justified to pay for major roof repairsneeded to preserve a potentially viable building pending subsequent fundingfor a comprehensive modernization program to complete total rehabilitationof the property. Under andSection;968.3 of the existing rule, the definition of special purposemodernization is restricted to physical improvements for cost-effectiveenergy conservation. The 1987 statutory amendment expanded the scope ofspecial purpose modernization by specifying four additional types of eligiblework items. The new statutory language, inserted under Section 14(i)(1)(D)of the 1937 Act, reads as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) physical improvement needs eligible under this subparagraph shallinclude replacing or repairing major equipment systems or structural elements,upgrading security, increasing accessibility for elderly families and handicappedfamilies (as such terms are defined in section 3(b)(3)), reducing the numberof vacant substandard units, and increasing the energy efficiency of theunits, except that the Secretary may make financial assistance availableunder this clause only if the Secretary determines that the physical improvementsare necessary and sufficient to extend substantially the useful life ofthe project. </ITAG>The proposed rule would therefore revise the definition of ``special purposemodernization'' under andSection;968.3 to include all five of the types ofphysical improvements now enumerated by the statute, citing a few examples.A special purpose modernization program could consist exclusively of physicalimprovements of any one type or any combination of two or more types listedin the proposed definition, subject to the further requirements of thePublic Housing Modernization Standards Handbook, 7485.2, REV-1. The revised definition would also incorporate the general statutory restriction,as prescribed by the exception clause of the above-quoted 1987 amendment,allowing CIAP funding for special purpose modernization only if HUD determinesthat ``the physical improvements are necessary and sufficient to extendsubstantially the useful life of the project.'' It is not enough that theproposed work items meet the basic eligibility tests under the reviseddefinition and the Modernization Standards Handbook. They must also beboth <T3>necessary </T3>to extend <T3>substantially </T3>the useful life of the project, and <T3>sufficient </T3>to do so. This ``necessary and sufficient'' test is a matter of common sense judgment,looking at the needs of the particular project. A particular physical improvementmay clearly be necessary, but still insufficient, of itself, to effecta substantial extension of the project's useful life. For example, repairof a building foundation, though necessary, might be insufficient withoutrelated drainage work. On the other hand, related landscaping work, thougheligible for inclusion in a comprehensive modernization program, mightnot be necessary by the special purpose standard. The ``necessary and sufficient''test is thus both a maximum and minimum standard; the work must be no moreand no less than what is required for substantial extension of the project'suseful life. The proposed rule would revise the existing procedures for preliminaryapplications and joint reviews under andSection;968.5. The main change herewould be in andSection;968.5(e)(2), regarding the needs assessment to becompleted by the PHA in preparation for the joint review. As a generalrule, a comprehensive assessment of all physical and management needs wouldbe required for any project for which the PHA is currently requesting comprehensiveor special purpose funding. However, where a special purpose request fora project is limited to physical improvements relating to accessibilityfor elderly and handicapped families and energy efficiency, a specializedneeds assessment would suffice unless HUD determined that there was evidenceindicating that the project had major problems justifying a comprehensiveassessment. (Emergency, homeownership and lead-based paint modernizationwould continue to be subject to a specialized assessment of project needs.)For consistency with this revision of andSection;968.4(c)(1), the relatedprovision on the PHA's five-year plan (andSection;968(c)(1)) would also berevised. If the PHA wished to request special purpose funds not previouslyincluded in its five-year plan, it would have to modify the plan beforeHUD would consider funding those needs. The proposed rule would add, under andSection;968.5(h), a new paragraph (4),authorizing HUD to set aside for special purpose modernization a portionof the total CIAP funds available for any Federal Fiscal Year (FFY), asdetermined by HUD to be necessary to assure that special purpose needsare appropriately addressed. Special purpose modernization applicationswould be ranked as a separate group and would compete only with each otherfor the set-aside funds_not with applications for comprehensive modernizationor other modernization categories. In view of this provision, referencesto ``special purpose'' would be deleted from existing paragraphs (2) and(3) of andSection;968.5(h). The actual amount of each year's special purpose set-aside would be statedin the Department's annual CIAP processing notices to PHAs and HUD Regionaland Field Offices. For FFY 1989, the Department's intention (subject tofinal rulemaking) is to set aside for special purpose funding 20 percentof each HUD Regional Office's total CIAP funds. If any Regional Officefinds that less than the total amount of its special purpose set-asideis needed to fund special purpose improvements, then the remaining fundscould be used for other needs. In addition, the proposed rule would add a new andSection;968.10, entitled``Additional provisions for special purpose modernization''. This new sectionwould set two conditions, each relating to funding for certain types ofspecial modernization. These conditions are designed to reinforce the overall CIAP policy establishedby section 14 of the 1937 Act, considering the intent of the 1987 amendmentfor special purpose modernization within the broader policy context ofthe program as a whole. This policy still emphasizes the primary importanceof a comprehensive approach to modernization, while recognizing a varietyof situations where special purpose modernization may be justified. TheDepartment believes that the conditions stated in the proposed new andSection;968.10, along with the other provisions of this proposed rule, strike aproper balance between these two policy goals.Proposed andSection; 968.10(a) would limit the number of times a PHA couldobtain special purpose funding for a project that has not yet been comprehensivelymodernized, with respect to three of the five types of physical improvementslisted in the revised definition. For such a project, special purpose fundscould be obtained only once for each of the types of physical improvementsrelating to major equipment systems or structural elements, security, andreduction of vacant, substandard units. If any additional physical improvementsto the same project for these three purposes become needed at a later time,they would have to be funded as a part of a comprehensive modernizationprogram, addressing the total physical and management needs of the project.Such comprehensive modernization may not necessarily involve extensiverehabilitation. However, it will be the case that <T3>all </T3>the needs of the project will be met, so that the total projectwill meet the modernization standards at one point in time.The Department believes that this limitation is necessary to assure thatall projects are brought up to the modernization standards and that noproject is permitted to continue in generally poor repair overall, occasionallyreceiving some special purpose or emergency modernization, but never reachingmodernization standards.This limitation would not, however, apply to the other two types of eligiblespecial purpose work_those related to accessibility and energy efficiency.Special purpose funding for these two purposes could be provided as manytimes as might be justified.This provision would have no applicability at all to a project which hadalready been comprehensively modernized. For such a project, there wouldbe no limitation on the number of times special purpose funding could beprovided for any of the five types of eligible physical improvements, ifjustified. For example, if the prohibition against premature replacementresulted in a need to replace old heating equipment after completion ofcomprehensive modernization, that need could then be addressed by a specialpurpose modernization program, as could any other eligible need that mightsubsequently arise.The rationale for the proposed andSection; 986.10(a) is that the three typesof work items to which its restrictions would be applicable merit specialsafeguards against poor PHA planning where the project has not been comprehensivelymodernized. The fact that this limitation would apply only in that situationmust not be taken as a sanction for piecemeal modernization in other situations.The 1987 legislation was not intended to repeal the statutory requirementsfor sound PHA planning and a comprehensive approach to its overall modernizationneeds.Proposed andSection; 968.10(b) would subject one of the types of specialpurpose work items_physical improvements to reduce the number of vacant,substandard units_to restrictions related to unit turnover. Note that routineturnover repairs which do not satisfy the definition of ``physical improvements''would continue to be ineligible for funding under special purpose modernizationor any other CIAP category.The proposed rule would further restrict special purpose funding for vacantunit repairs which might otherwise be eligible for CIAP funding. Such repairswould be limited to work necessary to meet local code requriements andreturn the vacant units to a habitable condition, comparable to that ofoccupied units in the same project.In any even, special purpose funding could be provided for this purposeonly if the PHA's average number of vacancy days per turnover of untison the market did not exceed 30 calendar days. This would ensure that specialpurpose funding for reduction of vacancies would be limited to PHAs withcapable management. A longer average turnover time indicates that theremay be ineffective management in regard to turnover. The PHA might needto address its management problems before funds could be spent effectivelyon physical improvements. In such cases, the most effective treatment mightbe comprehensive modernization, with management improvement funding inthe first year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment wasmade in accordance with HUD regulations at CFR Part 50 that implement section102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspectionand copying during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.This rule would not constitute a ``major rule'', as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 issued by the President on February17, 1981. Analysis of the proposed rule indicates that it would not: (1)Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innnovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreignbased enterprises in domestic or export markets.Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), the undersigned herebycertifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. The rule would expand the definitionof special purpose modernization, to permit CIAP funding for the four additionaltypes of physical improvements now authorized by statute, and would prescribecertain conditions and procedures for such funding. It would thus tendto give PHAs more flexibility and tend to make their modernization effectsless burdensome.The rule would apply to all PHAs, large and small, which apply for specialpurpose modernization funds. It would not have a significant economic impacton any HUD assistance recipients, including small PHAs or any other smallentities.This rule was not listed in the Department's semiannual agenda of regulationspublished on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854) under Executive Order 12291 andthe Regulatory Flexibility Act at 49 FR 15960.An abbreviated 30-day public comment period is provided, because the Departmentis making every effort to achieve publication of a final rule for implementationin connection with the Federal Fiscal Year 1989 funding cycle. Early publicationof a final rule would allow PHAs maximum opportunity, in their FY 1989planning, for a more flexible approach to special purposes needs.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 968</ITAG>Public housing.Accordingly, 24 CFR Part 968 would be amended as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 968_COMPREHENSIVE IMPROVEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  </ITAG>1.
