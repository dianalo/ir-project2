Gorbachev as Soviet president.</LP><TEXT>   Since the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989, defensecontractors have lobbied to keep selling their weapons byarguing, in part, that the most sincere promises of Sovietchange could wither overnight.   Now, with armored personnel carriers rumbling through thestreets of Moscow, the U.S. military-industrial complex saysit has been vindicated. &quot;We've got to keep our guard up,&quot;says Bernard Schwartz, chairman of Loral Corp., which makesradar warning receivers for jet fighters and other militaryelectronic equipment.   The stock market's reaction seemed to drive home thatpoint. In yesterday's broad decline, a number of majordefense industry stocks bucked the trend to close higher inactive trading.   Executives acknowledged that it's too early to tellexactly what impact the Soviet situation will have on thedefense debate in the U.S. The country's leaders &quot;shouldn'tmanage national defense on the basis of daily events,&quot; saysNorman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta Corp., whichbuilds missiles and other arms. &quot;Our defense strategiesshould be defined to meet long-term requirements.&quot; Mr.Augustine notes that it &quot;takes decades to develop and providethe sophisticated, high-performance equipment that, forinstance, was used in the Persian Gulf&quot; War against Iraq.   So far, at least, nothing major has changed in terms ofthe Soviet threat. The Warsaw Pact is no more. The Sovieteconomy is in shambles, raising questions about whether itwill ever really be able to arm itself with next-generationweapons to match what the Pentagon is still preparing tobuild.   Tom Christie, a staff member with the Institute forDefense Analysis and former top Pentagon procurementofficial, says he sees no reason the U.S. defense budget,which is slated to decline about 5% a year through the middleof this decade, should change direction now. &quot;The Sovietshave so many problems with their military -- morale problems,equipment problems,&quot; he says. &quot;And even if the hardlinerscome back, they're going to be busy trying to hold theircountry together.&quot;   Nonetheless, says Renso Caporali, chairman of GrummanCorp., the Bush administration and Congress &quot;were certainlymaking decisions about how the nation would defend itselfbased on the Gorbachev regime.&quot;   Mr. Augustine adds: &quot;The instability in the Soviet Unionwill clearly continue, confronting the Soviet people withsome difficult possibilities ranging from a fascist state tototal anarchy.&quot;   It's precisely that volatility that is bound to give U.S.backers of certain weapons systems -- particularly theStrategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Stealth bomber --more ammunition as they fight for funding on Capitol Hill.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Northrop Corp., maker of the B-2 bomber, closed at $30.125,up $1.125.   The company also disclosed that its Electronic SystemsDivision, which had been suspended from doing business withthe government for two years because of fraud, has beenreinstated.   Other defense issues closing higher on the Big Boardincluded McDonnell Douglas Corp., up $2.50 to $51.25, andLoral, up 50 cents to $43.75. Some stocks, including GeneralDynamics Corp. and Lockheed Corp., rose early in the day.However, General Dynamics closed unchanged at $44.25, andLockheed ended at $44.125, off 12.5 cents.   When Congress reconvenes next month, the House and Senatemust sort out a number of important issues on a $291 billiondefense-spending plan for fiscal 1992, which begins Oct. 1.The Senate, for instance, wants four more B-2s, while theHouse voted overwhelmingly to kill the bat-winged bomber. TheHouse also has relegated anti-missile research to the backburner by eliminating almost half of the requested funding bythe White House; the Senate voted almost all of it.   Meanwhile, the current events will be analyzed and argued.&quot;There's no doubt that this gives us all a moment's pause toremember that the Soviet Union still is the most armed nationon Earth,&quot; says John Morton, a Boston attorney who helpedarrange a trip last spring for Soviet aerospace officials totour U.S. defense factories.   Still, he quickly adds: &quot;It's not bombs and missiles thatthe Soviet Union needs more of, but clothes and wheat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
