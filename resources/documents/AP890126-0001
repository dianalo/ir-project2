Government and security sources said on condition of anonymitythat Enrique Gorriaran Merlo directed the attack and seizure Mondayof the 3rd Infantry Regiment's base in the northwestern Buenos Airessuburn of La Tablada.   Gorriaran, a leader of the now-defunct People's RevolutionaryArmy, is believed to have escaped during a spectacular 27-hour seigein which army and police forces retook the base, they said.   Police and court investigators probed links between the attackersand left-wing organizations. The death toll from the assault roseThursday to 38 with the death of a wounded police officer.   In all, the dead included eight army soldiers, two policemen, and28 guerrillas. Nineteen guerrillas were captured.   Also Thursday, police acting on a court order raided severalhouses in the oceanfront city of Mar del Plata, 250 miles south ofBuenos Aires. Authorities said three people were arrested, but gaveno other details.   In the Buenos Aires area on Wednesday, police raided about 25houses in what the sources said was an unsuccessful bid to nabGorriaran, one of Latin America's most notorious leftist extremists.   The People's Revolutionary Army was a Marxist guerrillaorganization active in the early and mid-1970s. It was decimated ina harsh anti-subversion campaign waged by armed forces leaders whoseized power in a 1976 coup.   Gorriaran, however, escaped arrest during the campaign and fledabroad. In 1980 he led a team of Argentine and Nicaraguan guerrillaswho assassinated Somoza, in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion,Gorriaran himself said in published interviews. Somoza, Nicaragua'sousted right-wing strongman, had been ousted by the leftistSandinistas in 1979.   When the elected government of President Raul Alfonsin assumedpower in Argentina in 1983, he issued a decree ordering theprosecution of five notorious leftist guerrillas, includingGorriaran. In the same decree he ordered the trial of nine formerleaders of the rightist armed forces for human rights abuses.   Gorriaran remained a fugitive for years and was believed to beliving abroad. Late last year a leftist human rights lawyer, JorgeBanos, asked the courts to allow Gorriaran to return and face trialwithout being imprisoned.   Police said one of the guerrillas killed in this week's assaultwas identified as Banos. He and at least two other of the attackerswhose names have been released by police were active in a leftistpolitical group, the Movement Everyone for the Country.   The little-known movement, formed about three years ago,denounced in early January what it said were plans for a coup byright-wing extremists in the armed forces. Those elements have ledthree short-lived but dramatic uprisings against Alfonsin in 21months.   The army base's attackers carried a written proclamation thatsaid their action was designed to pre-empt a coup and fomentcivilian resistance to the military.   In response to the attack, Alfonsin late Wednesday gave themilitary a policy voice in internal security. He decreed creation ofa National Security Council whose members include the chiefs ofstaff of the army, navy and air force, along with several civilianofficials.   Until the council was created, Alfonsin's center-left governmenthad barred the military from any role in internal security,maintaining that it was strictly a police matter.   Human rights groups have said they fear military participationwould mean a return to the harsh anti-leftist repression of the late1970s, when at least 8,900 people were illegally arrested and thendisappeared. They are presumed dead.   Also Thursday, the Justice Ministry said it will investigateallegations by Carlos Menem, presidential candidate of theopposition Peronist Party, that the assault on the base was designedto embarrass his party.   According to Menem, the motive was to ``enter (the base), do somedamage and leave behind propaganda connecting the Peronist Partywith the sectors of the army that mutinied a few days ago.''   The point, would be ``to destroy definitively, to bury the imageof the Peronist Party and its candidate.'' Menem offered no evidenceto support his reasoning, and no evidence has been disclosed to linkthe assault to the party.</TEXT></DOC>
