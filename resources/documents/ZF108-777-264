How long will it be until someone drives a 486at 50 MHz? (That's DOS at 50 MIPS.andP;  A modern mainframe cranks along at maybe150 MIPS.) And will anyone raise an eyebrow when it happens? In 1979 myemployer's mainframe had a gigabyte of on-line storage.andP;  That was a computerroom full of machines the size of file cabinets.andP;  Today a gigabyte drive willset you back about $5,000.andP;  I'll get back to this, but first let's go toCOMDEX.andM;Report from AtlantaandM;Spring COMDEX was back in Atlanta, this year.andP;  The DBASE community stayedaway.andP;  Fox had a big-deal, big-company-style booth on the main floor.andO;Wallsoft had a nice collection of template developers in their booth.andP;  Andnewcomer LodeStone Consortium was showing dB RACE-A DBF query machine thatthey claim is an order of magnitude faster than FoxPro.andM;You just got all the COMDEX DBASE activity in one paragraph.andP;  Aren't you gladyou stayed home? Microrim was showing R:BASE 3.0-its menus allow users to gettheir data out with a minimum of hassle, they tell us.andP;  Menu-driven and easyto use.andP;  Hmmm.andP;  Remember when they used natural language? Remember SQL? Isthere a lesson here?andM;Seen in AtlantaandM;Brier is not a brand of ice cream, it's a new disk start-up.andP;  Now who intheir right mind would start a new disk company? President John Bizjak andsome very smart people would.andP;  Their disks are amazing.andP;  Outside, they looklike every other 3.5-inch hard shell.andP;  Inside, though, they're coated withberrium ferrite.andP;  (Yeah, me too.andP;  I asked John how to spell it.) What's soslick about berrium ferrite? Would you like 25M per disk and a 35 ms accessspeed-faster than the original AT hard disks? At $25 per disk and $800 for aninternal drive (list-you figure out the street price), it looks like one ofmy empty bays is going to get filled in.andP;  Ciao, Bernoulli.andM;Heard in AtlantaandM;Big disk platters, you old-timers remember, were 14 inches.andP;  Then they shrunkto 8, then 5.25, and now 3.5.andP;  Next is 2.5.andP;  Today's average DOS box shipswith a 3.5-inch, 40M disk.andP;  Next year's average DOS box will ship with a2.5-inch, 100M disk.andP;  And no hip disk would be seen without an integratedcontroller.andP;  The IDE (40 pin) connector on the motherboard is definitely thewave of tomorrow.andM;Western Digital used to make nearly all the disk controller boards.andP;  Theybought Tandon's drive business two years back because they figured diskcontroller boards were the buggy whips of the  90s.andP;  Now they're shipping&quot;intelligent' disks.andP;  (The integrated controller is smart about adjustingcache to match your DOS sector size.) Throughput is the new watchword.andM;Western Digital calls it  &quot;cache flow.&quot; Cute? And they guaranteecompatibility.andP;  They call it &quot;Functional Integrity Testing.&quot; That's a test ofFITness, of course.andM;And guess who they buy the disks from? Pacific Rim manufacturers, right?andO;Partly right.andP;  How about IBM? Yes, IBM.andP;  Big Blue will need all the OEMbusiness it can get when our little DOS boxes take over for their mainframes.andM;Writable optical media are finally real.andP;  But they're tortoise slow.andP;  If youreally want to archive your data for a 100 years, go get'em.andP;  They may beslow, but they'll last forever.andP;  This should be a big seller in governmentoffices.andM;Nothing new at COMDEXandM;Every COMDEX somebody says &quot;What's new?&quot; and someone answersandM;Nothing much.&quot; Next time someone answers &quot;Nothing much&quot; I'm going to pack'emoff to a desert island and make them wait five years before going to anotherCOMDEX.andM;Think back five years.andP;  The hot new box is IBM's 6MHz AT.andP;  EGA is setting anew graphic standard.andP;  The 20M disk has an average seek time of 40 ms.andP;  Andwe're all crabbing about the terrible new keyboard-layout.andM;Today's bottom-end XT-compatibles beat that old clunker.andP;  Nobody makes a CPUas slow as 6MHz anymore.andP;  And that old hard drive is no match for Brier's newfloppies, never mind a real hard disk.andM;So let me give you my report on Spring COMDEX, 1995.andP;  The hot boxes are100MHz 80686s with one-gigabyte, 5-ms hard disks.andP;  They've got 128M of RAM onthe motherboard using the new 16-megabit chips.andP;  Nine chips ($100 extra) addsa 16M cache that really works wonders on your disk throughput.andP;  Of course,that's just a personal computer.andP;  Network servers are running 10 to 100concurrent CPUs managing disks measured in terabytes.andP;  Compaq's newtop-of-the-line ServerPro runs circles around any 1990 supercomputer.andP;  Those100M floppies really come in handy for storing full-motion, high-definitionTV presentations.andP;  And, oh, yeah, I almost forgot, there's one guy asking What's new?' and there's another guy answering &quot;Nothing much.&quot; And we'llstill be crabbing about the terrible new keyboard layout.andM;Fox fans fumingandM;Fox is doing just what you would've guessed.andP;  Growing too fast and gettinginto trouble with their troops.andP;  Here's the shocker: Foxpro has bugs! We'renot talking DBASE IV buggy., but still, it's not perfect.andP;  Why is anyonesurprised?andM;On the really serious side, the multiuser Fox products have been taking it onthe chin for not being, well, Fox-like.andP;  Seems when you go multiuser, thefleet Fox becomes a slow sloth.andM;I'd say we're stuck with Clipper, but the folks at Wordtech claim they've gota few surprises of their own.andP;  Fox says 'wait 'til fall.' I'll let you popthe question: &quot;Which fall?'andM;The template tourandM;I'm busy getting my RV ready to drive the family around the continent sellingmy templates and my book on how to write templates.andP;  Ten weeks, 20,000 miles,and stops at 30-plus Clipper groups.andP;  By the time you read this, we'll be inmid-tour, wandering up the west coast.andP;  I'm bringing along all the software Iwish I'd used a long time ago but never had the time ...andP;  You know how itgoes.andM;Promises to keepandM;The one I'm most excited about is dCLIP, from Donnay Software.andP;  Roger Donnayfigured out how to write a linker that works at runtime.andP;  And then he wrappedthis dynamic linker into a complete dot prompt environment, so all of usinterpreter lovers can pretend it's Fox while we still get FUNCky, or Grumpy,or sneezy, or whatever.andM;That's right, from Roger's dot prompt you run your favorite editor and thenDO the new program.andP;  And it's just like Fox, but you can still use all yourfavorite Clipper libraries.andP;  They link transparently as your program runs.andO;And there's a full dot prompt interpreter and even a debugger.andM;Roger wants you to use somebody else's linker when you're done developing.andO;All that pluggin' and chuggin' still gets the fastest finished EXE.andP;  Myfriends all agree that John Stolte, Jr.'s Blinker is the way to go.andP;  It'sanother one of those products that I haven't had an extra hour to learn touse.andP;  According to reports, it creates overlaid, extended memory applicationsas fast as Tlink will create something plain for the south 640.andP;  And if youdon't know an overlay from an overcoat, Blinker let's you stay blissfullyignorant.andP;  It does it all for you.andM;Saved by Steve SteinerandM;Steve Steiner is an assembly language whiz.andP;  His company, IntegratedDevelopment, is up to strange stuff.andP;  How about the code that runs IBM'sautomated soldering equipment? But out in Clipper land, he's shippingSmartMem, which, unlike Clipper, is smart about memory.andM;A little utility I wrote was processing one file just fine, but blew up on anout of memory' when I asked it to process a list of files.andP;  Sure,' Stevesays, you just need to repack the fragmented memory.'andM;I have trouble packing a suitcase, never mind memory.'andM;No problem, just call my 'h_pack()'.&quot;andM;How tough is it? My wife put dinner on while I unwrapped SmartMem.andP;  Theexamples were clear, documentation was simple, and I put h_pack()s in placeswhere they might do some good.andP;  I figured out how to link it and voila! Firsttime I fed it my list (all 17 chapters of my book), it ran through the wholething without a hitch.andM;Thirty minutes after opening the package, as we sat down to dinner, Linda wasasking what put me in such a good mood.andP;  'It's because now I can finally say'@BOOK.LST',&quot; I explained.andP;  You really are a nerd,&quot; she said.andM;Get your nerdandM;So send me your hottest tips and juiciest gossip and I'll send you your veryown nerd.andP;  Everyone loves the plastic pocket protector that says  &quot;NERD.&quot; Ihaven't run out yet-but don't wait to get yours.andM;Martin L. Rinehart is the author of The Entry Templates, which use Wallsoft'sU12 to create Clipper programs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
