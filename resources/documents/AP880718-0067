Police may close the investigation next week unless new cluessurface, The Seattle Times reported Sunday. Mary Lou Paisley'sdeath was ruled an accident at the time and there was no formalpolice investigation.   ``We don't even know if there was a crime, because we haven'tgot anything to substantiate that,'' said Sgt. Harlan Bollinger.   Paisley was a Boeing Co. executive at the time of his wife'sdeath. He left Boeing in 1981 to become assistant secretary of theNavy, and later became a defense consultant. He has been a centralfigure in a Justice Department probe into bid-rigging and briberyat the Pentagon.   ``It warranted a much more thorough investigation than was givenback then,'' Bollinger said. ``If something like that happenedtoday, we would have done a tougher investigation and got all theinformation that led up to her death.''   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, said Friday thatPaisley had not been contacted by police and ``has no inclinationto dredge up a sad and tragic event that was closed out 20 yearsago.''   Paisley told authorities in 1968 that his wife, who was anartist, apparently had gotten up during the night to paint and wasovercome by fumes while cleaning her brushes.   Police decided that Mrs. Paisley's broken ribs and otherinjuries were inflicted inadvertently by firefighters administeringcardiopulmonary resuscitation at the couple's home in the suburb ofKent.   Friends and family, however, have questioned the circumstancesof Mrs. Paisley's death. Her body was found in a bathroom, facedown in a pile of towels covered with the toxic solvent carbontetrachloride.   According to the coroner's report, Paisley told authorities thathis wife took two sleeping pills after having a drink and went tobed.   But lab tests showed no trace of the paint cleaner, no trace ofthe sleeping pills and no alcohol in her bloodstream. An autopsylisted the cause of death as ``? Drug hypersensitivity.''   Dr. Donald Reay, county medical examiner, said there is no wayto determine whether the autopsy tests were accurate. The medicalexaminer who performed the autopsy died last year.   The sheriff's office says all police reports on the death wereapparently destroyed in routine purges of non-homicide files.   A retired police detective, Dick Phillips, however, kept theonly copies of pictures take of Paisley's autopsy.   ``In my mind, it was never justified, that we never looked intoit,'' said Phillips. He said he kept the photos in part because ``Ifelt that the facts of the autopsy disputed the facts of the caseso strongly.''   Nine months after the death, Paisley married his secretary atBoeing, Mildred McGetrick. They were divorced in 1980, and hemarried computer analyst Vicki McKim.</TEXT></DOC>
