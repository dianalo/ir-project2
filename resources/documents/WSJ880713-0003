Testifying at Senate hearings prompted by the unfolding defense procurement scandal, the Pentagon chief specifically criticized the complexity of the weapons-buying process, arguing that it provides too many opportunities for contractors to intervene improperly.    In conceding that the procurement system may have created an environment in which wrongdoing could occur, the Pentagon chief broke with the stand he took just after the nationwide investigation became known last month. At that time, he said the scandal involved dishonest individuals -- not flaws in the system itself.    &quot;The overall process has too many decision points,&quot; he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;Each decision point is a point of venal vulnerability.&quot; The dozens of decision points in weapons programs stretch from the Congress, which pays for weapons projects, to the military services, which define the requirements for new weapons and select contractors to produce them.    Mr. Carlucci said that blame for the problems plaguing the procurement system should be shared. &quot;Some can be traced to the Department of Defense, some to the Congress, some to the industry,&quot; he said. He added that some problems &quot;simply haven't been addressed by any of us.&quot;    Mr. Carlucci said it was too early to suggest specific changes in the system, but he stressed that any revisions should make weapons programs more stable and less subject to year-to-year tinkering and intervention.    Although Mr. Carlucci became defense secretary in November, 1987 -- after most of the suspected bribery and bid-rigging occurred -- the scandal has raised questions about two previous procurement reform efforts in which he figured prominently. The first was the development of a set of Pentagon acquisition standards that he issued in 1982, when he served as the deputy defense secretary. The second was a 1986 White House procurement-reform commission on which he served.    Both earlier reform efforts were billed as far-reaching programs that would clean up the procurement system. The current investigation, which covers about 85 defense contracts, suggests that those efforts didn't resolve all the problems.    At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Carlucci and his senior aides sketched out a new policy for how the Pentagon will handle defense contracts that are tarnished by the unfolding scandal. Rather than automatically stopping payments on contracts that are implicated -- as they did 10 days ago, only to reverse the move this week -- they said they'd choose between a range of actions. The choice would depend on how far along the involved weapons project is and on the level of wrongdoing that's alleged to have taken place.    &quot;We'll look at how far along the contract is, as well as the level of taint and the cost to the government,&quot; said Kathleen Buck, general counsel for the Defense Department. She said that where contracts haven't actually been awarded, the Pentagon simply may require contractors to agree in advance to give up any profits if it's shown later that they won the jobs through use of inside information or bid-rigging.    In cases where contracts that already have been awarded are found to be suspect, companies could be allowed to continue work but would be suspended from bidding on future business for a period of time. Another option the department might exercise would be to impose fines on companies implicated in the scandal. </TEXT></DOC>
