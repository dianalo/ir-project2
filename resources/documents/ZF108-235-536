ZimmermanandM;Extending its reach in the data-communications market, Racal-Vadic recentlyreleased a family of modems and multiplexers that run over fiber-opticwiring.andM;The eight new Racal-Vadic Fiber Optic 1000, 6000 and 8000 Series modems andtime-division multiplexers provide users with a range of synchronous andasynchronous communications options for their fiber-optic networks, and arethe first in a line of fiber-optic products from the company, officials said.andM;The 1000 Series consists of the 1600 and 1700 synchronous modems and the 1800multiplexer, which can consolidate and distribute transmissions across T-1and European CEPT lines, said Scott Porter, director of marketing atRacal-Vadic in Milpitas, Calif.andM;The 1600 can transmit data at the T-1 speed of 1.544M bps, while the 1700 canrun at the CEPT rate of 2.048M bps, he explained.andP;  The 1800 multiplexercombines as many as 16 T-1 and CEPT channels.andM;PC-to-PC TransmissionandM;The 6000 Series includes the 6100 and 6200, two asynchronous modems that cantransmit data between PCs at speeds as fast as 19.2K bps.andP;  Also included isthe 6300, an asynchronous/synchronous modem that can transmit at speeds asfast as 256K bps.andM;In the 8000 Series, Racal-Vadic offers the 8100 and 8600, two asynchronous/synchronous time-division multiplexers for converting multiple communicationslines into one high-speed channel, Porter explained.andP;  The 8100 is capable ofcombining as many as eight channels, and the 8600 can be configured for 16 or32 channels.andM;While Racal-Vadic views the new modems as an option for users who want totake advantage of the extra reliability and bandwidth that fiber-optic wiringprovides over more traditional copper wire, and as an entry point into apossibly explosive market, some industry observers predict that the companywill have a difficult time trying to sell the new products.andM;&quot;I think they're interim products,&quot; said Jeremy Frank, vice president ofenterprise network strategies at the Gartner Group Inc., a market-researchfirm in Stamford, Conn.andP;  &quot;They're priced attractively, but I don't see a realwide-scale application for them.&quot;andM;The 1000, 6000 and 8000 Series modems and multiplexers, available now, rangein price from the $75 model 6200 asynchronous modem to the model 1800multiplexer, which costs between $2,970 and $9,205, depending onconfiguration.andM;Racal-Vadic can be reached at (800) 482-3427.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
