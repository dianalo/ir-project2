<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0654 </DOCNO><TEXT>Relativistic jets, which are beams of particles and magnetic fields emittingsynchrotron radiation that emanate from black holes at the centers ofgalaxies and quasars, have been one of the most exciting discoveriesmade at the Very Large Array (VLA) operated by the National Radio AstronomyObservatory (NRAO). The VLA is an array of 27 antennas, each 25 metersin diameter, distributed in a Y-formation with two branches 21 kilometerslong and one branch 19 kilometers long. Astronomers can use it to studyrelativistic jets that generate intense natural radio sources (or transmitters).These sources, associated with regions hundreds of thousands of lightyears across, are the most powerful in the universe in energy output.In his lecture, Bridle describes how consecutive advances in imagingtechniques for radio astronomy have uncovered the properties of the powerfulradio sources, culminating in the discovery at the VLA that many of thesesources contain radio emitting jets. He then describes some of the NRAO'sresearch on these jets, and discusses the jets' physical properties.He concludes with an outlook for the future: the NRAO's Very Long BaselineArray (VLBA) is to be completed in the early 1990's. The VLBA is an arrayof ten radio telescopes distributed from Hawaii to St. Croix, from theCanadian border to Texas. With the VLBA, astronomers plan to look moredeeply into these radio sources. 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
