Jimmy Carter, however, didn't get to name any Supreme Court justices. Ronald Reagan has named three, but they have replaced conservative or moderate justices and thus President Reagan really hasn't been able to remake the court.    But this year the warnings may be justified. When the next president takes office, three of the justices will be octogenarians. Any changes might disrupt the closely balanced current court on such issues as the death penalty, affirmative action and abortion. In the last term many critical issues were decided on 5-to-4 votes, and thus any appointments by the next president almost surely will be critical to this balance.    &quot;I think it's the issue&quot; of this election, says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah.)    The issue is bigger than just the Supreme Court. Probably hundreds of judges will be named to the lower federal courts over the next four years. President Reagan has appointed 360 federal judges, nearly half the judiciary, and the next president could well determine whether the conservative tide continues on the federal district and appeals courts.    But most of the focus is on the high court. The age issue affects three of the court's most liberal members: Next Jan. 20, when the new president takes office, Justice William Brennan will be 82 years old, and Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun will be 80. Conservatives eagerly anticipate that replacing any of them would break the court's traditional liberal wing.    The effect of a Dukakis election on the Supreme Court probably would be less dramatic, since he would be expected to replace any of these senior justices with other generally progressive jurists. (A wild card would be the retirement of any of the conservative justices, which would give a Dukakis administration the chance to tilt the court leftward).    The biggest controversy may be over what type of judges George Bush would name. Surely they would be more conservative than the likely Dukakis appointments. But conservatives nevertheless are worried.    Richard Viguerie frets that George Bush, if elected, would appoint &quot;country-club Republicans.&quot; Sen. Hatch worries that Mr. Bush's instincts are to avoid controversy and that his nominees would be &quot;bland.&quot; Judicial selection is an area where Mr. Bush has the right lyrics but the wrong music, conservatives say.    They cite his 1987 appearance before the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative lawyers from whose ranks the Reagan administration has plucked some of its federal judges. &quot;Judges need to be restrained and disciplined in the exercise of power,&quot; the vice president said. But he began his speech by talking about his admiration for the late Justice Potter Stewart, a moderate jurist and fellow Yale graduate who administered the oath of office to Mr. Bush in 1981. &quot;That's the problem with Bush,&quot; says Mr. Viguerie &quot;His idea of a conservative is a John Paul Stevens {another moderate justice} or a Potter Stewart.&quot;    A close adviser says Mr. Bush would exhibit &quot;less willingness to take a chance on the fringes of philosophy; you won't find a Siegan.&quot; Reagan nominee Bernard Siegan was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee for a seat on the federal appeals court in San Francisco recently because of his unorthodox conservative views.    Already there has been some behind-the-scenes skirmishing over what the Republican Party's platform will say about judges. The 1984 GOP platform called for &quot;the appointment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.&quot; A group of moderate congressmen met with Bush campaign aides two weeks ago in hopes of toning down that language. Charles Black, a Bush campaign adviser, says the vice president &quot;is committed to&quot; the old language. But Donald Devine, who heads an ad hoc lobby, the Committee to Save the Reagan Platform, says he is guarding against any slippage at the GOP convention.    Mr. Bush hasn't played a role in selecting the Reagan administration's 360 nominees to the federal courts. C. Boyden Gray, the vice president's top legal adviser, says, &quot;It's not an issue where he's indicated he wishes to chart new ground or take a different approach.&quot;    Unlike the vice president, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis does have a track record in picking judges, having appointed 127 judges to state courts in Massachusetts. In terms of selecting quality judges, the governor gets high marks, even from critics. &quot;His judges have been capable,&quot; says State Senator David Locke, the Republican assistant minority leader who is co-chairman of the Bush campaign in Massachusetts.    Alice Richmond, a past president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, says the Dukakis judges can't be pigeonholed as liberals. &quot;They cover the spectrum,&quot; says Ms. Richmond. But in Massachusetts, Sen. Locke points out, the spectrum itself leans leftward. &quot;Dukakis is an authentic, card-carrying liberal,&quot; he says. &quot;And his judges would reflect that philosophical leaning.&quot;    One of Mr. Dukakis's first acts as governor was to establish a merit selection system for judges. An 18-member Judicial Nominating Council recommends three finalists to the governor, who interviews them and makes his selection. Donald Stern, the governor's legal counsel, says Mr. Dukakis would probably &quot;borrow and use some elements&quot; of his merit selection process in the White House.    Gov. Dukakis recently chided the Reagan administration for its failure to appoint enough women or members of minority groups to the bench. Mr. Dukakis appointed the first woman to sit on his state's highest court, and 18% of his state judicial selections were women. Minorities comprised 11% of the total. Nine percent of the Reagan administration's federal judicial appointees are female, and 5% are minorities.    Political pressures doubtless will influence the Supreme Court selections of either man. Even if George Bush wanted to name a right-winger, he might resist for fear that Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans would gang up to defeat the nomination. For Mr. Dukakis, the challenge will be to pick someone who does not raise a red flag with conservatives and even some moderates. &quot;A Larry Tribe would mean World War III,&quot; says the Free Congress Foundation's Patrick McGuigan about Laurence Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor who testified against the confirmation of Robert Bork last summer.    Attorney General Edwin Meese adds that any speculation over Supreme Court nominations is premature, since the justices have exhibited an uncanny knack for defying the actuarial tables. &quot;Justices Brennan and Marshall look great,&quot; he chuckles ruefully.    ---    Ages of Supreme Court Justices    on Inaugural Day Next Jan. 20   Justice William Brennan            82   Justice Thurgood Marshall          80   Justice Harry Blackmun             80   Justice Byron White                71   Justice John Paul Stevens          68   Chief Justice William Rehnquist    64   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor        58   Justice Antonin Scalia             52   Justice Anthony Kennedy            52</TEXT></DOC>
