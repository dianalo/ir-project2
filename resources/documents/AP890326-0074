Sunday's balloting did not directly affect the government ofPremier Turgut Ozal. But opponents called it a referendum on Ozal'spolicies and Ozal said before voting began that he might quit ifvoters favored opposition parties.   Former Premier Suleyman Demirel, leader of the center-right TruePath Party, and Erdal Inonu who heads the leftist Social DemocratPopulist Party, both claimed victory over the Motherland Party.   Inonu, a nuclear physics professor turned politician, declared,``The people accomplished a real spring cleaning, making it clearwho they wanted to see in power.''   Two people were killed and 35 were wounded in violence at votingbooths in rural eastern Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported.It said police detained 42 people in clashes between rival familiesover voting for village leaders.   Early returns, based on 10 percent of the votes, showed Ozal'sparty losing mayoral races to the Social Democrats in Turkey'sthree largest cities _ Istanbul, the nation's financial andcultural center; Ankara, the capital, and Izmir on the Aegean coast.   Returns from provincial assembly elections had the MotherlandParty in third place behind True Path and the Social Democrats.   True Path, strong in rural areas, was getting 28.5 percent ofthe vote nationwide, the Social Democrats 26 percent and Ozal'sparty 21.5 percent.   A Moslem fundamentalist party, Prosperity, was making a strongshowing in several provinces in eastern Turkey and capturing 9percent of the votes nationwide.   Ballots are counted by hand and unofficial results are notexpected until Tuesday.   Voters elected more than 326,000 mayors, provincial assemblymembers, city council members, village leaders and neighborhoodrepresentatives.   Ozal's mandate as premier runs until 1992, but his popularityhas been slipping and his record was a major election issue.   During five years in power, Ozal has sought to rapidly modernizeTurkey, building new roads, public housing, power plants and animproved telecommunications system. Trade has been liberalized andTurkey has applied for membership in the European EconomicCommunity.   But inflation that reached 75 percent last year cost Ozalsupport.   Public opinion polls before Sunday's election indicated Ozal'sparty would fall below the 36 percent of the vote it drew in thegeneral elections in 1987 and the 41.6 percent in local polls fiveyears ago.   Opposition politicians have said early elections would be neededif the governing party drew less than a third of the vote.   Ozal, 61, ended his campaign Friday telling voters he wasprepared to quit if opposition gains were so large it would bedifficult for him to govern.   The premier said that only he can prevent a return to theturbulence of the 1970s, when terrorism and an economic crisispaved the way for a 1980 military takeover.   Seven parties with nationwide organizations sought the supportof Turkey's 28 million eligible voters. The nation has a populationof 55 million.   The parties are: Motherland, which advocates free-marketeconomy; the main opposition Social Democrat Populist Party; TruePath; the Democratic Left Party, led by former Premier BulentEcevit; Prosperity; the conservative Reformist Democracy Party andthe Nationalist Labor Party, also conservative.</TEXT></DOC>
