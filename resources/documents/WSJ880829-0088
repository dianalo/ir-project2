The energy concern said the rise came despite a 5.2% drop in revenue, which slipped to $340.3 million from $359 million. Piedmont said profit margins improved primarily because of changes in its sales mix. It sold more gas than before to firm customers with relatively high margins.    Piedmont said revenue declined partly because of a shift in its industrial market from selling gas, where the cost of gas is included in the rates, to transporting gas, where the cost of gas isn't.    In the 12 months through July, net rose 36% to $25.3 million, or $2.76 a share, from $18.6 million, or $2.13 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5.1% to $393 million from $414.2 million.    The company customarily has a loss in the fourth quarter because of low demand for gas. That is why net for the latest nine months exceeds that of the latest 12 months. </TEXT></DOC>
