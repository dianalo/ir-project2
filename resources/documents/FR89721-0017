Telephone (202)523-8151.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In June 1986, OSHA issued revised standardsgoverning occupational exposure to asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite andactinolite for general industry and construction which were to be effectiveon July 21, 1986. (See 51 FR 22812 et. seq., June 20, 1986).On October 17, 1986, OSHA published a partial stay of the revised standardsinsofar as they apply to occupational exposure to non-asbestiform tremolite,anthophyllite and actinolite, in order to enable the Agency to review newsubmissions raising questions about the appropriateness of regulating theseminerals in the revised asbestos standards, and to allow sufficient timeto reopen the rulemaking record and conduct supplemental rulemaking proceedingslimited to this issue (51 FR 37002).OSHA extended the stay until July 21, 1988 in a notice published on April30, 1987 (52 FR 15722), and again until July 21, 1989, in a notice publishedon July 20, 1988 (53 FR 27345).The extensions were issued to allow OSHA sufficient time first to gatherdata relating to the feasibility of regulating all impacted industries,then to collect and analyze additional health data and to draft a noticeof proposed rulemaking. OSHA is now completing the drafting and staff levelreview of the agency's draft notice of proposed rulemaking. The followingrulemaking milestones have now been established: publication of a noticeof proposed rulemaking_October 1989; publication of a final standard_November1990. Thus, an extension of the stay until November 30, 1990 is necessaryto conclude the rulemaking on the regulation of non-asbestiform tremolite,anthophylite and actinolite.  As was the case with the initial partial stay, the 1972 standard governingoccupational exposure to asbestos (redesignated 29 CFR 1910.1101) willremain in effect to the extent of the stay during the period of the extension.The full text of the stay with respect to these non-asbestiform mineralswas published in the October 17, 1986 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 37002).With respect to the extension of the partial stay, OSHA finds that advancenotice and opportunity for comment are inpractical and unnecessary withinthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553 in view of the limited duration of the extensionand the continued applicability of the 1972 standard (29 CFR 1910.1101)to cover the gaps in coverage created by the partial stay.The minor amendments to the notes to 29 CFR 1910.1001, 1910.1101, and 1926.58,similarly are made without advance notice and opportunity for comment.OSHA finds such process unnecessary and impracticable in that the changesmerely reference the extension of the stay and restate the applicabilityof the 1972 standard.No evidentiary issues are involved.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926</ITAG>Asbestos, Occupational safety and health.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Signature</ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of Alan McMillan, ActingAssistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Departmentof Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.It is issued pursuant to sections 4, 6(b), 8(c) and 8(g) of the OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657), section 107 ofthe Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (Construction Safety Act)(40 U.S.C. 333), the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (33U.S.C. 941), 29 CFR Part 1911, Secretary of Labor's Order No. 9-83 (48FR 35736), and 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 18th day of July, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan McMillan,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Amended Standards</ITAG>Part 1910 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1910_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
