Since the development of those kinds ofenergy systems demands, of course, time and large investment, the utilizationof fossil energy sources will be compellingly necessary for a still notablylong transition period of well over 100 years. However, in this reportit is becoming increasingly clear that the problem of emissions in generaland the CO/sub 2/ problem in particular can create lasting restrictionsfor the future development of energy systems.</TEXT></DOC>
