(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Don't ask Anabel Thompson the names of hergreat-grandchildren. She has 100 of them.   ``I couldn't tell you,'' she said. ``I've never known anyone withthat many great-grandchildren.''   Mrs. Thompson, who will turn 90 in March, grew up with sevenbrothers and a sister, raised 12 children with her husband and has61 grandchildren.   With the arrival of Ben Thompson last month, she reached thecentury mark in great-grandchildren.   ``The ones who live here come by to see me all the time,'' Mrs.Thompson said. ``The ones who live out of town I usually see in thesummertime. I love my great-grandchildren as much as my ownchildren.''   ``All the grandkids come to mother for advice and confide in hera lot,'' said Patsy Clayton, one of Mrs. Thompson's daughters.   ``Daddy always talked about throwing a rock in the water andwatching it ripple and ripple. That's how I think about all thegreat-grandchildren.''   A family reunion is planned in July. If Mrs. Thompson is able togo, young Ben Thompson probably won't be the youngest she sees.Great-grandchildren numbers 101, 102, and 103 are on the way.</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: Following item also moving on sports circuits.</NOTE><DATELINE>CHARLEVOIX, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Mount McSauba ski resort says itsproblem wasn't that prices were too high but that they were too low.   ``Downstaters would call, ask our rates, laugh and hang up,''said Ike Boss, recreation director. ``They thought any hill thatonly charged $3.50 for skiing must be a piece of junk.''   So operators doubled the lift ticket price to $7, andout-of-towners have begun using the hill more frequently.   Boss said he had to raise prices after Mount McSauba sufferedlosses for years. But some local skiers said it's now difficult toafford a day on the slopes.   ``If you have a 7-year-old and a 4-year-old, as I do, I have tospend $21, even though my 4-year-old cannot last longer than twohours,'' said Lauri Wilson.</TEXT><DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Organizers of a charity golf tournament wantedto play on a frozen lake, but balmy weather swamped that idea.   The Suburban Rotary Club moved this weekend's Arctic Open to acountry club after temperatures soared into the not-so-Arctic 40sand 50s and melted the course.   A nine-hole course was to be fashioned on Wehrspann Lake, withhundreds of discarded Christmas trees lining the course.   The Rotary club and the tournament co-sponsors, Wendy's fast-foodrestaurants, hope to raise about $20,000 for scholarships forhandicapped students.   One foresome planning to attend consists of politicians moreaccustomed to teeing off on each other than teeing off together:former Mayor Mike Boyle and three mayoral candidates, including CityCouncilman Jim Cleary.   Cleary, who invited the others to join him in a foursome, wasspokesman for a citizens group that recalled Boyle from office twoyears ago.   Boyle has not ruled out another try for the office.</TEXT></DOC>
