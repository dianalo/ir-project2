Bush took Mulroney and his family on a boat ride on a brilliantbut windy morning, touring the rocky coastline up to nearby CapePorpoise.   The breezes that were stirring up whitecaps in the ocean couldmake it even harder for Bush to break his two-week streak of failingto catch a fish despite daily attempts.   The president and the prime minister, old friends holding theirthird tete-a-tete this year, planned an informal mid-afternoonsession with reporters before Mulroney and family take their leavethis evening.   In Canadian parlance, the session was billed as a ``scrum'' _something short of a full news conference at Bush's scenic familycompound overlooking the Atlantic.   Mulroney, wife Mila and their four children arrived by helicopterat Walker's Point Wednesday afternoon.   ``We're going fishing,'' pronouncd a merry Mulroney, who addedwhen asked what he and Bush would talk about, ``Probably fish ...and lobster.''   Bush and wife Barbara later took the Mulroneys down the scenicKennebunk River in the president's speedboat, Fidelity, but theydidn't appear to get in any fishing.   Actually, lobster was one of the few possible bones of contentionfor the two leaders to mull over.   Maine lobstermen are griping that their Canadian counterparts aredepressing prices by catching and exporting lobsters smaller thancan be caught legally in U.S. waters. Maine Gov. John R. McKernanwrote Bush asking him to press Mulroney on the issue.   While White House aides said in advance that the two were likelyto talk about the drug crisis in Colombia and events in Lebanon andPoland.   Bush told a Chamber of Commerce luncheon Wednesday, ``This is apure, total vacation.''   ``I'm not going to look busy in order to convince people inAmerica that it's something other than a vacation,'' said Bush, whoactually has already let far more work intrude on this vacation thanhis predecessor, Ronald Reagan, allowed during his wood-choppingretreats to his Santa Barbara ranch.   Bush approved a $65 million aid package for Colombia last Friday,huddled with top advisers over drug strategy Tuesday, and flies backbriefly to Washington on Friday to meet Japan's new prime minister,Toshiki Kaifu, before a final Labor Day weekend here.   Bush, who has had no success fishing despite daily outings sinceAug. 16, told reporters while jogging that he was taking Mrs. Bushwith him for luck on his next fishing trip. He said he would end thedry spell even if he has to ``murder'' some fish.   In an oceanside speech to the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport Chamber ofCommerce, Bush expressed chagrin at a ``vicious assault on myability'': a graphic in the Portland Press Herald showing a bluefishinside a circle with a line slashing through it indicating no fish.   Bush complained a friend had caught a fish that very day while hewas driving the boat.   ``I think they should knock off that advertisement ... telling methat yet a 13th day I haven't caught one,'' said Bush, who was namedthe resort's outstanding citizen of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
