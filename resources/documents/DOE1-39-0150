Charge distributions of82- to 200-MeV/amu Xe and 105- to 955-MeV/amu U ion beams emerging fromthin solid targets were used to obtain single- and multiple-electronstripping and capture cross sections. The probabilities of strippingelectrons from the K, L, or M shells were calculated using the semiclassicalapproximation and Dirac hydrogenic wave functions. For capture, a simplifiedmodel for electron capture was used. The data generally agree with theory.</TEXT></DOC>
