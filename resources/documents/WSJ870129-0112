Walter B. Kissinger, chairman and chief executive officer, told securities analysts yesterday that the maker of automotive parts expects to post a loss equal to about $1 a share for 1986.    He said fourth-quarter results were hurt by cost overruns, principally in the Wilson Machine division. Results were also &quot;disappointing&quot; in three divisions tied to the heavy-truck and auto markets.    In the fourth quarter of 1985, net income totaled $4.7 million, or 50 cents a share, and for the full year, earnings amounted to $16.7 million, or $1.82 a share.    Saying that the effects of trimming overhead and restoring growth &quot;will take time&quot; to be felt, Mr. Kissinger said that the first quarter, &quot;historically a weak one for Allen, will approach break-even.&quot; However, he said, &quot;We expect a strong earnings turnaround beginning in the second quarter and for the balance of the year.&quot;    Mr. Kissinger, who last March forecast record 1986 earnings, was optimistic yesterday. &quot;Overall, I think 1987 will be a very good year for us.&quot; He said new programs and avoiding last year's problems should help results this year.    He also said directors authorized $15 million for the company to purchase more of its common stock. In the past nine months, Allen Group has purchased 1.1 million of its 8.2 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
