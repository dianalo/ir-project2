The talks were suspended last November with about 90 percent ofthe work completed on a new treaty sharply cutting backocean-spanning bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines.   The negotiations tentatively had been set to resume in February,but President Bush ordered a delay for a reassessment of U.S. armscontrol policy and strategic weaponry.   The review was recently concluded, and Baker on a trip to Moscowtwo weeks ago reached an agreement with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev for a resumption of the negotiations. The precise date inJune was left open until now.   The Soviets had been eager to resume but waited for completionof the review.   Baker has said the U.S. position in the Geneva talks would be topick up where the Reagan administration left off as it sought acutback of 30 percent to 50 percent. But Baker said theadministration also reserved the option to make some changes. Hedid not say what differences might emerge at the bargaining table.   Among the unsettled issues are whether to try to restrict mobileland-based missiles and how to verify reductions in such elusivearms as sea-launched and air-launched cruise missiles.   Max M. Kampelman, who was chief arms-control negotiator in theReagan administration, has said a treaty could be completed withina few months. That is not clear in light of possible new U.S.bargaining positions.   The Soviets also were determined to restrict the U.S. StrategicDefense Initiative, or Star Wars, program that seeks to construct adefense against ballistic missiles.   The strategic weapons are the most potent in the world.   The two superpowers in 1987 concluded a treaty to eliminateanother class of nuclear arms _ intermediate-range missiles thatcan travel from 300 to 3,000 miles. The pact also established asystem of verification that involves Soviet monitors going to U.S.installations and American inspectors operating on Soviet territory.   A third category of nuclear arms _ so-called battlefield ortactical missiles _ has not been subject to negotiations.   The West German government, with support from several NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization allies, have urged the United Statesto negotiate reductions or even total elimination of theground-based missiles with Moscow. But the U.S. position is thatthe missiles should be improved and are essential to the defense ofWestern Europe.   Short-range nuclear weapons have a range of under 300 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
