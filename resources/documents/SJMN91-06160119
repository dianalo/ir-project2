Mark O. Hatfield has survived past ethics scrapes by riding on hisreputation for three decades as a political figure here whose integrity wasabove question.;    But the latest disclosures about the Oregon Republican'sfinancial dealings have shattered any remnants of his reverential image.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Religion andamp; Ethics  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'SAINT MARK' NO LONGEROREGON'S SEN. HATFIELD FACES SERIOUS ETHICSCHARGES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Ethics  </MEMO><TEXT>     Investigations into his ethical conduct have left Hatfield, a deeplyreligious man once dubbed &quot;Saint Mark&quot; for his devotion to principle,struggling to save his reputation.;    Even some of the senator's closestfriends say he has greatly disappointed them, and left them wondering what ledto apparent lapses in judgment. And the controversy swirling around Hatfield,so highly regarded that he already has buildings named for him back home, hasspurred Democrats in the state to position themselves for politicaladvantage.;    A federal grand jury began meeting in Columbia, S.C., this weekto look into ties between Hatfield and James B. Holderman, the formerpresident of the University of South Carolina. The FBI and the Senate EthicsCommittee had already begun examining Hatfield's acceptance of nearly $15,000in airline travel and gifts -- including Steuben glass, an Audubon print and aporcelain statue -- from the university while Holderman was president. Theuniversity also granted a full scholarship to Hatfield's youngest child,Charles, worth about $15,000.;    At the time, the university was seekingapproval for a $16.3 million federal grant from the Appropriations Committeeheaded by Hatfield. In failing to disclose the gifts, which he received from1983 to 1987, Hatfield broke Senate rules. Presumably the grand jury willexamine whether federal laws were violated.;    The findings about Hatfield'sties to Holderman, an old friend who pleaded guilty last week to using hisposition to earn illegal compensation, have focused attention on otherdisclosures, both new and old, about the 68-year-old senator.;    &quot;I've knownthe senator for a long time and I don't think he's a venal man,&quot; said Craig L.Berkman, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party. &quot;But there seems to be apattern of benign neglect. I think there's still a lot of people out there whowant to give the senator the benefit of the doubt. But there's a lot ofhurt.&quot;;    Wayne H. Anderson, chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, saidthe disclosures expose Hatfield as &quot;not the ultra-clean gentleman, the saintthat so many people think he is.&quot;;    While defending Hatfield as &quot;aprincipled man,&quot; Larry Campbell, a Republican who is the speaker of the OregonHouse, conceded that the latest disclosures are &quot;devastating for thesenator.&quot;;    Hatfield, who won election last November to a fifth six-yearterm, has insisted that his behavior was nothing more sinister than technicaloversights.;    Questioned at a public appearance in Oregon last week, hespoke only briefly about the inquiry that is dogging him, and described it as&quot;very unpleasant and perplexing.&quot;;    Seeking to curb the political fallout,the senator announced in April that he would no longer accept gifts, exceptfrom family members or close friends, and would stop taking speaking fees.;   Hatfield has retained as his lawyer John W. Nields Jr., who represented him inan earlier case before the Senate Ethics Committee and was chief counsel tothe House Iran-Contra committee.;    These are among the other allegations:;   (check) Strapped for money after getting entangled in several real estatetransactions, Hatfield and his wife, Antoinette, turned to friends forfinancial help. Among them, former Rep. John R. Dellenback, R-Ore., lentHatfield more than $250,000 and forgave more than $75,000. The late Charles E.Cook, a California industrialist, along with his companies lent Hatfield morethan $73,000 and forgave most of the debt. Both Dellenback and Cook hadinterests in legislation before the Senate.;    (check) The Oregoniannewspaper in Portland reported in March that the Oregon Health SciencesUniversity had devised a special admissions policy that allowed Hatfield'sdaughter, Elizabeth Hatfield Keller, and a few other applicants to be admittedto the school in 1989, leading to the resignation of two admissions panelmembers. Hatfield is the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee,which has doled out millions of dollars in federal grants to the school overthe years.;    (check) Antoinette Hatfield accepted $55,000 in the early 1980sfrom Basil A. Tsakos, a Greek entrepreneur, who received help from the senatorin advancing a plan for a trans-Africa oil pipeline. The senator later donatedthe money to charity, and the Justice Department in 1987 announced that itwould not prosecute him. The Senate Ethics Committee also dropped the case.;   Since Hatfield was re-elected last November, the issue is primarily one ofhanging on to his reputation. In a race that was closer than many hadexpected, Hatfield was re-elected with 53 percent of the vote after asurprisingly strong Democratic challenge from Harry Lonsdale, a wealthybusiness executive who was seeking public office for the first time.;    SomeRepublicans fear that Sen. Bob Packwood, a Republican, could feel the residualdamage in his re-election bid next year.;    He is being challenged by Rep.Les AuCoin, a nine-term Democrat, and possibly by Lonsdale, who said &quot;allcareer politicians,&quot; including AuCoin, will be damaged by Hatfield's troubles.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD L.
