Application of generalizedfunctions for recording of differential operators in integral form convenientfor construction of conjugate equations is described. Four known determinationsof conjugate operator are compared and simple scheme for derivation ofconjugate equations on the basis of integral representation of directequations is obtained. The scheme suggested is compared with a classicalone using as an example nonstationary diffusion equation. It is shownthat the core of integral representation and the Green function of directequation turn out to be possible to interpret in terms of importancefunction relative to neutron flux density phi. Hence it follows thatthe same functions determine importance distribution as to functionalsof phi. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
