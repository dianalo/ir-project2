Final language of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -- orStart agreement -- remains to be worked out by negotiatorsmeeting in Geneva. But the two leaders said yesterday thatthey bridged enough of their substantive disagreements toallow them to call the treaty resolved and to announce thatthey will hold another superpower summit in Moscow late thismonth. Both sides had insisted that the Start agreement beready for signing at the next U.S.-U.S.S.R. summit, nowscheduled for July 30 and 31 in Moscow.</LP><TEXT>   If approved by the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Soviet, thetreaty will be the first ever to compel real reductions insuperpower strategic nuclear arsenals. It will force the U.S.and the Soviet Union to cut the arsenals of intercontinentalweapons they specifically designed to inflict enormous damageon each other, particularly the Soviets' big arsenal of heavyballistic missiles.   Mr. Bush expressed hope that the treaty would &quot;sailthrough the Senate.&quot; And he expressed gratitude that theconclusion of the treaty cleared the way for his meeting inMoscow, where he said the two sides will take up armscontrol, human rights, and such &quot;transnational problems&quot; asdrugs. Other officials said the two will devote substantialtime to talks on &quot;regional issues&quot; such as Cuba, Iraq and theMiddle East, Angola, and Afghanistan. They will also furtherdiscuss the Soviets' economic reform efforts.   The final strategic arms treaty is going to disappointsome analysts, though, and is sure to attract criticism fromconservatives skeptical of the arms-control process. In theend, Start will cut U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals byroughly 30%, not the 50% cut promised by the Reaganadministration when the process was launched. And someconservatives are sure to argue that the treaty is impossibleto verify and gives the Soviets too many loopholes to developnew missiles and work outside the treaty.   But the administration and Start supporters will point tothe fact that the treaty requires deeper cuts in Sovietwarheads. The Arms Control Association, an independentresearch organization, estimates that the Soviets will end upcutting their strategic nuclear arsenal by about 35%, toroughly 7,000 weapons from 11,000, while the U.S. will cutits by about 25%, to 9,000 from 12,000.   More important, the administration will argue, the Sovietswill have to cut significantly the warheads they keep atoptheir big land-based ballistic missiles, the weapons mostthreatening to the U.S. The treaty will limit both the U.S.and the Soviet Union to 4,900 of those warheads. Because moreof the Soviet strategic nuclear force consists of land-basedballistic missiles, rather than the weapons carried onsubmarines and bombers that the U.S. uses more extensively,the Soviets will have to make relatively deeper cuts in suchmissile warheads.   In addition, treaty backers will argue that the treatyshould be signed because the U.S., through decisions made byCongress as the defense budget is reduced, already iseffectively following the terms of the treaty without havingforced the Soviets to sign onto those terms.   For their part, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev wereunambiguous about their delight in having forged theagreement, with Mr. Bush calling it an historic day for thetwo countries after nearly a decade of negotiations. In aseparate news conference, Mr. Gorbachev called it &quot;one of themost important meetings of our time&quot; and said &quot;it is evidencethat in the world, despite difficulties and dangers, changesare taking place that bring about results that wouldn't havebeen possible a few years ago.&quot;   The two sides had seemed close to agreement last weekendafter intensive negotiations in Washington between the U.S.Secretary of State James Baker and his Soviet counterpart,Alexander Bessmertnykh. But after four days of talks, thosetwo men said they were unable to agree on a final, technicalissue, and they adjourned to meet their respective leaders enroute to the economic meeting being held here. Mr. Baker andMr. Bush specifically denied that they were saving an issueso the two presidents could be seen to close out the dealthemselves in London. &quot;This wasn't a stacked deck,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid.   But the economic summit of the world's richest industrialnations, which Mr. Gorbachev was invited to address for thefirst time, provided a world forum for their announcement.   The final issue hashed out between the U.S. and the SovietUnion was the question of &quot;throw-weight,&quot; or the size of thepayload each intercontinental missile carries, and howthrow-weight will be used to determine when either side hadfielded a new missile.   The U.S. insisted that any new missile have asubstantially different throw-weight than current missiles.That position was intended to prevent the Soviets from makingonly slight and inexpensive modifications to current missilesthat would enable them to carry more warheads. The Sovietspushed for allowing a smaller throw-weight change in newmissiles, perhaps because they want to be able to make smallmodifications to their single-warhead SS-25 missile to allowit to carry more warheads.   U.S. officials won't say precisely how the dispute wasresolved until negotiators in Geneva have worked out treatylanguage. The officials said only that the Soviet ForeignMinister, Mr. Bessmertnykh, contacted Mr. Baker earlyyesterday morning, asking to meet in advance of a scheduledlunch between President Bush and President Gorbachev.   After conferring with Mr. Bessmertnykh, Mr. Baker rejoinedPresident Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroftto review the latest Soviet proposal. And it was decided thatpending a final discussion between the two presidents, thatthe U.S. would accept the proposal. President Bush and Mr.Gorbachev later met and concluded the final agreement, andMr. Bush said the agreement followed a last-minute phone callto his arms control experts in Geneva for a review of thelanguage.   Overall, the precise number of strategic nuclear warheadseach country will retain under Start isn't clear. The treatylimits each side to 6,000 &quot;accountable&quot; warheads. Butbomber-carried weapons won't be fully counted, andsea-launched cruise missiles aren't included, so the numberof warheads each country maintains will be considerablyhigher.   Also, the total will be affected by decisions the twocountries make about whether to go ahead with some weaponsprograms allowed under the pact. For instance, the totalnumber of U.S. warheads would drop by about 1,000 if Congressdecides to hold deployment of the new B-2 Stealth bomber to15 planes, as the House of Representatives has suggested,rather than building the 75 planes the Bush administrationwants.
