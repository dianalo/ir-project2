The DOC announced itsinitiation of an investigation, and solicited public comments in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 4, 1987. On July 15, 1988, Secretary Verity submitted his investigation report tothe President. The investigation found that, at the present time, the domesticbearing industry would be able to meet most but not all national securityrequirements in the event of a major conventional war. The Secretary recommendedthat the President defer making a finding pending a supplemental Commerce/DefenseDepartment analysis of the impact of various ongoing Administration initiativeson the industry's ability to meet national security requirements. On August5, 1988, the President accepted Secretary Verity's recommendation and directedCommerce and Defense to prepare the supplemental analysis. On November 16, 1988, Secretary Verity submitted this supplemental analysiswhich concluded that improvements in economic conditions for the industry,in conjunction with the likely impact of other Administration initiatives,should be sufficient to bring the industry into an acceptable posture fornational security purposes. Based on this analysis, the Secretary recommendedthat the President determine that imports of anti-friction bearings donot threaten to impair the national security. On November 28, 1988, the White House announced that the President haddetermined that no action is necessary to adjust imports of anti-frictionbearings under authority of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,as amended. Both the Executive Summary of Commerce's July 15, 1988, section 232 reportand the complete text of the November 16, 1988, supplemental Commerce/Defensereport are reproduced below. A declassified version of the July 15 reportwill be available for public review and duplication in the Bureau of ExportAdministration's Office of Security and Management Support, Room 4886,U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, (202) 377-2593. <ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary </ITAG>Background On July 17, 1987, the Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers Association (AFBMA)petitioned the Department of Commerce (DOC) to conduct an investigationunder section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determinethe effect of imports of ball and roller bearings on the national security.Under this statute, the President has authority to adjust imports basedon recommendations from the Secretary of Commerce. DOC has one year inwhich to complete its investigation and forward its report to the President.In its petition, the AFBMA asserted that ``the domestic bearings industryis in a state of serious decline * * * (and unless action is taken) thedomestic industry's ability to supply military and related commercial needsis seriously endangered.'' The petitioner requested that quotas be established ranging from 0 percentto 34 percent of the U.S. market for the various bearing product categories.By statute, DOC must report findings and recommendations to the Presidentby July 17, 1988. The Significance of Bearings to Defense Manufacturing Antifriction bearings are essential in any metal product with moving parts,and therefore are necessary for manufacturing defense products as mundaneas motor vehicles and as sophisticated as high accuracy gyroscopes formissile guidance systems. Direct and indirect military consumption of bearingsaccount for about one-fifth of U.S. apparent consumption. For example,the KC-10 refueling aircraft uses an estimated 6000 bearings; the C-17transport plane uses about 10,000 bearings and the average helicopter usesabout 2500 bearings in its transmissions, gear boxes and rotor linkages.Accordingly, the Department considers a viable domestic bearings industryas a key element of the defense manufacturing base. Methodology for the Investigation The methodology for this investigation is based on a two-step process.<ITAG tagnum="81">Step I </ITAG>Compare total available supply of each product with anticipated demandduring a specified national security emergency_a one year mobilizationperiod followed by one year of a major conventional conflict. Supply is the sum of the following elements: _Domestic mobilization capacity (developed from responses to our industrysurvey); _Importer and domestic inventories (also from industry survey); and _Reliable imports (embodied in the model of the 1984 NSC Stockpile Study).Demand for each product is determined through an input/output analysisof end-use product requirements in the 1984 NSC Stockpile Study. (Thisapproach was approved by the NSC, DOD and FEMA.) <ITAG tagnum="81">Step II </ITAG>In categories where a supply shortfall is found, determine whether importshave been a significant cause of the industry's inability to meet nationalsecurity requirements. In addition to this snapshot supply/demand review, the Department alsoanalyzed current and prospective market trends to evaluate the industry'sability to meet national security requirements in the future. Significant Industry Trends Domestic shipments (in constant 1987 dollars) have declined from a highof $4.6 billion in 1979 to $3 billion in 1987.Employment has declined from a high of 58,300 workers in 1979 to 43,000workers in 1987. Profitability (net before taxes) has declined from a high of 9.3 percentin 1980 to 3.8 percent in 1986 (last year for which data is available).Since the late 1970s about 30 plants accounting for over $1 billion inproduction capacity have closed. About half of the 31 domestic producers surveyed by DOC for this investigationdepend on imported steel to varying degrees to manufacture finished bearings.Nine companies who import bearings quality steel do so because of a lackof domestic availability. Further, many domestic bearing manufacturersdepend on imports of bearing components for their finished products. Therefore,the U.S. is more dependent on foreign sources to manufacture bearings thantrade data indicate.Import penetration varies significantly depending on the bearing category.In some product categories, U.S. manufacturers still control the domesticmarket. However, in other product lines foreign manufacturers dominatethe market while import penetration is increasing and domestic shipmentsand production capabilities are declining. DOD industry experts project that imports are likely to gain increasedshares of the U.S. market_the large European and Japanese internationalbearing corporations have consolidated their hold on home markets, andhave increasingly turned their attention to the United States.

In five of the seven categories, it was determined thatimports do not threaten to impair the national security at the presenttime: <T3>Integral shaft bearings: </T3>In 1987, imports accounted for about33 percent of the units but only 6 percent of the value of U.S. consumption.It was therefore determined that imports are not a significant factor relatingto the industry's inability to meet national security requirements. <T3>Regular cylindrical roller bearings: </T3>The Department's survey ofbearing manufacturers identified adequate surplus production capacity ofsuperprecision cylindrical roller bearings to cover projected shortfallsin the regular precision category. <T3>Needle roller bearings: </T3>In 1987, imports accounted for less than10 percent of the units and value of U.S. consumption. It was thereforedetermined that imports do not have a significant impact on the industry'sinability to meet national security requirements. <T3>Other roller bearings: </T3>Imports accounted for about half of U.S.consumption in the `catch all' basket for roller bearings that are notclassified under one of the other categories. However, mounted roller bearingsaccount for nearly 70 percent of this category and many of these are taperedroller and spherical bearings with cast or forged mountings attached. Thereis excess production capacity to manufacture tapered roller and sphericalbearings that could be used to eliminate the projected shortfall in thiscategory. <T3>Regular ball bearings over 100mm</T3>: The Department's survey of bearingmanufacturers identified adequate surplus production capacity of superprecisionball bearings over 100mm to cover the projected shortfall in the regularprecision category.The Department's analysis indicates that shortfalls which can be attributedto high levels of import penetration exist in two of the fifteen bearingcategories under review.Regular Precision Ball Bearings Under 30mmA shortfall of $71 million (1982 dollars) is projected for the mobilizationyear and a $40 million shortfall during the war year. Surplus superprecisionproduction capacity would reduce but not eliminate these shortfalls. Thiscategory accounted for 12 percent of the volume and 3 percent of the valueof U.S. consumption in 1987.In 1987, imports accounted for 58 percent of the value and 78 percent ofthe volume of domestic consumption. From 1982-87, U.S. shipments fell 22percent by value and 17 percent by volume. During the same period, importsrose 41 percent by value and 79 percent by volume. Major import sourcesare Japan, Thailand and Singapore (imports from the latter two countriesentirely reflect activity by Japan's Minebea). From 1984-87, half of theU.S. firms producing these bearings discontinued production leaving fiveremaining companies (three of which are foreign-owned).Regular Precision Bearings 30-100mmA shortfall of $174 million is projected for the mobilization year followedby a shortfall of $129 million in the war year. Surplus superprecisionproduction capacity would reduce but not eliminate these shortfalls. Thiscategory accounted for 13 percent of the volume and 9 percent of the valueof U.S. consumption in 1987.In 1987, imports accounted for 43 percent of the value and 61 percent ofthe volume of domestic consumption. From 1982-87, U.S. shipments fell 8percent by value and rose 1 percent by volume. During this period, importsrose 38 percent by value and 50 percent by volume. Major import sourcesare Japan, Canada, Italy and West Germany. Defense uses are pervasive andrange from ground transportation to ordnance equipment.Key USG Actions Affecting BearingsBefore reaching a decision regarding a national security threat posed byimports, it is important to consider what steps the Government has andis taking to address the industry's problems.DOD currently has in place a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requiringdomestic procurement of ball bearings under 30mm used in military products.DOD has published draft regulations to expand the existing FAR to coverall bearings used military products. DOD is also undertaking a number ofother initiatives to help improve the industry's production base and abilityto meet national security requirements.FindingsThe Department's investigation finds that, at the present time, the domesticbearings industry would be able to meet most but not all national securityrequirements in the event of a major conventional war. Further, importscontinue to pose significant challenges to domestic manufacturers in anumber of product lines which could lead to the further erosion of domesticproduction capabilities. The Administration is currently taking a numberof steps to improve the bearing industry's production capabilities includingthe DOD draft Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that will require domesticprocurement of all defense related bearings.RecommendationsThe Secretary of Commerce recommends that the President defer making afinding in this investigation or taking any action under section 232 untilthe effect of these initiatives on the bearing industry's ability to meetnational security requirements has been evaluated by the Departments ofCommerce and Defense.<ITAG tagnum="26">The President, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>The White House, Washington, DC 20520.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dear Mr. President: On July 15, 1988, I forwarded to you the Departmentof Commerce's study on the Effect of Anti-friction Bearing Imports on theNational Security conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Actof 1962, as amended. Our investigation determined that the domestic bearingindustry would be able to meet most but not all national security requirementsin the event of a major conventional war. Further, we concluded that importscontinued to pose significant challenges to domestic manufacturers in anumber of product lines which could lead to the further erosion of domesticproduction capabilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding these concerns, I recommend that you defer a finaldecision in this case because the Administration is currently undertakinga number of initiatives designed to improve the bearing industry's abilityto meet national security requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specifically, the Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a BearingsAction Plan that requires domestic procurement of certain defense-relatedbearings (via a DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) and includesa number of other actions designed to improve the bearing industry's competitivenessand ability to meet defense requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After considering our report and recommendations, you decided to defera final decision in the Section 232 investigation pending receipt of aDepartment of Commerce/DOD evaluation of the effects of the Administration'sefforts in support of the bearing industry. The main points of my analysisare as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; In the event of a global conventional war, the domestic industrywould be able to meet most national security requirements. Domestic bearingmanufacturers would be unable to meet national security needs only in tworegular precision product lines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Even in the event of such a major military conflict, thedomestic industry would be able to meet all superprecision bearing requirements,which are the most critical elements for the production of advanced weaponsystems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement shouldprovide the domestic industry with an assured market for defense relatedproducts. Furthermore, the other elements in the Bearings Action Plan (forexample, the planned research center for bearing manufacturing technology,and the bearing refurbishment program to transfer refurbishment work fromDOD facilities to domestic bearing companies) should provide the U.S. bearingindustry with additional market opportunities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Finally, since our initial Section 232 analysis, the U.S.industry has benefitted from an increase in demand for bearings and isnow operating at very high capacity utilization rates. Further, there hasbeen an increase in new and expanded plant investment by domestic- andforeign-owned companies in the United States, which should result in anincrease in U.S. capability to produce bearings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although the issue of antidumping/countervailing duty investigationscannot be regarded as a factor for consideration in the Section 232 investigation,it is useful to discuss the investigations in light of current bearingindustry issues. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On October 28, 1988, the Department of Commerce issued its preliminaryantidumping investigation's determinations on bearing imports from ninecountries, with dumping margins generally in the range of 20-80 percent.The final antidumping determinations will be issued no earlier than January1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have enclosed a short paper which describes the industry's status,Administration programs and preliminary antidumping determinations in moredetail. I have also enclosed a letter from the DOD outlining the statusof Bearings Action Plan programs. Based on our analysis, I recommend thatyou determine that imports of antifriction bearings do not threaten toimpair the national security.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">   Sincerely, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Bill Verity, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Commerce.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION_BEARINGS SECTION 232 SUPPLEMENTARY PAPER</ITAG>IndustryStatusThe current demand for bearings in the United States is at its highestpoint in many years as major bearing-consuming industries, such as automobiles,aerospace and off-road equipment are experiencing significant sales increases.The U.S. bearing industry has benefitted from the substantial increasein domestic demand and has been operating at close to 100 percent of itscapacity for the last six months in almost every bearing category examinedunder the Section 232 investigation. In fact, for some bearing categories,the U.S. industry has been operating at full capacity for over a year.As a result of the high capacity utilization rates, lead times for neworders are longer than last year in nearly every category. This has contributedto price increases, which reportedly have reached as much as 30 percentin some categories. Moreover, further price increases can be expected asthe pressure on plant capacity continues.These indicators of the health of the U.S. bearings industry all pointto a general upturn in business opportunities. It is likely that theseopportunities will result in a more competitive U.S. bearings industry,which will enhance its capability to produce bearings to meet nationalsecurity requirements in an emergency.InvestmentThe United States has recently attracted significant investment in thebearing industry. The underlying reasons for this new investment leaveus optimistic about the industry's future competitiveness. Not only havesome production costs (labor and material) in the United States fallenbelow our European and Japanese competitors, but major bearing consuming-industriesappear to be making a comeback, after years of poor performance. Largecost savings and improved quality in bearing production can now be achievedby investing in the latest process technologies.Currently, more investment is taking place in the U.S. bearing sector thanin any other world bearing sector. Much of this investment has come fromseveral of the large foreign bearing multinationals. Several of these firmshave announced that they intend to invest large sums of money for expansionof existing U.S. facilities and for the construction of new plants.Some examples of this investment include the following: Koyo Seiko of Japanhas allocated $60-70 million for the next three years to expand its SouthCarolina plant to produce tapered roller bearings and to increase ballbearing capacity. NSK of Japan plans to spend $50 million to expand itsMichigan and Iowa ball bearing facilities over the next two years. SKFof Sweden has announced a $35 million expansion of its Georgia plant toproduce standard ball bearings, and is spending additional millions upgradingits bearing plants in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and New York. FAG of Germanyis dramatically expanding its Missouri factory, and NTN of Japan has nearlycompleted the expansion of one of its Illinois plants. Further, two newforeign entries to the American market, Georg Muller of Germany, and Nachi-Fujikoshiof Japan, have each announced new ball bearing plant constructions in Illinoisand Michigan.Many domestic firms are also investing heavily and some companies are increasingtheir investment plans. MPB, one of the country's finest producers of superprecisionbearings, has announced a five-year $40 million investment plan. Timkenis expanding its North Carolina tapered roller bearings facility and isplanning other expansions. Federal-Mongul is nearing completion of itsnew $65 million ball bearing plant in Pennsylvania.The new investment and plant expansion examples mentioned above are a healthyindication of the improving strength of the U.S. market for bearings. Suchan expansion of capacity in the United States to produce bearings shouldclearly boost our domestic capability to produce bearings for nationalsecurity needs during a mobilization.Bearings Action Plan ProgramsThe Federal DOD Aquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) on all DefenseDepartment procurements of antifriction bearings was established in August1988 for a three to five year period. The DFARS could provide an estimated$40-50 million in additional revenue opportunities to domestic suppliersof defense-related bearings. It should also reverse the increase in defense-relatedbearings imports which would otherwise have occurred. The DFARS coversall ball bearings 30mm and above and all roller bearings. This new DFARScomplements the 1971 DFARS on miniature and instrument bearings (30mm andbelow).In addition to the DFARS, the Bearings Action Plan contains other programswhich should have an impact on the competitiveness of the U.S. bearingsindustry. For example, the Department of Defense has a project underwayto establish a Research Center on Bearings Manufacturing Process Technology.The Center will be operated by a coalition of universities and privateorganizations, with significant DOD funding requested. The objective ofthe center will be to focus on production technology for ball and rollerbearings, with a goal of decreased reliance on foreign sources for defense-relatedbearings.The Defense Department is also involved in transferring some of the bearingrefurbishment work it now performs in-house to private industry, especiallywhere the refurbishment involves complicated processing. This should provideindustry with additional defense-related business to maintain and expandcapacity.The Defense Industrial Supply Center recently held a special conferencein Philadelphia on aircraft engine bearings, which brought together customersand suppliers to discuss mutual concerns. The approach was beneficial forboth parties, and DOD intends to continue this dialogue in future conferenceswith the bearings industry.The last area of interest with DOD programs is the enhanced effort to identifyand prosecute manufacturers or suppliers involved in potential fraudulentactivities with the Defense Department. Currently, the Defense CriminalInvestigative Service is investigating alleged wrongdoing by two suppliersof bearings. Through this kind of effort, the sales of legitimate bearingsuppliers will be enhanced if the accused parties are found guilty anddebarred from further DOD procurement. The DOD bearings initiatives should help U.S. bearing producers to boosttheir competitive position with respect to the defense-related bearingsbusiness. Clearly, these programs are focused on the defense-critical areaof bearings production, which has been the focus of our 232 investigation.We anticipate an overall increase in U.S. capabilities in this area. Antidumping/Countervailing Duty Investigations Although this issue cannot be regarded as a factor for consideration inthe section 232 investigation, it is useful to discuss the antidumping/countervailingduty investigations in light of current bearing industry issues. On August 30, 1988, the Commerce Department issued its preliminary determinationsof subsidies in the countervailing duty investigations on bearing importsfrom Thailand and Singapore. The preliminary net subsidy rates were 17.83percent for Thailand and 4.95 percent for Singapore. On October 28, 1988, Commerce issued its preliminary determinations thatimports of antifriction bearings from West Germany, France, Italy, Japan,Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom are being soldin the United States at less than fair value. The estimated dumping marginsrange from .48 percent to 225.88 percent, with most of the margins fallingin the 20 percent to 80 percent range. The Department will make its final antidumping and countervailing dutydeterminations no earlier than January 10, 1989. To the extent that itfinds that bearings are not being fairly-traded in the United States andthe International Trade Commission finds that bearings imports are causinginjury to the domestic industry, the Department will impose antidumping/countervailingduties based upon the final dumping margins/net subsidy rates. Conclusion Since our initial section 232 analysis was completed, the U.S. industryhas benefitted from an increase in demand for bearings and is now operatingat very high capacity utilization rates. Further, there has been an increasein new and expanded plant investment by U.S. and foreign companies, resultingin an increase in U.S. capability to produce bearings. The recent implementation of a DFARS on bearings should provide the domesticindustry with an assured market for defense-related products. Furthermore,the other elements in the DOD Bearings Action Plan should help the U.S.bearing industry improve its competitiveness. We therefore conclude that the competitiveness of the U.S. bearing industryhas improved since the DOC's July 1988 report. We further conclude thatthe trends and programs cited above should lead to further improvementsin the industry's competitiveness and in its ability to meet national securityrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="26">Mr. John A.
