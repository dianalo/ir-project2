Secretary of State James A. Baker III broached the proposal in a45-minute meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and alsotold him the situation in the occupied territories was``untenable,'' a senior U.S. official said afterward.   While the atmosphere was relaxed, Baker told Arens withoutgetting into specifics that a calmer environment was essential ``tocreate conditions that will allow for direct talks,'' said theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``We certainly want to reduce tension,'' Arens told reportersafter meeting with Baker. But, Arens added: ``It's not easy to dothat considering the violence in the area at the present time.''   However, the visiting Israeli official also commented: ``I thinkwe will find common ground on how to do this.''   Arens then met with President Bush at the White House for ahalf-hour and also with Vice President Dan Quayle.   ``We didn't arrive at any finalized or defined positions,'' Arenssaid afterward. ``I think it is probably premature to expect that atthis point.''   While the day's meetings evidently went smoothly, Arens raisedquestions about the talks the United States is having with thePalestine Liberation Organization.   The foreign minister told Israeli reporters he had informed Bushthe dialogue would not contribute to the peace process because thePLO remains engaged in three levels of terrorism _ against Israelisin southern Lebanon, by calling for violence in the territories andagainst Palestinians who disagree with Yasser Arafat's organization.   Meanwhile, Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said in astatement that the administration was seeking ``new ideas'' toadvance the peace process.   ``President Bush emphasized that the United States does not wantto miss an opportunity for peace in the Middle East and stillbelieves in direct talks as the best path to peace,'' Fitzwater said.   Baker described the actions he urged on Arens as ``variousreinforcing and reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse thetension there.'' He was not specific. But even before Arens arrived,published reports said they included release of Palestinianprisoners and a general easing of Israeli control.   Next week, Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia,is expected to ask the Palestine Liberation Organization to blockguerrillas from trying to infiltrate Israel.   The parallel appeals to Israel and the PLO seem designed to bringthe two sides together eventually. The Israeli government refuses todeal with an organization it accuses of continuing terrorism, whilea PLO aide said Sunday in New York the U.S. approach was unbalancedand outdated.   Nabil Shaath, who was granted a visa by the administration toattend a conference at Columbia University, said ``we are the onlyoccupied people in the world who are being asked to refrain from anyexpression against the occupation. That's ridiculous.''   Baker said he had ``a productive exchange of views'' with Arensat the State Department. Returning the kind words, Arens said theirtalk ``contributed to building a basis of understanding between us.''   At the same time, Baker stressed any settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict must ``address the legitimate political rightsof the Palestinian people.''   The PLO, which asserts the right to speak for all PalestinianArabs, is demanding a state carved out of territory now controlledby Israel.   For 15 months, Palestinian Arabs have waged a campaign againstIsraeli authority on the West Bank and in Gaza. The lands werecaptured by Israel in its lightning victory over Jordan and Egypt inthe 1967 Six-Day war.   Baker reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's security andsaid ``we can and must find a way to move ahead'' toward an overallsettlement.   Despite pressures from Arab and West European governments, theBush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan forMideast peace talks.   ``It's just basically common sense that before you do anythingthat you could consider an initiative, you've got to change theconditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation,'' aU.S. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Sunday.   Bush has said he would not be rushed by a Soviet diplomaticinitiative in the Middle East into offering wide-ranging new peaceinitiatives in his talks with Middle East leaders. Arens will befollowed here by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Husseinof Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.   Bush has kept open the U.S. dialogue with the PLO that began lastDecember despite a series of attacks by PLO guerrillas on Israelisecurity positions across the border in southern Lebanon.   U.S. and Israeli officials seem content to use Arens' visit tobuy time before moving more heavily into the complex problems ofMideast peacemaking.   Arens, who is making his first trip to the United States asforeign minister, said there was ``a solid foundation offriendship'' between his country and the United States.   Both Arens and Baker described the two countries as allies.</TEXT></DOC>
