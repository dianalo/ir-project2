Houston-based Shell Oil Co., an oil and natural gas producer, said two of its subsidiaries yesterday filed a challenge to the commission's new order in federal appeals court in New Orleans. Shell is the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group. A second challenge was filed by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America in federal appeals court here, where the issue has been litigated for more than two years. The association is the leading pipeline trade group.    The lawsuits follow a commission order over the weekend revising the natural gas rule, which is designed to reshape pipeline-producer relationships. The panel also delayed the impact of a much-disputed part of the rule until Jan. 1.    The revisions came despite repeated statements in recent weeks from commission Chairwoman Martha Hesse that the commissioners expected to stick by the order. &quot;The commission blinked in the face of pressure from the (gas) producers,&quot; complained a pipeline official.    The prior commission rule, which went into effect Sept. 15, required a producer to give a pipeline credits for any gas it transports for sale by the producer directly to a third party. The credits can be used to reduce the pipeline's obligation to pay for gas it has ordered from that producer but cannot sell. And the rule said a pipeline can refuse to transport gas for a given well unless all royalty interests in the well sign affidavits agreeing to grant the credits.    Producers have claimed this amounts to contract abrogation, because the credits can be used against any contract between the producer and the pipeline, despite the fact that gas prices vary.    Attempting to allay producer concerns, the commission has now revised the rule to require pipelines to ship gas if only 85% of the royalty interests sign affidavits; it removed language saying that the affidavits are &quot;irrevocable&quot;; and it delayed the impact of the rule on existing contracts to Jan. 1 from Nov. 1.    The rule has been the subject of outspoken opposition from almost all segments of the industry. It has been revised and delayed repeatedly since the first version was issued in October 1985. But initial reactions from producer and pipeline trade groups indicated that neither was mollified by the changes.    &quot;If anything, it's only made it worse,&quot; said Robert Platt, an attorney for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil producers. </TEXT></DOC>
