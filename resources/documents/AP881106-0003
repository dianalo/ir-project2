Jean-Claude Paul, the forciblyretired commander of Haiti's most feared army unit who was indictedon U.S. drug charges, died Sunday under suspicious circumstances, afamily friend said. He was 49.   Radio Haiti-Inter said Paul, a 29-year army veteran and one ofHaiti's most powerful figures, died of a heart attack at about 3p.m. in his home in suburban Fermathe. The independent station gaveno other details.   A family friend said there was speculation Paul was poisoned,possibly prior to having a heart attack.   The friend, who would not be identified further, said Paul'shousemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to Petionville policestation for questioning about the colonel's death.   Paul's former wife, Mireille Delinois, was taken to the stationSunday night and was under police protection because of fear ofreprisals by Paul's relatives, the friend said.   The military government's spokesman, Frantz Lubin, said he had noinformation on Paul's death. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clydealso said she had nothing. The capital, Port-au-Prince, appearedcalm.   Paul was fired Sept. 30 after a coup led by noncommissionedofficers ousted Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,replacing him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.   The coup leaders said they were outraged with the state-sponsoredmurder and corruption Namphy tolerated.   Paul had commanded the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, the mostbrutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, and had been linked to theTonton Macoutes, the hated private army of the 29-year Duvalierfamily dictatorship.   Soldiers under Paul's command have been blamed for widespreadviolence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promisedafter a popular uprising drove Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile inFebruary 1986.   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced thecancellation of independently run general elections last November,leaving at least 34 people dead.   Paul had been considered one of the most powerful members of thearmy, which has run this impoverished Caribbean nation for most ofits 144 years.   In March, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami oncharges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.   Soldiers who staged the Sept. 17 rebellion that ousted Namphysaid they wanted to name Paul the army chief but decided not tobecause of the drug charges.   Immediately after the coup, Paul appeared to be allied withAvril, but the new leader reportedly became concerned that Paulmight turn against him. Avril had already ousted about 60 of thearmy's most repressive commanders.   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said Paul's retirement couldhelp lead to the renewal of a $70 million annual aid package theUnited States cut off after the November 1987 election massacre. Oneof the conditions the Reagan administration has set for renewing aidis that Haiti cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through Haitiinto the United States.   The drug trafficking indictment alleges Paul conspired to import220 pounds of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. Itsays the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 milesoutside Port-au-Prince to load and fly the shipment to the Bahamas.   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army wholater defected, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob Graham,D-Fla. in a special U.S. Senate hearing that 70 percent of Paul'stroops were involved in drug trafficking.   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when Jean-ClaudeDuvalier fled into exile in France.   An attempt to dismiss Paul in June failed and led to the fall ofthe civilian government of Leslie F. Manigat, who won military-runpresidential elections in January.   Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrative post, but Paulrefused and was backed by Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat on June 20,accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul remained head ofhis battalion.   Paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew Namphy inSeptember.   The soldiers who formed Haiti's new government have said theywant to end random, state-sponsored violence and institutedemocratic reforms, but the government has set no dates forelections.</TEXT></DOC>
