A kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housingproject where the bullet-riddled body of a 34-year-old mother wasdiscovered before dawn. A squad car screamed by, blue lightspulsing. The owner of a furniture store that had been looted in lastJanuary's riots waited at the door for customers. He was armed.   Inside a small concrete-block building set apart from the DrewElementary School, students in blue and white uniforms were toldtheir future is not necessarily foreshadowed by eveside of the chain-link fence.   ``We let them know there are alternatives to drugs, to poverty,to crime,'nts on the other' said Drew Principal Frederick Morley. ``Theway out iseducation, literacy and skills. I think they're listening.''   The success of educators like Morley is vital not only to thepeople of Liberty City but to the nation as a whole.   As labor shortages arise, companies are hiring people fromdisadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity, not philanthropy. At thesame time, the knowledge-based economy demands more sophisticatedskills than ever.   Morley and otherose round, white faceand shaggy mustache seems more suited to an Irish pub than a ghettostreetcorner.   ``I'm just trying to provide the tools _ the education _ to movein the right direction,'' said Mann, a University of Miami professorwho founded the Entrepreneurial Institute in response to LibertyCity riots in 1982.   The $15, five-week courses include accounting, internationalbusiness and business computer software. About two-thirds of the2,500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black.   ``There's an amazing resilience in the human species. The bodyand mind only lets you go so far into destitution, then the sense ofsurvival takes over,'' Mann said. ``That's what we're hoping to tapinto _ that sense that the black community will claw back againstthe odds.''   Education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstreamin Miami. Among other things, they face discrimination from whiteand Hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric inblack communities.   ``Listen, I'll hire anyone, but it seems the ones who can _ andwant to _ work are the Haitians and the Latins,'' said CharlesGenthner, president of Fire Hose Corp., which makes fire hoses in a1-year-old Liberty City plant.   ``There has to be the idea that getting into the work force isthe best option,'' said John Cordrey, an economist at the BeaconCouncil, a tax-supported Miami area business group.   ``In my opinion, the blacks have made the Hispanics a scapegoat.They see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs,''said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami professor studying localimmigration. ``What is really plaguing the black community here is abreakdown in the family.''   ``Identifying the problem is easy. Turning it around isdifficult.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 25</NOTE></DOC>
