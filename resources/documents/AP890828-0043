Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has promised democraticreforms and set an election for Feb. 25, 1990, in accordance with anagreement signed by Central American presidents on Aug. 7 in Tela,Honduras.   The accord also called for disbanding the Nicaraguan Resistancearmy by Dec. 8, with a United Nations team to observe the process.   ``By the time the U.N. gets here, we'll be gone,'' said``Commander Henry,'' head of the rebel medical corps.   Most of the army fighting to oust the Sandinista government hasbeen camped in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border since U.S.military aid was suspended a year-and-half ago.   The isolated camps are strung out along the narrow Yamales Rivervalley 30 miles from the nearest paved road. Weakened by desertionsand shortages of supplies and medicine, the army has by and largeretained its integrity and spirit.   ``We have too few bullets and too much morale,'' said Galeano.   He and other field commanders say an intact fighting force willpressure the Sandinistas into fulfilling their democratic promisesto a war-weary nation.   ``What can the U.N. do if Ortega cheats?'' asked one soldier, whohad taken the battle name ``Danilo.'' ``Look what happened inPanama,'' where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega retains his grip onpower despite U.S. and other international opposition.   Battle-hardened commanders express contempt for ``politicians''of the Nicaraguan Directorate in Miami.   ``We've kicked out the desk soldiers. They lost touch with thefighters,'' said ``Commander Dimas,'' one of a group of young fieldcommanders who now make up the general staff.   U.S. officials say they fear that Contras who return to Nicaraguawill be wiped out by the vastly larger Sandinista army, and Contracommanders said they had been asked to wait at least until Dec. 8before making a move.   ``The gringos think everything in Central America runs on theirmoney. They think that without their money and their supplies we'lljust go away,'' said Dimas.   ``Now we're thinking about this entirely from the point of viewof our own interests,'' he said.   Non-lethal aid has continued, and U.S. officials pointenergetically to literacy and civics courses, barber and cookingclasses and even a course in public speaking as examples of thecurrent U.S. effort.   But many Contras now see the aid as irrelevant and even damaging,because it made them seem a creature of the United States ratherthan an indigenous guerrilla force created by Sandinista oppression.   Withdrawal of the aid is viewed as immoral, and some said U.S.advisers didn't seem to realize they were in a war.   ``They were always telling us, `Oh no, don't attack that bridge,don't attack that factory, Congress will get mad,'' said ``Henry.''   The army is made up almost entirely of peasant farmers,sharecroppers and ranchers who fled the Sandinista government's landseizures and collectivization efforts. Many now have families in thecamps, in nearby villages or in refugee camps in eastern Honduras.   Commanders and soldiers alike said they began their fight withoutexpecting U.S. aid.   ``I started with a .22 rifle after they tried to make me join acollective,'' said ``Pavon,'' or ``Big Bird,'' a member of the JorgeSalazar No. 5 battlion.   But despite defiance, the army knows it is alone, short ofammunition and with little hope of outside help. An outbreak ofmeningitis has killed three children and left others ill.   ``What do you know about Canada's rules on asylum?'' asked afighter named ``Freddy'' when he was alone with a journalist. ``Isthere a lot of work there?''   Freddy said he had joined the Contras to avoid the draft. ``Iavoided two years of service, but now I've been fighting for six,''he said.   Mariana Amador said she walked 10 miles from a village to collecther son, who had decided to desert from an Contra artillery unit.   ``He got nervous when they started talking about going back intoNicaragua,'' she said.   Where there were 11,000 men in early February, there are now6,000 to 7,000.   Commanders claim 2,500 fighters have already left for Nicaragua.While no one wanted to discuss desertions, some companies thatshould have 200 men could muster only 120.   ``We're purifying ourselves,'' said Commander Nolan, the leaderof a combined battalion. ``The weak and the corrupt are leaving.''   Ortega and the Sandinistas have been making an effort to convincethe Contras that it is safe to return. Sandinista and Contra fieldcommanders have held impromptu talks.   But the fighters are skeptical about Sandinista promises, sayingthat Ortega has yet to prove he can keep a promise.</TEXT></DOC>
