First National Bank of Toms River is the main unit ofStatewide Bancorp, and had assets of about $1.8 billion. Itis the largest commercial bank in New Jersey to fail. FirstFidelity, based in Lawrenceville, N.J., has about $29 billionin assets and is among the nation's 25 largest bank holdingcompanies.</LP><TEXT>   A run by depositors developed at First National Bank ofToms River earlier this month after the bank's parentdisclosed a loss of $165.8 million for last year. The losswas prompted by big loan loss reserves that examiners forcedthe bank to set up. Depositors withdrew at least $85 millionin the first week after the loss was reported.   The government-assisted acquisition may be an example ofwhat First Fidelity plans for the future. In March, afterBanco de Santander of Spain agreed to pay $220 million for a13.3% stake in First Fidelity, Anthony Terracciano, chairmanof First Fidelity, said he would use the additional capitalto make acquisitions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.   First Fidelity will assume about $1.6 billion of depositsand $1.7 billion of assets from First National Bank of TomsRiver. However, First Fidelity has the right to return to theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. any assets that regulatorshave classified as troublesome. First Fidelity has 180 daysto return such &quot;adversely classified&quot; assets and will receivecash in return.   First Fidelity's vice chairman and chief financialofficer, Wolfgang Schoellkopf, said in an interview that someof the 56 branches of First National Bank of Toms River willbe closed. He noted that First National has 34 branches inOcean County while First Fidelity has 17 there. &quot;There aredefinitely overlaps,&quot; Mr. Schoellkopf said, though he addedthat no decisions have been made yet about which branches toclose.   Mr. Schoellkopf said the bidding for First National Bankof Toms River proceeded &quot;very quickly.&quot;   &quot;We did our due-diligence {research} last week and wesubmitted our bid yesterday,&quot; Mr. Schoellkopf said. He saidhe didn't know whether there were any other bidders for thebank.   First National Bank of Toms River was the 50th bank in theU.S. to fail so far this year, the FDIC said, and the firstbank failure this year in New Jersey. Though First NationalBank of Toms River is the largest commercial bank to fail inNew Jersey, it isn't nearly as large as City Savings ofSomerset, N.J., a failed thrift that once had $10 billion inassets.   Officials of Statewide Bancorp couldn't be reached forcomment yesterday.   The transaction was announced after the close of the stockmarket yesterday. First Fidelity shares closed at $26.625each, up 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange compositetrading.</TEXT></DOC>
