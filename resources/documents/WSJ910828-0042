After an initial surge to more than $6 billion in assets,sales have stalled and some of the nation's five prime ratefunds are even reporting lower fund assets. The funds havehad to contend with a host of problems, including aSecurities and Exchange Commission inquiry and questionsabout the way funds value the bank loans in which theyinvest. But the real killer may turn out to be something farmore prosaic -- lower interest rates and stiffer competitionfrom other types of funds.</LP><TEXT>   At first blush, prime rate funds had all the hallmarks ofa mutual fund success story. After the first of the fivefunds was launched three years ago, the funds quickly becamepopular with investors who wanted higher yields than theycould get on money funds while avoiding sharp zigzags in theprice of their mutual fund shares.   The funds, all of which are sold through brokers,generally invest in bank loans that are used to financeleveraged buyouts and other transactions involving heavilyindebted companies. Because these loans can be tough to sellon short notice, prime rate funds don't stand ready to buyback their shares on a daily basis, as other mutual funds do.Instead, investors can cash in their shares only every threemonths, when the funds hold quarterly tender offers.   Prime rate funds buy loans on which the interest payablevaries along with changes in the prime rate or otherbenchmark interest rates. That feature, says fund sponsors,allows them to boast remarkably stable share prices.   Here's why. Most bond funds typically bounce up and downin response to changes in interest rates. But with the primerate funds, interest rate swings don't affect the value ofthe loans, but instead affect the amount of interest that ispayable on each loan. As a consequence, the share prices ofprime rate funds don't vary when interest rates change.   But there's another factor that prime rate funds aren'timmune to -- credit risk. Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves,the largest of the five prime rate funds, was caught holdingthe bank loans of Al Copeland Enterprises, Best Products andHarvard Industries, all of which filed for bankruptcy underChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. But even with thesetroubled loans, Eaton Vance's share price, now at $9.96, isjust four cents below its initial $10 share price.   The remarkably stable share price of prime rate fundscaught the attention of the SEC, which has begun looking intothe funds. The SEC declines to comment on the inquiry, butfund company executives say the agency is looking into howthe funds value their portfolios.   James Hawkes, an executive vice president with Eaton VanceCorp., wouldn't comment directly on the SEC inquiry. But hedoes think &quot;there's a misperception that the prime rate fundsare somehow levitating their {share prices} by ignoringwhat's going on in the real world. The funds have withstoodthe test of two or three years pretty well.&quot;   SEC regulators aren't the only folks who are concernedabout the prime rate funds. In April 1990, Shearson LehmanBrothers stopped selling the funds. Robert Leo, Shearson'sdirector of mutual funds, declines to say why. &quot;The processwe use to review what we market is rigorous and proprietary,and therefore it's our policy not to discuss it,&quot; he says.   Some financial planners fear that investors mayincorrectly assume prime rate funds are as safe as bankcertificates of deposit, Treasury bills and money marketfunds. Consider an advertisement by Pilgrim Group's PrimeRate Trust. The ad boasts that &quot;over 3 years of fluctuatingrates, our return remained 1 1/2 to 2% above CDs and moneymarket funds.&quot; But there's a key difference between thesevarious investments. While the principal value of acertificate of deposit and a money fund are fixed, the shareprice of a prime rate fund can fluctuate. The Pilgrim adsmake that point in a small footnote.   Prime rate funds &quot;sound like the greatest thing sincecrushed ice&quot; when you see such advertising, says P. Kemp FainJr., president of Asset Planning Corporation in Knoxville,Tenn., a financial planning and investment advisory firm.&quot;The real danger is that people think the principal isguaranteed, and it's not.&quot;   Pilgrim officials reply that their advertisements clearlyspell out the differences between the firm's prime rate fund,certificates of deposit and money funds. Robert A. Grunburg,Pilgrim's president, also says Pilgrim's advertisements havebeen cleared by the National Association of SecuritiesDealers, which regulates mutual fund advertising. There is&quot;nothing misleading&quot; about Pilgrim's ads, he says.   For all the controversy, prime rate funds have performedpretty well. Over the 12 months ended July 31, the five primerate funds returned an average 9.1%, according to LipperAnalytical Services. That's about the same as the averagegovernment bond fund, and slightly worse than most corporatebond funds.   Despite that good performance, asset growth at prime ratefunds has leveled off, and a few funds have suffered cashoutflows. According to Lipper, Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust hasshrunk by $146 million in the nine months ended June 30, to$1.054 billion. Eaton Vance's fund, meanwhile, was down $159million in the six months ended June 30, to $1.937 billion.Since Lipper last compiled its numbers, Eaton Vance has heldanother tender offer for its fund, which resulted in theoutflow of an additional $106 million.   Why this drop in assets? Eaton Vance's Mr. Hawkes doesn'tattribute the drop to the SEC inquiry or concern abouttroubled loans. Instead, says Mr. Hawkes, prime rate fundsare losing sales for a far more mundane reason -- increasedcompetition. Over the past year, short-term global bond fundsand adjustable-rate mortgage funds have surged in popularity.Prime rate funds compete directly with these other funds,because all three types are seen as higher-yieldingalternatives to money funds.   Sales of prime rate funds have been hampered by theprecipitous drop in yields that has occurred at these fundsin recent months. The Eaton Vance fund's effective yield, forinstance, slumped to 7.6% in July, down from 9.8% at the endof 1990. This means that the yield on prime rate funds now isabout on a par with adjustable rate mortgage funds -- wherethere are no restrictions on selling fund shares -- and wellbelow the short-term global bond funds, some of which areyielding close to 10%.   &quot;The short-term global funds, which have become sopopular, have taken sales from the prime rate category,&quot; saysMr. Hawkes. &quot;There's lots of competition out there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
