The two, both former Eastern Airlines pilots who signed withTrump late last year, are happy to be working again. They are among170 Eastern pilots who now work for the casino-property billionaire.   ``It's a golden opportunity. Everyone is excited,'' saidElizabeth, a flight engineer celebrating her 27th birthday Thursdayat the Trump Shuttle's debut. She had been working for Eastern foronly a year and a half when employees struck the Miami-based carrieron March 4.   For co-pilot husband Gary, 42, who had flown for Eastern for 10years, the heady enthusiasm of the occasion was tempered withnostalgia.   ``We'll always have a kinship to Eastern,'' he told a reporter inthe crowded Trump Shuttle terminal at New York's LaGuardia Airport.``That's our roots. Eastern is a great group of people.''   Cannon said he was relieved, however, that the three-month``emotional roller coaster'' of striking Eastern was over for thecouple.   Trump, unlike Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo, isn't in a``confrontational position'' with employees, he said.   The couple are relocating from Dublin, Ohio, to New Jersey.   Other Trump Shuttle pilots, who had come from carriers other thanEastern, were less prone to looking back.   ``The potential is so much greater here,'' said Peter Woermann,43, comparing his new job favorably with his former employerBusiness Express, a regional airline based in Hartford, Conn. ``Ithink it's a great opportunity.''   Don Thompson, 28, came to fly for Trump from Precision Airlines,a commuter line based in Manchester, N.H., which suspended alloperations in March. Precision, one of the carriers which had fedinto Eastern's flights, furloughed 350 workers.</TEXT></DOC>
