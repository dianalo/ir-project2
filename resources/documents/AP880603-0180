Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the African NationalCongress guerrilla movement, which has been accused of four otherbombings in the past nine days.   The ANC has not commented on the recent bombings. But it issueda statement Friday from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, sayingthe month of June ``must be a period of united and decisive popularoffensive'' against the government.   The statement endorsed a three-day anti-apartheid protestscheduled to start Monday, saying South Africa's economy ``mustgrind to a halt'' on those days.   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting the South Africangovernment.   Several corporations sought court orders Friday barring blackunions from organizing work stoppages next week. The employersalleged that the protest could lead to violence.   The bomb exploded at 1:30 p.m. outside a branch of the StandardBank in Roodepoort, a city that borders the west side ofJohannesburg. Three black men and a white woman were killed.   A Roodepoort police spokesman, Maj. Tiene Halgryn, said eightpeople were seriously injured, including two whites and six blacks.He said 11 people suffered less severe injuries.   Police said most of the victims were waiting at the streetcorner for a traffic light to change when the explosion rippedthrough a metal trash bin.   The blast shattered windows in the bank and nearby stores inRoodepoort's central business district.   Police said the explosive device was a Soviet-made limpet mine,and they searched for other bombs in the area.   Most of the bombings blamed on the ANC in recent months haveinvolved limpet mines. Government posters encourage the public towatch out for the mines, which can be attached to other objects.   ``If everyone is on guard, the ANC's diabolical plans cannotsucceed,'' said Vlok, the law and order minister.   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aspart of its efforts to topple the government and end apartheid, thesystem of racial separation that denies South Africa's blackmajority a vote in national affairs.   In the past, the ANC's official policy has been to aim itsattacks at targets linked to the government and security forces.Its leaders have warned that some civilian casualties wereinevitable.   The death toll in Roodepoort was the highest from a bombing inSouth Africa since a car bomb killed four white policemen inJohannesburg in May 1987.   It was the fifth bombing reported in the area in a nine-dayspan. The only other injuries came from a May 26 bombing inPretoria that hurt four white women.   The statement from ANC headquarters, issued shortly afterFriday's explosion, said the ANC had distributed leaflets in SouthAfrica endorsing the planned protests by anti-apartheid laborunions and church groups.   Government officials and employers have warned that workers whoparticipate face dismissal or legal action.   The protest is intended to express opposition to the bannings ofmajor anti-apartheid organizations and other government movesagainst opposing trade unions, newspapers and individual activists.The two largest black federations say their main grievance isproposed labor legislation that would curtail unions' ability tostrike.   The Chamber of Mines, which represents South Africa's six majormining companies, said the unions were using the proposed bill ``asa rallying point to polarize the work force.''   One gold mining company, Free State Consolidated, said itobtained a court injunction Friday barring the black miners' unionfrom organizing a protest strike.   The company said the protest call has ``been backed by threatsof violence and coercion.''</TEXT></DOC>
