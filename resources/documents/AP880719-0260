The ideas are coming fromeverywhere,'' said physiologist Robert Edwards, who with the lategynecologist Patrick Steptoe pioneered the technique known as invitro fertilization.   ``There have been some amazing advances,'' especially inunlocking some of the mysteries of early human growth andhereditary diseases, Edwards said.   Originally developed as a treatment for women with blockedFallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization has produced a range oftechniques such as embryo freezing, womb-leasing and egg donationto treat infertility in both men and women.   Virtually every industrialized country has an established invitro program, and many developing countries, such as China, Indiaand Egypt, have entered the field.   Because few countries keep records of in vitro births, noprecise estimate exists of their number worldwide.   However, a survey by AP bureaus indicated at least 10,000test-tube babies have been born since the first, Louise Joy Brown,on July 25, 1978.   Britain, Australia, France, the United States, West Germany,Belgium and Austria account for the majority of test-tube babiesworldwide.   But fledgling programs also have been set up in Asia, the MiddleEast and Latin America, often in defiance of religious and economicobjections.   In the conservative Islamic nations of the Middle East, forexample, theologians initially balked at in vitro because of theKoran's teaching against Western-style adoption procedures andbirth outside marriage. But clinics have sprung up in Saudi Arabiaand Egypt, mainly catering to the wealthy, and two clinics areexpected to open soon in Bahrain.   Italy, meanwhile, has established a flourishing test-tube babyprogram despite the Roman Catholic Church's objections toartificial reproduction.   China, while imposing a strict one-child-per-family regime tocontrol its population of more than 1 billion, announced the birthof its first test-tube baby this year. India's first test-tube babywas born two years ago.   In vitro researchers say assisted conceptions produce astatistically negligible addition to the population, and Edwardssays those who criticize populous countries for promoting newchildbirth methods ``should re-analyze their own view of life.''   ``A Chinese woman has the same urge to have children as aBritish woman,'' he said. ``You can't just set aside a group ofpatients and leave them to suffer in silence.''   Despite the proliferation of clinics, the Steptoe-Edwardstechnique remains a costly, hit-and-miss proposition available toonly about 5 percent of childless couples.   ``Nearly 10 years after the first baby was born as a result ofin vitro fertilization, this treatment is still largelyunsuccessful,'' said a report in the June 25 issue of the BritishMedical Journal.   It said the latest figures show that in Britain only 11 percentof women got pregnant and 9 percent had a live baby after a singlecycle of treatment, and other countries with advanced programs hadsimilar success rates.   The treatment has brought ``an awful lot of joy and happinessfor a lot of people, but also a lot of disappointment,'' said Dr.Peter Brinsden, deputy director of the Fertility and In VitroFertilization Unit at London's Humana Hospital, Wellington.   Eventually, he expects the success rate ``to creep up to 20 to30 percent,'' but noted, ``It's a long way down the road.''   Brinsden and his colleagues are among world leaders in thelatest in vitro spinoff known as gamete intrafallopian transfer, orGIFT, in which doctors transfer egg and sperm directly into theFallopian tube for fertilization in the womb.   The Humana unit has reported a 31.2 percent success rate withGIFT, but it has the drawback of being available only to women withat least one unblocked Fallopian tube, the normal site ofconception.   Although Edwards said his clinic at Bourn Hall, near Cambridge,has a much higher pregnancy rate than average, he acknowledged thatthe biggest in vitro advances have been in research into hereditarydiseases, rather than improving the technique's success rate.   Under the Steptoe-Edwards technique, ova are removed from themother, mixed with the prospective father's sperm in a laboratorydish and reimplanted in the mother's uterus.   To increase the chances of pregnancy, doctors now routinely usedrugs to stimulate ovulation and fertilize and implant three orfour embryos at a time, resulting in a high incidence of multiplebirths.   Australia, which began in vitro research as far back as 1971 andhas produced an estimated 2,000 babies, has pioneered the storingof frozen embryos in liquid nitrogen.   The procedure, which saves embryos for later use if the firstattempt at pregnancy fails, has proved highly controversial.   In 1983, a quandary developed over what came to be known as theworld's first ``test-tube orphans'' _ embryos left in Australiancold storage after their American parents died in a plane crash.The embryos were offered to a childless couple last December, butit is not known whether they were ever used.   An estimated 10,000 frozen embryos are now stockpiled around theworld _ 3,000 in France, 1,000 in Britain and most of the others inAustralia, raising concerns over their fate should their parentsdie or decide not to claim them.   Australia, France, West Germany, Sweden, Italy and Spain haveall taken steps to regulate in vitro. But the most comprehensivenationwide controls are expected to emerge in Britain, where thegovernment has proposed legislation covering the entire field offertility treatment and embryo research.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
