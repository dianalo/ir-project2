(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On the first day without wakes orfunerals since the tragedy, children are running in the farmyard,spraying each other with a garden hose while their mothers shoutfor them to cut it out.   It would be a normal day but for one thing. Elmbrook, the dairyfarm nurtured by five generations of Theuerkauf men over 108 years,has no one to run it save for the widows and children.   Inside the great, white farmhouse, Linda Theuerkauf and herchildren gather in a circle, surrounded by memories, and say thenames:   ``First Tom...''   Tom Theuerkauf, 27, was the first one into the manure pit,through a narrow hole and down the ladder to clear the drain 12feet below.   ``... then Danny ...''   Dan Theuerkauf, 15, quiet and thoughtful like his uncle Tom, hadbeen cutting hay by himself for two years, already part of thecircle of Theuerkauf farmers. Dan saw Tom's head hit the ladder andslip into the dark. He sent his 8-year-old brother Brian for helpand then went down.   ``... and Brian got Bill first.''   Bill Hofer, 63, was the third man down, a cousin who grew upacross the lane from the Theuerkaufs, went to school with them andfarmed with them.   ``... and I got my Grandpa ...''   Carl Theuerkauf Sr., 66 the day they buried him, a patriarchwith a love for farming surpassed only by his passion for hisfamily. He hated nothing more than when people wouldn't try, yet heonce stopped Carl Jr. from running into a burning barn to save thecows, the farm equipment, the new tractor.   Dorothy Theuerkauf remembers her son said, ```Spray me down Dadand I'll go in.' ... Carl said, `No way, don't risk your life formachines.'''   Carl Sr. stepped into the hole to save his son, grandson andcousin.   ``... and then my Carl.'' Linda finishes the toll.   Carl Theuerkauf Jr., 37, was the last man down.   ``I don't know where he came from,'' Linda said. ``He wasn'tsupposed to be on the farm that day.''   At first no one knew what had happened. Men went into that pitevery week to clear the drain before the pump was turned on. Butmethane from the decaying sewage had built up during a heat wave;it took only seconds for each man to collapse, scant minutes tosuffocate in air that contained no oxygen.   The automatic waste pit was one innovation cited in 1981 whenMichigan State University named Carl Sr. the state Farm Manager ofthe Year.   Over five generations, the Theuerkaufs (pronounced Turk'-off)built Elmbrook into the largest and most respected dairy farm inMichigan's Upper Peninsula. Gain the Theuerkaufs' trust and you hadthe ear of every farmer for 50 miles. Lose it, as one state ag mandid, ``and your word is dirt,'' a county agent said.   As their lives touched Menominee County, so did their July 26deaths. Newspapers carrying stories of the family sold out andpeople stood by the road in the rain when the funeral processionpassed. Not since more than 700 people celebrated Elmbrook'scentennial a year ago July was there such a gathering.   Carl Sr. was so proud of that centennial he was near tears atthe county fair last year when they handed him the historicalmarker. This year, the fair was deserted, what with the funeralsand the rain.   The same gloom hung over Elmbrook. A cow was loose in the backfield. Two newborn calves lay untended in the mud of a holding pen.Thick, wet muck coated the stall floors in the dairy barn.   No longer is Elmbrook a tight ship farmed by committee, Carl Sr.and sons Tom and Carl Jr. meeting in the yard every morning, handson hips, debating the day's work sometimes for an hour.   Missing from those meetings was Carl Sr.'s third boy, Bill, awoodworker, not a farmer. Carl once said he could handle anything,so long as it wasn't a death, but he cried three years ago when helearned Bill had lost his hands in a car crash.   Elmbrook still needs running. The pit, still waiting to beemptied, sits like a vault beneath the dairy barn and nobody willgo near it.   Bill, just 23 but aged incredibly, it seems, these past weeks,is taking a crash course in his family's occupation, scramblingbetween the paid hands and neighbors who volunteered to help. Whatare you doing? What must be done there?   That doesn't stop one of those raucous water fights with wet,laughing Theuerkauf children everywhere. They splash each otherlike they did just the Sunday before, when their fathers andbrother were throwing water, too.   That's the kind of thing the Theuerkaufs are keen to remember.   There are the Sunday mornings, when Linda made waffles and CarlJr. would poke fun at her cooking. ``Tasteless, tasteless,'' hewould say.   There are the Sunday afternoons, when Carl and Linda drove aloneto see the cornfields and Carl would talk of plans for the future,the family, the farm.   ``How Carl loved the farm. His dream was to make it the bestfarm it could be, so we could be together,'' Linda said.   After the ambulances and the television crews, Linda awoke inthe dark. It was the hour Carl would be getting up, and she walkedacross the yard to the bright lights of the barn. ``I stood andwatched the man milk the last six cows. It was 3 a.m. and I feltCarl there with me.''   She smiled. ``Do I hate the farm because of what happened? No.''   But that night after they died, Linda hated Elmbrook. ``I justwanted to pack and move away and never come back.''   In the trailer next door, 5-year-old Tommy promises Tom's widow,Wendy, he will take care of her. Two-year-old Rachael cries. Atnight, Tom's pet German shepherd whines softly. ``Even the dog islost,'' Wendy said.   She doesn't know if she will stay. ``I have to see what my kidssay.'' What is the farm to them now? Pain? Love?   Farming and Elmbrook remain life and love for Carl Jr.'schildren. The oldest, 16-year-old Becky, sees her father and herbrother Dan in the work of the farm hands.   From a sandbox in the yard, Brian plotted how he and Dan wouldrun their own dairy operation. Brian tucked a toy tractor intoDan's coffin, and the Saturday they buried his big brother, hebegged to go home in time to turn on the TV wrestling shows ``so Ican tell Danny about it.''   Dan had wished for such a brother on the candles of a birthdaycake; a pregnant Linda guessed it. ``I said, `You wished for a babybrother,' and he started crying. He said if somebody knows yourwish, it won't come true.''   Linda and her children are crowded together on the couch,passing a rose and a carnation, two flowers saved from the funeralthe day before. On the wall above hangs a portrait of Elmbrook,painted long ago by a relative.   For an afternoon, Brian, Becky, 12-year-old Tracy and10-year-old Carrie sit with Linda and tell warm, funny stories.   ... Dad's California vacation that turned out to be tours offarms ...   ... How Grandpa would drive around lost, never askingdirections, filling the car with cigar smoke until it seemed thejourney would never end ...   ... Danny's favorite joke: Why did they outlaw round bales ofhay? Because cows couldn't get a square meal.   ``What was your father's favorite song?'' Linda asks. They sing:   ``Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar atsuppertime. Be my little sugar and love me all the time.''   Linda laughs, pulling dark hair back from her face to show nottear-swollen misery but twinkling eyes. ``He sang that to me all ofthe time ... and he had a rotten singing voice.''   They laugh and laugh. Then Becky asks the question:   ``Why, why did he have to go down?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 13</NOTE></DOC>
