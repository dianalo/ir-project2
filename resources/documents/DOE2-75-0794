<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-0794 </DOCNO><TEXT>The presence of cobalt as a thin coating or as an alloy constituent onthe surface of a positive current conductor, particularly for a brownstoneelectrode, which, preferably, is a nickel-plated steel cup or a deep-drawingsteel sheet, manifests itself in the reduction of the contact resistancebetween the conductor and the MnO/sub 2/. To apply the cobalt, the conductoris most preferably polarized cathodically in an aqueous CoSO/sub 4/ solution.The cobalt coating formed in less than 1 min depending on the selectedconcentration of Co ions and on the conditions of current flow, the thicknessof which lies within a {mu}m range, gives the transition zone betweenMnO/sub 2/ and a nickel-plated current conductor even during long storagea resistance capacity which otherwise requires gold-plated conductors.</TEXT></DOC>
