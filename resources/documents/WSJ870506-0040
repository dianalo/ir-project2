Gary Hart said he made &quot;a mistake by putting myself in circumstances that could be misconstrued,&quot; but denied he spent a night with a Miami actress and vowed that the controversy won't derail his presidential campaign.    Mr. Hart, combative in his first public appearance since the Miami Herald linked him with 29-year-old Donna Rice, said he was the victim of reporters who &quot;reached inaccurate conclusions based on incomplete facts.&quot; He asserted he &quot;absolutely did not&quot; engage in &quot;immoral&quot; activities.    While Mr. Hart and Miami Herald journalists continued their stormy exchange over the techniques used in the paper's surveillance of his Capitol Hill townhouse, the candidacy of Mr. Hart -- a week ago the clear leader in the crowded Democratic field -- continued suffering political damage. Among political professionals, the question was no longer the details of the incident, but Mr. Hart's judgment in leaving himself open to rumor by spending time with the woman.    Mr. Hart today meets his first test of public sentiment since the Miami Herald reports. He will be campaigning for votes in northern New Hampshire, which next Feb. 16 holds the first presidential primary.    &quot;At no time did we, the woman involved and I, spend an evening, a night, together,&quot; Mr. Hart said in a speech here before the American Newspaper Publishers Association.    The former Colorado senator appeared solemn and acknowledged a new tinge to his campaign, which now is partly a struggle to mold the political future of the country and partly a &quot;struggle to retain my integrity and honor.&quot;    Later, at an evening fund-raiser at the Sheraton Centre hotel, Mr. Hart attempted to make light of the incident, saying, &quot;We sure took the campaign debt off the front page.&quot;    But he told the 350 people who paid $1,000 each that he recognized that the &quot;personal side of politics&quot; cannot be escaped now, adding, &quot;Anyone who wants to test my character is in for a surprise. I may bend, but I don't break.&quot;    The accusations against Mr. Hart came less than a month after he formally opened his presidential campaign and sought to put to rest questions that he was uncomfortable with his past, unsure of his commitment to politics and unfaithful to his wife.    These questions, often called &quot;character issues,&quot; had been peculiarly nettlesome to a candidate who repeatedly had to explain during his 1984 primary campaign why he had changed his name, his age and his signature. In that contest, he scored an upset victory in the New Hampshire primary and nearly defeated former Vice President Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination.    Mr. Hart, who prides himself on his creative approach to political questions, again is girding for an inquisition over his private life -- one that threatens to overshadow his political proposals and seriously endanger his campaign itself.    In his initial comments yesterday and in interviews with top Hart advisers, the campaign's strategy clearly was to assert Mr. Hart's innocence and to portray the incident as a trivial diversion.    &quot;I don't intend to give up, because the cause is more important than the candidate,&quot; Mr. Hart said. &quot;The prize is not the presidency, it's our country's future.&quot;    At the same time, however, Mr. Hart told the publishers that the incident &quot;hurt my family and other innocent people and reflected badly on my character.&quot;    Mr. Hart, 50 years old, and his wife, Lee, whom he met in college, have been separated twice and reconciled both times. In the past several years the Harts, who live in Kittredge, Colo., have made deliberate efforts to display the strength of their marriage. Mrs. Hart, who campaign aides said was ill, didn't appear with her husband yesterday.    The start of Mr. Hart's speech was broadcast live yesterday afternoon by NBC-TV and the Cable News Network, though both networks broke away from the speech when he turned to the economic themes of his campaign.    In response to questions after the speech, Mr. Hart said he met Miss Rice while he was in the company of Mrs. Hart. He said that the time he spent with Miss Rice on the island of Bimini early this year was &quot;in open daylight,&quot; and that they slept on separate boats. Mr. Hart added that he placed &quot;no more than half a dozen or so&quot; phone calls to the actress, many in response to her calls. He said she had offered to be &quot;involved and helpful&quot; in the campaign.    Nearly all of the questions asked by the publishers dealt with the Miami Herald story.    At the heart of the candidate's case before the publishers was his charge that the Miami Herald reporters conducted a &quot;spotty surveillance,&quot; leaving his Washington home and one of its entrances unobserved for several hours. He argued that the reporters were so eager to rush their story into print that they &quot;refused to interview the very people who could have given them the facts.&quot;    Tom Fiedler, the newspaper's political editor and one of the reporters on the scene, took issue with Mr. Hart's remarks. He said that Mr. Hart wouldn't tell reporters &quot;anything,&quot; including the identity of the woman.    Mr. Hart asked the publishers to weigh whether &quot;the urgency of meeting a deadline&quot; was worth sacrificing the truth. &quot;When you ask for scrutiny,&quot; he said, alluding to his recent challenge that reporters follow him to assure themselves he wasn't being unfaithful to his wife, &quot;you want complete scrutiny.&quot;    Richard Capen, publisher of the Miami Herald, responded: &quot;The issue is not the Miami Herald. It's Gary Hart's judgment. He's an announced candidate for the presidency of the United States who knows full well womanizing was a question in his past.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
