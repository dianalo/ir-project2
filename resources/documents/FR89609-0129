The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge MaryEllen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in SaltLake City, Utah on June 21, 1988. On November 10, 1988, the AdministrativeLaw Judge issued her opinion and recommended ruling. On December 2, 1988,counsel for the Government filed exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge'sopinion, and on December 6, 1988, Respondent's counsel filed a responseto the Government's exceptions. On December 12, 1988, Judge Bittner transmitteda record of these proceedings, including the aforementioned exceptionsand response, to the Administrator. The Administrator has considered therecord in its entirety and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues hisfinal order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusionsof law as hereinafter set forth.The Administrative Law Judge found that Respondent is a general familypractitioner who has been in private practice since 1954. In February 1985,an investigator with the Utah Department of Business Regulation initiatedan investigation concerning Respondent's prescribing practices with ScheduleII and III controlled substances. The investigator specifically noted threeindividuals who received substantial quantities of controlled substancesfrom Respondent over lengthy periods of time. Respondent wrote prescriptionsfor Dolophine, a Schedule II narcotic, on a regular basis from September24, 1984, through February 4, 1985, for one individual. Respondent knewthat this individual was dependent on narcotics and testified at the hearingthat he was trying to ``wean'' this individual from narcotics. Respondentwas not registered by DEA as a narcotic treatment program, and was, therefore,not authorized to write prescriptions for narcotics for a narcotic dependentperson in order to treat such dependency.The Administrative Law Judge also found that Respondent prescribed largeamounts of Percocet, a Schedule II narcotic, and Valium, a Schedule IVcontrolled substance, to an individual from March 1984 through February1985. Respondent indicated that although he knew this individual had medicalproblems, she was addicted to these substances. To a third individual Respondentprescribed various controlled substances for weight control from 1980 throughMarch of 1985, on at least a monthly basis. A physician who reviewed thisindividual's medical record at the State's request, indicated that Respondentprescribed these drugs long after they ceased to be effective, and thatRespondent had not put this individual on any type of supervised weight-lossprogram.The Utah Division of Registration of the Department of Business Regulationproposed the revocation of Respondent's license to practice medicine inApril 1985. Following a hearing before the Utah Physicians Licensing Board,Respondent's license to prescribe Schedule II and III controlled substancesin the State of Utah was suspended for six months, from August 5, 1985,until February 5, 1986. The Board found that Respondent had prescribedcontrolled substances to an individual knowing he was an addict, prescribedcontrolled substances to an individual in an excessive quantity, and thatRespondent had prescribed controlled substances to an individual in excessof the amount necessary to treat her conditions.Investigators for the Utah Department of Business Regulation discoveredthat Respondent had written at least 20 prescriptions for Schedule II andIII controlled substances during the time that the Schedule II and IIIportion of his Utah license was suspended. At the DEA hearing, Respondenttestified that he mistakenly believed the suspension only applied to situationsinvolving prescriptions for treatment for drug addiction. In response tothese activities, Respondent and the Utah Division of Registration enteredinto a stipulation suspending Respondent's authority to handle ScheduleII and III controlled substances for six months beginning on March 31,1987. Respondent was required to apply for reinstatement of those privileges.Respondent has not applied for reinstatement of his Schedule II and IIIprivileges in Utah, and is, therefore, not currently authorized to handleSchedule II and III controlled substances in the State of Utah.The Administrative Law Judge found that since March 1986, Respondent hascomplied with the restrictions on his prescribing authority. She furtherfound that in the past, Respondent demonstrated carelessness and lack ofresponsibility in his handling of controlled substances, but that Respondentrecognizes his past mistakes and that he can be trusted with a registrationlimited to Schedules IV and V. The Administrative Law Judge recommendedthat Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration in Schedules II and IIIbe revoked, and that his pending application for renewal of DEA Certificateof Registration, AW1642431, be granted for Schedules IV and V only. TheAdministrator adopts the opinion and recommended ruling of the AdministrativeLaw Judge. Based upon Respondent's lack of authorization to handle controlledsubstances in Schedules II and III in the State of Utah and Respondent'spast conduct with respect to the prescribing of controlled substances inthose schedules, Respondent's DEA registration in Schedules II and IIImust be revoked.Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28CFR 0.100 (b), hereby orders that the Schedule II and III portion of DEACertificate of Registration, AW1642431, previously issued to Scott PyperWallace, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked. Respondent's applicationfor renewal of DEA Certificate of Registration, AW1642431, is hereby grantedfor Schedules IV and V and shall be restricted to only those schedules.This order is effective July 10, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
