Exports to the United States dropped 19.4 percent from a yearearlier to 199,904 units, according to the Japan AutomobileManufacturers Association.   Japanese companies exported a total 524,785 units in January.   An association spokesman, who requested anonymity, said therewas no single reason for the drop in shipments to the U.S. market.He added that the higher value of the yen, which makes carsexported from Japan more costly to American buyers, was animportant factor.   The United States is the largest market for Japanese car exports.   Exports to the United States in the first 10 months of fiscal1987, which ends in March, were down 5.4 percent compared with ayear earlier, to 1.978 million units.   Total exports to the U.S. market for fiscal 1987 will probablynot exceed the 2.3 million unit quota set in Japan's voluntaryexport restrictions, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
