Payne (The Americas, Nov. 28) made a commendable effort in informing your readers about the armed struggle in Suriname. But their anti-government tone distorts the picture.    It is hard for me as a citizen of Suriname to accept the authors' dubbing the situation there as an &quot;ideal setting for the Reagan Doctrine.&quot; Although they don't say who the U.S. should support, their admiration for the Suriname Liberation Army (SLA) is evident along with the claim that Suriname is becoming another &quot;security threat in the region.&quot;    Ronny Brunswijk, who heads the SLA campaign in the east, isn't fighting to promote democracy, rather he is fighting to establish a kleptocracy for his 300 supporters if he succeeds. Yet the authors are quick to criticize the current civilian cabinet in Suriname, calling its head, Col. Dese Bouterse, an &quot;admirer of Fidel Castro and Grenada's late dictator Maurice Bishop&quot; who has called on Libya's Moamar Gadhafi to &quot;help him maintain his brutal military regime.&quot;    But Col. Bouterse, although an admirer of two Marxists, has not indoctrinated the 400,000 people in Suriname with leftist ideology. Surinamese are allowed to travel anywhere in the world and to read the Western press. Paramaribo's two dailies carry reports from such agencies as the Associated Press and Reuters.    Also, Col. Bouterse has encouraged the expansion of small businesses while importing the needs of the private sector. And he has pledged the free elections in early 1987.    By engaging in a war against the people, the SLA has threatened the basic human rights of the villagers in the region they occupy.    Yes Mr. McColm and Mr. Payne, the &quot;Reagan Doctrine&quot; should be applied to the current situation in Suriname. A good example is El Salvador, where the government is fighting guerrillas that also call for cease-fires and negotiations. But El Salvador's FMLN and Suriname's SLA are blind to the fact that the only problems in their respective countries are the wars these groups have triggered.    Narendra Nandoe   Boston</TEXT></DOC>
