Latvia's independence-minded governmentimmediately passed a resolution condemning the event anddemanded that all Iraqi soldiers &quot;leave the territory of therepublic of Latvia.&quot; Moscow itself has said it would continueto honor some old &quot;contracts&quot; with Iraq. We suppose that inthe larger geopolitical picture, the impact of a Balticrepublic's criticism of landlocked Iraq's navy doesn't loomlarge. But as the West sorts out the question of who its newfriends are, it's worth noting that the Latvians had littletrouble deciding whose side they're on.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
