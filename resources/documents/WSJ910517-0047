The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study,which will be published this fall, said a widely usedhydrochlorofluorocarbon, or HCFC, takes 50% longer to breakdown than earlier tests showed. The HCFC is considered thebest substitute for chlorofluorocarbons that had been usedfor electronics cleansing.</LP><TEXT>   The new research indicates the HCFC falls closer tounacceptable levels in federal standards set by last year'sClean Air Act. The report said the HCFC lingered as long as13 years in the atmosphere instead of eight years, asprevious tests showed, increasing both the potential forozone damage and global warming effects.   &quot;It's not over the line,&quot; said A.R. Ravishankara, anNational Oceanic and Atmospheric researcher. &quot;The questionis: `Is it too close to the line?'&quot;   Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, whichmonitors compliance with clean air standards, said they wereconcerned with the study results. But they said the HCFCstill falls within allowable federal standards.</TEXT></DOC>
