(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State officials have silenced a proposalby two units of the Department of Environmental Protection for amorning ``quiet hour.''   Employees in the water pollution and waste disposal unitsplanned to initiate a ``quiet hour'' from 10 a.m. to noon. Duringthat time employees wouldn't take calls or visitors without anappointment.   Supervisors said the department's office building in Hartfordwas so noisy and crowded that employees needed the time to get workdone.   ``The building is a pit. We've got to do something to make itpossible for people to do their work,'' said Michael J. Harder,assistant director of the department's water compliance unit.   The proposal, however, was rejected. ``We're a public agency,and we have to remain open to the public,'' Deputy DEP CommissionerJohn Anderson said Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
