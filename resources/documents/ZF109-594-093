SPSS/PC+ 3.1 from SPSS Inc. of Chicago; Systat 4.2 (which was recentlyupgraded to 5.0) from Systat Inc. of Evansville, Ill.; NCSS 5.02 from NCSS ofKaysville, Utah; and Statgraphics 4.0 from STSC Inc. of Rockville, Md.andM;The sixth packages, RS/1 4.2, from BBN Software Products Corp. of Cambridge,Mass., was rated notably lower than its nearest competitors overall, andreceived the lowest score in seven of the 12 atttributes.andM;&quot;I would like to see our lab get rid of RS/1,&quot; said a chemist at an Easternmanufacturing firm who asked to remain annonymous.andP;  &quot;We now have toincorporate three pieces of software to do the job we bought RS/1 for.andP;  It'sbecome a white elephant.&quot;andM;&quot;The file structure of RS/1 is awkward and the commands are not at allstraight-forward,&quot; added Daryl Middleton, a team leader at Ford Motor Co.andO;&quot;It takes too long to learn the commands.&quot;andM;While buyers were disappointed with RS/1, SAS garnered the highest overallscore and took the top spot in six of the 12 attributes.andM;According to Dan Wilson, director at BRI Computer Services Inc., amedical-device research firm, SAS is an industry standard.andP;  &quot;For the industrywe're in, it's really a non-brainer.andP;  The FDA will only accept statisticsgenerated by SAS,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;SAS is far more powerful in terms of data manipulation and exploration dataanalysis than any package on the market,&quot; said Thomas Prusinski, a manager atBabcock andamp; Wilcox Inc., a propulsion-systems manufacturer.andM;All of the advanced statistical software packages included in this week'sPoll are intended for use in determination of basic descriptive statistics,Chi squares, cross tabulations, ANOVAs, Pearson correlations, univariateT-tests, linear regression analyses, multivariate analyses and regressionanalyses beyond linear regression.andM;There are some obvious differences between products.andP;  Large gaps of 10 to 27points separated the highest- and lowest-scoring products in every attribute.andO;However, products scores remained somewhat close for the four most importantattributes, with the exception of RS/1 trailing the pack for overallperformance.andM;Buyers deemed overall reliability as the most important criteria whenpurchasing an advanced statistics software package.andM;Doris Hertsgaard, owner of DH Research, a statistics consulging firm, definedreliability as accuracy.andP;  &quot;Reliability means the package is going to give youaccurate results.andP;  You need to know that whoever did the programming knewwhat they were doing,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;With SAS, when you run a regressionprocedure, you know you're getting accurate results.&quot;andM;Buyers of RS/1 were not as confident.andM;&quot;RS/1 doesn't provide you with enough information,&quot; said Lawrence Barker,principal applied statistician at Reeco Inc., a research firm that doescontract work for the Department of Energy.andP;  &quot;I question its accuracy in thesense that I don't feel a particular set of results is appropriate for agiven problem.&quot;andM;&quot;Performance means a combination of speed and numerical accuracy.andP;  RS/1 isslow and much to cumbersome for large data sets,&quot; said Barker.andM;Although scores for overall performance were close, buyers of SPSS/PC+ ratedtheir product highest.andM;&quot;SPSS is faster than the other because there's far less overhead involved,&quot;said Babcock's Prusinski.andP;  &quot;SPSS is not as rich as SAS in terms offlexibility, so there's not as much CPU-intensive overhead.andP;  It will alwaysgive the best performance.&quot;andM;Bruce Barton, a statistician at the Maryland Medical Research Institute, amedical-research firm, said in the area of performance, speed isn't alwaysthe best definition.andM;&quot;If you're analyzing a large data set, you're not going to sit around andwait for it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;to me, performance means a smoothly functioningpackage, with all the parts of the package working well together.andP;  With SPSS,they've integrated the various parts of the package together so data istransferred smoothly without unnecessary reformatting.&quot;andM;Documentation Is CrucialandM;It is interesting to note that the two documentation attributes tied forthird in importance to buyers, indicating that documentation is essential toadvanced statistics software.andM;&quot;When looking to purchase a stats package, the first thing to look for isautomatic installation,&quot; said Jeff King, PC analyst at the University ofSouth Florida's College of Medicine.andP;  &quot;Secondly, it's crucial that themanuals be clear and concise, with good examples.andP;  Based on my experience,the people using these packages aren't all statisticians.&quot;andM;In both areas of documentation--completeness/organization and clarity--NCSSlagged behind its competitors, while SAS and SPSS fared better, buyers said.andM;&quot;NCSS&quot; documentation is not the easiest to understand,&quot; said Bruce Kiefer,supervisor at Morgan Construction Co., a steel bar and rods manufacturer.andO;&quot;although the basics are there, it really doesn't give you all the backgroundyou may want.andP;  In order to be effective with the package, you just have totry different things with a hit or miss approach.&quot;andM;Buyers noted that although SAS Institute's documentation is put togetherwell, it's quite voluminous.andM;&quot;It's as good as it can be.andP;  [SAS Institute] seems to have a fetish aboutdocumentation, because for years they were compared to SPSS,&quot; said BRI'sWilson, &quot;At one point, SAS had horrible documentation.andP;  Now it seems they'vegone overboard.andP;  There's so much, it will fill a shelf.andP;  But it iswell-put-together.&quot;andM;&quot;SPSS&quot; documentation is better in the sense that there's less of it,&quot; saidBabcock's Prusinski.andP;  &quot;People in the PC world seem to like getting one bookwith everything clearly explained.andP;  SAS is just as clear and concise as SPSS,but it can be daunting because there's much more of it.&quot;andM;In the category of ease of running statistical procedures, buyers of SASfound the process to be simpler than did buyers of RS/1.andM;&quot;It's incredibly easy.andP;  [With SAS] you just type in the procedure options,load in the data set and you're running,&quot; said DH Research's Hertsgaard.andM;&quot;As long as the data set is structured properly, it's very easy,&quot; agreedWilson.andM;&quot;RS/1 makes it too complicated to run a simple procedure.andP;  The package givesyou too much information and you wind up trying to distill what you need,&quot;said the chemist.andP;  &quot;There isn't a simple macro to allow me to get averageeasily.andP;  You have to write a command for each step.andP;  It would take me hoursto get one piece of data to my bosses.&quot;andM;Buyers of SAS also rated that product the easiest to use for creating andmofifying variables.andM;&quot;It's much easier than the other packages.andP;  You don't have to go through anyspecial steps,c said Hertsgaard.andP;  &quot;If you want to double something, you justname the variable and choose the appropriate algebraic statement.&quot;andM;&quot;One reason SAS has caught on is due to their excellent programming language,which makes modification a snap for our programmers,&quot; said Wilson.andM;Setting Bad ExamplesandM;Statgraphics received the lowest score from its buyers for creating andmodifying variables.andP;  &quot;If you're trying to learn how to modify variables fromtheir natural, you're out of luck,&quot; said Wayne Curry, an engineer at West Co.andO;Inc., a packaging manufacturer.andP;  &quot;The examples just don't correspond.andM;In the areas of ease of training and ease of use after training, NCSS buyersrated their product highest, while RS/1 buyers thought their product waslacking in these areas.andM;&quot;In order to use RS/1 effectively you have to be on the ball witheverything--computers, mathematics and presentation,&quot; said the chemist.andO;&quot;It's almost as if you have to be a programmer to get anything out of it.&quot;andM;SAS garnered the highest scores in product support categories, with scoresnotably ahead of its competitors.andM;&quot;The support SAS Institute offers is outstanding,&quot; said Prusinski.andP;  &quot;They area solid organization that is always responsive.andP;  They seem to have a goodvision of the users' computing environment.&quot;andM;&quot;[STSC's] support is not very responsive.andP;  It's often taken tham a couple ofdays to get back to me,&quot; said Middleton.andM;&quot;Not only have I had to wait several days for an answer from [STSC], I've hadto call them back to finally get an answer,&quot; said Susan Nugent, a PC operatorat Zimmer Inc., an orthopedic-implant manufacturer.andM;According to buyers, the packages also differ greatly in their graphicscapabilities.andP;  In this category, an 18-points spread exists betweenhighest-scoring Statgraphics and lowest-scoring SPSS.andM;&quot;Graphics are a strong selling point for Statgraphics.andP;  For engineeringreports, the graphics work well, as far as being able to show what I want andmodify it if necessary,&quot; said Middleton.andM;&quot;SPSS&quot; graphics are extremely poor,&quot; said Prusinski.andP;  &quot;all they did waslicense another vendor's package to incorporate within their package.andP;  Wewere looking for the ability to map and do three-dimensional contour plots.andO;It's just not there.&quot;andM;The largest gaps between products are evident in the area of value relativecost.andP;  NCSS scored nine points ahead of the pack, and RS/1 trailed the otherproducts by 10 points.andM;&quot;NCSS offers a lot of capability for the price--that's the key,&quot; saidMorgan's Kiefer.andP;  &quot;I looked at a number of different packages, and NCSS is inthe several-hundred-dollar range, as opposed to being priced at over athosand [dollars].&quot;andM;&quot;I would categorize RS/1 as a terrible buy,&quot; said Mike Rourke, an engineer atMead Corp., a paper manufacturer.andP;  &quot;The package seems five to eight years outof date.&quot;andM;Reeco's Barker agreed: &quot;If asked for a recommendation, I would say don't buyit; there are better packages available that will do the job better and costless.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
