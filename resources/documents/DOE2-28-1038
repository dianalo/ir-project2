Despite the drastic slowdown, however, the globalnuclear enterprise is large. As of mid-1986, the world had 366 nuclearpower plants in operation, with a generating capacity of 255,670 MW.These facilities generate about 15% of the world's electricity, rangingfrom 65% in France to 31% in West Germany, 23% in Japan, 16% in the UnitedStates, 10% in the Soviet Union, and non in most developing nations.Nuclear development is clearly dominated by the most economically powerfuland technologically advanced nations. The United States, France, theSoviet Union, Japan, and West Germany has 72% of the world's generatingcapacity and set the international nuclear pace. The reasons for scalingback nuclear programs are almost as diverse as the countries themselves.High costs, slowing electricity demand growth, technical problems, mismanagement,and political opposition have all had an effect. Yet these various factorsactually form a complex web of inter-related problems. For example, risingcosts usually represent some combination of technical problems and mismanagement,and political opposition often occurs because of safety concerns or risingcosts. 13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
