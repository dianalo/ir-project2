But Western analysts warn that such restrictions could heighten tensions in East Germany and ultimately cause more popular unrest there.    The disclosure of stricter travel restrictions was made in the West German newspaper Die Welt. Citing unnamed Western diplomatic sources in East Berlin, the paper reported that the East German government planned to restrict travel to Hungary drastically starting next Friday. A spokesman for the East German Foreign Ministry, Denis Ruh, called that report &quot;an outright lie,&quot; and said the government's policy in granting Hungarian travel visas hadn't changed.    &quot;These lies are being spread in Cold War style to create confusion and to slander East Germany,&quot; Mr. Ruh was quoted as telling the East German news agency, ADN.    However, several Western diplomats confirmed the substance of the Welt report. They noted, moreover, that according to their information, the East German government already has instituted stricter travel policies. They said there has been a sharp reduction in the number of visas granted for Hungarian travel, although they declined to provide specific numbers.    &quot;We have strong indications of more restrictive practices in granting travel permission to Hungary,&quot; said one adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking on the condition he not be named.    Some 200,000 East Germans currently are on vacation in Hungary. East Berlin reckons that as many as 10,000 probably won't return once the vacation season ends this month, the adviser noted. The sudden exodus this summer of refugees from East Germany has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Bonn and East Berlin. More than 2,000 East Germans have fled to the West in the past four days alone in the largest wave of emigration since construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Western analysts expect the emigre count to swell to more than 100,000 this year as East Germans flee a country whose leaders scorn the reforms now taking hold in neighboring Communist states such as Poland and Hungary.    Many of these refugees have poured through the recently dismantled border barriers between Hungary and Austria. Others have sought refuge in West German diplomatic missions in Eastern Europe.    Just yesterday, for instance, 108 East Germans who occupied the West German Embassy in Budapest were allowed passage to the West at dawn. The Hungarian state news agency said the government took the action &quot;on the basis of humanitarian considerations.&quot; Meanwhile, more than 250 East Germans continue to occupy West German missions in East Berlin and Prague, Czechoslovakia.    Whether the East German government can extricate itself from its current crisis is a question that confounds Western analysts. However, most agree that East Germany is lurching toward crisis. Above all, it is a crisis that the nation's aging leaders seem utterly confused by. With the rest of the East bloc swept up in a tide of economic and political change, East Berlin has steadfastly stuck to its old ways. Yet the government, led by 77-year-old Erich Honecker, appears almost incapable of governing at a time that demands new ideas.    Even the economy, which once clanked along in dependable fashion, seems to have turned against the leadership. Although East Germany remains the East bloc's most successful economy, the nation is beginning to experience Polish-style shortages in many commodities, including fruits and vegetables.    As the nation's economic performance has slipped, so, too, has the relative value of its currency. Fifteen East German marks now buy one Deutsche mark; as recently as two years ago, the black market exchange rate was five to one. (Officially, the two German states observe a one-to-one parity.)    The economic troubles, coupled with growing dissatisfaction at the government's stiff resistance to democratic reform, have greatly fueled discontent. Western diplomats fear that further restrictions in travel will only add to the feelings of frustration. </TEXT></DOC>
