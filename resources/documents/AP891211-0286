President Reagan's unprecedented firing of 11,400 striking airtraffic controllers in 1981 touched off a decade of retreat forAmerican labor.   Many historians say the 1980s will go down as a pivotal era whenonce-powerful unions faced assault from a mix of politicalconservatism, deregulation, America's declining economic might anda barrage of corporate takeovers that resulted in unfamiliar ownersand sudden layoffs.   While more than 12 million people joined the work force in thiscountry, union membership shrank by 3 million and organizers gropedfor strategies to survive.   Corporate clout strengthened as quickly as union power faded.Bosses formerly cowed by the muscle of big labor reclaimed theadvantage in contract talks, threatening to close plants and cutjobs unless they got concessions.   Union-busting, once the work of hired thugs wielding baseballbats and shotguns, was revived in the form of court orders, cleverpublicity and right-to-work legislation, labor activists say.   ``You don't look under `union busters' in the phone book,'' saidLorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO in Washington. ``Youlook under `security,' `attorneys,' and `public relations firms.'''   The decade will be remembered by activists as the time whenairline boss Frank Lorenzo broke unions by enforcing his way inbankruptcy court, and federal prosecutors hobbled the mightyTeamsters union with racketeering charges in criminal court.   It will be remembered by the United Auto Workers as the timewhen Tennessee recruits of a Japanese carmaker told one of thenation's biggest unions to go away.   By the end of the decade, instead of fighting for higher wages,unions were struggling to retain past victories in such areas ashealth insurance, job security and pensions.   Labor also faced assault from another direction, the lure ofemployees becoming bosses themselves. Employee stock ownershipplans multiplied, affecting companies that ranged from lumber millsto car rentals.   The rise of ESOPs, as they are called, was part of a largertrend of takeovers and restructurings that sought to maxmizereturns to shareholders _ often at the expense of jobholders.   ``Clearly the employers have had the initiative in the last 10years,'' said Kim Moody, executive director of the Labor Educationand Research Project in Detroit. ``This has forced the unions intoa more defensive posture.''   The catalyst for the retreat was the ill-fated strike by theProfessional Air Traffic Controllers Association, which presentedRonald Reagan with the biggest domestic challenge in the first yearof his presidency.   He ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to dismiss andreplace the strikers, stunning the union and temporarily wreakinghavoc on the nation's network of commercial air traffic. A fewmonths later, PATCO dissolved, most of its members jobless andbitter.   ``Obviously when you have a president who goes in and busts aunion, it sends a strong signal to other industries,'' said Ms.McHugh. ``If the president can do it, you can, too.''   Richard Belous, a labor economist with the National PlanningAssociation, a Washington-based research group, said the PATCOstrike marked the end of three decades of union advances.   ``It had tremendous symbolism,'' he said. ``The strike gavemanagement the intestinal fortitude to do things it wouldn't havedone before.''   Others said the economy's weakness in the beginning of thedecade played an important role in eroding union influence, byundermining the premise that a union shop means secure jobs.   Deregulation was another major factor, said Alvin Bauman, adivision chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington.   ``Where you once had a monopoly dominated by unionized firms,deregulation made it possible for non-union firms to come in andcompete.''   Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show about 20.1 millionworking Americans belonged to unions in 1980, about 23 percent ofthe total work force. By last year the number of union members hadshrunk to 17 million or 16.8 percent of the total.   Union leaders contend they are not passive observers in theunraveling of their power.   While attention focused on the UAW's embarassing failure at theNissan Motors plant in Smyrna, Tenn., earlier this year, the BakeryWorkers union organized a Russell Stover candy plant down the road.   The UAW itself has organized other professional workers thisdecade in an effort to diversify. UAW members now range from officeclerks to jai-alai players.   Although business groups contend labor's use of the strike isdeclining because it is ineffective, unions say the strike remainsone of their potent weapons.   The Machinists union strike against the prosperous Boeing Co.,for example, was approved overwhelmingly in September and produceda victory for the workers in less than two months.   A protracted strike this fall by the Communications Workers ofAmerica and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers againstNynex Corp., one of the Baby Bell telephone companies, forced it tocapitulate on a key demand of the strikers, employer-paid healthinsurance.   Organized labor helped defeat the appointment of Reagan'sSupreme Court nominee Robert Bork, partly because of his perceivedanti-union views.   Perhaps their most important victory of the decade, laborleaders say, was congressional passage of a plant closing law in1988, which gives workers at least 60 days' notice of layoffs.   The law was designed to stem the growing number of companiesthat have shut factories without warning and moved manufacturing tocheaper locations _ Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.   But some say the law is a hollow victory that could discouragepotential employers from establishing new businesses in the UnitedStates. Some even see the law as a symbol of labor's weakness.   ``I think it's going to be a very hard time for labor in the1990s,'' Belous said. ``Labor has been pushed back from the 40-yardline to the 10-yard line.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
