The plan to propose a new safety standard for chemicalplants, incorporating policies already followed voluntarilyby many companies, was disclosed in a department report toPresident Bush covering the explosions last October at aPhillips Petroleum Co. plastics complex near Houston. Thecatastrophe, one of the worst chemical-facility disasterssince World War II, killed 23 workers and injured more than130.</LP><TEXT>   The department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration plans to propose that chemical companies berequired to take such steps as evaluating chemical-plantvalves to see if any pose a safety hazard, training companyand contractor workers properly, ensuring that valves can beclosed easily if chemical material is clogged in pipes, andmanaging changes in procedures that could pose new safetyproblems, Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell said.   Mr. Scannell, who runs OSHA, told a news conference, &quot;Ithink we've got to do something right away&quot; to make sure thatsimilar disasters don't occur. He said the proceduresencompassed by the coming proposal are ones that Phillipsplants are supposed to follow, but didn't at the Houstoncomplex.   While the petrochemical industry has had a lower injuryrate than many other industries, major disasters haveoccurred in the industry, including a 1984 accident thatkilled more than 2,000 in Bhopal, India, and a 1985 explosionin Mexico City that killed about 650 that same year, thereport said. It said accidents in the industry resulted fromsuch factors as inadequate attention to the recognition ofhazards, poorly maintained equipment, poor planning, andunsafe work practices.   Last week, OSHA cited Phillips for $5.7 million in fineson charges of willful violation of OSHA rules, includingfailure to follow company-prescribed methods of protectingworkers against fire and explosion hazards. Fines of $730,000were also proposed against Fish Engineering andamp; ConstructionInc., a Houston-area company doing maintenance work on thePhillips site when the explosions took place.   OSHA traced the Houston explosions to Phillips's failureto provide a backup valve or other means of preventing theescape of gases when a single ball valve wasn't closed duringrepairs. Polyethylene particles clogged settling legs in apipe system, and were being cleared, when a buildup of highlyflammable gases escaped from the unattended settling legs,OSHA said.   OSHA's plans for a chemical-process management rule werealready in the works before the Houston disaster, officialssaid. Now, the agency also will revise its priorities, tobetter identify &quot;catastrophic risks&quot; in the petrochemicalindustry, such as those posed by the use of contractors, Mr.Scannell said.   The agency also released a preliminary report by the JohnGray Institute, which concluded that petrochemical companiesare relying more on contractors, and that contract workershave a high turnover rate, sustain more injuries, get lesssafety training than permanent workers, and work under loosersafety supervision.   Mr. Scannell said injury reports for chemical plants coveronly permanent workers, a situation that may mask higherinjury rates for on-site contractors.</TEXT></DOC>
