Participants described the day's market activity as drivenby activity in mark rates, with the dollar and Swiss francemerging as the main beneficiaries of the West Germancurrency's weakness.</LP><TEXT>   The mark weakened on news that Mr. Kohl's governingcoalition lost its majority in the upper house of the WestGerman parliament as a result of losses in state electionsSunday, traders said. Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats governin a coalition with the Bavarian Christian Social Union, asister party, and with the centrist Free Democrats.   It was feared the loss of the upper house to theleft-of-center Social Democrats could complicate thereunification process as the government tries to rushlegislation through parliament in order to meet a strictdeadline for monetary and economic unification. Mr. Kohl'sgovernment has set July 2 as the effective date of a statetreaty covering the monetary, economic and social aspects ofthe Germanys' reunification.   Traders emphasized, however, that the market remainsbullish on the mark in the long term.   &quot;The election throws a wrench into the works to somedegree, but both {the Christian Democrats and SocialDemocrats} still want unification&quot; and neither will letpolitical bickering get in the way of the bottom line, saidBill English, senior trader at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura in New York.   Despite some gains against the mark and other currenciesyesterday, the dollar exhibited the fundamental weakness thatcaused its losses Friday, said John McCarthy, chief foreignexchange dealer at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V. in New York.   The dollar's gains yesterday came from special factorsweakening the mark, and the currency was steadied againstother units by underlying support from surging U.S. stockprices, Mr. McCarthy said. The Dow Jones Industrial Averageended the day at a new all-time high of 2,821.53, up 19.95points. The previous record high had been 2,810.15 points,reached last Jan. 2.   The Swiss franc also benefited from the mark's weakness,traders said. The Swiss unit attracted buyers because ofSwitzerland's high interest rates and comparative politicalstability, they said.   The switch to the franc from the mark following news ofthe West German election results helped the Swiss unit extendits gains against the dollar for the second consecutive day,they said.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6425 marks, up from its close of 1.6380 marks in verylate trading Friday. At about 4 p.m. Friday, the dollar wasat 1.6478 marks, but then subsequently continued falling tothe 1.6380-mark level.   The dollar was quoted at 152.47 yen in late dealingsyesterday, down slightly from 152.65 yen late Friday.Sterling was quoted at $1.6825, up from $1.6790 Friday.   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency wasquoted at 151.70 yen, down sharply from Monday's Tokyo closeof 153.35 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about1.6455 marks.   Yesterday's focus on the mark relegated dollar-yendealings to the back burner following Friday's sharp yenjump. The U.S. currency spent the New York day little changedfrom Friday's closing level against the yen.   Market activity generally was muted yesterday byparticipants' preparation for important economic indicatorsdue later in the week, dealers said.   Participants said the most important economic figureexpected during the week is the Consumer Price Index forApril, due tomorrow.   The CPI is being awaited as a further signal ofinflationary pressure on the U.S. economy, and by extension,an indication of which direction interest rates will take,said Dell' Agricoltura's Mr. English and Peter Iversen, atrader at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $368.40 an ounce, down 40 cents.Estimated volume was a moderate two million ounces.
