Mario Cuomo on Friday praisedJesse Jackson's leadership, vision and contributions to theDemocratic Party, but firmly restated his neutrality until afterJune 7 in the race between Jackson and Michael Dukakis for theDemocratic nomination for president.   Cuomo and Jackson held a joint news conference following a1{-hour private meeting, which Cuomo said he requested.   Cuomo, who ranked near the top of many polls of presidentialcontenders until he unequivocally ruled out a draft on his behalf,praised both Jackson and Dukakis and said the differences betweenthem were minor.   Agreeing with Cuomo's unified-party theme, Jackson muted hisrecent criticism of Dukakis during the news conference and joinedin praise of the Massachusetts governor, saying, ``We fundamentallyare on the same side of history.''   ``I do not believe Michael Dukakis would handle (allegations ofimpropriety by Attorney General) Ed Meese the way (Vice President)George Bush has. Mike Dukakis would handle South Africa quitedifferently from George Bush,'' Jackson added.   Jackson was campaigning in San Francisco for California's June 7Democratic primary, where 336 delegates are at stake. Cuomo was inthe city to deliver a fund-raising address for Democratic Rep.Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.   Cuomo brushed aside questions of why he asked Jackson to meetwith him by joking that it helps him politically with some groupsto be seen with Jackson.   The two described their topics of discussion as politics andunifying the Democratic Party after the nominating convention inJuly.   Cuomo said he didn't think Jackson's recent criticism of Dukakisas someone who lacks vision would hurt the party, saying: ``I thinkthis is a legitimate and productive process.''   Responding to questions about his plans for endorsing acandidate, Cuomo repeated his earlier statement that ``thefront-runner after California and New Jersey should be supported atthe convention.''   That position almost guarantees Cuomo's eventual endorsement ofDukakis. According to The Associated Press delegate count, Dukakishas 1,597 and Jackson has 944. A total of 2,081 delegates areneeded to nominate.   But Jackson immediately praised Cuomo's stand on an endorsement,saying that ``waiting until after June 7 is the appropriate thingto do. That was the governor's commitment, and he has remained trueto his position.''   Cuomo balanced his references to what appears to be a futureDukakis endorsement with lavish praise of Jackson.   ``The Democratic Party needs (the) Rev. Jackson for his personalinput, for his personal capacity, for his ability to deal with theissues intelligently _ not just to articulate them, which he doeswith eloquence and effectiveness, but understanding the issues,especially questions of foreign policy,'' Cuomo said.   He said the party needs ``Jesse Jackson personally. If not asthe nominee, and he is surely the underdog, we need hiswholehearted participation in the process.   ``If anyone fails to see that, then they don't deserve to be inpositions of leadership in our party,'' Cuomo said.   Dukakis is ``a man of great intelligence, great sensitivity andgreat practicality,'' Cuomo said, adding, ``I'm certain he knows asclearly as I do, and perhaps more clearly, how important Jesse isto the process.''   In other appearances Friday, Jackson continued to put the fightagainst drugs at the center of his presidential platform, and hecriticized the ``Just Say No'' anti-drug campaign sponsored by theadministration.   Earlier at a Los Angeles-area treatment center, Jackson shookhands with addicts, blasted street gangs and said Dukakis lacks astrong anti-drug policy during a campaign stop at a narcoticstreatment center.   ``So far, the governor has not put forth a comprehensive plan,and the president's plan is limited,'' Jackson said. ``There is theJesse Jackson proposal, there is the Reagan-Bush proposal. At thistime there is no other for the war on drugs.''   As he campaigned in Oregon and Los Angeles, Jackson criticized aproposed deal between the Reagan administration and Panamanianleader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on drugcharges.   ``It's not enough to just say no out of one side of the WhiteHouse, then have drug dealers on the CIA payroll on the other sideof the White House,'' he said at a Portland, Ore., news conference.``Our children's lives are at stake.''</TEXT></DOC>
