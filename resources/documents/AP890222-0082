The operator of the plant, which processes uranium for nuclearweapons, says that the Feed Materials Production Center is safe andthat the urine sampling analyses it uses to test people forradiation exposure are reliable.   In addition, the tests have been vindicated by outsidelaboratories, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio announced Tuesday.   The EPA made the decision last week after two of its inspectors,including Catherine McCord, chief EPA inspector at the plant, werecontaminated with uranium in December while attending meetings atthe facility, which is 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati. The plantis owned by the federal Energy Department.   Anne Rowan, a spokeswoman in the EPA's Chicago regional office,said the EPA had not seen Westinghouse's announcement about thevindicated tests and was unfamiliar with it.   ``We have not changed our position,'' Ms. Rowan said.   She said the EPA is investigating its own testing methods, whichshowed that its inspectors were exposed to uranium.   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also is keepinginspectors away from the plant until the exposure problems arecorrected.</TEXT></DOC>
