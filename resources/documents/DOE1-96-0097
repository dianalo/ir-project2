Photo-electrochemical(PEC) solar cells with n-WSe/sub 2//l/sup -/, l/sub 2//Pt have been fabricated.In order to improve upon the efficiency, the effective WSe/sub 2/ crystalsurfaces have been etched in aqua-regia. We have obtained a high PECconversion efficiency, up to 17.1%. This corresponds to the most efficientWSe/sub 2/-based PEC solar cell reported so far. Evidence and argumentshave been presented to show that the high efficiency ({similar_to} 17.1%)is achieved due to the combined effect of improved crystal quality, obtainedthrough a SeCl/sub 4/ transporter, and a decrease in the density of surfacesteps consequent to photo-etching.</TEXT></DOC>
