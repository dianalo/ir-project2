The 16 NATO foreign ministers meeting here today and Friday planto focus on the outlook for Eastern Europe in light of Mikhail S.Gobachev's push for reforms in the Soviet Union.   Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary-general, said the alliancehas a great interest in the new Soviet policy of political andeconomic change ``and what effect it will have on us.''   The Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization holds itssemiannual spring assembly in Madrid on Thursday and Friday.   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said``Eastern Europe will be a testing ground for Gorbachev'sreforms.'' The official added that the United States will urge itsEuropean allies not to aid Eastern European countries unless theyundertake substantial political reforms.   The United States has been ``making the point all along thateconomic reform is not going to work unless there is politicalreform as well,'' the official said.   The United States will be represented by Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz; Alton Keel Jr, U.S. ambassador to NATO; andRoseanne Ridgeway, the assistant secretary of state for Europeanaffairs.   No formal communique will be issued when the meeting endsFriday, but Carrington said he would read a brief statement.   East European nations in the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet bloc'scounterpart of NATO, are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union.   Carrington said the NATO ministers would also discuss armscontrol and how NATO members divide up the cost of Western defense.That includes transferring 72 U.S. F-16 fighter-bombers from Spainto Italy, acceding to a Spanish demand that the fighter wing leaveits soil.   The Council's meeting in Madrid is the first in Spain since itjoined NATO in May 1982.   Spain is not integrated into the NATO military command inaccordance with a March 1986 referendum in which Spaniards alsovoted to remain in NATO only on condition that U.S. militarypresence in Spain be substantially reduced.   The American official said the United States planned to tell itsallies it feels it is carrying the financial burden of NATO'sdefense.   He said Congress will probably seek a reduction in the 325,000U.S. troops stationed in Europe unless this burden is moreequitably distributed.</TEXT></DOC>
