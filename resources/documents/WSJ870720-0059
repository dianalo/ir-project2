Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's conservative government severed relations Friday, as a relatively minor diplomatic spat escalated out of control. The rupture threatened the safety of five French hostages in Lebanon, ended Mr. Chirac's long-standing efforts to improve ties with Iran and raised questions about the safety of at least eight French diplomats still in Tehran. Iran threatened to hold the Frenchmen as spies, an echo of the 1980 U.S. hostage crisis.    Mr. Chirac's government, continuing the policy of its Socialist predecessor, has tried to bargain with the Iranians as part of its efforts to gain the release of the five hostages. Until now, it has refrained from any inflammatory rhetoric against Iran. France is also widely believed to have sold arms to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war.    But Mr. Chirac, who intends to run for the presidency next May, has scored his best political successes recently in the battle against terrorists. Police have dismantled several major terrorist rings, involving Iranians, North African Arabs, Lebanese and French suspects. The arrests have been credited with ending a wave of bombings that began last September, killing 11 people, injuring 150 and badly hurting tourism in France.    The break in diplomatic relations is a direct result of the continuing anti-terrorist drive. Tensions between France and Iran began heating up last month, when a French magistrate sought to question an Iranian Embassy interpreter in connection with the bombings. The interpreter, Wahid Gordji, who the French say doesn't have diplomatic immunity, has refused to leave the refuge of the embassy and answer the magistrate's questions.    In severing diplomatic ties Friday, France proposed the closure of the embassies in Tehran and Paris by Wednesday and the exchange of both countries' remaining diplomats. This proposal was still being discussed over the weekend by the Iranian charge d'affaires in Paris and the French government.    Such a swap could end a stalemate that has left both nations' embassies surrounded by security forces. In Paris, riot police have ringed the Iranian Embassy and its estimated 40 occupants since June 30, shining searchlights on the building throughout the night. In Tehran, Revolutionary Guards have taken up positions around the French Embassy.    French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond said last night that negotiations were proceeding &quot;normally,&quot; but that France wouldn't yield in its determination to force Mr. Gordji to answer a magistrate's questions. &quot;This point is not negotiable,&quot; he said.    Mr. Raimond defended the government's past overtures to Iran as an attempt to normalize relations as other countries have done. He denied that the Chirac government had sold or offered to sell Iran arms. He also denied that the rupture was a defeat for France. &quot;If anyone has been defeated, it's the country that tried to intimidate us,&quot; he said.    The government's decision to break relations was immediately praised for its &quot;firmness&quot; by French politicians on both the left and the right. Jacques Barrot, a parliamentary member of Mr. Chirac's right-wing coalition, said France had no other choice, &quot;faced with blackmail and fanaticism.&quot; Socialist Party spokesman Jean-Jack Queyranne called the move &quot;serious but necessary.&quot;    It is unclear what effect France's action will have on the wider problems of tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Iran-Iraq war and troubled U.S.-Iranian relations. France, which has prided itself on an independent policy in the Middle East even when the policy hasn't worked, will almost certainly continue to go its own way.    The French government hasn't backed U.S. proposals to escort foreign oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, although the French Navy does escort French ships. And France didn't break with Iran until a combination of provocation and domestic pressure forced it to; the U.S. and Britain had broken or reduced their levels of diplomatic relations long before.    Meantime, a pro-Iranian group in Lebanon reportedly threatened to kill two of the hostages, diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine, after the diplomatic break was made. This report couldn't be confirmed, the French Foreign Ministry said.    For its part, Iran said it wanted to arrest the French counsul in Tehran, Paul Torri, on charges of spying and drug smuggling. France has dismissed the charges as absurd, but Mr. Torri has been forced to remain in the embassy to avoid arrest. An unconfirmed report from Iran yesterday said the Iranian Interior Ministry planned to arrest a number of French diplomats as &quot;spies.&quot;    The French did say that the Italian Embassy would look after French interests in Iran while relations remain severed, just as the Swiss look after U.S. interests there.    French officials continued to be optimistic that the negotiations would lead to the departure of the diplomats still inside the French Embassy in Tehran. Mr. Chirac's gamble could come unstuck if these diplomats are prevented from leaving by the Iranians, or tried on spying charges. </TEXT></DOC>
