At a hearing of the National Assembly's finance committee,Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the government will order acriminal investigation in the case, regardless of the conclusions ofa report expected next week from the commission that overseesoperations of France's stock exchange.   ``This affair will not be covered up, and I think that's a changein comparison with a slightly earlier period,'' Beregovoy said, in aveiled reference to political scandals the Socialists say were leftunresolved under previous conservative governments.   Commission reports usually are not made public, but Mitterrandissued a statement late Thursday saying he and other top governmentofficials had agreed to make an exception and release the reportbeing prepared in this case.   French, American and Swiss investigators have been looking intosuspicious trading in shares of the U.S. firm Triangle IndustriesInc., just before it was acquired last fall by the state-ownedFrench metals producer Pechiney SA.   Some investors made quick profits by buying Triangle stock atabout $10 a share and selling them a few days later, followingPechiney's takeover bid Nov. 21, at $56 a share. These investorsinclude Roger-Patrice Pelat, a retired businessman who is perhapsMitterrand's oldest and closest friend.   Pelat has refused comment on suggestions he benefitted frominside information and says he won't say anything until after thestock exchange commission makes its report.   The scandal has led to the resignation of Beregovoy's chief ofstaff, Alain Boublil, who said he quit so he could defend hisinnocence more vigorously.   Both the Communist Party and the conservative Rally for theRepublic party have been calling for an independent parliamentaryinquiry.   Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the Rally for the Republic, hadtold reporters he was ``very worried about the risk of a cover-up.''   ``This affair is more serious than it looks,'' Juppe said. ``Itraises questions about a certain conception of politics and itsrelations with morality. If the general suspicion of corruptioncontinues to weigh on the political community, this is notacceptable.''   French newspaper reports say the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission told its French counterpart it was looking into purchasesof about 220,000 shares in Triangle just before the takeover bid.   Only sketchy information about most of the buyers has becomepublic, and there has been little more than speculation about whomight have leaked valuable tips about the imminent takeover bid.   ``My personal conviction is that there was insider trading, butI'm completely unable to prove it,'' Jean Gandois, president ofPechiney, said in an interview on French radio Thursday.   Gandois defended the high price Pechiney paid for Triangle, theparent firm of American National Can, saying it was worth it toestablish the French company as world leader in metal packaging.   Beregovoy told the parliamentary committee that Pechiney'spurchase ``is a good deal and the price paid corresponds to theAmerican market.''   The finance minister said he had asked all his aides who hadadvance knowledge of the takeover ``on their honor'' if they leakedthe information, and the answer ``on their part was that noindiscretion had been committed.''</TEXT></DOC>
