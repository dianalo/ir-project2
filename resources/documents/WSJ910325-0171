The suit alleges apattern of racketeering that includes murder, extortion,embezzlement of union funds and mail fraud. The case isscheduled for trial today.   The settlement with local 1804-1, its board and officersalso calls for the court appointee, yet to be named, tosupervise the local's elections through 1997. In addition, itprovides for broad changes in the local's constitution andby-laws to strengthen financial controls and requires currentofficers to pay $100,000 out of their personal assets to thelocal's general treasury. This is only the second time underRICO prosecution that the defendant has been made to payrestitution, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ping Moy.
