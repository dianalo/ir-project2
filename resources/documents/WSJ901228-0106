Jonathan, a gay man approaching his 30s, feelsdetached and alone. Why, he asks, can't he make a life forhimself?   But the conversation is cut short when his father suffersa sudden, agonizing attack of emphysema. As the two slowlymake their way back toward the lights of the parentalcondominium, Jonathan muses: &quot;They were like holes punched inthe night, leaking light from another, more animated world.For a moment I could imagine what it would be like to be aghost -- to walk forever through a silence deeper thansilence, to apprehend but never quite reach the lights ofhome.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A yearning for home -- for a secure and fixed place in theworld -- is what drives this sad, eloquent work of fiction.For the characters whose stories are told here, it is a placejust beyond reach. Families -- at worst something to escape-- are makeshift alliances at best, poor defense against theforces of age, illness and disaffection.   This novel began attracting attention well before itspublication date, when excerpted chapters appeared in the NewYorker. Mr. Cunningham, a 38-year-old writer who has yet toquit his day job at Carnegie Corp., is no writing-workshopupstart. This, his second novel, took six years to write. Hisfirst, the 1984 &quot;Golden States,&quot; has since gone out of print-- the author having decided that it fell short of his ownstandards.   One hopes that a different fate awaits &quot;A Home at the Endof the World.&quot; Told in four different voices, this is thestory of Jonathan and Bobby, who become boyhood friends inCleveland during the 1970s. Jonathan, a pensive outsider,feels stifled by his close relationship with his mother. Thedrug-dazed and disheveled Bobby is the casualty of a familytragedy that begins with the death of his adored olderbrother. The two boys escape their unhappy home lives bysmoking dope, playing rock records and engaging in furtivesex.   Standing just outside this charmed circle are two women.Jonathan's mother, Alice, a dissatisfied housewife, seesBobby as a threat, but takes him in out of pity and her ownboredom. As the novel shifts to the boys' East Coastadulthood, the mother role is picked up by Clare, an olderwoman who becomes Jonathan's East Village roommate during hisstint as restaurant critic for a hip Manhattan paper.   The pair play at keeping house: Clare is the &quot;half-lover&quot;Jonathan lives with and confides in, but for sex -- andnothing else -- Jonathan turns to Erich, a lonely would-beactor. When the now-orphaned Bobby moves in -- having beengently pushed from the nest by his surrogate mother, Alice --Clare and Jonathan acquire a token son.   This offbeat family takes a step closer to reality whenClare, desperate for a more literal kind of motherhood, takesBobby into her bed and conceives a child with him. The threeset up camp in a dilapidated Woodstock house, with both menplaying father to the infant Rebecca.   What keeps the novel from degenerating into a paean to thenontraditional family is Mr. Cunningham's surgeon-likedetachment from his characters' confused longings. This NewAge family cracks just like a traditional one. &quot;At least welove each other. Didn't you say that first?&quot; Bobby asks, onlyto be told by an increasingly moody Clare: &quot;Maybe I did.About a thousand years ago.&quot;   Nor does the novel lapse into sentimentality when thehousehold acquires a token grandfather in Erich, who is dyingof AIDS. Here, the virus -- which is never mentioned by name-- just seems like another form of the alienation that eachof the trio seems to suffer from. Jonathan, who is probablyinfected himself, remarks on a &quot;a floating sensation, as ifyour hours didn't add up to whole days and your presence . .. didn't affect the landscape as human presences ordinarilydo.&quot; And AIDS fails to bring the characters closer together.Nursing Erich with &quot;the tenderness I hoped I might inspire inothers if my vigor leaked away and my body started tochange,&quot; Jonathan keeps his distance from his &quot;half-lover&quot;until the end.   The territory Mr. Cunningham claims here is fairlywell-traveled: a gay man dying of AIDS, a middle-aged womanrushing to beat her biological clock, a son estranged fromhis parents. But the unsparing clarity of his prose makesthem seem fresh and interesting. Even the toddler Rebecca,who at the age of two discovers &quot;the lush possibility ofsaying no,&quot; is satisfyingly unpredictable.   The only time the novel jars is when it shifts from thecharacters' speaking voices to their more meditativenarrational ones. This is most glaring with Bobby, who goesfrom inarticulate sentences studded with &quot;likes&quot; and&quot;reallys&quot; to eloquent, even lyrical passages of prose.   But it's hard to complain about prose so finely pitched.Bobby, bathing a dying Erich, sees him as &quot;lost in his ownmystery, staring into a hole that keeps opening and opening.&quot;Even the smallest details are sharp-edged and vivid:Rebecca's abandoned doll lies &quot;grinning with stony rapture atthe sky.&quot;   Images like these, which fuse the taut, distilled imageryof a poem with the immediacy of a snapshot are what make thisnovel so memorable.</TEXT></DOC>
