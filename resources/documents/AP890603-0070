But they say the president's sweeping proposals for slashingtroops and weapons in Europe will broaden East-West bargaining atthe Vienna arms talks and ensure that an eventual accord will bewide-ranging.   ``It will be a more comprehensive set of negotiations and a morecomprehensive agreement,'' said Richard Fieldhouse, a researchfellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute inSweden.   ``That also means,'' he said, ``it will be more difficult.''   Bush wants the talks brought to ``an early and satisfactoryconclusion'' within six to 12 months and their results implementedno later than 1993.   John Cross, deputy director of the London-based InternationalInstitute for Strategic Studies, said the Bush initiative``produces better prospects than hitherto for striking an armscontrol bargain.''   But he cautioned it will be ``impossibly hard without anenormous amount of good will'' between the East and Westnegotiators to bring the talks to an end a year from now.   Bush's unveiling of the plan at a summit of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization was an attempt by the West to seize the armscontrol initiative from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   It also let the leaders of the 16 NATO nations emerge from their40th anniversary celebration united.   ``They got their act together and confirmed they have very muchmore in common on what really matters,'' said Cross.   The president's bargaining offer calls for sharp cuts in Sovietand American troops stationed in Europe and in tanks, artillery andother conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.   Moreover, Bush said the United States, in a turnabout, would bewilling to negotiate reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters.   The inclusion of aircraft, analysts say, will expand thediscussions to an important area of concern. But it also will makethe talks tougher because of the difficulty in defining attackplanes.   Bush also urged that the two sides agree to destroy all weaponsthat are singled out for reductions and that the troops bedisbanded.   His proposal was unanimously adopted by the other 15 delegatesat the meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels.   They agreed to let experts take a look at the plan and draw up adetailed offer to put on the bargaining table when talks resume inSeptember. The Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations beganlast March between the NATO nations and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.They cover the region spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the UralMountains in the Soviet Union.   Analysts had predicted the discussions would last several yearsat least. Previous negotiations dragged on 15 years with noagreement.   Fieldhouse said, ``It's clear enough that the two alliances havesimilar enough objectives and enough common ground to reach anaccord.''   Such an agreement, said Cross, would reduce substantially themilitary threat in Europe but not erase the military might.   The Soviet Union, he said, will remain a powerful force and NATOwill have enough strength to mount a defense if needed.   Under the American plan, troop densities would be thinned.   Bush proposed that both sides reduce their troop strength inEurope to 275,000 on each side. That would mean a cut, according toU.S. estimates, of 350,000 for the Soviets and 30,000 for theUnited States.   NATO's opening position would require the Warsaw Pact to bigmassive cuts in main battle tanks, artillery and armored troopcarriers, considered key forces in an invasion or surprise attack.   The West would make smaller trims of 5 percent to 10 percent inthose categories.   The NATO allies want the East bloc nations to clip their forcesto a level equal with the West _ and below NATO's current holdings.   Bush's arms control offer helped solve a bitter alliance disputeover the future role of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.   Germany had demanded that NATO enter early talks with theSoviets on reducing tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.   The United States and Britain argued attention should first beplaced on the Soviet Union's enormous superiority in non-nuclearweapons.   The leaders' final statement said they would be prepared todiscuss a partial reduction in battlefield nuclear missiles butonly after implementation of a conventional arms accord was underway.   By underscoring the word ``partial,'' the United States andBritain were able to halt, at least temporarily, a German push forelimination of all those weapons.   Bowing to German pleas, the allies also agreed to put off keydecisions on introducing and deploying a more powerful generationof short-range nuclear missiles until 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
