Support from the airline's pilots gave striking Machinists anearly and impressive boost in their bitter war with Easternmanagement, and other unions have been equally impressive in theirsupport of the strikers, principally through attendance at ralliesand donations to strike funds.   But as the strike enters its third week _ with Eastern all butgrounded and mired in bankruptcy court _ even many labor leadersagree that their nemesis, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, isthe early winner because he is losing less money per day now onEastern than he was before the strike.   But they say the lasting verdict is not yet in, and that thestrike has given labor's morale a much-needed boost.   ``The strike is holding firm and I think it's a great show ofsolidarity,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in an interviewFriday. ``The future of this airline under bankruptcy proceedings islargely uncharted waters. But this man had this company on therocks, and when you're on the rocks, uncharted waters look muchbetter.''   Unions representing Eastern workers marked the two week point ofthe walkout Saturday with a rally across the street from the WhiteHouse, chiding President Bush for not intervening to block thestrike and promising continued solidarity.   ``Our resolve is rock solid and so are our picket lines,'' saidRandy Babbitt of the Airline Pilot Association, which along withEastern's flight attendants union has been honoring pickets ofstriking Machinists.   As labor prepared for the strike, which began when 8,500 membersof the International Association of Machinists walked off the jobMarch 4, its plans included major disruptions of other airlines andrailroads through secondary pickets it believed would be honored byunion workers.   But those efforts have been stymied by court injunctions in NewYork and Washington prohibiting other unions from honoring picketsof Eastern workers. They are appealing those rulings, but laborleaders have not pressed further boycotts because they do not wantto endanger the public support the strikers have garnered.   ``Everything we've done to date is legal, and I think the publicappreciates that and has been on our side,'' said IAM spokesman JimConley.   David Bensman, director of the Labor Studies Program at RutgersUniversity, concurred with that view.   ``If the unions had immediately succeeded in getting sympathystrikes going and disrupting things I think the public might haveturned against the unions,'' Bensman said. ``Labor now has made itscase and painted Lorenzo as an irresponsible employer. I think thathas left labor in a strong position with the public if the strike isexpanded in the future.''   For now, labor's goal is to keep Eastern virtually grounded _ theairline has been able to fly roughly 10 percent of its pre-strikeschedule of 1,040 daily flights _ while pursuing a possibleemployee-led buyout of the company and drafting a unionreorganization plan to counter any proposal Lorenzo submits to thebankruptcy court.   Labor's efforts so far have won praise from outsiders who followthe movement, particularly iteling more powerful leads you toact more powerfully,'' said Bensman. ``It seems to me what hashappened so far has been about as good as the unions could haveexpected.''   Lorenzo has been aided by the bankruptcy filing, the unionsconcede, because it has stopped a financial drain on cash-poorEastern that was $1 million a day before the strike and severaltimes that in the days immediately following the walkout.   ``In many ways he's already won,'' said Conley. ``He's takenhundreds of million in assets from this airline and transferred themto Continental and Texas Air.''   But union leaders are encouraged by indications Lorenzo is tryingto sell the airline and by polls and other indications publicsupport is with the striking workers, who hope anti-Lorenzosentiment will affect non-union Continental, which has been losingmoney nearly as fast as Eastern.   Bensman said labor also has sent a powerful message throughoutthe airline industry, where workers at several carriers have beenforced to accept wage concessions in recent years.   ``If Lorenzo had succeeded here in splitting the Machinists fromthe pilots and then imposing harsh concessions, it would have sentthe green light to management at other airlines,'' he said. ``Laborhas strengthened its position in the industry as a whole.''   Peripheral to the strike itself has been a related politicaldebate and, much like Eastern's ultimate fate, the ramifications ofthe strike in that context remain unclear.   By refusing to block the walkout by naming an emergency mediationboard, Bush has soured his relations with labor. CongressionalDemocrats, who benefit heavily from labor's political warchest, arepushing legislation that would force Bush to intervene but do notappear to have the votes to override a veto.   Kirkland accused Bush of ``siding with a pirate'' by refusing tointervene but said it was too soon to discuss the long-term impactthe strike would have on labor's relations with the newadministration. ``I'm still hopeful better judgment will prevail.''</TEXT></DOC>
