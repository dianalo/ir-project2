The microstructural evolution of the Cr-Wsteels was similar to that of the conventional Cr-Mo steels. Carbidesprecipitated in the martensite and the intermetallic compound Fe/sub2/W precipitated in the {delta}-ferrite of the Cr-W steels. On the otherhand, only carbides precipitated in both the martensite and the {delta}-ferriteof the Cr-V steels. The effect of Cr, W and V on the thermal embrittlementis discussed by taking account of the precipitation behavior.</TEXT></DOC>
