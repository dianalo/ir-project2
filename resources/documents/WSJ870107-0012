But the real winner in the wake of the four-day show, which is expected to attract 100,000 dealers, manufacturers and distributors, could be the consumer. Amid frenetic competition among manufacturers and the swelling ranks of retailers, items with some of the latest bells and whistles are likely to become more affordable.    &quot;The consumers will win on this deal,&quot; predicts George Jones, a senior vice president of Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount-store chain. &quot;They're going to win on compact-disk players, IBM (computer) clones and camcorders,&quot; which combine a camera and videocassette recorder in a single unit.    Competition is expected to heat up in 1987 as growth slows in the industry. Last year, the value of factory sales increased by at least 10% to more than $28 billion, according to preliminary estimates by the Electronic Industry Association. For this year, the trade group foresees a rise of less than 7%.    In addition, the emergence of aggressive South Korean competitors and the significant strengthening of the yen against the dollar may force Japanese electronics companies to take steps favorable for consumers, says Vern Brisson, general manager, distribution, of the U.S. unit of Sharp Corp. &quot;The competition is getting keen from the Koreans, and the Japanese don't want to lose market share without a fight,&quot; he explains. &quot;One way to do that is not to raise your prices and add benefits to your product line.&quot;    Some companies have already done this. For example, picture-enhancing circuitry once found only in VCRs priced $500 and up is now standard on many less expensive machines. &quot;The video market moves so blasted fast that we have had several VCRs that haven't gotten into our catalogs because they were superseded by lower prices or more features or a combination of both,&quot; says Ed Juge, market-planning director for Tandy Corp., the operator of Radio Shack stores.    Of course, exhibitors at the electronics show will unveil plenty of new gizmos. Sharp, for example, is introducing a VCR for people who tend to fall asleep while viewing: At the end of the tape, the machine automatically turns down the sound and replaces the harsh black-and-white lines on the screen with a wave of blue. Also, there will be more variations on the boom box, or portable stereo system, including a number of compact-disk machines and a box from Lloyds Electronics Corp. replete with a second amplifier that can be switched on for extra sound.    There's also a hint of apprehension surrounding the show. Industry officials are anxious about the introduction of digital audiotape -- or DAT -- recorders by several manufacturers. DAT units, which reproduce sound more accurately than conventional, analog machines, are apparently so good that many vendors fear they could cripple the booming sales of compact-disk players. Another product has the movie industry worried: Go-Video Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., is expected to show a VCR that allows users to record a videocassette onto a blank tape within the same unit.    Meanwhile, mass merchandisers are on the prowl for lower-priced products. P.R. Gullet, an electronics buyer with K mart Corp., is looking for stereo color televisions -- which typically retail for $600 or more -- that he can sell to his customers for around $400. &quot;Enough numbers are being built that the companies can get it down to the mass merchants,&quot; he says.    And in fact, some manufacturers may have what he wants. For example, Lloyds Electronics, which sells to many discount chains, plans to introduce a stereo color set that will probably sell in discount stores for between $399 and $449. The model, styled to resemble a professional studio monitor, includes such features as on-screen digital channel and timer displays. Lloyds also plans to include a coupon for free stereo speakers for the new TV. &quot;It wasn't long ago that a regular 19-inch color TV set was in the mid-$300 (range) anyway,&quot; says Randy Marx, the company's president.    As prices continue to decline, stereo TV sets could even become the hottest-selling product in 1987. The Electronic Industry Association figures that as many as 30% of the color TV sets sold in the U.S. this year will have the stereo-sound feature. Such units accounted for about 17% of the 18 million color sets sold here last year, and only 8.9% of the nearly 17 million sets sold in 1985.    Mass merchants also are searching for VCRs with the stereo feature. While most stereo units are still in the $600-and-up range, Samsung Electronics America Inc. is unveiling one at the show that will retail for about $460. The South Korean-made machine, which Samsung believes will fill the gap between the less expensive machines and the high-priced stereo models, is &quot;stereo-capable&quot; -- that is, it can play back stereo videotapes but can't record in stereo.    Target's Mr. Jones and other mass merchants are hoping as well to find less expensive camcorders at the show that are both smaller and have such features as autofocusing. Target has already had &quot;a moderate degree of success&quot; selling a JVC camcorder priced at $1,399, a lot more than most of the chain's customers can afford to pay, Mr. Jones says. &quot;The potential is there to sell a lot&quot; of cheaper camcorders, he adds.    Retailers believe, too, that camcorder prices will decline as manufacturers scramble to introduce new souped-up models, many of which have appeared in a variety of formats. Many companies, such as JVC, have stuck to the commonly used VHS format, while Sony Corp. of America has been marketing models that take smaller, 8-millimeter cassettes.    Samsung plans to market a machine in yet another format, a 4-millimeter camcorder weighing only 2 1/2 pounds and expected to sell for $1,300. Why the new format? &quot;The same reason you have a two-door and a four-door car,&quot; says Donald Kobes, the marketing-services manager. &quot;Someone wants a smaller car.&quot;    An item that mass merchandisers such as K mart and Target still appear to be cool on is the compact-disk player, one of the hottest products of 1986. Although the prices are low enough -- some are available for less than $200 -- the disks themselves are still considered too expensive for many discount-store shoppers.    Compact-disk players &quot;are a growing portion of our business,&quot; says K mart's Mr. Gullet. However, he adds, disk prices will have to be as inexpensive as record albums before the recorders can produce booming sales in mass-market outlets. New disks sell for about about $12.95, compared with an average of $7.99 for traditional records. &quot;That,&quot; he says, &quot;keeps a lot of people out of the market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
