The proposed new regulationsprovided for incorporation of the current provisions of andSection;andSection;143.21(1) and 143.29, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 143.21(1) and 143.29),with certain modifications that provided for the filing of a written applicationand a procedure for Customs aproval of express consignment and hub facilities;established advance manifest requirements; established bond requirements;generally raised the informal entry ceiling to $1,250 for those qualifyingto use the procedures; eliminated the distinction between shipments valuedat $250 or less and those valued in excess thereof; raised the value levelof shipments which must be segregated if an advance manifest is used from$5.00 to $25.00; streamlined informal and formal entry procedures; requiredall entry numbers to be furnished to Customs in a Customs approved barcoded readable format; and permitted the district director to waive productionof entry documents in certain cases.The proposed regulations also provided for the extension of the districtdirector's authority to require the consolidation of shipments under oneentry. The proposed amendments were designed to promote uniform, fair,and consistent treatment of the various courier and express services andmake the procedures available to all operators, carriers, and other entitiesthat meet the criteria, while at the same time assuring the protectionof the revenue in accord with all applicable laws and regulations.Comments on the proposal were to have been received on or before February16, 1988. Pursuant to a request to extend the comment period, Customs extendedthe comment period to March 1, 1988.All imported merchandise entering the Customs territory of the U.S. issubject to procedures relating to entry and clearance. The procedures ensurethe proper valuation, and tariff classification of the merchandise forthe purpose of collecting the lawful amount of duties, as well as compliancewith all other laws and regulations administered and enforced by Customs.Depending upon its value, different procedures are provided for the entryand clearance of merchandise.Formal entry procedures are set forth in Part 141, Customs Regulations(19 CFR Part 141), which are applicable, with certain exceptions, to shipmentsof merchandise valued in excess of $1,000. Informal entry procedures containedin Part 143, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 143), are generally limitedto shipments of merchandise valued at $1,000 or less.Although the procedures for the informal entry of merchandise are lesstechnical and detailed than those for formal entry, they may still presentan impediment to courier and express services seeking to fulfill theirfunction of expedited delivery.The trend in the express consignment industry for time-sensitive clearanceof cargo and the processing of entry documents is well recognized by Customs.Because of the special needs of the growing express consignment industry,by T.D. 86-143, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 22, 1986 (51 FR 26243), informal entryprocedures were adopted. These procedures are set forth in andSection;andSection;143.21(1) and 143.29, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 143.21(1), 143.29). Theseprocedures have helped the industry and Customs to cope with an ever-increasingworkload. Nevertheless, Customs recognized that the procedures could beimproved. In reaching this conclusion, Customs noted that major expressconsignment companies have averaged over a 400% increase in imported cargocarried during the last 2 years while Customs staffing levels have remainedstatic at express industry facilities due to manpower constraints. A further150% increase in volume is expected in the coming year.The Customs Cooperation Council, an international organization in whichthe United States participates, recently examined the express consignmentindustry. It noted the problems raised by on-board and fast parcel servicesas well as the time-sensitive nature of such consignments. The Council'sstudy, as noted in the May 1, 1987, report of its Permanent Technical Committee(Document 34.040), highlighted the need for the Customs services of theCouncil's member countries to provide a rapid reliable control and clearancesystem for this type of traffic.It has now been determined, as stated in the notice, that more detailedand accurate information from the express consignment industry is necessaryfor Customs to streamline its processing. Certain advance information onincoming shipments and full reimbursement for services rendered is necessaryfor Customs to assist the industry while maintaining Customs enforcementposture.The proposed rule set forth revised special informal entry procedures applicableto the express consignment industry in a new Part 128, Customs Regulations(19 CFR Part 128). The new Part 128 defines an express consignment operatoror carrier and certain other terms. It establishes an approval processfor express consignment facilities that, in addition to other requirements,mandates participation in Customs data processing system for entry andentry release processing. These procedures will be available to all operators,carriers and other entities that can meet the criteria set out in theseregulations.Two types of installations presently utilized by the express consignmentindustry are being recognized. The first is a centralized hub facilitywhich is a separate, unique, single purpose facility normally operatingoutside of Customs operating hours; the facility must be approved by thedistrict director for entry filing, examination and release of expressconsignment shipments. The second type of installation is the express consignmentcarrier facility, which is a separate or shared specialized facility approvedby the district director solely for the examination and release of expressconsignment shipments.Because of the high volume of entries that the major overnight courierservices handle under existing criteria, they could qualify to be designatedas a port of entry. As such, Customs inspectional services would be providedat all times at no additional cost to the courier service. All expensesfor providing the service would be allocated out of the annual Customsbudget appropriations in the same manner as it is done at other designatedports of entry.Currently, in accordance with the User Charges Statute (31 U.S.C. 9701),the courier services must reimburse Customs for inspectional service occurringat places other than established ports of entry. The User Charges Statutewas enacted to ensure that Federal Governmental services provided to individualrecipients, as opposed to the general public, are self-sustaining to thegreatest extent possible. The potential establishment of separate portsof entry for individual couriers would, in effect, be contrary to the Congressionalintent concerning the User Charges Statute. Accordingly, by T.D. 87-65,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1987 (52 FR 16328), the port of entryworkload criteria were modified to provide that no more than half of theminimum 2500 consumption entries to be filed at a port can be attributedto one entity. The entity must compensate the Government for services providedunder 31 U.S.C. 9701.The new regulations incorporate the current provisions of andSection;andSection;143.21(1) and 143.29, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 143.21(1), 143.29), withcertain modifications. As revised, they provide for a written applicationand approval process for express consignment and hub facilities; establishadvance manifest requirements; establish bond requirements; raise the informalentry ceiling to $1250 for those qualifying to use the procedures; eliminatethe distinction between shipments valued at $250 or less and those valuedin excess thereof; streamline informal and formal entry procedures; requirethat all entry numbers be furnished to Customs in a Customs approved barcoded readable format; and permit the district director to waive productionof entry documents in certain cases. The district director's current authorityto require the consolidation of shipments under one entry is also extended.These amendments will further promote uniform, fair and consistent treatmentof the various courier and express services and make the procedures availableto all operators, carriers and other entities that can meet the criteria,while at the same time better assure the protection of the revenue in accordwith all applicable laws and regulations.The new Part 128 provides for an application processing fee in connectionwith the facility approval process. It is Customs intent to initially implementa two tiered fee system. A $500 fee would apply to the approval of facilitiesin existence at the time final regulations are published, as well as facilitieswhich are changed or altered after having been previously approved, wheresuch change or alteration does not amount to an expansion. This would coverthe expenses of the district director's review of and response to the application,review of the proposed procedures by the port director and higher levelCustoms officials, and also cover administrative costs. An applicationfee of $1000 would apply to the approval of new or expanded facilities.The fee would cover, in addition to the expenses noted above, facilitydesign review (including blueprint review) and on-site meetings betweencompany and Customs officials to discuss the facility design, operationaland procedural proposals. This fee system would be reviewed and revisedperiodically to reflect changes in expenses. Changes in the fee systemwill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and the Customs Bulletin.In order to conform the numbers of the new Part 128 to the Customs regulatorynumbering scheme, some section numbers are being altered from those appearingin the proposed rule. This does not involve any substantive changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments</ITAG>Seven hundred thirty-three comments were received in response to the noticepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 16, 1987 (52 FR 47229), and the commentperiod extension published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4998). A synopsisand analysis of the comments received, identified by the regulatory section,as contained in the notice, to which they refer, is contained in Part Ibelow. General comments are discussed in Part II. References to the aforementionedrevised section numbers are parenthetically noted in the heading and/orbody of each comment and regulatory provision, as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part I. Section by Section Synopsis and Analysis</ITAG>1. Section 128.1DefinitionsWith respect to the definition of ``express consignment operator or carrier''several commenters suggested that the regulations and the benefits providedthereunder be made available for express consignments transported by allexpress services; i.e., on-board couriers, air freight forwarders, commercialairlines, all-cargo airlines, and post offices, provided that such shipmentsare in fact handled on a truly express basis and that the carrier involvedprovides an appropriate level of cooperation with U.S. Customs. We agreeand have changed the definition of an express operator to:An ``express consignment operator or carrier'' is an entity operating inany mode or intermodally moving cargo by special express commercial serviceunder closely integrated administrative control.Numerous commenters also requested a softening of the term ``guaranteed''contained in the same definition. The requests were based on the fact thatmost international express consignment companies do not guarantee timelydelivery to the public. Therefore, the word ``guaranteed'' has been deletedfrom the definition and the word ``reliable'' substituted.2. Section 128.1(d) and (e)Numerous commenters objected to the distinction made in the definitionsof a ``hub'' and an ``express consignment carrier facility'' and believethat only one definition for a processing facility should exist. We disagree.There is an obvious industry distinction between a ``hub'' and a ``non-hub''operation. Customs developed the two definitions to specifically distinguishprocessing operations between a hub or spoke operation, where all expressconsignment cargo is delivered and random airports operations, where expressconsignment shipments are generally directly delivered to the city of destination.Customs, because of manpower constraints as well as the problems of clearingon-board courier or courier shipments (see andSection; 128.1(c)) in passengerprocessing facilities, must have the option of directing all shipmentsto an ``express consignment carrier facility'' for the examination andrelease of express consignment cargo. In addition, the centralization ofall aspects of the entry processing function has required Customs to establishcentralized locations for the presentation of entry documentation, suchas the Document Analysis Unit (DAU) at Kennedy Airport in New York.3. Section 128.1(f)Several commenters suggested that Customs should only be concerned withthe items imported into the United States and not necessarily the entitiesinvolved in the importation process, and that the regulations and the definitionscontained within should be confined to that issue. We disagree. The intentof the regulations is for the Customs Service to provide special proceduresfor the cargo imported by the express consignment operators or carriers.The two cannot be separated. That was the intent behind the definitionssections, and, in particular, andSection; 128.1(f) dealing with closely integratedadministrative control. However, we do agree with several of the commentssuggesting a change in the phrase contained in andSection; 128.1(f), ``implementedby'' to ``indicated by'' when referring to the control between the localcompany and the foreign affiliate.Several commenters objected to the express consignment operator or carrierbeing responsible for reimbursement to Customs for special enforcementoperations, as required in andSection; 128.1(g). We agree and have revisedthe definition of ``reimbursable'' to include only normal costs.4. Section 128.2 Express Consignment Carrier Application and Approval Process(New Section 128.11)Several commenters suggested that the approval process for express consignmentcarrier hubs or facilities be handled centrally at Customs Headquarters.We disagree. The approval process should remain at the local/district level,since the managers at those levels are more familiar with their particularneeds. However, Customs has developed its own handbook for guidance inthe requirements of these facilities that will be adopted for nationaluse.5. Section 128.2(b)(1) and 128.2(c) (New Section 128.11(b)(1) and 128.11(c))Numerous comments were received regarding andSection; 128.2(b)(1) and 128.2(c)(New andSection; 128.11(b)(1) and 128.11 (c)). The present language seemsto imply that Customs would have total approval of the entire express consignmenthub or facility construction (see andSection; 128.2(c) (New andSection; 128.11(c)).We agree that a clarification is necessary in those two sections, and thatandSection; 128.2(c) (new andSection; 128.11(c)) should also reflect the revocationof approval when changes are implemented to the international cargo processingarea without Customs approval. The two sections have been revised. Section128.2(b)(1), as revised (new andSection; 128.11(b)(1)), refers to a fulldescription of the international cargo facilities rather than the generalterm facilities. Section 128.2(c) (new andSection; 128.11(c)), as revised,will clarify that the changes or alterations referred to are limited toan approved international cargo processing facility. The revised sectionwill also clarify that the failure to obtain prior approval for changesor alterations to the international cargo facility may result in the suspensionof approval as an express consignment facility or hub and the proceduresfor processing cargo contained in this chapter.6. Section 128.2(b)(7)(i) (New Section 128.11(b)(7)(i))One comment was received regarding andSection; 128.2(b)(7)(i) (new andSection;128.11(b)(7)(i)), suggesting, in connection with the contents of the applicationsfor approval of an express consignment carrier or hub facility, that thelanguage be changed to only require formal entry for cargo to be processedin the Customs Automated Commercial System (ACS) and its associated modules.We disagree. We believe that such a change would be restrictive. It wouldnot allow future changes in the ACS system to permit the processing ofinformal entries. It also would prohibit processing of informal entriesand cargo exempt from entry in the Air Cargo Automated Manifest System.Also, it became apparent that while express consignment entities were agreeingto use ACS there was no specific provision that entries be submitted thereunder.In order to clarify this point, andSection; 128.5 (New andSection; 128.23)is being revised. The final version thereof provides that the entry dataconcerning articles subject to entry must be transmitted in accordancewith ACS requirements.7. Section 128.2(b)(7)(v) (New Section 128.11(b)(7)(v))Several comments were received, in connection with the contents of theagreement an express consignment entity must file in connection with itsfacility application, that the language in this subsection is too broad.We disagree. This subsection was included to bring uniformity in the reimbursementof costs incurred by the Customs Service and which are currently beingreimbursed by express consignment operators and carriers operating at so-called``User Fee'' airports.8. Section 128.2(d) (New Section 128.12)Numerous commenters indicated problems with andSection; 128.2(d) (new andSection;128.12) dealing with the appeal of the denial of an application, the lackof specific appeal steps, and the limitation of 14 calendar days in whichto appeal the decision of the district director. We agree. We, therefore,have rewritten the provision.9. Section 128.3 (a) and (b) Manifest Requirements (New Section 128.21(a) and (b))All comments received from current express consignment companies reflectedstrong opposition to segments contained in this subpart. Specifically,the objections were to the requirement of manifesting separately all articlesspecifically exempt from entry by andSection; 141.4 Customs Regulations (19CFR 141.4). We strongly disagree. The need to manifest all incoming cargofor control and enforcement screening purposes is a vital and essentialconcern of the Customs Service. It is necessary if the Customs Serviceis to continue to achieve its mission to preserve and protect the revenueof the United States while at the same time preventing the importationof contraband. Several commenters observed the so-called disparity of processingand manifesting requirements as related to this issue and the internationalshipments carried by the United States Postal Service. Many express carriersbelieve that they should be treated by Customs in the same manner and withthe same requirements and regulations imposed upon postal shipments. TheCustoms Service is bound to observe the numerous bilateral agreements andtreaties negotiated by our Government with the International Postal Unionand its member countries. We believe that the current procedures establishedby the Customs Service also achieve their objective with regard to postalimportations.10. Section 128.3(c) Explanation of Manifest AmendmentsAlthough this provision was not the subject of a specific comment, it hasbeen determined that the content of the proposed provision was essentiallyprocedural. Since the procedure for the explanation of manifest amendmentsfor overages and shortages is already covered elsewhere in the CustomsRegulations (andSection; 4.12 as to vessels, andSection; 122.49 as to aircraft,and andSection; 123.9 as to land vehicles) the provision is excluded fromthe final rule.11. Section 128.6 Informal Entry Procedures (New Section 128.24)In the course of reviewing comments on this section we noted that paragraph(a), which generally permits the informal entry of shipments not exceeding$1250 in value and the consolidation of such shipments if each is valuedat $1250 or less, was confusing. It appears, as proposed, to only permitthe consolidation of shipments which are not subject to this provision,i.e., prohibited or restricted merchandise, quota merchandise, etc. Theparagraph has been altered to correct this deficiency while still permittingthe consolidation of shipments valued under $1250. Also, several commenterswere concerned about the increase in the informal entry ceiling from $1000to $1250 being limited to the express consignment industry. We agree thatsuch an inequity should not exist and will change the limit for other importationsin a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> document.A commenter questioned the meaning of the phrase ``other necessary information''appearing at the end of the second sentence of andSection; 128.6(c) (newandSection; 128.24(c)) which identifies the documents which must be attachedto the Custom Form 3461 and the information that must appear therein. Theprovision is being altered to clarify that it covers information whichmay be necessary in the case of a particular shipment, local condition,or other situation identified from time to time by the district directorin charge of the port of entry.We noted, as a result of several comments, that andSection; 128.6(d) (newandSection; 128.24(d)) conveyed the meaning that articles valued at $25 orless could be administratively exempted from duty and tax. Since the statutoryauthority for administrative exemptions generally provides for only a $5limit in such cases, the provision is being altered.12. Section 128.8 Simplified Entry Document Procedures (New Section 128.26)Several commenters expressed a lack of understanding of the reasons forthe furnishing of entry numbers in approved bar coded readable format asrequired by andSection; 128.8(a) (new andSection; 128.26(a)). The purpose ofthis requirement is to permit the expedited processing of entry paperworkand cargo release. The section has been modified to clarify this point.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part II_General Comments</ITAG>1. Certain commenters believe that the proposed procedures amount to an<T3>ultra vires</T3> amendment of the governing law in the guise of regulation.We believe that the regulatory provisions of Part 128 do not exceed theauthority provided by the statutes listed in the authority citation forPart 128. Taken together, those statutes provide the Secretary of the Treasurywith rather broad discretion in prescribing rules and regulations to governthe areas which are the subject of the regulations.2. The modified system proposed for the clearance of express consignmentcargo, according to some commenters, weakens safeguards and proceduresmandated by law covering the entry of merchandise into the United States.This issue was raised when we proposed the addition of andSection;andSection;143.21(1) and 143.29 to the Customs Regulations. We responded in T.D. 86-143by indicating that we are aware of the potential for smuggling and otherabuses, that we currently conduct random intensive examinations of merchandisefrom courier and air express shipments, that we will conduct audits onthe operations of the express companies and brokers to ensure that properduty has been collected, and that we are negotiating agreements with thecompanies setting forth specific preventative steps that can be taken toensure that smuggling and other abuses are detected and reported to us.We should now report that we followed through on those actions and aresatisfied with the level of compliance observed. We will continue withthese procedures.3. The proposed procedures, according to certain commenters, vastly magnifythe potential for improper classification and valuation of merchandise,and unauthorized release.The issue was raised in the comments received in connection with T.D. 86-143.Customs will take steps similar to those identified in response to theprevious comment, such as audits and intensive examinations to insure properclassification and valuation of merchandise.4. Some commenters believe that the proposed regulations fail to addressthe question of adequate bond coverage for the express companies ``in-house''brokers.Customs believes that existing regulations already address this issue andthat in appropriate cases bond coverage can be increased.5. Certain commenters believe that the proposed regulations permit <T3>per se</T3> violation of andSection; 111.36 of the Customs Regulations.The proposed regulations themselves do not authorize any action which isin direct conflict with andSection; 111.36 of the Customs Regulations. Theproblem raised is one which could arise from any transaction in which abroker has business relations with an unlicensed person; it is not limitedto transactions such as those contemplated by Part 128. Such a problem,when and if it arises, may be dealt with in the same manner as when itarises in any other context.6. The discriminatory and anti-competitive nature of the present and proposedexpedited clearance procedures must be corrected according to some brokercommenters.As we pointed out in T.D. 86-143, courier and express air service companiesmust still use a licensed broker to transact Customs business. Differentbrokers will acquire different shares of this business, but the brokerageindustry is not being excluded from this category of transactions.7. Some commenters raised concerns regarding the possible violation ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act and E.O. 12291.The Express Consignment Industry Regulations do not place an increasedregulatory burden on a significant number of small entities such as theRegulatory Flexibility Act and E.O. 12291 were designed to prevent. Theyprovide simplified procedures which are available to anyone wishing totake advantage of them. While some entities may be better able to utilizethe procedures than others, the ability to do so is based on competitivefactors and not on a regulatory burden. In fact, some comments receivedfrom small entities praised the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information contained in this final regulation has beenreviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordancewith the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))under control number 1515-0144. The estimated average burden associatedwith the collection of information in this final rule is 15 minutes perrespondent or recordkeeper.Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestionsfor reducing this burden should be directed to U.S. Customs Service, PaperworkManagement Branch, Washington, DC 20229 and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject (1515-0144) Washington, DC 20503.Part 178, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 178), which lists the informationcollections contained in the regulations and the control number assignedby OMB is being amended to add andSection; 128.11 thereto.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document was Arnold L.
