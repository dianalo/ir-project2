The venture, called GPA Airbus 320, will offer the 25 A-320s to carriers world-wide that want to lease, rather than buy, the 150-seat, twin-engine airplane, which is used on short to medium-range routes. GPA holds 50.5% of the venture, while Airbus, a European aerospace consortium, holds 17.5%. Pacific Western Airlines Corp. of Canada holds 24.5% and Banque Paribas of France has 7.5%.    The formation of GPA Airbus 320 caps GPA's efforts to become a jetliner supermarket for the 1990s, with aircraft from every major manufacturer in its lease portfolio.    With the A-320 order, GPA will have about 270 aircraft in its lease portfolio and 95 planes on option -- a fleet nearly as big as United Airlines'; United is the acknowledged industry giant. GPA's specialty is the short-term, off-balance-sheet operating lease, which gives airlines flexibility to expand or contract capacity on short notice without placing the lease-obligation liability on their books.    Until recently, GPA had focused on buying Boeing Co. 737s on speculation and leasing them. And GPA did renew its commitment to Seattle-based Boeing last summer by ordering 81 737s for $2.3 billion. But in 1984, GPA branched out and formed a equally owned joint venture with McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St. Louis to buy and lease as many as 50 new MD-83 aircraft.    GPA late last year formed a partnership with the Dutch aircraft manufacturer N.V. Fokker and two Japanese concerns, Mitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp., to buy and lease as many as 100 Fokker F-100 aircraft.    And GPA last May formed a joint venture with Pacific Western, Canada's third-largest carrier. This 50-50 venture, called GPA Propjet, is gearing up to buy and lease a variety of commuter aircraft.    Airbus's president, Jean Pierson, said the creation of the joint venture &quot;doesn't mean we don't want to market the (A-320) aircraft directly.&quot; Scheduled to enter service in two years, the A-320 has accumulated 271 firm orders and shows signs of continuing to sell well. &quot;But with this joint venture, we address a part of the market that is clearly specific and needs a specific kind of financing scheme we can't address&quot; through normal manufacturer's financing, Mr. Pierson said.    The A-320 has received orders from only two U.S. airlines, Pan American World Airways and Northwest Airlines, and one U.S. leasing company. GPA's many contacts and current leases in the important U.S. market is expected to help Airbus make inroads there.    The GPA-Airbus venture is scheduled to take delivery of the A-320s between 1990 and 1992, and has delivery dates between 1992 and 1994 for the 25 aircraft on option. It will have assets of $240 million, to be contributed by the four partners in proportion to their equity. About 85% of the $2 billion purchase price for the 50 A-320s will be raised through syndicated loans and other debt financing. </TEXT></DOC>
