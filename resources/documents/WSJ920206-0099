When the outlook is uncertain, he justholds up his pet frog, Emile, and tells his viewers, &quot;I don'tknow if it's going to rain -- and Emile doesn't know,either.&quot;   It works well in Hungarian, anyway. The serious-looking56-year-old confides that back home he's a star.</LP><TEXT>   That's why he's here at the International WeatherForecasters Festival, swapping tales with his colleaguesaround the lunch table. It may not be the Cannes FilmFestival, but for up-and-coming TV weathermen and women fromAlgeria to New Zealand, last weekend's meeting in the Parissuburb of Issy les Moulineaux was the place to be. Tipspicked up here can, to a career, mean the difference betweena favorable wind and a tropical depression.   Just ask Senegal's hottest weatherman, Abdul-Aziz Diop,recognized by the festival as one of this year's bestpresenters. He says ideas he picked up here last year madeall the difference to his show. For example, he beganresponding to people's feelings about the weather. So now,when it's hot in Senegal, he tries to soothe viewers byshowing beach scenes. When it's cool, he injects warmth byplaying light jazz.   &quot;I can't walk down the street anymore,&quot; he complains ofhis new celebrity status.   Of course, there are cautionary tales as well. Piet vanRensburg, a weather presenter in South Africa, tells of thetime he concluded a forecast by going over to the studiowindow and saying, &quot;Now let's see what the weather's reallylike.&quot; The South African weather office didn't share hissense of humor, he recalls, adding that he almost lost hisjob.   Only the Bulgarian participant, Dimitar Ivanov, seems tobe lacking in gimmicks. And no, he confesses ruefully, he hasnever made a joke. Then why, one is compelled to ask, did hebecome a TV weatherman? &quot;There were no jobs for astronomers,&quot;he says, &quot;so I did this.&quot;   And it's no easy job. The strain of forecasting, as Mr.Karoly tells it, can be overpowering. He strikes a chord ofsympathy among his colleagues when he confesses that he feelsresponsible for the weather.   &quot;If I've told people it won't rain, and then I'm lying inbed that night and I hear precipitation on the roof, well, Ican't sleep,&quot; he says. CNN's Valerie Voss takes up the theme,declaring: &quot;It's a sense of failure.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
