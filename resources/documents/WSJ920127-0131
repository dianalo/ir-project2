Mrs. Aquino's support of Mr. Ramos, a 63-year-old formerarmed forces chief of staff who backed Mrs. Aquino throughsix coup attempts, goes against the advice of close friends,most of her relatives and influential senior leaders of theRoman Catholic Church in the Philippines.</LP><TEXT>   As expected, Mrs. Aquino announced her decision Saturdaybefore about 300 senior government officials and supportersassembled at the presidential palace for a Catholic Massmarking her 59th birthday.   &quot;Secretary Eddie Ramos, I am confident, will fearlesslycontinue the vision of this democratic society that ourpeople have fought hard to re-establish&quot; she said. &quot;I willsupport Eddie in pursuit of this goal.&quot;   Mr. Ramos, who served Mr. Marcos for more than 10 years asthe head of the Philippine Constabulary, a paramilitarypolice force, became an instant hero in February 1986 when heswitched sides and backed a popular uprising supporting Mrs.Aquino's claim to have won a snap election called by Mr.Marcos.   However, as a Protestant in a nation that is 85% Catholic,Mr. Ramos is opposed by senior Catholic leaders. Manila'sCardinal Jaime Sin, who normally presides at religious eventsattended by the president, was absent from Saturday'sceremony. Cardinal Sin has indicated his preference foranother candidate, former Supreme Court Chief Justice MarceloFernan.   Mr. Ramos's main rival for the president's support, HouseSpeaker Ramon Mitra, reacted to Mrs. Aquino's choice withbitter defiance. Speaking on Saturday to a convention of theLaban ng Demokrattikong Pilipino, the largest party inCongress, Mr. Mitra said: &quot;The president's promised word hashung over this campaign for months. Now she has spoken. Buton May 11 it will be the nation that will speak.&quot;   Although Mr. Ramos usually rates higher than Mr. Mitra inopinion surveys, he lacks a campaign organization and can winonly if Mrs. Aquino's endorsement attracts new supporters,particularly congressmen, who traditionally run the nationalcampaign machinery of Philippine presidential candidates.   Analysts said that it wouldn't be clear for several daysand perhaps weeks how many of Mr. Mitra's supporters withinthe LDP will bolt to Mr. Ramos's camp in response to Mrs.Aquino's endorsement and the prospect of government support.   For now, most of the politically active relatives of Mrs.Aquino's late husband, Sen. Beningo Aquino, whose 1983assassination galvanized the opposition to Mr. Marcos's rule,are supporting Mr. Mitra.   Even Mrs. Aquino's politically influential brother, Jose&quot;Peping&quot; Cojuangco, has so far declined to back her choice. Asource in Mr. Mitra's campaign said Sunday that Mr. Cojuangcowas resigning his position as secretary-general of the LDPbut would continue to be a party member. Should Mr. Cojuangcodecide to quit the party and keep a public pledge to supporthis sister's choice, several key congressmen would beexpected to follow him.   Mr. Fernan, meanwhile, said Saturday that he wouldcontinue his quest for the presidency. Without Mrs. Aquino'sbacking, however, he stands little chance. Both Mr. Mitra andMr. Ramos have asked him to run as their vice president towoo Catholic Church support and to create a ticket withbalanced geographical appeal. (Mr. Fernan is from the centralVisayas, a voterich region where both Mr. Mitra and Mr. Ramoslack strong links.)   With several other candidates also competing foranti-Marcos votes, analysts said that the administrationsplit had increased the chances of a victory by the leadingopposition candidate, Eduardo &quot;Danding&quot; Cojuangco, Mrs.Aquino's estranged cousin and a former close friend andbusiness associate of Mr. Marcos.   Danding Cojuangco's claim to the Marcos mantle is disputedby several rivals, including Mr. Marcos's widow, Imelda. Butanalysts said that among the opposition candidates, Mr.Cojuangco is the strongest because he has both money and astrong rural campaign network.</TEXT></DOC>
