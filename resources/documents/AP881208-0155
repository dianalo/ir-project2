Pakistan's official news agency quoted the country's U.S.ambassador, S. Shah Nawaz, as saying Gorbachev's speech Wednesday tothe United Nations was ``statesman-like'' but that his Afghanproposals were unrealistic.   The agency also reported that an Afghan pilot landed his MiG-21jet in Pakistan on Thursday and surrendered. A government officialspeaking on condition of anonymity said the plane landed at MiramShah in North West Frontier Province, 10 miles from the Afghanborder.   The agency identified the pilot only as Capt. Asadullah.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported a clash betweenthe Afghan army and the insurgents, saying at least 86 guerrillaswere killed and 56 wounded. The report, which could not beconfirmed, did not give a date for the clash.   There was no immediate response from Foreign Minister SahabzadaYaqub Khan on Gorbachev's proposals. However, a ministry officialwho spoke on condition of anonymity said an end of hostilities was``not practical'' because Afghan guerrillas were determined to fightto victory.   Gorbachev proposed a Jan. 1 cease-fire between Soviet-backedAfghan forces and the U.S.- and Pakistan-supported guerrillas, withboth sides holding their ground.   He called for a mutual arms freeze on the same date and for aninternational conference to restore peace in the war-torn country.   Moscow agreed in a U.N.-mediated accord last spring to withdrawits troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. Half of the troopspulled out under the schedule, but the Soviet Union suspended thewithdrawal last month but pledged to remove its troops on schedule.   Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 and stayed on to helpdefend the Marxist government against an increasingly ferociousinsurgency.   ``There is no demarcated line of battle where the cease-firecould be enforced,'' Nawaz was quoted as saying by the agencyAssociated Press of Pakistan.   He said Gorbachev's proposal for an international conference onAfghanistan was not new, and was ``aimed at giving legitimacy to theKabul regime,'' which seized power in 1978.   The guerrillas have gained large parts of eastern Afghanistansince the Soviet pullout began May 15. Communist government forcesstill control most major cities while insurgents rule thecountryside.   Rahim, whose party leader Burhanuddin Rabbani currently chairsthe seven-party guerrilla alliance, said the guerrillas would keepfighting until all Soviets have left the country and the Kabulgovernment falls.</TEXT></DOC>
