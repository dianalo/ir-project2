No. 07,803,806 filed Dec. 9,      1991. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This application generally relates to cannon cartridges and more      particularly to a cartridge assembly having multiple connected cases. </PAR><PAR>  2. Brief description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Cannon cartridges, especially those designed for use in tank guns, are      limited in the axial length which can be accommodated within the confines      of the tank. This restriction limits the amount of propellant that can be      utilized to propel a given projectile through the gun tube. Accordingly,      there is a need for a cartridge design which extends the useful volume for      containing propellant within the cartridge without lengthening the      cartridge unit. One approach is to provide a portion of the propellant      charge around the sabot of a penetrator projectile as disclosed in U.S.      Pat. No. 4,936,220. This design makes use of the space between front and      rear bourrelets to house a sequentially ignited booster charge However,      the volume available for propellant is comparatively small. Another      approach is to provide separate propellant and projectile components. In      large artillery cannon designs, the propellant is loaded as separate      canisters or bags behind the projectile. Thus the entire round to be fired      consists of several unconnected components. This design has the advantage      of being easily handled by those individuals loading the gun. This design      also has the advantage that the total charge can be tailored to the target      type and range on the spot. Such tailoring is not conventionally available      lo lank guns. </PAR><PAR>  Separate ammunition is also more time consuming to load than fixed      ammunition. It has the additional disadvantage in that in order to unload      an unfired round from the chamber of the gun, the operator must reach into      the chamber, which may potentially be very hot, to retrieve the individual      bags of propellant and the projectile. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, there is a a continual need for a cartridge assembly for use      in a large caliber tank gun which extends the propelling charge capacity.      There is also a need for a cartridge assembly which permits on the spot      selection of the propellant charge to be utilized depending on the target      range and type. There is also a need for a cartridge assembly that is      simple to load and permits retrieval of the round components easily by an      individual operating the gun without reaching into the gun chamber to      retrieve components. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The cartridge assembly in accordance with the present invention addresses      the above mentioned needs. The cartridge assembly of the present invention      comprises two or more combustible cartridge case segments, the front of      which is fastened to the projectile assembly and the rear of which      contains a primer assembly and a charge of propellant The two segments are      automatically joined together during loading via velcro rings at a butted      interface between the segments. </PAR><PAR>  Velcro, as used in this specification, means a pair of complementary sheet      or fabric materials, one of which has hooks and the other has loops or a      thread pile which is engaged by the hooks when the two materials are      placed together. </PAR><PAR>  Extending axially throughout each of the segments is a bundle of flexible      combustible ignition strands which, when ignited, propagate the ignition      flame front at an extremely high rate, on the order of between 3 to 6      thousand feet per second. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, the projectile containing segment is loaded first into the      gun chamber followed by the primer containing propellant charge container.      As the segments are butted together, the velcro strip hook and loop      arrangement locks the two segments together forming an integral cartridge      assembly which can easily be removed and separated from one another during      unloading of the tank gun if necessary. </PAR><PAR>  The rear segment of the cartridge assembly of the invention comprises a      tubular combustible cartridge casing having a metal head closing one end.      A combustible interface cap closes the other end. A plurality of ignition      strands extend from the primer assembly mounted in the metal head, through      the propellant contained in the case to a holding plug mounted in the      combustible interface cap so that the ignition strands terminate flush      with the outer surface of the holding plug. Around the plug on the front      face of the interface cap is a ring of velcro type of material. This ring      is preferably cemented onto the front face of the cap. </PAR><PAR>  The velcro type material is typically one piece of a complementary pair of      fabrics One of the pair has resilient hooks extending from a fabric      backing which is glued or sewn to the end cap. The other of the pair has      thread loops, or jumbled yarns forming loops attached to a fabric backing.      The loops become hooked when the two materials are butted together. </PAR><PAR>  The front segment comprises a combustible case, which is a tubular body,      having an interface cap and plug assembly closing the rear end of the      tubular body and a projectile assembly inserted into and closing the front      end of the combustible case. Extending from the interface cap and plug      assembly through the propellant charge contained in the case around the      rear of the projectile assembly is a plurality of flexible combustible      ignition strands as in the rear segment. Each strand has its front end      secured in a corresponding blind bore in a sabot on the projectile      assembly. The rear end of the strands extend into and through the holding      plug so as to project flush with the aft end of the holding plug in the      interface cap and plug assembly closing the rear end of the case. On the      exterior aft face of the interface cap is a ring of velcro type fabric      which is complementary to the velcro ring on the face of the interface cap      on the front end of the rear segment. </PAR><PAR>  When the two segments are butted together, as when the segments are      inserted sequentially into the chamber of the gun, the ends of the strands      butt against and the caps adhere to each other. The segments are thus      joined, in effect, into one cartridge assembly. In addition, the      propellant composition in the rear segment can be field selected to      optimize the ballistic performance for a given target. </PAR><PAR>  Upon ignition, the ignition flame front propagates at a high rate from the      primer assembly along the ignition strand in the aft cartridge segment,      through the plug assembly, across the abutted caps to the strands in the      front segment, and then throughout the strands in the front segment. Since      the ignition propagation velocity is on the order of between 3,000 to      6,000 feet per second, and each of the case segments are approximately 2.5      feet in length, propellant ignition in both segments occurs in less than a      millisecond. Thus propellant ignition in both segments occurs virtually      simultaneously. Since different propellant charges can be contained in the      separate segments, the total charge utilized can be tailored to the      specific target and range, much like separate ammunition in large      artillery guns. This choice can now be made in the field with the use of      the assembly in accordance with the invention. </PAR><PAR>  These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention      will become readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed      description when taken in conjunction with the appended claims and the      accompanying drawing. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a longitudinal schematic sectional view through a dual cartridge      assembly in accordance with the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view through the projectile and      propellant segment in accordance with the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an enlarged partial sectional view of a rear portion of the      segment shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an enlarged view of the front end portion of the segment      illustrated in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an enlarged exploded perspective view of the cap and plug      assembly in accordance with the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  One preferred embodiment of the cartridge assembly 10 in accordance with      the present invention is illustrated schematically in FIG. 1. The assembly      comprises a front projectile and propellant case segment 12 butted against      a rear primer and propellant case segment 14. The segments are operably      connected together at an interface and each segment contains a propellant      charge 16. The front segment 12 contains and supports a projectile      assembly 18. </PAR><PAR>  The rear primer and propellant case segment 14 comprises a tubular      combustible case 20 which is open at both ends. The rear end of case 20 is      closed by a conventional flanged metal closure head 22 which is retained      on the rear end of case 20 in a conventional manner via threads, adhesive,      snap rings, or other conventional fastening means. </PAR><PAR>  The metal head 22 includes a primer assembly 24 which confines the rear      ends of a plurality of flexible ignition strands 26 within a primer      chamber containing a conventional primer composition </PAR><PAR>  The primer assembly 24 in the cartridge of the present invention includes a      multistrand igniter assembly 26 and a primer head 28. The primer head 28      is a threaded metal housing which contains a conventional priming element.      The igniter assembly 26 includes a unitary adapter body which holds the      rear ends of a plurality of ignition strands 30 in proximity to the      discharge opening from the primer head so as to receive the spark from      ignition of the priming composition. The primer head 28 and the igniter      assembly 26 are threadably fastened together so as to sandwich the metal      head 22 therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably there are six ignition strands 30 which have their rear ends      terminating together in the igniter assembly 26. The ignition strands 30      then fan out forwardly into an equally circumferentially spaced      arrangement extending axially through the case 20. The strands 30 are      flexible combustible ignition strands of ITLX type material preferably      available from Atlas Powder Company. These strands have a high order      propagation velocity of between about 3000 to 6000 feet per second when      the rear 1.4 inches of the strands are confined in the assembly 26 during      ignition. These strands are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,017. </PAR><PAR>  One or more lateral strand supports 32 may be utilized to maintain the      ignition strands 30 in an appropriately spaced configuration. These strand      supports 32 in the rear case are typically flat, combustible, ring shaped      plates which frictionally fit inside the case 20 and have spaced through      holes to laterally support the strands from one another in the propellant      16. </PAR><PAR>  The opposite ends of the ignition strands 30 are gathered together and      pushed into a holding plug 34 so that the terminal ends of the strands 30      are even with the outer face 36 of the holding plug 34. This holding plug      34 is then inserted into a cup shaped retaining portion 38 of an end cap      40. The end cap 40 is made of a combustible felted material such as      nitrocellulose as is the combustible case 20. The end cap 40 is preferably      adhesively bonded to the open front end of case 20 after the case is      filled with propellant 16. </PAR><PAR>  Affixed to the flat outer annular end surface of the cap 40 around the      outer face 36 of the holding plug 34 is a velcro hook or loop material 42.      This ring of velcro hook or loop material 42 is designed to mate with and      attach to a corresponding loop or hook ring 44 on the end cap 46 of the      projectile and propellant case segment 12. </PAR><PAR>  The projectile and propellant case segment 12, separately shown in FIGS. 2      and enlarged portions shown in FIGS. 3, 4, and 5, comprises a tubular      combustible case 47 having its rear end bonded to the end cap 46. The end      closure cap 46 is essentially identical to the end cap 40 on the front end      of the rear primer and propellant case segment 14. This end cap 46 is      partially shown enlarged in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  The end cap 46 on case segment 12 has a tubular portion 48 which is      coextensive from a flat annular disk portion 50 and a central cup shaped      retainer portion 52 which supports another holding plug 34. This holding      plug 34 Contains and supports the rear ends of another set of six ignition      strands 54. The strands 54 extend forwardly through the propellant charge      16 contained within the segment 12 and terminate at the saboted projectile      assembly 18 closing the front end of the segment 12. </PAR><PAR>  The front ends of the ignition strands 54 are secured in holes 56 in the      sabot 58 as is clearly shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4. The ends of the strands      54 are each pushed into a split sleeve 60 which has alternating teeth 62      along the split in the sleeve 60. The split sleeves 60 containing the ends      of the ignition strands 54 are then inserted into the holes 56. The teeth      62 compressively bites into the plastic tubing of the ignition strand 54      to hold the strand end securely in place in the sabot 58. </PAR><PAR>  As in the rear primer and propellant case segment 14, the strands 54 in the      front projectile and propellant case segment 12 are maintained in lateral      position by a strand support 64. Strand support 64 is a flat disk shaped      piece of combustible material which is slidably disposed on the aft end of      the finned penetrator 66. The strand support 64 has a plurality of      radially extending fingers which each have a through bore through which an      ignition strand 54 passes. The strand support 64 prevents lateral movement      of the strands so as to keep the strands radially and circumferentially      spaced within the assembly 12. </PAR><PAR>  Assembly of front projectile and propellant case segment 12 proceeds as      follows. The projectile assembly 18 is separately and conventionally      assembled. The front ends of the ignition strands 54 are passed through      the holes in the strand support 64 and embedded in the holes 56 in the      sabot 58. If the projectile is a full caliber projectile rather than an      saboted subcaliber kinetic energy penetrator projectile assembly as      illustrated, then the ends of the strands 54 would be similarly embedded      in holes in the aft end of the projectile itself. </PAR><PAR>  The rear ends of the strands 54 are gathered and the outer case 47 of the      front projectile and propellant case assembly 12 is then slid over the      rear end of the projectile assembly 18 and the strands 54. The front end      of the case 47 is rivited or otherwise secured to the projectile assembly      18. </PAR><PAR>  The tubular portion 48 of the end cap 46 is preferably fastened to the aft      end of the case 47 prior to installation on the projectile assembly 18.      However, the portion 48 and the rear end of case 47 may be fastened      together at this time. The joint is preferably glued with a suitable      adhesive. The joint may be a typical skive joint or a rabbet as      illustrated. The ends 68 of the ignition strands 54 are passed through a      central aperture in the retainer portion 52. The outer annular rim 53 of      the retainer portion 52 is adhesively bonded to the disk portion 50. The      ends 68 are then threaded through the spaced bores 70 in the holding plug      34 and slack in the strands 54 is pulled through as the plug 34 is      inserted into and seated in the retainer portion 52. The holding plug 34      may be friction fit or may be glued into the retainer portion 52. Finally,      the ends 68 are cut off flush with the outer face 32 of the holding plug      30. </PAR><PAR>  Assembly of the rear primer and propellant case segment 14 is similar and      will therefore not be set forth in detail here. The principal difference      is that the rear ends of the strands 30 are secured in the primer assembly      24, as is more fully described in copending application Ser. No.      07,803,806, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The front      ends of the strands 30 are secured in the cap 40 in a manner identical to      that described above for cap 46. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, front case segment 12 and rear case segment 14 are fastened      together merely by contact between the end caps having the velcro      materials 42 and 44 thereon. When the front projectile and propellant case      segment 12 is loaded into a gun chamber followed by a rear primer and      propellant case segment 14, a removable bond between the two cases is      automatically established. </PAR><PAR>  The outer end faces of the abutting holding plugs 30 need not be aligned      such that the strands 30 and 54 match end to end. The propagation velocity      of the flame front through the ignition strands 30 is strong enough and      fast enough so that any mismatch between the ends of the ignition strands      in the abutting holding plugs is inconsequential. The flame front merely      traverses the interface between the case components instantaneously. In      fact, the plugs 34 need not be touching one another but must be close      enough so that traversal is assured. This distance is on the order of less      than 0.25 inches. </PAR><PAR>  The plugs 34 are presently made of wood. However, other materials may be      advantageously employed, such as a cellulose fiber material,      nitrocellulose, a plastic material, or a molded solid propellant. The end      cap and plug assemblies 40 and 46 may also be made as a unitary molded      body rather than the three piece design of combustible case material as      above described. In this case, an energetic or at least combustible      plastic material would be preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The invention has been shown and described with reference to one preferred      embodiment. Variations and modifications are contemplated as being within      the scope of the invention as above described. In addition, other      modifications are contemplated. For example, three or more segments may be      joined together as above described. The rear segment 14 may have a      noncombustible case. Also, there may be fewer or more ignition strands      than the six illustrated in the above embodiment. The mechanism for      joining the segments may also be other than velcro rings as above      described. For example, a snap fit mechanical arrangement could be      utilized. Accordingly it is intended to embrace all such variations and      modifications as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
