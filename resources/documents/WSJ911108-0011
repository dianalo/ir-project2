The suit alleged that fromDecember 1983 to September 1990, Mr. Adler used false names,false Social Security numbers and false tax-identificationnumbers to open accounts at the various brokerage firms. Insome of the accounts, the SEC alleged, Mr. Adler claimed thathe represented businesses with large amounts of assets, inorder to trade on credit.   The SEC alleged that Mr. Adler placed orders to buysecurities, usually stock options, through the accounts, butdidn't actually pay for the transactions in advance.
