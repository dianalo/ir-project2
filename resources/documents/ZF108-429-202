Inthinking of a suitable editorial introduction, I realize that I have beensurprisingly naive about the problems faced by a large portion of the worldpopulation using Latin font typewriters - and thus of the need for computingterminals, other interface devices, and software for special scripts orlanguages.andP;  I knew, of course, that the Japanese had been developing specialterminals for their industry and that the Chinese spelling of some names andplaces were changed to aid in typsetting, but I still felt that the QWERTYkeyboard and ASCII font was enough.andP;  As a result of my deliberations, Idecided to look up the entries in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (mine is the15th edition) to see what it had to say.andM;From the section on &quot;Writing, Forms of  volume 19), 1 found that there areapparently three types of &quot;full writing&quot; (phonography):andM;1) Logo-syllabic, which includes modern Chinese;andM;2) Syllabic, which includes the early.andP;  Semitic syllabary (including earlyHebrew and Kanji (Japanese); andandM;3) Alphabetic, including the Latin alphabet (with all its special accent inuse in different European languages) with Greek and Cyrillic, many versionsof the Aramaic, including Indian, Arabic, and Vocalized Hebrew (withdiacritical marks to indicate vowels), and many others.andM;In this special section we address two of these: Chines and Arabic.andP;  I ampleased that they represent two special problems in computing, the ideogramand its representation as a total word or phrase in a single &quot;character&quot; andthe difference in reading and writing the text (right-to-left instead of theleft-to-right direction of Latin-based languages).andM;While doing some research on language, I found (in volume 10 of theMacropaedia) that not only was I not a polyglot but that there wereapparently more variations than I had ever guessed when viewing the roots ofa language tree (Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary, 2nd edition,unabridged).andM;It became obvious to me that computing in another language would not be aseasy as it might at first seem.andP;  It is not just a word-for-word translationor transliteration - not even for simple concepts such as column headings.andO;In the simplest of examples, the words may not need to be writtenleft-to-right and/or down, nor may they need the same space to convey thesame message.andP;  Even a dot matrix printer may prove difficult to use, if nottotally inadequate !andP;  The article by the Qiaos, apart from illustrating thebeauty of Chinese writing, depicts how scholars are trying to find ways ofencoding a large script of symbols.andP;  the problems associated with this typeof recognition have been known for many years.andM;Indeed, I remember a group in the Boston area working on this in the sixties.andO;They were attempting to provide a way for American typists to input articlesthat were written in Chinese into the computer.andP;  The goal was to provide thetypists with the ability to recognize the salient features of the symbolswithout benefit of serious long-term training in the language.andP;  As I recall,in this experiment, with a limited set of (on the order of 4,000) ideograms,the typists could work at about the same speed as they would for theequivalent words in English-presumably because there were less total keystrokes for the Chinese symbols than the translated text.andM;In Chinese there seems to be no way that a single character-encoding systemwould work due to the enormous possible font size.andP;  The Qiaos describe theirmethod of representing huge character sets and some proposed ways ofunderstanding change in meaning or sound of the many complex interactions ofthe character components.andP;  Although there are already several  codingsystems&quot; of the Chinese character set, the need for efficiency andstandardization remains a large part of the problem.andM;The article on Arabic text by Tayli and Al-Salamah has an interestingsolution for a PC with &quot;bilingual capabilities.&quot;andP;  By making modifications toROM-BIOS, the authors are able to write the screen outputs as equivalentArabic, though there is no mystery in the translation (which is all providedby embedded special vocabularies and words for special software packages suchas spreadsheets).andP;  Because the script is a mirror image to ours, the columnheadings must be reversed, posing some intriguing problems that the authorhas solved in interesting ways.andM;Even when the text is in the natural language of the reader, there may betypographic style effects that hinder or aid the reader, as discussed in thearticle by Oman and Cook.andP;  The area of program comprehension has beenconsidered important for some years now, and the authors have put togetherthis article to provide recommendations on a &quot;book format&quot; that they show (byexperiment) improves the understanding of programs (computer languages arealso meant to be understood - especially when they encode an algorithm thatmust be maintained over time.)andM;Finally, the article by Raman and Alwar concentrates on translation acrosslanguages - in this instance, the major 24 languages used daily in India.andP;  Asan example, the authors then show a fram-based translatro system for theselanguages that are gree of word order: in these the words of a sentence canbe shuffled without changing the meaning.andM;In reflecting on the problems of the multiple language and character setsfaced by the world, it appears that a large portion of the potential computeruser population is at a disadvantage.andP;  They must use difficult interfaces orlearn another language.andP;  When we add up the cost of not having goodinput-output devices for the many people who can compute but find itcumbersome, we can conclude that the cost of efficient new devices would payfor themselves many times over.andP;  Particularly at a time when the world'spolitical barriers are being removed, perhaps our new opportunity frontiershould be to remove the barriers to computing for all humanity, be theydifferent in language, representation, or device needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
