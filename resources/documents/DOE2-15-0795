Nonetheless it has been considered prudent to quantifythe consequences of a particular hypothetical accident involving a transportpackage. The particular accident examined assumed that recriticalityoccurs during the refilling of a flask, and for the Commissariat a l'EnergieAtomique (CEA) scenario, for which flasks are transported dry, the hypotheticalaccident occurs as the flask is slowly lowered into a storage pond. Analternative UK scenario assumes that the flask is being refilled, followingbreach, by a high-pressure hose. Thus, the consequences of such an accidentwere estimated by developing computer codes, Chateau by the CEA and Sartempby the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). This and other results showthat the hypothetical accident in which a transport flask is broughtto critical by the reentry of water gives at most a relatively mild event.In view of the considerably unlikely circumstances and conservative aspectsintroduced, this result shows that such an accident can be safely contained.</TEXT></DOC>
