BACHMAN</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Emperor Hirohito ascended Japan'sChrysanthemum Throne 62 years ago, the mystical coronation rite had``the magnificence of a dream'' enveloped in eerie silence.   So wrote Fanny Davenport Rogers MacVeagh, wife of then U.S.Ambassador Charles MacVeagh and one of the few foreigners invitedto Hirohito's enthronement.   Hirohito died last year at age 87. His eldest son, EmperorAkihito, will be crowned Monday.   In a 29-page letter to her five sons written one month after theceremony, Mrs. MacVeagh gave a richly detailed account of the 1928enthronement that is the model for the rites planned for Akihito.   ``Count Makino, in the most archaic costume, slowly mounted thesteps on the side of the throne away from us and handed the emperora tightly rolled scroll. The emperor took it, unrolled it ... andread it in a firm but rather low voice,'' she wrote.   Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka then ``clambered'' down to a levelbelow the octagonal, purple-curtained throne to lead Japaneseguests and foreign dignitaries inside the ancient Imperial Palaceof Kyoto in three cheers of ``banzai,'' a wish for long life.   ``Then, to my barbaric Western mind, then was the moment for thebells,'' she continued. ``But there were no bells. If the slow,mysterious sound of the temple gongs did float overfrom the cityor from the monasteries on the surrounding mountains, I, at least,never heard it. The chief impression was that of the magnificenceof a dream.''   The enthronement Monday will include representatives flown infrom more than 150 countries, a far cry from Hirohito's coronation,when 100 foreign guests from 28 countries took a 10-hour ride byprivate train from Tokyo to Kyoto.   The foreigners, all drawn from the diplomatic corps in Tokyo,arrived in marble-walled Kyoto station Nov. 2 and were led to aprocession of bright red limousines. For Mrs. MacVeagh, the arrivalwas marred only by photographers' flash bulbs ``explodingcontinually about us.''   The procession moved silently through crowd-lined streets, pastgateways covered with green cypress twigs and torii, thetraditional gates to Shinto shrines.   ``The few tramcars that were permitted to run were entirelycovered with chrysanthemums and other flowers, like floats in aflower festival,'' she wrote. Lanterns lined the streets, eachtopped with a parasol to keep out the rain.   ``The city was spotlessly clean, and because the enthronement iseven more a religious than a political festival, and because theJapanese are a distinctly silent people, it was very quiet,'' shewrote.   ``There was no one in Kyoto during all that enthronement timewho was not known to the police,'' she wrote of the tight security,which also will be in place for Akihito's enthronement. At least32,000 police are to be deployed Monday.   The night before Hirohito's enthronement was spent resting andpartying. Then, on a ``sunny morning with a little wind of icyquality,'' the foreign delegations rose early to attend thereligious portion of the enthronement ceremony in which the emperoroffers prayers to the sun goddess.   This year, that segment will be strictly private to conform withthe separation of religion and state mandated by Japan's postwarconstitution. The formal declaration of ascension to the throne,however, will be broadcast on national television, the first timecommon Japanese will be able to view the solemn rite.   Ambassador MacVeagh, a lawyer from New York and New Hampshire,was in the third of four years as head of the U.S. mission to Japanat the time of the coronation.   After the coronation, the delegation returned to Tokyo in asteady rain. The emperor asked for protocol to be broken so peoplelining the streets could carry umbrellas.   The umbrellas, said Mrs. MacVeagh, added ``a note of comfort andwell-being to what had otherwise been a most dreary spectacle,while to these humble Japanese people, it was an unforgettableproof of the symapthy and love of their divine emperor.''</TEXT></DOC>
