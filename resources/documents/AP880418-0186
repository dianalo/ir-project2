However, Michigan United Conservation Clubs, an exhibitionsponsor, said the permit may be unnecessary because Chineseofficials have agreed to provide pandas exempt from a treatygoverning endangered-species imports.   The World Wildlife Fund, a private organization seeking topreserve wild animals, said in a letter to the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service: ``The imported wildlife will be used forcommercial purposs, and the import will neither serve scientificpurposes nor enhance the propagation or survival of the species.''   Such use of the pandas would violate both U.S. endangeredspecies laws and the Convention on International Trade ofEndangered Species, the letter said.   Evidence of poaching of the rare giant panda in China promptedthe World Wildlife Fund to oppose the Michigan exhibition, saidWilliam Reilly, the organization's president.   ``Had we known a year ago what we have learned in the past fewmonths about the plight of the panda and the pressure posed byexhibition loans, we almost certainly would have opposed most, ifnot all, previous short-term loans just as rigorously,'' Reillysaid.   Reilly said approval of the permit would increase the demand forthe import of giant pandas into the United States for commercialpurposes.   Tom Washington, MUCC executive director, denied the exhibitionwas commercial. ``Certainly, we are not a circus, or a carnival, oreven a zoo, for that matter,'' he said. ``There is a whole stringof hypocricy involved here.''   MUCC received a letter over the weekend from Sichuan Province'sforeign affairs office providing assurance that ``they will provideus with a pair of pandas born before 1984,'' Washington said. Theanimals would not require an import permit, he said.   The exhibitors of the pandas in Michigan would pay Chineseauthorities at least $300,000, with the money to be used to build apanda captive-breeding facility and to improve the animals'habitat, Washington said.   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and MUCC inFebruary asked the Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the pandasshown at a 100-day summer exhibition, called Pandarama, at theMichigan State Fairgrounds in Detroit.</TEXT></DOC>
