The company said it couldn't specify the size of what itcalled &quot;significant restructuring charges&quot; for the dismissedworkers and other cost-reducing moves. But analysts said thework force reductions alone could mean a restructuring chargeof as much as $200 million in the fiscal year which endedyesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Shao Wang, an analyst with Smith Barney, said the questionis whether the cost cuts will return Wang to profitability.&quot;The real issue is when can you see black ink instead of redink. That's something that's unknown to me.&quot; However, he saidhe thinks the cost-cutting will allow Wang to be profitablein some quarters in fiscal 1992 and &quot;break even for theyear.&quot;   Mr. Wang expects the company to report an operating lossfor the fiscal fourth quarter of about $100 million, or 60cents a share, on revenue of about $500 million. In theyear-earlier quarter, Wang had a net loss of $496.7 million,or $3.01 a share, after $441.6 million in restructuringcharges. Revenue in the year-ago quarter totaled $652.2million.   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, WangClass B stock closed at $3.75, up 37.5 cents.   Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., currently has about 17,500workers, down from a high of 31,500 less than three yearsago. The company, which specializes in midrange computersused for office automation, has been cutting costs and takinghuge write-downs in each of the past two years while revenuehas declined from over $3 billion to about $2 billion. Manyof Wang's customers have been buying personal computers toreplace Wang's proprietary systems and word processors.   On June 18, Wang startled employees and customers byannouncing that in the future it would sell IBM computers aswell as its proprietary VS product line. Some analystspredict that customers will quickly move away from the VSline, adding that Wang will become mostly a software company.But Richard Miller, Wang's chairman and chief executive, saidin an interview, &quot;we'll be in the computer hardware businessas long ahead as I can imagine.&quot; He predicted that mostcustomers will be relieved by Wang's new ties to IBM andregard them as assurance that it's safe to continue to buy VScomputers.   Wang said that Horace Tsiang, 49, the company's chiefresearch and development officer, will leave the company &quot;topursue other interests.&quot; Analysts had speculated that Mr.Tsiang would leave in the wake of the IBM announcement,because he is best known as a hardware engineer.   Mr. Tsiang was a protege of An Wang, the company founderwho died last year, and the top-ranking officer remainingfrom the days before Mr. Miller was hired to save thefloundering firm in August 1989. Mr. Miller said he is stillnegotiating about Mr. Tsiang's role as a corporate director.   Wang said that Spencer Stuart Inc., an executive searchfirm, has been hired to look for a new development director.Mr. Miller said the new director should be a softwareindustry veteran with experience in industry-standardcomputers. Mr. Miller said he will temporarily head Randamp;Dhimself, although he doesn't have any engineering background.   Mr. Miller said he has restructured Wang into threedivisions, including an information systems division thatwill sell both the VS and IBM products which account forabout 70% of revenue. That division is headed by Joseph M.Tucci, executive vice president.   Wang also established a new personal computer systemsdivision to sell PCs to mass merchandisers who Mr. Millersaid are attracted by the Wang brand name, even though thecompany hasn't sold at retail in the past. The PC operationis headed by James J. Hogan, senior vice president, who likeMr. Miller came from General Electric Co.'s consumerelectronics operation.   Mr. Miller said that future growth will come primarilyfrom the Office 2000 division, which will develop and sellsoftware to help customers improve document management usingWang's imaging technology for turning paper into electronicimages. That group will be headed by William P. Ferry, seniorvice president.</TEXT></DOC>
