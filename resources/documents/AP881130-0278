Honda of America Mfg. Inc. expects to export 50,000 cars to Japanthat year and 20,000 to other countries not yet specified, companyspokesman Roger Lambert said. Honda earlier this year beganexporting U.S.-built two-door Accord Coupes to its home country.   The Accord Coupe is produced only at the Marysville plant, about35 miles northwest of Columbus in central Ohio.   Europe would be a likely market for Honda of America topenetrate, John Franck, an analyst with Provident National Bank inPhiladelphia, said Wednesday. American companies stand to benefitfrom lowered economic trade barriers that would result from themerger of Europe into a single market by 1992.   ``Where else would you go with them?'' Franck said. ``There areno barriers for American exports in Europe in 1992 that I know of.''   Under the current system, American companies are faced withdiffering regulations in each of the 12 countries in the EuropeanCommunity.   Franck said the export of Hondas serves the company's auto supplyneeds in Japan but also ``is an attempt to diffuse the idea ofshipping to Europe. They have been evasive in that area.''   Lambert said Honda of America does not yet know which countriesto target for its 1991 exports.   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz andamp; Birneyof New York City, also said Honda would be interested in theEuropean market.   ``The specter of American-made Japanese cars is something thatthe Europeans would find to be very paranoid about,'' she said.``Who wants to have more competition?''   Honda of America has been exporting motorcycles to world markets,including Europe, since 1980. It also exports four-door Accordsedans to Taiwan and Canada. The company plans to ship 4,500 cars toCanada and 1,500 to Taiwan this year.   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, expectsto ship 6,000 Accord Coupes to Japan by the end of this year, upfrom its original estimate of 4,000.   Lambert said there has been strong demand for the car, withorders for 2,000 Accord Coupes when the initial load of 540 carsarrived last April. He said the cars aroused curosity in dealers andcustomers.   ``They asked, will these cars be as good as the cars that comeout of Japan?'' he said. ``When the first cars arrived, they wereput under the microscope ... and they were very well-received.''   In Japan, the Coupe sells for 2.6 million yen, about $21,300 atcurrent exchange rates. A comparable car sells for $11,650 to$15,300 in the United States, depending on equipment.   Toshiaki Mishiba, a Honda dealer in Tokyo who has sold about 30of the Coupes since April, said Japanese are attracted to theleft-side steering wheel in the U.S.-made Honda. Japanese cars havethe steering wheel on the right side.   ``It gives Japanese an American feeling combined with confidencein Honda's quality,'' Mishiba said. ``With its leather seats,aluminum wheels and (American-made) Bose stereo system, it'srelatively cheap, about 300,000 yen ($2,500) less than a comparablecar sold in Japan.''   Ms. Keller said the Accord Coupe, a new model this year, mustprove it is a well-made car that retains its value if the company isto reach its export growth goals.   ``The Japanese customer may very well be buying this car thisyear because it's new, it's different. It has its badge ofdistinction,'' Ms. Keller said.   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979with a motorcycle plant at Marysville. The auto plant at Marysvillebegan production of the Accord four-door sedan in November 1982, andan engine plant at Anna in western Ohio started production in July1985.   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysvillein July 1986, and production of Civic engines began at Anna twomonths later.   Near the Marysville operation, Honda is building a new assemblyplant that is scheduled to begin production of Civic four-doorsedans in the fall of 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
