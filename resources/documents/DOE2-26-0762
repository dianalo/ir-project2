<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-0762 </DOCNO><TEXT>Modern mass spectrometers for stable isotope analysis offer accurate isotoperatio results from gaseous samples (CO/sub 2/, N/sub 2/, H/sub 2/, SO/sub2/) in a completely automated fashion. However, most samples of interesteither are associated with contaminant gases or the gas has to be liberatedby a chemical procedure prior to measurement. In most laboratories thissample preparation step is performed manually. As a consequence, samplethroughput is rather low and - despite skilful operation - the preparationprocedure varies slightly from one sample to the next affecting mainlythe reproducibility of the data.</TEXT></DOC>
