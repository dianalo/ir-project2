<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0704 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new rotation therapy technique using slit beams of 10 Mev X-rays (3.3mm x 50 mm at isocenter FCD 100 cm) was developed. The dose distributionof a 360-degree rotation of the slit beam described above is similarto that of a 137-Cs needle. The axes of a 360-degree rotation of theslit beam were arranged to cover the target volume to produce a dosedistribution similar to interstitial irradiation. This technique wasnamed as the slit beam rotation therapy. Twenty patients who had radioresistanttumors or were difficult to control by conventional therapy have beentreated with this technique, combined with or without conventional externalbeam irradiation, since 1982. Eight out of ten extracranial lesions showedgood regression and a palliative effect was obtained without severe morbidity.A one year survival rate of 67 % in six patients with glioblastoma multiformewas achieved by this method. Although the feasibility study is stillin progress, this new treatment technique looks highly promising.</TEXT></DOC>
