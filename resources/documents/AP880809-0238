The Fed announced shortly after the opening bell that it washiking the discount rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent,its highest level in more than two years. Stock prices immediatelyheaded south.   An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the Fedcharges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank'smost direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb oneconomic growth. Jumps in other interest rates, including those onmortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow.   Analysts were cautiously optimistic that the market, which hadbeen anticipating higher interest rates, could digest the hike inthe coming days. They reasoned that with the dollar up sharply onthe announcement, foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominatedinstruments like stocks and bonds.   Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott inPhiladelphia, noted that volume, minus dividend-capturingstrategies, was moderate and that there was no sign of any panicselling.   A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains andeven considered the news somewhat positive. ``The feeling is thatthe sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patientwill recover,'' said Michael Metz, vice president and technicalanalyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co.   He also said the action enhances the Fed's credibility amongthose who thought the central bank would refrain from making anydecisive moves before November's presidential election.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
