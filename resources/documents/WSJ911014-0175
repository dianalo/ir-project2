Chastened by the failure of another Italian public andprivate sector partnership, the defunct chemical ventureEnimont S.p.A., Enimont's former chairman, Lorenzo Necci, hasmanaged to convince both sectors that this time theircollaboration has all the ingredients for success.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Necci, now the special commissioner to the staterailroad, has won approval for the project from politiciansat home and from bankers world-wide, who are scrambling toget in on the project.   And while the sheer size of the project, with itspotential for cost overruns and missed deadlines, has somepeople wary, analysts say the project's dimensions also arepart of its appeal. They are impressed with Mr. Necci'spromise of innovation paired with sure profit.   &quot;The high-speed train project is one that's capable ofrepaying its investment costs,&quot; said Mr. Necci at a recentpresentation to analysts in Milan. &quot;{It} will produce strongreturns because the demand is already there.&quot;   The first trains of the high-speed network are expected togo into operation in five to seven years, and the estimatedprice tag of 30 trillion lire ($23.7 billion) is more thantwice the cost of the celebrated Eurotunnel project linkingBritain and France. The plans call for it to span the Italianpeninsula in a large `T' running from Turin across to Venice,and from Milan down to Naples, cutting travel times betweenthese cities in half.   &quot;It is an interesting project because it is an opportunityfor a huge technical, economic and financial jump,&quot; saidMarcel Sarmet, director for major projects and development atCredit Lyonnais, the French bank which is acting as specialadviser to the project.   At the center of the project is Treno Alta VelocitaS.p.A., which is 40%-owned by the Italian railroad Ferroviedello Stato and 60% by a group of international banks andfinancial institutions, including Credit Lyonnais, which owns2.5%. TAV was formed in July to develop the network, whichwill be operated by the Italian railroad.   In putting together the project, Mr. Necci has managed tostave off a deepseated mistrust between the public andprivate sectors in Italy. And he has warded off comparisonswith the failure of Enimont, which was crippled by constantsquabbling among its shareholders before it finally fellapart.   From the investor's point of view, the government'sagreement to fund 40% of the project and to pay interest onloans until the system becomes operational minimizes a gooddeal of the risk involved.   Meanwhile, the government has turned to the banks to raisethe outstanding capital on international financial markets.Ercole Incalza, TAV managing director, believes it'sprecisely TAV's quasi-private nature that has given theproject momentum at a time when public resources areincreasingly scarce.   &quot;It's the only area where the private sector is present,&quot;he says. &quot;This project would be almost impossible to financesolely by the state in a moment, such as this, of scarcefinancial resources.&quot;   Although financing for the project hasn't been definedyet, Mr. Sarmet said capital will be raised through acombination of equity and debt with a variety of instrumentson international markets. He said shareholders areconsidering an initial, privately placed capital increase forTAV, which will be brought to the market &quot;at a later stage,when it will be better defined.&quot;   TAV has been granted a monopoly over the high-speed trainlines through a 50-year, renewable contract signed last monthwith the Italian railroad. Once the network is developed, theItalian railroad will operate the high-speed rail service,paying rentals back to TAV for the use of the lines. In thisway, TAV's income will be guaranteed by the railroad in theform of rental payments, Mr. Necci said.   The project financing &quot;makes the position of the lenderless risky than it was in the Eurotunnel, which was financedthough non-recourse loans,&quot; said Mr. Sarmet, who also servedas the first financial director for Eurotunnel.   However, a key element for the success of the Italianproject will be ticket prices. Mr. Sarmat said that althoughthe government already has agreed to a commercial policy thatwill take costs into account, &quot;there's always a certainpolitical risk in Italy that a government 10 years later willtake a different view and could require non-competitivetariffs to be used.&quot;   Mr. Incalza says the price policy will have to strike abalance between the construction costs and the rates of otherforms of transportation.</TEXT></DOC>
