(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A reward is being offered for the greatpumpkin slasher, a vandal who destroyed what was billed as theMidwest's largest gourd and took its valuable seeds, authoritiessaid.   The pre-Halloween prank has dumbfounded residents of this upscalesuburb north of Chicago, where the 354-pound pumpkin was on displayat the posh Bannockburn Green Retail Center.   The slasher cut the pumpkin and made off with half of it and allthe seeds.   ``Someone did a very clean job of it,'' Enid Pesmen, propertymanager of the center, said Tuesday.   She bought the pumpkin for $200 from a grower in Nekoosa, Wis.,to use as a Halloween promotion at the center. It was to replace thecenter's annual pumpkin giveaway, canceled this year because of thedrought, said center spokeswoman Susan Hill.   The grower, Gary Keyzer, won the Midwest Pumpkin Weigh-Offcontest earlier this month with the mammoth pumpkin, and agreed topart with it if the seeds were returned to him, Ms. Hill said.   The center had planned to keep the pumpkin on display outdoorsuntil Halloween, then offer it to bakeries to make pies for thehungry, Ms. Hill said.   But during the weekend, the slasher struck. Workmen found theremains of the pumpkin Saturday night.   Mrs. Pesmen said she has no idea who might have pulled such astunt.   ``I assume they really wanted the seeds,'' she said.   She has offered a reward of about $100 for return of the seeds,but has little hope of finding the thief.   ``I don't know how we're going to find someone with half apumpkin and seeds,'' she said.   The mystery may not be identified until next growing season, if apatch of giant pumpkins crops up in Bannockburn.   ``That's what we're going to be on the look-out for,'' Ms. Pesmensaid.</TEXT></DOC>
