Although the storm hit eastern Rhode Island with windstopping 115 miles per hour, initial damage forecasts frominsurers and analysts were relatively small. MichaelFrinquelli, an insurance analyst with Salomon Brothers, saidhe expects claims to total around $250 million to $300million, only a fraction of claims from other hurricanes inrecent years.</LP><TEXT>   By comparison, Hurricane Hugo, which hit several islandsin the Caribbean and Charleston, S.C., in 1989, resulted inclaims to insurers of $4 billion, Mr. Frinquelli said. Ifclaims from Hurricane Bob are as low as he predicts, earningsper share for property and casualty insurers hurt by thestorm could be reduced by only five to ten cents for thethird quarter, he said.   Sean F. Mooney, a senior vice president and economist forthe Insurance Information Institute, said he expects thatHurricane Bob will cause damage resulting in claims of lessthan $1 billion. By comparison, in the first half of thisyear, the insurance industry suffered losses from storms of arecord $2.6 billion.   Insurers with large property and casualty businesses inRhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- states whichappeared yesterday afternoon to be hardest hit by thisseason's first hurricane to hit land -- had received only atrickle of calls by late yesterday afternoon. The hurricane'scenter crossed eastern Rhode Island around 3 p.m. yesterday.   Some insurers began gathering special teams in their NewEngland offices to deal with claims. Aetna Life andamp; CasualtyCo., for example, began assembling teams of claims adjustersin its Hartford, Conn., headquarters Sunday night. But thecrew of 50 claims adjusters was stranded in Hartfordyesterday, unable to move into the affected area becauseroads were closed, said Robert Burnham, national director ofclaims.   Mr. Frinquelli said he doesn't expect the storm to besevere enough to reverse heavy price cutting in theproperty-casualty industry, which sometimes happens followinglarge losses from catastrophes.</TEXT></DOC>
