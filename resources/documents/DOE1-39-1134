Estimates of land elevations are obtainedfrom topographic maps, and flood elevations are estimated using the dambreach and flood routing (DAMBRK) model. The calculations are performedat a disaggregate spatial scale by various land use and industrial classificationcategories. The basic areal units are city blocks for urbanized areas,enumeration districts, and Census tracts. Depth-damage functions, whichprovide an estimate of damages as a proportion of the existing valueof the structure, are estimated statistically. Computer software calledDAMAGE is used to combine the economic, flood elevation, and depth-damageinformation to compute economic losses for different possible flood stagesand for different inflow events. Two case studies are presented as illustrationsof the method. 19 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
