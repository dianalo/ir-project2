Mohammed Khalid Massarwa, 46, said Thursday that the IsraeliForeign Ministry told him his two-year term would not be extendedbecause the ministry was considering closing the Atlanta consulate.   An Israeli Embassy spokesman in Washington, David Peleg, saidthere are no immediate plans to close the consulate. He would notdiscuss the reasons for not extending Massarwa's appointment.   Much of Atlanta's Jewish community supported Massarwa asevidence of Israel's commitment to pluralistic democracy.   ``First and foremost, I thought it was terrific to have himhere,'' said Harriet Zimmerman, a vice president of the AmericanIsrael Public Affairs Committee. ``I have a lot of respect forhim.''   But critics who campaigned for Massarwa's return to Israel saidthe ministry is dismissing him because of his comments favoring aPalestinian homeland.   Jay Starkman, leader of a ``Massarwa Must Go'' campaign, alsosaid an Arab could not properly represent the Jewish state.   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens had denounced Massarwa forcomments he made last summer in a speech to the Atlanta chapter ofthe United Nations Association. Two Israeli newspapers reported inSeptember that Massarwa said allowing the Palestinians to establisha homeland might solve Israel's security problems.   Massarwa's statement conflicted with the policy of Israel'sgoverning Likud bloc. The rival Labor Party was responsible forMassarwa's appointment in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
