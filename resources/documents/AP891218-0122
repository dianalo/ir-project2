One raised thepossibility that chemical weapons will soon be used.   Terrorist groups appear to be moving away from hijackings andtoward airplane bombings, as evidenced by the Pan Am explosion lastDecember and by the bombings this year of an Avianca plane overColombia and a French UTA jetliner over Niger in Africa, saidAnthony Wayne of the State Department's office on counter-terrorism.   Thus, he said, the number of terrorist incidents might declinewhile the number of casualties would grow.   In the first 10 months of the year, 410 people were killed ininternational terrorist attacks, according to preliminary figurescompiled by the State Department. In the corresponding period lastyear, 308 people were killed.   Terrorism has become so pervasive ``that it's lost much of itsshock value,'' said Seth Cropsey, deputy assistant secretary ofstate for special operations. ``Terrorists, to stay on the frontpage and in the public eye feel they must increase the carnage,''he said.   As a result, ``it's likely that we'll see more efforts to bombplanes and the appearance of new weapons and tactics previouslyshunned by terrorist groups. Indeed, future concern is the possibleintroduction of biochemical agents,'' he said.   Cropsey declined to elaborate on such prospects, citingintelligence sources.   A third official, speaking on a seminar panel with the othertwo, cautioned against any expectation that reforms in the SovietUnion would result in a lessening of support for countries such asCuba, Syria and Nicaragua that have been accused of financingterrorist groups.   ``Until proven wrong, we should not operate'' on thatassumption, said Oliver B. Revell, associate deputy director ofinvestigations at the FBI.   Revell, speaking at a George Washington University symposium onterrorism, said terrorist organizations such as theMarxist-oriented Japanese Red Army and the Palestine LiberationFront-General Command will continue to pose a threat to U.S.interests and to Americans in 1990.   Investigations have focused on the PFLP-GC as a prime suspect inthe bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland last December inwhich 270 people _ among them 200 Americans _ were killed.   Revell also said ``a very small number of tightly disciplined''Iranians among the 325,000 Iranians living in the United Statescould present a threat to Americans. ``Anti-U.S. sentiment hascontinued'' since the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini lastsummer, Revell said.   Some 10,000 Iranian students on scholarships from theirgovernments live in the United States and ``with thisinfrastructure, the threat appears to be substantial,'' he said.   Tehran Radio reported in recent months on several meetingsbetween senior Iranian officials and the leader of the PFLP-GC.   In another development, a congressional report issued Mondaysaid that increased security procedures since the bombing of Flight103 are not being carried out properly at high-risk foreignairports due to a lack of training standards.   The General Accounting Office report faulted the FederalAviation Administration for not establishing minimum trainingrequirements and standards for the extra security measures takenfollowing the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster.</TEXT></DOC>
