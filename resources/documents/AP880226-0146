(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five wild cougars or mountain lionsfrom Texas will be released in a forest in northeastern Florida tosee if the closely related but endangered Florida panther cansurvive there, wildlife officials said Friday.   If the re-introduction plan succeeds, the Florida panther couldbe roaming the Osceola National Forest by the next decade, theysaid.   The big cats will be fitted and radio collars and sterilizedbefore they are released in April or May in the forest north ofLake City, said Tom Logan, chief of the bureau of wildlife researchfor the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.   The Osceola National Forest was selected because of its size,habitat and food base. The surviving population of Florida panthersnow is largely confined to southern Florida in the Everglades andBig Cypress National Preserve, although sightings have beenreported around Lake Okeechobee and inland from Cape Canaveral.   It is impossible to use Florida panthers for the first phases ofthe project because only a few dozen of them survive, Logan said.   ``We don't have enough to experiment with,'' Logan said.   After the one-year experiment, the five cougars will be removedfrom the area and the second phase of the project will begin, withthe release of captive-born cougars or hybrid offspring of aFlorida panther and a cougar.   So far, attempts to mate Big Guy, a Florida panther injuredseveral years ago by a car, with female cougars at White OakPlantation near Yulee have been unsuccessful.   ``He's more aggressive than in past years. We have our fingerscrossed,'' said Chris Belden, an official with the panther project.   If the first two phases of the project are successful, the finalphase would be the introduction of Florida panthers into the area.   ``Each phase of the proposed experiment is structured to enableus to identify and deal with any problems that might come up. Andthe radio collars would enable us to locate and remove any of thecats at any time we believe is necessary,'' Logan said.   The plan calls for livestock owners to be paid for any lossescaused by the cats.   Wildlife officials said they plan no special hunting seasonrestrictions for the benefit of the cats, but said it is unlikelythat people will ever see the animals.   ``They are very reclusive animals and the likelihood ofinteraction is very, very slim,'' said Logan.</TEXT></DOC>
