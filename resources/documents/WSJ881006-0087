But the aerospace contractor declined comment on whether the officers are among a number of current and former officials that Sundstrand previously disclosed may be charged with criminal wrongdoing as a result of the investigation. Sundstrand also has said that the company itself may face criminal charges.    Anton Valukas, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, declined comment on Sundstrand's personnel shifts.    Sundstrand, Rockford, Ill., previously said that within the next 12 months it will pay out at least $100 million relating to &quot;contract disputes&quot; with the government. The company has also disclosed that it and its Sundstrand Data Control Inc. subsidiary near Seattle, Wash., have been the subject of federal grand jury investigations.    Sundstrand said that Bernard W. Kittle, corporate group vice president for its advanced technology group, and Joseph J. McCarthy, vice president, finance and administration for the advanced technology group, have been placed on &quot;administrative leave.&quot;    Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam declined to elaborate on what Sundstrand meant by administrative leave, how long such a leave might last, or whether the two would be paid while on leave.    However, Mr. Vernam said that Harry Stonecipher, Sundstrand president and chief operating officer, was assuming Mr. Kittle's duties as acting group vice president.    The company added that A. Adrian Kemper, Sundstrand corporate controller, has been reassigned as controller for the company's industrial products segment.    None of the three Sundstrand officials could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
