Police arrested 14 members of the environmental organizationafter some protesters tried to climb the cables of the Conynghamand four others jumped into the water to stop the warship fromdocking.   Police on rubber dinghies boarded the Greenpeace ship Moby Dickand towed it from the harbor. The Moby Dick had blocked the port ofAalborg to demand guarantees from the destroyer's captain that the4,500-ton warship did not carry nuclear arms.   Activists surrounding the Conyngham in rubber boats started toclimb in its cables but were forced down by water sprayed fromhoses. The destroyer had been waiting at anchor since early morningin the fiord outside the city in northern Jutland.   In a final effort to stop the boat from docking, four activistsundressed and jumped into the water, but they were removed bypolice.   Earlier Saturday, Greenpeace tried to deliver a letter to theship's captain, but it fell into the water. Signed by SocialDemocratic leader Svend Auken and others, the letter was a reminderof Denmark's non-nuclear policy.   The visit was the first by an American warship since thegovernment decided in June that visiting warships did not have tonotify Denmark if they carried nuclear weapons.   The opposition Social Democrats had demanded that visitingwarships adhere to Denmark's non-nuclear policy, and the issueforced elections May 10.   The United States and Britain said the Social Democrats'proposal, if implemented, would have threatened NATO solidarity andviolated their policies, which forbid disclosure of which shipscarry nuclear arms.   Greenpeace claims the American destroyer was inspected andauthorized to carry and launch nuclear arms as late as January 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
