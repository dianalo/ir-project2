Contracts for distant delivery, though, have declined in recent days as traders firm up positions in anticipation of Tuesday's hog and pig report.    The April contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 7 cents a pound to 48.32 cents. It has risen more than 8% since March 11, when it settled at 44.60.    Tuesday's report, due from the Agriculture Department after trading's close, is expected to show that producers are continuing a slight expansion in herds. The quarterly 10-state report represents about 78% of the nation's hog producers.    The report probably will show that as of March 1, producers increased their breeding herds about 2% to 6% from a year ago, analysts said. The number of breeding animals is crucial to the size of future herds.    Producers are being encouraged to expand their herds because of continued cheap feed prices and strong demand, analysts said. &quot;Grain prices are low and cattle prices are expected to be strong through the second quarter; that makes hogs strong too,&quot; said Joel Karlin, director of research for Jack Carl/312 Futures Inc. in Chicago.    Farrowing, or birth, intentions for March through May are expected to increase 7% to 8% from a year ago. June through August intentions might be as much as 10% more, according to Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.    The total population of hogs is expected to be unchanged from a year earlier. An increase in hogs under 60 pounds, though, and a decrease in heavier weight classes could be reported, Mr. Abbenhaus said.    In recent days, anticipation of the report has put pressure on summer and fall contracts, but wet weather conditions in the western part of the Corn Belt has slowed the movement of hogs to market, tightening supplies and boosting the April contract.    Bad weather has also helped cattle prices climb. Blizzard conditions in the Texas Panhandle, western Kansas and western Nebraska may have set shipments of animals to slaughter back about a week, according to Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. The weather conditions are making an already tight supply of animals even tighter, he said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: British pound prices fell sharply as traders took profits after the recent run-up and shifted funds into other currencies that are experiencing renewed volatility. A drop in oil prices added to the pound's decline, said Anne Mills, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. She estimated that the pound contract for June delivery would get strong support from technically oriented traders if it falls as low as 1.58. The June contract fell 0.0090 to 1.5905 yesterday. Most other currency futures traded in narrow ranges as traders feared further intervention in support of the dollar by the central banks of leading industrial countries. Japanese yen prices rose slightly, while West German mark and Swiss franc prices fell.    ENERGY: Oil prices fell in response to inventory statistics released by an industry group after the market closed Tuesday. The American Petroleum Institute's figures showed a surprising rise in U.S. refinery utilization and crude oil production for the week ended last Friday. Higher refinery output translates into more distillate products on the market and lower prices, which tend to drag down crude prices. &quot;That's not a good foundation to build a bullish market on,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. In particular, the domestic refinery rate, which rose to 78.7% of capacity from 75.7% a week earlier, &quot;means an upward shift in the level of products that can now be expected to flow from refineries,&quot; said Robert Boslego, vice president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., consulting firm. Some industry analysts, moreover, expect further buildups in refined products in the coming weeks. The oil industry &quot;is gearing up for an early and strong driving season,&quot; said Jan Lundberg, chief executive officer of Lundberg Reports Corp., Fredericksburg, Va. Crude oil for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange skidded 24 cents a barrel, to $18.47, with sharp losses in heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices.    COCOA: Prices closed lower, retreating from early gains. The selling seemed to reflect disappointment about the continued failure of cocoa producing and consuming nations to agree on measures for managing the buffer stock provided for by the International Cocoa Agreement, analysts said. Purchases from Malaysia, which is the world's fourth-largest producer but isn't a partner in the accord, are a major source of dispute, they said. The contract for May delivery on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York settled $17 below Tuesday's close, at $1,920 per metric ton. Earlier in the day it traded as high as $1,948. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. Prices for deliveries in later months had smaller price declines. May's correction was steeper because last week the contract rose more than later months, analysts said. Its early rise yesterday reflected ill-fated hopes that an agreement was near among producers and consumer representatives meeting this week in London, analysts said. Prices eased as those hopes faded through the day, they said. A major stumbling block in London was the amount of cocoa the buffer stock manager would be allowed to buy from Malaysia. Producers want to limit purchases from non-member nations to 10% of purchases at any given time and limit Malaysia to half that amount, or 5%, an analyst said. But consumers were said to be pressing for a larger share of the buffer stock purchases to go to Malaysia, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
