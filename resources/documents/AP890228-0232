(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's point man on the savingsand loan crisis urged a group representing smaller banks Tuesday toenthusiastically support the administration's plan for rescuing thethrift industry even though they may have reservations about someaspects.   Richard C. Breeden, who oversaw drafting of the president's plan,told a meeting of the Independent Bankers Association of Americathat quibbling over details of the plan could dangerously delayurgently needed action.   The administration has estimated the cost of rescuing insolventor teetering Sandamp;Ls at $90 billion and the weak one-third of theindustry is losing money at the rate of $40 million a day.   ``At $40 million a day, we shouldn't launch into a six-monthdebate,'' Breeden told the bankers, meeting at the Anaheim HiltonHotel. ``We simply have a huge problem and we simply have to get onwith it.''   The president has proposed spending $39.9 billion of tax moneyover the next decade to finance the bailout. Additionally, savingsand loans and to a lesser extent banks would pay more for theirfederal deposit insurance.   Members of the independent bankers group, which representscommunity banks with assets of $100 million or less, have objectedthat higher insurance premiums would place a disproportionate burdenon them.   They also have complained that the president's plan does littleto remedy what they see as inequities between regulation of theirindustry and the credit unions with which they compete.   One aspect of the plan that has drawn little opposition is thepresident's proposal that federal regulators should rein in whatmany see as overly aggressive management in the thrift industry.Under the Bush plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, whichoversees the Sandamp;L business, would be placed under control of theTreasury, as has long been the case with bank regulation.   ``Critical decisions of the bank board over the last decadeconcerning capital adequacy, capital averaging, accounting rules,chartering standards and other areas of thrift supervision do notseem to have adequately protected the public marketplace and thetaxpayers,'' Breeden said.   ``As a result, we must instill accountability at the top to helpprevent a repetition of this situation.''   The president's aide drew sustained applause from the bankerswhen he reminded them the president wants to spend an additional $50million a year to prosecute dishonest thrift managers.   ``The president is determined to see that those who have causedmassive losses to American society through criminal wrongdoing willbe sought out, pursued relentlessly and placed behind bars wherethey belong for a long time,'' Breeden said.   A congressional study found fraud played some role in up toone-third of thrift failures to date.</TEXT></DOC>
