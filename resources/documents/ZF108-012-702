Burchett Management Systems Plc wrapped upa neat deal, acquiring US computer-aided software engineering tools developerMeta Systems Inc, Ann Arbor, Michigan and its UK distributor, Keith LondonAssociates Ltd, Welwyn, Hertfordshire, for #2.49m in total, #1.72m of it incash between now and the end of the year: Meta is best known for itsStructured Architect system written for MS-DOS microcomputers, adopted forthe UK by Keith London back in November 1987 (CI No 809).andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Co has a contract for 40,000 workstations - its 6386 systems presumably- with a potential value of $850m if extended from its initial three yearsfor the full seven years, from the US Department of Transportation: theOffice of Automation Technology and Services contract was awarded by theFederal Aviation Administration, which is the contracting agency on behalf ofthe Department of Transportation.andM;- o -andM;Zenith Electronics Corp last week completed the sale of Zenith Data Systemsto Groupe Bull SA and received $496.4m in cash, which it says represents 90%of the estimated purchase price based on the adjusted net book value of theunit at the end of November - when it was about $55m lower than at the end ofSeptember as inventories fell; the final price will be based on net bookvalue at December 28.andM;- o -andM;Singer andamp; Friedlander Group and allies now speak for 16.36% of the shares ofApricot Computers Plc.andM;- o -andM;Robert Maxwell duly topped the 150 pence a share offer for Monotype Corp Plcby US investment group King Black andamp; Associates through its Pointplus fundwith a 160 pence a share &quot;final&quot; offer - but Pointplus immediately bought inthe market at 161 pence and said that it would now offer that to all theholders.andM;- o -andM;The management buyout of the Irish business of Memory Computer Plc - nowcalling itself Anglo Irish Memory Computer - is off, and a refinancingpackage is in negotiation.andM;- o -andM;Bull SA and Thomson SA's Christmases received a boost last week in the shapeof a government hand-out totalling $583m to increase their internationalpresence and to finance acquisitions such Bull's takeover of Zenith DataSystems currently going through: in justification of this governmentlargesse, Minister for French Industry Roger Fauroux said that unlike the&quot;opportunist&quot; European policies followed by the UK and Eire in informationtechnology, France was following a policy of putting &quot;credible actors on theinternational stage&quot;.andM;- o -andM;Fauroux gave the French technology sector yet more cause for optimism bydeclaring that the government should increase its support of research anddevelopment: this support will take the form of increased tax relief forresearch projects and more direct financial aid made available by the variousgovernment departments - by 1990, it is estimated that government aid willhave risen 8% to $790m in this area, with a large part of that going towardsThomson SA's work on high-definition TV; around $117m will go to the &quot;Eureka&quot;European Research and Development project.andM;- o -andM;Indications are that the US authorities will allow US West Inc to installonly an analogue and not a digital cellular system under its joint ventureagreement with the Hungarian telecommunications authorities, the reason beingthat digital exchanges are regarded as equivalent to supercomputers andtherefore too sensitive to be granted export licences for Comecon countries;one solution might be to install all the switches for the system across theborder in Austria.andM;- o -andM;NCR Corp is cheering its shareholders by launching its fourth share buy-inprogramme, proposing to buy up to 15m shares over the next two years, addingto the 24m it has bought in or authorised for purchase since 1987: downsideis that the programme will cost almost $900m at current prices, and it isdebatable whether a technology company should spend so much of its cash in sounproductive a manner.andM;- o -andM;Paging services and locum organiser for doctors Air Call (Holdings) Plc isbeing sold again in a second management buyout valuing it at #41.4m: thecompany was taken private in 1986 in a management buyout.andM;- o -andM;Sumitomo Corp has been awarded the $43m contract for a fibre optic cable tolink East Java with Kalimantan and complete the fibre trunk between Jakartaand Samarinda, by Perumtel, the Indonesian state telecommunications company:Perumtel has a $4,000m investment programme to double its lines by 1994.andM;- o -andM;And Indonesia's PT Indosat has signed with Singapore Telecom to share thecost of a 620 mile fibre optic cable linking Indonesia and Singapore, withthe construction contract to be put out to tender shortly: the cable, plannedto be completed in 1993, will have capacity for 15,000 concurrent calls.andM;- o -andM;DPC Acquisition Corp had pulled in enough shares to give it 44% ofDataproducts Corp at the original close last week, and has hopefully extendedthe offer to January 9.andM;- o -andM;President Bush has approved the delivery of those three Hughes Aircraft Cosatellites to China (CI No 1,332), saying that as they were for civil use,they should not have been caught up in the ban on export of militaryequipment to the Gerontocratic Republic: the decision is expected to raise astorm in Congress, which is critical of moves to restore normal relationswith China in the wake of the massacre.andM;- o -andM;The first fibre optic cable between Spain and the Canary Islands is down andready to run: Telefonica de Espana SA has begun testing the 906-mile $67mPencan-4 cable, which will replace three coaxial cables and has capacity for11,520 concurrent calls; a Pencan-5 with the same capacity will be laid in1992.andM;- o -andM;Stratus Computer graduated to the New York Stock Exchange Big Board.andM;- o -andM;The European Investment Bank is lending Irish Telecommunications InvestmentsPlc $15m to help its programme to convert the national domestic andinternational networks to all-digital operation by 1991.andM;- o -andM;With chairmen all over the world deciding that they'd like a nice acquisitionfor Christmas, there was plenty to write about in preparing this issue, butgetting the details during the dead period between Christmas and New Yearproved well-nigh impossible: one company was working but its fax machine wasout of order and the maintenance men out of earshot, others were manned by ananswering machine, and while Learmonth andamp; Burchett Management Systems Plc wasunmanaged for the break, shareholders will be happy to know that the peoplethat actually generate the company's wealth were hard at it - no admin, butthe programmers were working.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
