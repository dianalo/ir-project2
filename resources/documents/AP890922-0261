Shayne Walters, 32, of Laguna Hills, Calif., pleaded guiltyThursday in Manhattan federal court to a conspiracy count for theinsider trading and to perjury for lying under oath to aninvestigator of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Walters, a former sales representative for R.R. Donnelley andamp; SonsCo., agreed to cooperate in a federal investigation of illegaltrading using purloined copies of the business weekly from 1986 to1988. The magazine has not been charged.   Donnelley is a Chicago-based printer of Business Week. Waltersworked for the company from January 1983 until April.   He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on eachof the two charges. He is to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. DistrictJudge John Walker Jr.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson said his office wouldrecommend a lenient sentence for Walters based on the information hegives the government.   The conspiracy charge alleged that between September 1986 andJuly 1988, Walters obtained advance copies of Business Week from theDonnelley printing plant in Torrance, Calif., and then supplied themto his stockbroker who traded on companies reported favorably in the``Inside Wall Street'' column.   Walters told the judge that he would leave his house at 3:45 a.m.on Thursdays, the day the magazine was distributed, and drive 45miles to the plant to get a copy of the magazine.   He then would drive 45 miles home and give the magazine to hisstockbroker, Walters said. He also said the stockbroker, who was notidentified, paid him for some of the advance copies.   Walters was the latest person to plead guilty to schemesinvolving trading on prepublication copies of ``Inside Wall Street.''   William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. broker, and S.G.(Rudy) Ruderman, the former broadcast editor for Business Week, hadpreviously pleaded guilty to similar charges and were each sentencedto six months in prison.   At least seven other Donnelley employees have either resigned orbeen fired in wake of the Business Week scandal. The SEC also hassued Dillon and five others.   In a settlement reached with the SEC in August, Walters agreed topay $62,000 in restitution and civil penalties _ an amount doublehis illegal profits.   Papers filed by the SEC said Walters purchased and sold stockfrom 13 companies based on information in the magazine and that thestockbroker traded on more than 40 companies.   The perjury charge said Walters lied to an SEC investigator onMarch 16 when he said he had never seen an advance copy of BusinessWeek.</TEXT></DOC>
