Two major publishing concerns -- Macmillan Inc. of New York and Maxwell Communication Corp. of Britain -- recently bought big stakes in the company and say they may seek control. And a group including Robert M. Bass, the Fort Worth, Texas, investor, has become the company's biggest holder, with a 16.2% stake.    The interest mainly reflects some promising growth businesses for Bell andamp; Howell. After selling its movie-camera business eight years ago, the company has positioned itself firmly in the fast-expanding information and business-services industry.    In the past five years, revenue at its document and mail-processing unit has surged two-thirds and at its information-storage and retrieval unit revenue has jumped a third. Profit at the mail-processing unit has almost tripled. Both units are leaders in the office-automation boom.    In addition, the company's publishing subsidiary, a leading school textbook company, is sitting on a demographic gold mine as the children of Baby Boomers fill more classrooms. In the past five years, the unit's revenue and earnings have more than doubled.    &quot;Some management actions and some good luck have created a good company with above-average earnings potential,&quot; says George Podrasky, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps, in Chicago.    Analysts estimate that the company has a per-share break-up value of between 65 and the high 80s. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bell andamp; Howell common closed at 59 1/2, down 1/4.    Perhaps of greatest interest to Macmillan and Maxwell, which said it wants to acquire Skokie, Ill.-based Bell andamp; Howell in a friendly deal, is the Merrill book division of the publishing unit. &quot;Without question it is the gem,&quot; says Bert Boksen, an analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. &quot;With good growth prospects, it's a nice fit with either one.&quot;    Merrill is one of the nation's biggest publishers of mathematics and science textbooks. Analysts estimate both will be in stronger demand as schools come under more pressure to emphasize those subjects. Over the long-term, analysts believe that market demand will expand further as the children of Baby Boomers move into grade schools.    A report earlier this year by L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc., New York, estimates that 1987 revenue for the publishing group, as a whole, will jump about 28% to $225 million from the 1986 level, while operating earnings will rise about 29% to $32 million.    Part of the publishing group's anticipated increase is due to Bell andamp; Howell's new electronic catalog system, the IDB2000, introduced early this year. At the time, the company estimated it would generate $100 million in sales by 1991. But the product has sparked so much interest that the company now says it could reach the $100 million mark by 1989.    Already used at about 100 General Motors Corp. dealerships, the computer system allows dealers to quickly identify the parts for a car, avoiding the time-consuming process of paging through manuals.    Some analysts believe Bell andamp; Howell over the years has plugged millions of dollars into products that flopped, and that the company finally came up with a big winner with the IDB2000. &quot;It has very explosive growth potential,&quot; says Mr. Boksen.    It isn't clear how much luck Bell andamp; Howell will have in defending itself from a takeover bid, should one surface. Company officials have said they wish to remain independent, and earlier this week backed it up by beefing up a &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover measure.    There's also some speculation that the Bass group may side with management to help it thwart a hostile buy-out. Representatives of the Bass group reaffirmed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the group's stake in Bell andamp; Howell was for investment purposes only and that management has its support. Officials for the Bass group couldn't be reached for elaboration.    But some analysts believe the Bass group will support management only until Bell andamp; Howell gets a sufficiently high offer. &quot;Like any investor,&quot; says Mr. Podrasky, &quot;(the Basses) want to maximize the total potential of their investment.&quot;    ---   Bell andamp; Howell   (NYSE; Symbol: BHW)   Business: Publishing and information services.
