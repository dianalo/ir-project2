A rival package says its ingredients promote healthy skin, aid digestion and even help heal wounds. Another cereal alludes to cancer prevention.    As cereal companies make their section of the supermarket sound more like a drugstore, government regulators, medical groups and consumer advocates are raising objections. General Mills Inc., for example, can't sell its new Benefit cereal in Texas until it substantiates the product's reputed cholesterol-lowering properties.    In an effort to mollify the regulators, Kellogg Co. issued a call yesterday for the industry to police itself. The biggest U.S. cereal maker proposed a marketing guide that seeks to differentiate between advertised &quot;health messages&quot; and &quot;health claims.&quot;    The Battle Creek, Mich., company says manufacturers should provide a &quot;health message&quot; about a total diet that may include the product. An inappropriate &quot;health claim&quot; would be one that touts a specific product or ingredient as preventing or treating a disease. &quot;Any statement regarding a specific food that goes beyond the concept of a total diet . . . should be subjected to {the Food and Drug Administration's} regulatory approval process,&quot; Kellogg contends.    Kellogg urged that even health &quot;messages&quot; be used only where they can be supported by what it called &quot;adequately substantiated scientific studies&quot; -- a concept it didn't immediately define.    &quot;This is unquestionably an indirect shot at General Mills,&quot; says John McMillin, food analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., noting the questions raised about the study cited in General Mills' advertising for Benefit. As for how one can distinguish between a &quot;claim&quot; and a &quot;message,&quot; he says, &quot;it's a very fine line.&quot;    Kellogg also seemed to send a mixed message. Even as it proposed the industry standard, the company rolled out a new cereal called &quot;Heartwise,&quot; a name that seems to make a health claim. Kellogg says Heartwise has more soluble fiber than any other ready-to-eat cereal. That's important, Kellogg contends, because &quot;health experts&quot; recommend that Americans eat more fiber as part of a good diet.    The health-claims issue currently is being tackled by the FDA and Congress, which are drafting new food-labeling laws. But several states, weary of that protracted process, are starting to act on their own. In Texas, where General Mills just this week met again over the Benefit issue, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner says he has misgivings about any health claim or message. &quot;Heart attacks are way too serious to put on cereal boxes or in 30-second TV spots,&quot; he says.    General Mills isn't the only cereal company to come under Mr. Gardner's scrutiny. He has been talking with Quaker Oats Co. for more than a year over the cereal maker's claims that oatmeal reduces the risk of heart disease. &quot;Quaker is hyping a product,&quot; he says. &quot;If you have cholesterol problems, you don't see Quaker. You see your doctor.&quot;    Ronald Bottrell, a spokesman for Quaker in Chicago, cites several studies that found that &quot;both oatmeal and oat bran, as part of a low-fat diet, helped contribute to a cholesterol reduction.&quot; He especially notes one study, done at Northwestern University Medical School, which Quaker helped to fund. As for Kellogg's call for self-policing, Mr. Bottrell says, &quot;Food manufacturers should be able to show a link between their products and any health-related effects they could have -- provided it is based on reliable scientific research.&quot;    In Minneapolis, a General Mills official took issue with Kellogg's proposal. &quot;My feeling is that the consumer is not going to see a difference between a health message and a health claim,&quot; said Vice Chairman Arthur Schulze. &quot;It looks like they've made a distinction without a difference.&quot;    Self-regulation may be in for a grilling. According to Norine Olson-Elm of the Minnesota attorney general's office of consumer affairs, &quot;We're not scientists, but we can rely on experts as well as companies can, and we will be doing that.&quot;    The FDA plans hearings around the country, beginning in October, on food labeling. &quot;We expect health claims will be the most contentious issue,&quot; says agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit. &quot;Our plan is, by early next year, to propose a regulation that covers the entire range of food labeling . . . . Consumers want a change.&quot;    Indeed they do, says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, which is developing its version of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval in response to requests from perplexed shoppers. Called &quot;HeartGuide,&quot; the program will review various foods for their ability to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Those items that pass association guidelines -- manufacturers will pay for the product evaluation -- would bear an endorsement sticker. </TEXT></DOC>
