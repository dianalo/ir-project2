AuthorityPart B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub.L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA),Pub. L. 100-12, and by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendmentsof 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100-357,\1\<NOTE/> created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Productsother than Automobiles. The consumer products subject to this program (oftenreferred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditionersand central air conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; room air conditioners;fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumerproduct classified by the Secretary of Energy. Section 322. To date, theSecretary has not so classified any additional products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPA, NAECA,and NAECA 1988, is referred to in this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B ofTitle III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291 <T3>et seq.</T3> Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPA only,is referred to in this notice as NECPA.Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: Testing,labeling, and mandatory energy conservation standards. The Department ofEnergy (DOE or Department), in consultation with the National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST), is required to amend or establish newtest procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section323. The purpose of the test procedures is to provide for test resultsthat reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operatingcosts of each of the covered products. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedureis not required if DOE determines by rule that one cannot be developed.Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eighty days after a test procedure fora product is adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumptionof, or the cost of energy consumed by the product except as reflected ina test conducted according to the DOE procedure. Section 323(c)(2).The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is required by the Act to prescriberules governing the labeling of covered products for which test procedureshave been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to requirethat each particular model of a covered product bear a label that indicatesits annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating costsfor other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimatedoperating cost is not required under section 324 if the FTC determinesthat such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasingdecisions or is not economically feasible. In such a case, FTC must requirea different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At thepresent time there are FTC rules requiring labels for the following products:room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters,freezers, refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, and central air conditioners.44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, and 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987.For each of 12 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federalenergy conservation standard. Section 325 (b) through (h). The Act establisheseffective dates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, dependingon the product, and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed bythe Department within three to ten years, also depending on the product.Section 325 (b) through (h). After the specified three- to ten-year period,DOE may promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretarymay not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowableenergy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a coveredproduct. Section 325(l)(1). The Department's first review of standardsis for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. The Act requiresDOE to publish a final rule for these products by July 1, 1989. Section325(b)(3)(A)(i).The Act also directs DOE to prescribe an energy conservation standard,no later than January 1, 1989, for small gas furnaces, i.e., gas furnaceshaving an input of less than 45,000 Btu per hour and manufactured on orafter January 1, 1992. Section 325(f)(1)(B).With regard to another covered product, television sets, the Act allowsthe Department to prescribe an applicable standard; however, such standardmay not become effective before January 1, 1992. Section 325(i)(3).These products (refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers; smallgas furnaces; and television sets) are the subject of this rulemaking.Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achievethe maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasibleand economically justified. Section 325(1)(2)(A).Section 325(1)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standardis economically justified, it must first solicit comments on a proposedstandard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determinethat the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatestextent practicable, on a weighing of the following seven factors:(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on theconsumers of the products subject to such standard;(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average lifeof the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increasein the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expensesof, the covered products which are likely to result from the impositionof the standard;(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directlyfrom the imposition of the standard;(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered productslikely to result from the imposition of the standard;(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, determined in writing bythe Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of thestandard;(6) The need for national energy conservation; and(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant. In addition, the Actspecifies criteria for petitions to DOE in regard to amendments to standards.Section 325(k). Under the Act, any person may petition the Department toconduct a rulemaking to amend a Federal energy conservation standard forany covered product. Section 325(k)(1). The Department must grant sucha petition if it determines that an amended standard will result in significantconservation of energy, is technologically feasible and is cost effective.Section 325(k)(2).Sections 325(k)(3) (A) and (B) stipulate that in no case may an amendedstandard apply to products manufactured within three years or five years,depending on the product, after publication of the final rule establishinga standard.Prior to proposing a new or amended standard, DOE is required to publishan advance notice of proposed rulemaking which specifies the type (or class)of covered product to which the rule may apply and which provides a 60-dayperiod during which interested persons may submit written comments. Section325(m)(1) (A) and (B).Section 325(q) provides that manufacturers having annual gross revenuesnot exceeding $8 million may apply to DOE for an exemption from all orpart of the requirements of an energy conservation standard. This exemptionmay not extend beyond two years from the effective date of any standardsrequirement. This authority will not be exercised by DOE unless, afterwritten consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary finds thatfailure to allow the exemption would likely result in a lessening of competition.Section 326 of the Act requires manufacturers to submit information orreports to assure that each covered product to which a standard appliesmeets the required energy efficiency level. The Act also specifies thatin determining information requirements, DOE consider existing sourcesof information, including nationally recognized trade association certificationprograms. Section 326(d).Enforcement-related provisions of the Act provide for: (1) DOE to prescriberules requiring manufacturers to allow the Department to observe testingand inspect results of testing conducted by the manufacturer (section 326(b)(5)); (2) manufacturers to supply to DOE a reasonable number of productsfor testing purposes (section 326(b)(3)); (3) manufacturers to submit informationor reports necessary to ensure compliance (section 326(d)); and (4) injunctiverelief against any prohibited act, including distribution of noncomplyingproducts (section 334).Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules concerningtesting, labeling, and standards on State laws or regulations concerningsuch matters. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are supersededby the Act. Section 327 (a) through (c). Exceptions to this general ruleinclude: (1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 3, 1987,and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remainin effect until the applicable standard begins (section 327(b)(1); (2)State procurement standards which are more stringent than the applicableFederal standard (section 327(b)(2) and (e)) and certain building coderequirements for new construction, if certain criteria are met, are exemptfrom Federal preemption (section 327(b)(3) and (f)(1) through f(4)); (3)State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters;and (4) State standards for television sets effective on or after January1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal standard forsuch product (section 327(b)(6) and 327(c)).Another exception to Federal preemption concerns standards for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers and freezers. The Act specifies that if DOE doesnot publish a final rule before January 1, 1990, relating to the revisionof Federal standards for this product category, the State of California'sDecember 14, 1984, standards (effective January 1, 1992) for these products,would become effective in California beginning January 1, 1993, and maynot be preempted by any Federal standard prescribed on or after January1, 1990. Section 325(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) and section 327(c).In addition, if DOE does not publish a final rule before January 1, 1992,relating to the revision of standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers, any State regulation which applies to such products manufacturedon or after January 1, 1995, is exempt from Federal premption until theeffective date of a Federal standard. Section 325(b)(A)(ii)(II).A State whose energy conservation standard is preempted may petition theDepartment for a rule that it not be preempted on the basis that the Stateregulation is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energyinterests. Section 327(d). However, DOE cannot issue the requested ruleif it is established that such State regulation will significantly burdenmarketing, manufacturing, distribution, sale or servicing of the coveredproducts, or is likely to result in the unavailability in the State ofany covered product with performance characteristics that are substantiallythe same as those generally available in the State at the time of DOE'sdetermination. Section 327(d)(4).The Act further provides that, except under certain energy emergency conditions,any State regulation for which exemption is granted shall apply to productsmanufactured three years after DOE publishes such a rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, or five years after publication, if DOE findsthat additional time is necessary for retooling and redesign. Section 327(d)(5).b. BackgroundNECPA required DOE to establish mandatory energy efficiency standards foreach of 13 covered products.\2\<NOTE/> These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximumimprovement in energy efficiency that was technologically feasible andeconomically justified.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The consumer products covered by NECPA included: Refrigeratorsand refrigerator-freezers; freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; waterheaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipment not including furnaces;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; humidifiersand dehumidifiers; central air conditioners; and furnaces.NECPA provided, however, that no standard for a product be establishedif there were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined byrule either that a standard would not result in significant conservationof energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economicallyjustified. In determining whether a standard was economically justified,the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of the standardexceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors discussed above.NECPA specified the priorities and procedures to be followed in adoptingefficiency standards. Nine of the 13 covered products were given priority.These nine products were: Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers; freezers;clothes dryers; water heaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipmentnot including furnaces; kitchen ranges and ovens; central air conditioners;and furnaces.The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for thenine priority products on January 2, 1979. 44 FR 20. On December 13, 1979,DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for dishwashers,television sets, clothes washers, and humidifiers and dehumidifiers. 44FR 72276. An advance notice for central air conditioners (heat pumps) waspublished on January 23, 1980. 45 FR 5602.After receiving comments on the January 2 advance notice, on June 30, 1980,DOE published its first proposed rulemaking for the nine products. 45 FR43976. (Hereafter referred to as the June 1980 proposal.) This NOPR setforth DOE's proposal concerning energy efficiency standards for the coveredproducts. It also proposed comprehensive requirements for certificationand enforcement of the standards, procedures for processing petitions byStates that sought exemption for regulations subject to the general preemptionrequirements of NECPA, and small business exemptions.On April 2, 1982, DOE issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking withrespect to the nine priority products. 47 FR 14424. (Hereafter referredto as the April 1982 proposal). With respect to eight of the products,DOE proposed to make a determination that a standard would not result insignificant conservation of energy and would not be economically justified.\3\<NOTE/> The April 1982 proposal also proposed rules governing petitionsto DOE both by States to obtain exemption from preemption of State or localenergy efficiency standards, as well as by manufacturers to obtain preemptionof State or local standards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The April 1982 proposal did not propose any rule withrespect to the product type ``home heating equipment, not including furnaces,''or with respect to that class of the product water heaters made up of heatpump water heaters, or with respect to those classes of the product centralair conditioners that are heat pumps.On Decmber 22, 1982, DOE published a final rule in which the Departmentdetermined that efficiency standards were not warranted for clothes dryersand kitchen ranges and ovens. 47 FR 57198. (Hereafter referred to as theDecember 1982 final rule.) At that time, DOE also adopted final proceduresby which States might obtain exemption for State or local efficiency standardsfrom Federal preemption, and by which manufacturers might obtain preemptionof a State or local standard not otherwise preempted.On August 30, 1983, DOE published a final rule with respect to the remainingsix covered products: Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, freezers,water heaters, furnaces, room air conditioners and central air conditioners.48 FR 39376. (Hereafter referred to as the August 1983 final rule). Foreach of the six products covered by the August 1983 final rule, exceptcentral air conditioners, DOE determined that an energy efficiency standardwould not result in significant conservation of energy and would not beeconomically justified. With respect to central air conditioners, DOE foundthat an energy efficiency standard would result in significant conservationof energy, but not be economically justified.On April 1, 1985, DOE published a proposed rule with respect to four coveredproducts: Dishwashers, television sets, clothes washers and humidifiersand dehumidifiers, 50 FR 12966. (Hereafter referred to as the April 1985proposal). For each of the four products covered by the April 1985 proposal,DOE proposed that an energy efficiency standard would not be economicallyjustified and would not result in a significant conservation of energy.During 1983, DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules were challengedin a lawsuit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) andothers against the Department. On July 16, 1985, the U.S. Court of Appealsset aside DOE's December 1982 and August 1983 final rules. <T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>Herrington</T3>, 768 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1985).Consequently, on March 5, 1986, DOE published notices in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>removing the December 1982 and August 1983 finalrules and withdrawing the April 1985 proposal. 51 FR 7549 and 51 FR 7582.The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which became law on March17, 1987, amended EPCA in part by: Redefining ``covered products'' (specifically,refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers were combined into oneproduct type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted; andpool heaters were added); establishing Federal energy conservation standardsfor 11 of the 12 covered products; and creating a schedule, according towhich each standard is to be reviewed to determine if an amended standardis required.More recently, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of1988 (Pub. L. 100-357) established Federal energy conservation standardsfor a new covered product, fluorescent lamp ballasts. These amendmentsalso created a review schedule for DOE to determine if an amended standardis required.As stated above, the Act requires DOE to publish a final rule for smallgas furnaces by January 1, 1989; for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers by July 1, 1989; and to consider establishing a standard fortelevision sets. DOE is combining these rulemaking items into one action.The purposes of this rulemaking is three-fold: (1) To review the energyconservation standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers(hereafter referred to as refrigerators) that have been established bythe Act; (2) to propose energy efficiency standards between 71 percentand 78 percent AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) \4\<NOTE/> for small gas furnaces, i.e., those having an input rateless than 45,000 Btu per hour; and (3) to consider the establishment ofan energy conservation standard for television sets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) is the ratioannual fuel output energy to annual fuel input energy, expressed as a percent.As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking,with a 60-day comment period that ended February 5, 1988, as the Departmentconsiders prescribing applicable new or amended standards for these threeproducts. 52 FR 46367, December 7, 1987. (Hereafter referred to as theadvance notice). The advance notice presented the product classes thatDOE planned to analyze, and provided a detailed discussion of the analyticalmethodology and analytical models that the Department expected to use inperforming the analysis to support this rulemaking. The Department invitedcomments and data on the accuracy and feasibility of the planned methodologyand encouraged interested persons to recommend improvements or alternativesto DOE's approach. The comments in response to the advance notice are addressedin sections II and III of this notice. In addition, on January 28, 1988,a public hearing was held on the advance notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Discussion</ITAG>As stated above, NAECA requires DOE to determine if the legislated standardsfor refrigerators should be amended, to establish a standard for smallgas furnaces, and to consider establishing a standard for television sets.The Act prohibits DOE from promulgating a standard for a product if (1)there is no test procedure for the product, (2) a standard is not technologicallyfeasible, (3) DOE determines that a standard would not be economicallyjustified, or (4) if a standard would not result in a significant conservationof energy. To measure possible energy savings and economic justification,DOE analyzed several possible standard levels for each product type (refrigeratorsand television sets) or class of product (small gas furnaces). Furthermore,the Act stipulates that any adjustment of a standard may only be towardstringent levels. With respect to each appliance, DOE analyzed variousspecific design options, including prototypes. A prototype can be eitheran individual component, e.g., high efficiency compressor, or a completeassembly with the design option installed, e.g., a condensing furnace.While a prototype design may be technologically feasible as an individualcomponent or as part of a bread-board \5\<NOTE/> assembly, it does not necessarily follow that techniqueshave been developed for mass production of the prototype design.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A bread-board unit is an experimental arrangement of thedesign made to test its feasibility.a. Test ProceduresFor each product discussed in today's proposed rulemaking there is an applicableDOE test procedure to evaluate its energy efficiency. These test proceduresalso cover the various classes of products identified in today's notice.However, DOE has issued four test procedure waivers for refrigerator-freezers,all concerning variable defrost controls.\6\<NOTE/> The engineering analysis for refrigerator-freezers for today'sproposal is based upon the test procedures included in DOE's Decision andOrders concerning variable defrost controls. Research in support of thedevelopment of test procedures for refrigerator-freezers equipped withvariable defrost controls has been completed. DOE issued a proposed ruleconcerning variable defrost controls on September 26, 1988. (53 FR 37416).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ RF-001 Whirlpool Corp., 50 FR 34186, August 23, 1985;RF-002 White Consolidated Inc., 51 FR 15679, April 25, 1986; RF-003 andRF-004 Whirlpool Corp., 51 FR 36591, October 14, 1986.b. TechnologicalFeasibility<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>For those products and classes of products discussed in today's notice,DOE believes that the efficiency levels analyzed, while not necessarilyin production, are technologically possible. The technological feasibilityof the design options is addressed in the product specific discussion.DOE's criteria for evaluating design options for technological feasibilityare that the design options are already in use by the respective industryor that research has progressed to the likely development of a prototype.Several comments addressed the subject of technological feasibility. TheCalifornia Energy Commission (CEC) recommended that DOE put no limits ondesign options for technological feasibility, that DOE include prototypes,foreign market designs and designs with long paybacks. (CEC, No. 35, at4.) \7\<NOTE/> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) identifiedthe need for DOE to establish maximum technologically feasible levels separatelyfrom any economic inputs. (AHAM, No. 22, at 4.) The Natural Resources DefenseCouncil (NRDC) recommended that DOE increase standard levels to the maximumtechnologically feasible designs, such as evacuated panel insulation forrefrigerators. (NRDC, No. 19, at 9.)  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Comments on the advance notice have been assigned docketnumbers and have been numbered consecutively. Statements that were presentedat the January 28, 1988, public hearing are identified as Testimony.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels  </ITAG>The Act requires that in considering any new or amended standards, theDepartment must consider those that ``shall be designed to achieve themaximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determinesis technologically feasible and economically justified.'' (Section 325(l)(2)(A).)Accordingly, for each class of product under consideration in this rulemaking,a maximum technologically feasible design option was identified. This isthe most efficient model of a class for which at least a prototype exists.A complete discussion of each maximum technologically feasible level anddesign options included in each is found in the Engineering Analysis. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Chapter 3, specifically sections3.2.3 through 3.2.5, 3.3, and 3.4.1 through 3.4.3. These are presentedin Table 2-1, below.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,xs50  </C><T4>Table</T4> 2-1._<T4>Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels  </T4><H1>Products and product classes  </H1><H1>Unit energy consumption  </H1>  Refrigerators and Refrigerator-Freezers:  <ITAG tagnum="3">Manual Defrost (16.8 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>380 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Partial Automatic Defrost (18.1 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>435 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic Defrost Top Mount (20.8 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>515 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic Defrost Side-by-Side (24.1 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>599 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic Defrost Side-by-Side with Through-the-Door Service Features(31.9 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>776 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic Defrost Top Mount with Through-the-Door Service Features(20.8 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>525 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic Defrost Bottom Mount (20.4 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>535 kWh/yr.  </D>Freezers:  <ITAG tagnum="3">Chest, Manual Defrost (22.5 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>315 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Upright, Manual Defrost (26.1 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>343 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Upright, Automatic Defrost (29.9 cu. ft.)  </ITAG><D>505 kWh/yr.  </D>Small Gas Furnaces:  <ITAG tagnum="3">Non-Weatherized (Indoor)  </ITAG><D>\1\ 97% AFUE.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Weatherized (Outdoor)  </ITAG><D>\1\ 97% AFUE.  </D>Television Sets:  <ITAG tagnum="3">Monochrome (13andmin16;andmin16;)  </ITAG><D>46 kWh/yr.  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Color (19andmin16;andmin16;-20andmin16;andmin16;)  </ITAG><D>171 kWh/yr.  </D><F>\1\ 78 percent AFUE is the maximum standard level that is allowed bythe Act for small gas furnaces.  </F></ITAG>  The Department believes that these are the maximum technologically feasibleenergy conservation levels from an engineering standpoint; some or allof these levels will be evaluated in accordance with the economic justificationfactors specified in the Act to determine if the levels are economicallyjustified. Specifically excluded from further analysis are the maximumtechnologically feasible levels for small gas furnaces, since these levelsare beyond the range in which the Department must establish standards. The New York State Energy Office (NYSEO) called for DOE to explain whyit does not adopt any design option that conserves more energy than themaximum technologically feasible design. The NYSEO also stated that forthose design options selected, DOE must ensure that development and commercialavailability correspond to the dates standards become effective. (NYSEO,No. 32, at 4-6). Admiral Home Appliances (Admiral) stated that ``innovationcannot be legislated,'' therefore, maximum technologically feasible designoptions are those that are fully developed and commercially available today.Admiral also stressed NAECA's requirement that DOE delete design optionsthat would lessen utility to the consumer and affect performance, life,and reliability of the covered appliance. (Admiral, No. 31, at 3).  DOE proposes that the maximum technologically feasible level is one thatcan be carried out by the addition of design options, both commerciallyfeasible and prototypes, to the baseline units without affecting the product'sutility. DOE believes that there are no products available with the sameutility and capacity that are more efficient than the maximum technologicallevel. DOE believes that design options, including prototypes and foreigndesigns, must be capable of implementation by the effective date of a standard. Each maximum technologically feasible level was evaluated to determineif it would be commercially viable, that is, economically justified, atthe time of the effective date of the standard. Design options that haveunacceptable impacts on consumers or manufacturers or result in the changingof the utility of the product were rejected.  DOE provided lists of design options for engineering analysis in the advancenotice. DOE received a number of comments on these design options, whichresulted in more detailed design options for DOE review. DOE has consideredthese suggestions and has addressed them in the product specific discussionsin this notice.  The analysis process is described fully in the Technical Support Document.Computer models and manufacturers' data were used to predict improvementsin product efficiencies and the costs associated with these improvements. The Engineering Analysis addresses two statutory requirements. The firstrequirement is the Department's evaluation of the maximum improvementsin energy efficiency that are technologically feasible. The second requirementrelates to the lessening of utility to the consumer of any of the coveredproducts due to the imposition of standards. The Engineering Analysis alsoprovides information on efficiencies and manufacturing costs to other sectionsof the overall analysis. The product specific sections of this notice includethe method of analysis for each of the products.  c. Energy Savings  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Determination of Savings  </ITAG>The Department forecast energy consumption through the use of the LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model (LBL-REM). The LBL-REM forecastsenergy consumption over the period of analysis for candidate standardsand the base case.\8\<NOTE/> The Department quantified the energy savings that would beattributable to a standard as the difference in energy consumption betweenthe standards case and the base case.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For refrigerators the base case represents the NAECA 1990standards; for small gas furnaces and television sets, the base case representsno-standards.  The LBL-REM, which is an improvement of the Oak Ridge National LaboratoryResidential Energy End Use Model (ORNL Model) that was used by DOE in previousstandards rulemakings is fully explained in the Technical Support Document.Appendix B to that document addresses the LBL-REM in detail. The LBL-REMcontains algorithms to project average efficiencies, usage behavior, andmarket shares for each product. The model's assumptions and methods aredescribed in the Technical Support Document. The market share algorithmused for the refrigerator analysis is the same as the one used in previousanalyses. Since such products have no significant competition from technologiesthat use fuels other than electricity, the principal market share decisionsare: purchase this product or not; and select among the available classes.The fraction of potential purchasers who actually purchase the productis determined each year by applying market share elasticities to the percentchange in equipment price, operating expense (which includes changes inelectricity price and in unit energy consumption), and income. The marketshare elasticities are constant over the projection period. The marketshare obtained by each class in any future year is assumed to be a constantfraction of total refrigerator sales. (<T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table B.3). For refrigerators,the market shares range from a low of 0.7 percent for a top-mount refrgerator-freezerwith through-the-door ice, to a high of 72.9 percent for a top-mount refrigerator-freezerwithout through-the-door ice service. If this assumption were changed,the results of the LBL-REM would be affected, e.g., for refrigerators,if the market share of less expensive and less energy consumptive productswere to increase, the energy savings would be increased and the net presentvalue would also likely be increased. If this scenario were to occur, consumerswould sacrifice utility by purchasing refrigerators with fewer amenities.DOE requests comments on this issue. On the other hand, a new market share algorithm for small gas furnaceshad to be developed, since such products had not previously been analyzedseparately. Market shares for small gas furnaces are determined using modificationsto the algorithms developed for all heating and cooling end uses. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document section 4.2.3. Elasticities forheating equipment in new mobile homes, new large multifamily housing (fiveor more units), and all types of existing housing are calculated usingmethods and models developed by Lin, Hirst, and Cohn, <T3>Fuel Choices in the Household sector,</T3> Oak Ridge, TN: Oak RidgeNational Laboratory, ORNL/CON-3, 1976. Those authors reported a cross-sectionalanalysis of residential fuel choices (equipment ownership market shares)for five major end uses, including space heating, air conditioning, waterheating, food freezing, and cooking, using 1970 data from states.For new single-family and new small (two to four units) multifamily housing,effective market share elasticities are derived from an econometric modeloriginally developed by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), <T3>Household Appliance Choice</T3>: <T3>Revision of REEPS Behavioral Models</T3>, Palo Alto, CA: Electric PowerResearch Institute, EPRT EA-3409, Research Project 1918-1, 1984, and modifiedat Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL).The model was established from a national data base disaggregated to thehousehold level, using exogenous variables of equipment prices, operatingexpenses (which are proportional to fuel prices), household income, andother variables. The most significant difference between the EPRI modeland the LBL model is the LBL model's characterization of a household discountrate for the choice of heating and cooling equipment as varying with maximumwinter heat load and a measure of the oppressiveness of summer climate.Essentially, the data strongly support the hypothesis that households thatare likely to use a particular piece of equipment frequently (because ofa cold winter climate or a hot, humid summer climate) are likely to paygreater attention to future operating expenses. Such households are estimatedas having lower discount rates, i.e., accepting longer payback periodsfor additional equipment expenses for heating or cooling appliances thanthose living in relatively mild conditions. Conversely, those householdsin milder climates give relatively greater weight to equipment price thanto operating expense. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Appendix B. section B.5.The LBL-REM is used to project residential energy use over the relevanttime periods for: (1) Television sets with and without standards; (2) smallfurnaces at 71, 74, and 78 percent AFUE; and (3) refrigerators at differentstandard levels, including the NAECA-imposed 1990 standards, and severalcandidate amendment levels. By comparing the energy consumption projectionat alternative standard levels or no standard (for television sets), atstandards of 71 percent and 78 percent AFUE (for small furnaces), and atalternative standard levels or NAECA 1990 standards (for refrigerators),the Department estimated the amount of energy projected to be saved duringthe period 1992-2015.\9\<NOTE/> The energy saved is expressed in Quads, i.e., quadrillionBtu. With respect to electricity, the savings are quads of source or primaryenergy, which is the energy necessary to generate and transmit electricity.The Act defines ``energy use'' as the quantity of energy directly consumedby a consumer product at point of use. This is generally called ``site''energy, as opposed to ``source'' energy. There are great differences betweenthese types of energy. In 1986, the amount of electrical energy consumedat the site was less than one-third of the amount of source energy thatwas required to generate and transmit the site electrical energy.\10\<NOTE/> Therefore, it is important to identify whether the electricityinvolved is site or source energy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ LBL-REM was programmed to analyze a single standard levelor alternative levels, over the entire period. That is, the fact that astandard might be revised during subsequent rulemakings was not consideredby the model. The Department believes that it is not possible to predictwhat result such reviews may have, and therefore it would be speculativeto model any particular result. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking,each standard level that was analyzed was projected to have been in placefrom the time of implementation to the year 2015.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Energy Information Administration, <T3>Electric Power Annual 1986</T3>, Tables 7 and 41, DOE/EIA-0348(86),1987.The LBL-REM projections are dependent on many assumptions. Among the mostimportant are responsiveness of household appliance purchases to changesin energy prices and consumer income, future energy prices, future levelsof housing construction, and options that exist for improving the energyefficiency of appliances. As is the case with any complicated computermodel simulation, the validity of the outputs is critically dependent onthe inputs.Several of the assumptions that were described in the advance notice werequestioned in comments on the advance notice. These included the following:<T3>Rebound Effect.</T3> NYSEO critiqued the existence of a``rebound effect''with more efficient refrigerators or television sets (NYSEO, No. 32, at14-15). The Department believes that households respond to changes in operatingexpenses in three different ways. In the short run, they change the waythey operate existing equipment, e.g., lower winter thermostat setting.In the long run, they also change equipment by switching from one fuelto another, and by improving the efficiency of their equipment, e.g., purchasinga more efficient water heater, or both. Thus, the elasticity of demandcan be thought of as being separated into three elements_a usage elasticity,a technical efficiency elasticity, and an equipment/fuel choice (marketshare) elasticity. Household changes in equipment use in response to changesin fuel price and household income determine the usage elasticities. Theseelasticities are based on engineering possibilities and judgment in theoriginal formulation of the ORNL model.\11\<NOTE/> <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Appendix B. DOE requests commentson the methodology and elasticities used and the appropriate values forthe various elasticities, including usage elasticity (rebound effect).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Eric Hirst and Janet Carney 1978 ``The Oak Ridge Engineering-EconomicModel of Residential Energy Use,'' Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL/CON-24.In the analysis, the Department assumed that a more efficient refrigeratoror television set would not be used more intensively because it is moreenergy efficient. Therefore, in estimating energy savings from differentstandard levels for refrigerators and television sets, the Department didnot use a rebound effect. The Department does not have any data that consumerswill use refrigerators and television sets any differently with changesin either energy prices or efficiency. However, the Department did includea ``rebound effect'' of 30 percent for small gas furnaces. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, sections B.1 and B.6. The Departmentrequests comments on the ``rebound effect'' for each product subject totoday's proposal and for all space heating and cooling products, includingthe furnace categories not covered by this notice.<T3>Discount Rate.</T3> NRDC and the CEC contended that the Department'suse of five, seven and 10 percent discount rates was artificially highand would result in many capital-intensive candidate standard levels beingexcluded from consideration (NRDC, No. 19, at 21; and CEC, No. 35, at 7).Since a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today, that futuredollar must be discounted to determine its value today. If the discountrate chosen is too high, the present value of future dollars will be understated.Thus, higher discount rates tend to preclude more capital-intensive candidatestandard levels. Nevertheless, the Department does not believe that theseven percent rate that was used in the analysis is artificially high.From the business perspective, a reasonable discount rate would be onethat represented the private opportunity cost of capital used to meet anyappliance conservation standard. A gauge of the private opportunity costof capital is the most profitable alternative use of that capital. Onemeasure of that cost could be the prime rate, that is, the interest ratethat is offered by lending institutions to their most credit-worthy customers.In early October 1988, the prime rate was 10.0 percent. If such a businesssecured a loan at one of those rates of interest, and repaid it in the1990-1995 time period, the real rate of interest would be 5.0 percent.This results because the expected annual rate of price increases in thattime period is approximately five percent. Most businesses, however, arenot eligible for loans at the prime rate of interest, so the estimatedreal rate of interest for these firms would probably be somewhat higher.Similarly, from the consumer perspective, one approach to selecting anappropriate discount rate is to look at the interest payable on a consumerloan and depreciate that interest by the inflation rate. If a consumersecures a loan at 12 percent interest, and repays it in the 1990-1995 timeperiod, the real rate of interest will be seven percent. Thus, DOE believesthat from both the business and consumer perspectives, a seven percentdiscount rate is reasonable.On the other hand, it may not be reasonable to require consumers to makean investment where there are inherent risks. For example, if consumersperceive a risk because of the uncertainty of energy prices and reliabilityand longevity of the equipment, they would require a greater return ontheir investment, i.e., a higher discount rate. It has been argued thatthe discount rate should be as high as 15 percent. Dubin and McFadden,``An Econometric Analysis of Residential Electric Appliance Holdings andConsumption,'' <T3>Econometrica</T3>, March 1984, pp. 345-361. DOE requests comments onthe approach taken to select an appropriate discount rate, alternativeapproaches, and the consumer and business risks to be considered.Several of the inputs, e.g., energy and equipment prices, were tested insensitivity analyses to determine the effects of varying certain assumptionson the results of the analysis. By such sensitivity analyses, it is possibleto determine those inputs where changes, including possible errors, aremeaningful to the model's output, and those inputs for which changes arenot meaningful. <T3>See</T3> the Technical Support Document, sections 4.3 and 5.4.The savings attributable to the different standard levels are identifiedfor each product in section III of this notice.<T3>Modeling</T3>. Several comments offered suggestions on the LBL-REMmodeling efforts. NYSEO and CEC critiqued the use of old data in LBL-REMin developing the baseline units for analysis. They contended that useof such old data could underestimate the impact that increased efficiencystandards could have on saving energy. (NYSEO, No. 32, at 12; and, CEC,No. 35, at 3).While some old data was used for the analysis of refrigerators, small gasfurnaces, and television sets, these data points were merely the pointof departure of the analysis. All of the data bases were updated to reflectcurrent levels of efficiency in the marketplace, and, in the case of refrigerators,the baseline units were those with levels of efficiency that will be inthe marketplace after the NAECA-imposed standards are in effect, i.e.,after January 1, 1990. These data were then used to calculate annual energyconsumption for the LBL-REM and life-cycle cost (LCC) analyses, based onthe DOE test procedures. For example, in the LCC analysis, DOE used thetest procedure annual average hours of use to calculate the annual costof operation. This calculation does not account for variability in consumerusage patterns, nor does it reflect any changes in typical consumer usagebehavior since the test procedures were developed. While the use of out-of-dateusage values may affect the results of the LBL-REM and LCC analysis, DOEis not certain to what extent the results would be affected since, forexample, the energy savings and net present value calculation of the LBL-REMwould use the dated usage values in both the base case and standards case.Several comments expressed confusion as to the difference between ``baselineunit'' and ``base case.'' In the engineering analysis, the baseline unitfor each product class under consideration is identified. These are unitsthat are representative of units that are expected to be offered for salein the beginning year of the analysis.\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The baseline units for small gas furnaces and televisionsets are those with estimated average shipment-weighted energy factors(SWEF's) in 1987, while the baseline refrigerator units are ones with anestimated average SWEF in 1990.Baseline refers only to the engineering analysis and is the first pointidentified in each cost-efficiency curve. It is the product to which designoptions are added to create more efficient units. On the other hand ``basecase'' refers to the economic analysis forecast without standards for smallgas furnaces and television sets, and for refrigerators, only those standardsmandated by the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">2.</ITAG><T3> Significance of Savings</T3>Under section 325(1)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department is prohibited fromadopting a standard for a product if that standard would not result in``significant'' energy savings. While the term ``significant'' has neverbeen defined precisely in the Act, the Department believes that a standardlevel option need not meet a threshold level of energy savings to be considereda ``significant'' saver of energy. The U.S. Court of Appeals, <T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>Herrington, supra, </T3> concluded that Congressional intent in usingthe word ``significant'' was to mean ``non-trivial.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 30. Thus, DOE believes that each candidate standard consideredresults in significant energy savings. Two comments discussed the issue of significant energy savings. NRDC Notedthat the use of engineering estimates to screen those design options thatyield measurable energy savings is desirable and encouraged the Departmentnot to establish (as it had in the past) a threshold of significance forenergy savings. The Department has not established a significance thresholdfor energy savings. In addition, AHAM contended that, with regard to revisionof refrigerator standards, if DOE found that incremental savings by the1990 standards are ``minor,'' the Department can ``legally conclude thatno revision is justified.'' (AHAM, No. 22, p. 7). DOE proposes that eachcandidate refrigerator standard saves a significant amount of energy. d. Rebuttable Presumption NAECA established new criteria for determining whether a standard levelis economically justified. Section 325(1)(2)(B)(iii) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer ofpurchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard levelwill be less than three times the value of the energy savings during thefirst year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard,as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttablepresumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determinationby the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken intoconsideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard iseconomically justified.</ITAG>DOE believes that this provision means that if the added price of an appliance,caused by a conservation standard, would repay itself to the consumer invalue of energy savings in less than three years, then it can be presumedthat such standard is economically justified.\1\\3\<NOTE/> This presumption of economic justification can be rebuttedby the seven factors of economic justification. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ For this calculation, the Department calculated cost-of-operationbased on the DOE test procedures. Therefore, the consumer is assumed tobe ``average'' consumer as defined by the DOE test procedures. Consumersthat use the products less than the test procedure assumes will experiencea longer payback while those that use more than the test procedure assumeswill have a shorter payback. e. Economic Justification As noted earlier, section 325(1)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, provides seven factorsto be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is economicallyjustified. <ITAG tagnum="81">1.</ITAG><T3> Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers</T3>The engineering analysis identified improvements in efficiency along withthe associated costs to manufacturers for each class of product. For eachdesign option, these costs constitute the increased per unit cost to manufacturersto achieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler,and retailer markups will result in a consumer purchase price higher thanthe manufacturer cost. To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, and to determinethe effects of standards on different-sized firms, the Department useda computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the three industriesunder consideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ManufacturerImpact Model (LBL-MIM), is fully explained in the Technical Support Document.The LBL-MIM was formerly named the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory TypicalYear Model (LBL-TYM), which is the name that appeared in DOE's advancenotice of this proposed rulemaking. LBL-MIM provides a broader array ofoutputs than the specified in the advance notice. The outputs are shipments,price, revenue, net income, and return on equity (ROE). An ``Output Table''lists values for these in the base case and in each of the standards casesunder consideration. It also gives a range for each of these estimates.A ``Sensitivity Chart'' shows how ROE would be effected by a change inany one of the model's nine control variables. For consumers, a measure of economic impact is the life-cycle cost of aproduct, because it accounts for the increased first price, any increasedmaintenance expenses, and the reduced fuel expenses resulting from theproduct's greater efficiency. Under section 325 of the Act, life-cyclecost analysis is a separate factor to be considered in determining economicjustification <ITAG tagnum="81">2.</ITAG><T3> Life-Cycle Costs</T3>One measure of the effect of proposed standards on consumers is the changein life-cycle costs resulting from standards. This is quantified by thedifference in life-cycle cost (LCC) between the base and standards casefor the appliance classes analyzed. The LCC is the sum of the purchaseprice and the operating expense, including maintenance expenditures, discountedover the lifetime of the appliance. The LCC is calculated at the estimated average efficiency for each classin the year standards are imposed using consumer discount rates of five,seven, and 10 percent. The purchase price is based on the factory costsin the Engineering Analysis, and includes a factory markup plus a distributorand retailer markup. As noted in the advance notice, energy price forecastsare inputs that are taken from the 1986 <T3>Annual Energy Outlook</T3> of the Energy Information Administration.Appliance usage forecasts are taken from the results of the LBL-REM. TheDepartment seeks comments on the input to the LCC analysis including thediscount rate and energy price forecasts. The differences in life-cycle costs between the base case and various levelsof standards for refrigerators and small gas furnaces are presented inTables 6.1 through 6.3 of the Technical Support Document. These LCC's arecalculated at a seven percent discount rate; a higher rate, e.g. 10 percent,gives a smaller difference, while a lower rate, e.g. five percent, producesa greater difference. As discussed above, it has been argued that discountrates as high as 15 percent should be used. The Department did not use15 percent in the LCC analysis; however, as can be seen in the variousLCC curves, the use of a higher discount rate would result in a flattercurve with the minimum life-cycle cost dropping, i.e., approaching thebaseline unit. If a higher discount rate were used, e.g., 15 percent, andenergy prices were lower than average, the minimum life-cycle cost pointcould be less efficient than the baseline unit. When the LCC numbers are plotted graphically (on the Y axis) against unitenergy consumption (on the X axis), the data generally produce a curvethat is concave from above in shape. This means that at first the LCC curvewill decline as efficiency improvements are made, will reach a minimum(which may or may not be discrete), and then rise. All this indicates isthat the first efficiency improvements will produce energy savings, thevalue of which will more than pay for the design change. As efficiencyimprovements are made, it becomes increasingly costly to save more energy,and, eventually, the value of the energy savings will not cover the expendituresfor the design improvements. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, section 3.5.The minimum of the LCC curve was of particular interest in the analysis.The minimum of the curve represents that level of efficiency improvementsthat maximizes the difference between the value of energy saved and theadditional consumer expenditures for the relevant efficiency improvements.Therefore, design options that corresponded to the minimum point were ofspecial consideration in establishing standard levels. Efficiency levelsexceeding the LCC minima were generally rejected as standards as not beingeconomically justified. At efficiency levels beyond the LCC minima, theincremental first cost of the product exceeds the value of the energy savingssuch that the average consumer does not realize a benefit from the investment.  The Department conducted a net present value (NPV) analysis to assess thedifferential economic impacts on consumers that would occur from the adoptionof standards (for small gas furnaces and television sets) and amended standards(for refrigerators) compared to a base case with no-standards (for gasfurnaces and television sets) and NAECA 1990 standards (for refrigerators).<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Chapter 5. The LBL-REM calculatesthe total expenditure for each product (discounted total value of energyconsumption from 1992 through the last year of use for those products purchasedthrough the year 2015, plus the total discounted expenses for equipmentpurchased from 1992 through 2015) with and without standards (for televisionsand small furnaces), and with more stringent standards and with NAECA 1990standards (for refrigerators). The NPV analysis is similar to the LCC analysis,in that the greatest NPV should occur at the standard level that correspondsto the LCC minimum for the product.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The NPV for each product at the different standard levelsis identified in section III of this notice. The NPV calculation, likethe LCC analysis, is based on national average efficiency and usage values.This analysis does not take into account variations in energy prices andlocal usage rates. If for any product the covariances are zero, the resultsof the analysis will not be affected. If, however, the covariances arenot zero, the results of the analysis will be affected. DOE does not havethe data to determine if or to what extent the NPV calculation is affectedby using average usage rates and energy prices. DOE requests comments onthis issue.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The net present value (NPV) of a standard, per appliance,is calculated for all affected appliances that are purchased in the projectionperiod, while the life-cycle cost (LCC) is calculated only for the lifetimeof an appliance that is purchased in the first year of the relevant standard.Therefore, NPV and LCC estimates, per appliance, may not correlate exactly.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Energy Savings   </ITAG>While the significant conservation of energy is a separate statutory requirementfor imposing an energy conservation standard, the Act requires DOE, indetermining the economic justification of a standard to consider the totalprojected savings that are expected to result directly from new or revisedstandards. DOE used the LBL-REM results, discussed earlier, in its considerationof total projected savings. The savings for the three products are providedin section III of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products   </ITAG>This factor cannot be quantified. In establishing classes of products anddesign options, the Department tried to eliminate any degradation of utilityor performance in the three products under consideration in this rulemaking.That is, to the extent that comments or DOE's own research indicated thata product included a utility or performance-related feature that affectedenergy efficiency, a separate class with a different efficiency standardwas created for that product. In this way the Department attempted to minimizethe impact of this factor as a result of the standards that were analyzed.However, other factors, in conjunction with standards, could affect theutility or performance of products subject to standards. For example, theEPA limitations on CFC production could cause refrigerator manufacturersto adopt alternatives to the regulated CFC's which would affect the refrigerator'sutility or performance. In this way, DOE is not able to assure that utilityand performance could not be affected by standards.   Also, as discussed in section III of this notice, DOE was not able to establishseparate classes for television features that provided a utility and whichaffected energy efficiency. DOE requests comments on the impacts that bothlegislated and revised standards could have on product utility and performance.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Impact of Lessening of Competition   </ITAG>It is important to note that this factor has two parts; on the one hand,it assumes that there could be some lessening of competition as a resultof standards; and, on the other hand, it directs the Attorney General togauge the impact of that effect, should it occur.   In order to assist the Attorney General in making such a determination,the Department studied the affected appliance industries to determine theirexisting concentrations, levels of competitiveness, and financial performances.This information will be sent to the Attorney General. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Chapter 7.   To afford the Attorney General the information that he may need to carryout his responsibility, we have forwarded copies of this notice and theTechnical Support Document for his review.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Need of the Nation to Conserve Energy   </ITAG>One measure of the need of the Nation to conserve energy is the country'sreliance on energy in the form of oil, especially imported oil. This wasdocumented last year in a DOE report (<T3>Energy Security: A Report to The President of The United States, </T3>Washington,DC.: U.S. Department of Energy, March 1987.) In that report, U.S. energysecurity was essentially considered to be a function of free oil markets.The three products being considered here (namely, refrigerators, smallgas furnaces, and television sets) are all fueled by energy forms otherthan oil, specifically electricity for refrigerators and television sets,and natural gas for the small furnaces. While some oil is used to generatethe electricity on which refrigerators and television sets operate, thatis a very small part of our national energy picture. Specifically, only5.5 percent of net electricity was generated by petroleum in 1986. Therefore,conservation of energy by these products will have little bearing on ournational energy security.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Other Factors   </ITAG>This provision allows the Secretary of Energy, in determining whether astandard is economically justified, to consider any other factors thathe deems to be relevant. The only such factor that has been identifiedis the EPA regulation to restrict the production of certain chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Product-Specific Discussion</ITAG>a.

Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>During the comment period on the advance notice, the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) published a proposed rulemaking on December 14, 1987, concerningCFC production restrictions. 52 FR 47486. Recent findings regarding depletionof the earth's ozone layer have pointed to certain CFC's as the probablecause of that depletion. As part of an international agreement to haltthat deterioration, the EPA proposed production restrictions on the mostharmful of those CFC's. These rules were finalized on August 12, 1988.53 FR 30566. Persons commenting on the advance notice with regard to refrigeratorsvoiced concern about EPA's proceeding, since many of the design optionsthat were under consideration by DOE involved CFC's. The following is asummary of comments concerning refrigerators.The manufacturers and the trade association expressed concern for the ozonelayer and recommended that DOE policy set the reduction of CFC's as a priorityover energy conservation; to do otherwise would create potential conflictbetween two government agency rulemakings. (White Consolidated Inc. (WCI),No. 17, at 2; Whirlpool, No. 10, at 1; Admiral, No. 31, at 2; and AHAM,No. 22, at 16). Each recommended that DOE reject all design options thatwould require increased use of CFC's. (Whirlpool, No. 10, at 7; WCI, No.17, at 1; Admiral, No. 31, at 2; and AHAM, No. 22, at 18). Whirlpool statedfurther that substitutes for CFC 11 and 12 would not be available for approximatelyfive to seven years. (Whirlpool, No. 10, at 2.)NRDC stated that DOE should establish more stringent standards in an effortto replace CFC technology with new forms of technology such as vacuum panelinsulation or improved refrigeration cycles and that this would reduceindustry need for CFC 11 or 12. (NRDC, No. 19, at 9.) The Solar EnergyAssociation of Oregon (SEAO) supported this opinion. (SEAO, No. 30, at1.) NRDC believes that DOE has the authority under section 325(b) of theAct to respond to industry demands for leadtime by establishing a two-tierlevel or extension to provide maximum technologically feasible standards.(NRDC, No. 19, at 12.)NAECA established the review cycles to provide industry with sufficienttime to respond to regulated standard levels set by DOE. Intermediate standardlevels could require manufacturers to retool more than once in a five-yearperiod. Therefore, the Department does not consider the imposition of intermediatestandard levels between reviews to be practicable.The EPA testified that, if promulgated, its proposed rule would not eliminateCFC 11 or 12 from production, but would impose reductions in CFC productionover 11 years (EPA, Testimony). EPA stated that its proposed rule wouldallow for market-based CFC distribution and use, providing for a flexibleregulation suitable to the needs of business and consumers. (EPA, Testimony).SEAO recommended that DOE analyze and follow one of two courses of actionconcerning CFC issues. First, DOE could follow EPA's proposed rule andapply limited availability to the cost analysis. Alternatively, DOE couldanticipate the further or more rapid reduction of CFC's production dueto developments in research on the ozone layer. (SEAO, No. 30, at 2.)In commenting on the advance notice, E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company(DuPont) described its work on alternatives to CFC 11 and CFC 12. Whilethe company has some promising alternatives, it does not expect to havethem available in commercial quantities until late 1992, at the earliest;and, even then, the alternatives (HFC-134, HCFC-123 and HCFC-141b) willbe less energy efficient as well as much more expensive. (DuPont, No. 48,at 1-2.)At the public hearing on the advance notice, the NRDC urged that the Departmentnot establish standards that would require use of more of the harmful CFC's,and also advocated that such CFC's be banned. (NRDC, Testimony.)In mid-March 1988, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)announced the results of a 19-year international study that concluded thatthe depletion of the earth's ozone layer was more extensive than had previouslybeen indicated. Specifically, the study found that stratospheric ozonehas decreased by as much as three percent over densely populated areasof North America and Europe since 1969, as well as wintertime drops ofmore than six percent in Alaska and the Scandinavian countries, and thatthis ozone depletion had been caused by certain CFC and other chemicals.In late March 1988, DuPont urged a total phaseout of the destructive CFCand indicated its intent to cease production of those CFC's at some unspecifieddate. In announcing the decision, the company cited the significant ozonedepletion that was documented in the NASA report.In September 1988, EPA reported that nothing short of a halt in the useof CFC's can save the stratospheric ozone layer from further dangerousdepletion. EPA projects a more extensive and faster-moving threat thanpreviously realized. DOE's analysis does not consider the possibility thatCFC's could be banned altogether. Furthermore, the possibility of a banin CFC use is an example of the reason why DOE needs to exercise care inprescribing standards. For example, DOE is prohibited by NAECA from reducingthe stringency of standards.Because of limitations imposed on CFC's, whether by reduction in productionlevels or by production bans, refrigerator manufacturers may be requiredto utilize alternatives to the restricted CFC's to achieve energy efficiencyrequirements. DOE cannot be certain, however, that the new product wouldhave the same utility or performance or be able to achieve the same levelof energy efficiency. If standards are set at a level that, as a resultof these or other factors, cannot be attained, the standards could havean adverse effect on manufacturers and consumers, since DOE is prohibitedby NAECA from reducing the stringency of standards.The Department believes that under present EPA regulations, there willbe substitutes for CFC-11 and CFC-12, but with a cost and energy efficiencypenalty. In addition, questions exist regarding the ability of appliancemanufacturers to accommodate new refrigerants in their production processes.For example, if the new refrigerants are not as energy efficient as theCFC's being replaced, it would mean that more of them would be needed toachieve the same level of savings; and, this could result in a need toalter the refrigerator design in order to accommodate the substitute materials.Under these circumstances, any change in the need for CFC's could resultin altering the expected results of the analysis by, for example, adverselyaffecting the estimates of manufacturing costs, consumer prices, and soon.The Department is examining all design options, including those using CFC's.CFC's, while being reduced in quantity, are not banned from production.Supplementary information provided through DOE research shows that theresidential refrigerator industry consumption of CFC-11 and CFC-12 currentlyrepresents approximately two percent of all consumption of the regulatedCFC's.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ ``The Use of Chlorofluorocarbons in Refrigeration, Insulationand Mobile Air Conditioning in the United States,'' Terry G. Statt, DOE,paper prepared for EPA Conference on Substitutes and Alternatives to CFC'sand Halons, Washington, DC, January 13-15, 1988.The engineering baseline unit for refrigerators was identified in the advancenotice as the same unit used in the April 1982 proposal. The CEC and AHAMexpressed concern that the data were too old for current use and that DOEshould use a representative model. (CEC, No. 35, at 3; and AHAM, No. 22,at 27.)DOE agrees, and has used as the baseline for each class, a refrigeratorwith a SWEF near that which is expected to prevail after the 1990 NAECAstandards are in effect.AHAM stated that data provided to LBL on 1987 refrigerator models had nosingle set of design options used by manufacturers to accomplish energygoals, making it difficult to identify a baseline unit. (AHAM, No. 22,at 27.) Furthermore, AHAM suggested removing from consideration, in thisrulemaking, those design options that would be used to accomplish the 1990standards. (AHAM, No. 22, at 28.) The Department did not include such designoptions in this analysis.NRDC submitted data on the LaBrecque Cycle, as a possible means to shiftfrom CFC-12 to CFC-22. (NRDC, No. 19, at 19.) While DOE agrees that thistechnology is a theoretical possibility, the Department has no knowledgeof any prototype or laboratory assembly that demonstrates its potential.Furthermore, DOE does not have data to conclude that this technology couldbe adopted as a prototype by the time of the amended standard's 1993 effectivedate. Therefore, DOE did not include this technology in the engineeringanalysis.NYSEO recommended that DOE investigate different configurations, changesin unit dimensions, number and location of doors, rotary compressors aswell as conducting research into Japanese methods of refrigerator manufacturing.(NYSEO, No. 32, at 7.) DOE believes that the number and location of doorsand dimensions of a refrigerator may have utility implications to the consumer,but it is uncertain whether there is any impact on energy efficiency. Manyrefrigerators are used as replacements and must therefore fit into thespace used by previous models, which can make dimensions very restrictive.The concept of using rotary compressors as one of the design options isa good one. However, DOE believes that considering design options by compressorefficiencies, e.g., 5.0 or 5.3 energy efficiency ratio, rather than bydesign e.g., rotary compressor, allows manufacturers to select the appropriatecompressor design.The CEC was concerned that some design options will be incorporated toreach the 1990 standard levels, and should not be used again to evaluate1993 levels. Also, the CEC requested that DOE identify the method of combiningdesign options. (CEC, No. 35, at 6.)The Department combined design options by beginning with those designsthat were most cost-effective for consumers, and then adding progressivelyless cost-effective ones.DOE has determined that certain design options will be part of the 1990standard level design, and are in some current models, therefore, theyare being treated as part of the base case for 1990. These options are:Foam insulation substitution in freezer section doors; and antisweat heaterswitch.One design option, evacuated insulation panels, was mentioned throughoutthe comments as an energy saver that could also eliminate the need forCFC-11 in refrigerators. NRDC commented that evacuated panels have beenresearched in many forms, all showing high potential for saving energy.(NRDC, No. 19, at 17). AHAM provided information from its investigationof Japanese use of evacuated panels in refrigerators. AHAM stated thatthe models were discontinued, and speculated that it was due to concernsabout a combination of cost, reliability and incompatibility with the manufacturingprocess. (AHAM, No. 22, at 31).DOE has funded research at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) andOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to develop U.S. technology in evacuatedpanels. Completion of this research is expected to take approximately fiveyears; however, independent research or a major breakthrough may bringthis technology into place prior to 1993. Nevertheless, DOE believes thatto specify standards that would require evacuated panel insulation in 1993would be beyond the ability of the manufacturers to carry out commerciallyacceptable redesign and retooling successfully. Therefore, DOE is retainingevacuated insulation panels as a design option but proposes that it isnot technologically feasible for implementation of 1993 standard levels.DOE believes that the scheduled reductions in CFC production will inspireindustry to research non-CFC technology such as evacuated panels and provideprototypes and limited production models for the next review process ofrefrigerators.Whirlpool requested that DOE evaluate the possible development of two newclasses for refrigerators. The first is an all-refrigerator with automaticdefrost and the second is for built-in refrigerators. Whirlpool recommendedthat the standard level for an all-refrigerator with automatic defrostbe equivalent to a refrigerator-freezer, top mount, with automatic defrostand that the standard level for a built-in be approximately 10 to 15 percentabove the non built-in class. (Whirlpool, No. 10, at S-6). AHAM supportedthe adoption of the all-refrigerator with automatic defrost class. (AHAM,No. 22 at 26).DOE proposes to include the all-refrigerator with the class of top-mount,automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer. However, DOE does not have anyinformation to conclude that built-ins, which provide utility to the consumer,affect energy consumption. Thus, DOE is not proposing a separate classfor built-in refrigerators. DOE invites comments and data concerning theadoption of these classes.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efficiency Levels Analyzed</ITAG>DOE examined a range of standard levels, including the 1990 NAECA standards.As discussed above, the impacts of any revised standards were comparedto the 1990 NAECA standards; therefore, the impacts of the base case aregenerally not presented because they are calculated to be zero.Table 3-1 presents the efficiency levels, other than the base case, selectedfor analysis for 1993. Alternate levels were selected to generate a rangeof impacts for analysis. Initially, the levels were selected for the classof top-mount, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer without through-the-doorice service. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level consideredin the engineering analysis. It was felt that manufacturers eventuallycan produce appliances at this efficiency. Level 4 generally correspondsto the minimum life-cycle cost point. Levels 1 through 3 correspond toefficiencies lower than that of level 4. Each level was analyzed discretelyin the engineering analysis. Standard levels for each of the other classesof refrigerators was based on the combination of design options for thetop mount, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer without through-the-doorice service.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 3-1._<T4>Alternative Efficiency Levels for </T4>1993<T4> for Refrigerators and Refrigerator-Freezers and Freezers [Energy ConsumptionKWh/Yr.]</T4><ITAG tagnum="96"/><H1>Product class</H1><H1>1</H1><H1>Level analyzed</H1><H2>2</H2><H2>3</H2><H1>4</H1><H1>5</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Refrigerators and Refrigerator-Freezers with manual defrost<D>14.4 AV+287</D><D>12.3 AV+272</D><D>11.9 AV+258</D><D>10.6 AV+245</D><D>8.0 AV+245</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Refrigerator-Freezers_partial automatic defrost<D>16.7 AV+333</D><D>15.2 AV+317</D><D>14.1 AV+305</D><D>12.5 AV+290</D><D>8.9 AV+273</D></ITAG>Refrigerator-Freezers_automatic defrost with:<ITAG tagnum="3">Top-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service \1\</ITAG><D>19.3 AV+384</D><D>17.8 AV+372</D><D>16.8 AV+363</D><D>14.4 AV+334</D><D>10.0 AV+306</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Side-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service</ITAG><D>14.8 AV+572</D><D>13.5 AV+547</D><D>13.1 AV+540</D><D>10.9 AV+497</D><D>6.9 AV+426</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Bottom-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service</ITAG><D>21.1 AV+410</D><D>19.1 AV+499</D><D>17.9 AV+386</D><D>15.2 AV+353</D><D>10.5 AV+321</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Top-mounted freezer with through-the-door ice service</ITAG><D>20.5 AV+409</D><D>18.9 AV+395</D><D>17.6 AV+380</D><D>14.8 AV+343</D><D>10.2 AV+313</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Side-mounted freezer with through-the-door ice service</ITAG><D>17.2 AV+662</D><D>15.7 AV+635</D><D>15.2 AV+625</D><D>12.8 AV+582</D><D>8.1 AV+517</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Upright Freezers with: Manual defrost</ITAG><D>14.7 AV+213</D><D>13.2 AV+191</D><D>12.3 AV+181</D><D>10.4 AV+177</D><D>7.0 AV+157</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost</ITAG><D>20.7 AV+300</D><D>19.2 AV+277</D><D>18.0 AV+264</D><D>14.8 AV+252</D><D>9.7 AV+216</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chest Freezers and all other freezers</ITAG><D>12.8 AV+186</D><D>12.0 AV+173</D><D>11.2 AV+163</D><D>9.4 AV+159</D><D>7.0 AV+157</D><F>\1\ Including all refrigerators with automatic defrost.</F></ITAG><T3>Payback Period. </T3>Table 3-2 presents the payback period for theefficiency levels analyzed for the most prevalent class of product (20.8cubic foot adjusted volume, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer).

For most classes, standard level 3 corresponds to the moststringent energy conservation standard level at which the additional expenseof purchasing a product at this efficiency level will be less than threetimes the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive duringthe first year.

This is because residential electricity ratesare projected to decline from 1984 to 1995, then increase, reaching 1983levels by 2015 (in real terms). Without upward pressure on operating expenses,the LBL-REM projects that there will be no major energy consumption improvements.When revised energy conservation standards are imposed, the LBL-REM projectsthat over the period 1992-2015, the following savings would be attributableto the increased standards:<ITAG tagnum="25">Level 1_3.8 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 2_5.1 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 3_5.9 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 4_8.1 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 5_11.6 Quads</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(<T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.8.)On the basis of the above, DOE believes that the increased standard levelsconsidered for refrigerators would result in a significant conservationof energy. However, DOE believes that the LBL-REM base case projectionsof no improvement in the efficiency of refrigerators compared to 1990 isunlikely. Over the last two decades the average efficiency of refrigeratorshas increased over 50 percent. During this time, the nation experiencedboth declining and increasing real energy prices. DOE believes there isno reason to conclude that the average efficiency of refrigerators willnot continue to increase. Changes in SWEF can be brought about by a numberof factors including heightened consumer awareness.\1\\6\<NOTE/> DOE requests comments on this issue, particularly the LBL-REM'sforecast of refrigerator efficiency.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\On June 13, 1988, FTC published proposed rules to amendthe appliance labeling program. (53 FR 22106). In particular, FTC requestedcomments on amendments to refrigerator labeling. Changes to the refrigeratorlabel could increase consumer awareness of energy consumption.<T3>Economic Justification_</T3>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 3 efficiency ranges from $12.60for a 22.5 cubic foot (adjusted volume (AV)) chest freezer to $15.90 fora 31.9 cubic foot AV automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer with side freezerand through-the-door services. The cost for the most prevalent class ofproduct (automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezer with top-mounted freezer)would increase $13.20. For level 4 efficiency, the per unit increased costto manufacturers to meet that efficiency ranges from $22.40 for a 26 cubicfoot chest freezer to $36.80 for a 31.9 cubic foot automatic defrost refrigerator-freezerwith side freezer and through-the-door services. The cost for the mostprevalent class of product (automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezer withtop-mounted freezer) would increase $33.20. The per unit increased costto manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency ranges from $4.60 to $6.90,while level 2 cost increases range from $7.70 to $10.30. For level 5, thecost increases from $47.30 to $79.60. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.14 through 3.23.The LBL-MIM, in the base case, projects manufacturers long-run return onequity (ROE) to be 9.54 percent for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezersand 8.25 for freezers. At level 3, the LBL-MIM predicts that a prototypicalrefrigerator and refrigerator-freezer manufacturer would have a gain inits ROE to 10.59 percent, a gain of 11.0 percent. At level 4, the manufacturer'sROE is expected to increase to 10.56 percent, a 10.7 percent gain. Thecorresponding gains for freezer manufacturers are 15.5 percent at level3, and 6.9 percent at level 4. At levels 1 and 2, the refrigerator andrefrigerator-freezer manufacturers' ROE are expected to improve respectively,to 10.08 percent (an improvement of 15.6 percent) and to 10.32 percent(an improvement of 8.2 percent). For freezer manufacturers, the ROE isexpected to improve to 8.99 (an improvement of 12.8 percent) for levels1 and 2, respectively. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 7.9 and 7.10.These industries have displayed periods of increasing consolidations thathave been especially pronounced during periods of low earnings. By increasingprofitability, as DOE projects, standards could lead to a reduction inthe rate of such consolidations, thereby possibly contributing to morerobust competitiveness than is likely in the base case. The increase inprofitability is directly related to the LBL-REM projection of shipments.Shipments under standards are projected to increase slightly. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.34. If shipments wereto decrease, however, the LBL-MIM's projection of ROE would likely decrease,resulting in reduced profitability and possibly increase industry concentration.The Department's characterization of the prototypical manufacturer in thebase case assumes that manufacturers' typical refrigerator, refrigerator-freezerand freezer designs are based on the combination of options presented inthe Engineering Analysis for the baseline unit. If manufacturers use adifferent combination of design options to produce refrigerators that minimallycomply with the 1990 NAECA standard, the Department may have inappropriatelycharacterized the financial position of the prototypical manufacturer inthe LBL-MIM. Furthermore, since financial data of the type needed to characterizethe prototypical manufacturer are generally not available, DOE had to makea number of assumptions based on the limited data publically available,e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annualreports. Finally, DOE assumed that manufacturers would have sufficientquantities of the regulated CFC's. Because of the significant impact theseassumptions could have on the results of the analysis, DOE requests commentson these issues, particularly from small manufacturers.The sensitivity analysis, however, indicates the refrigerator, refrigerator-freezerand freezer industry is sensitive to price and operating expense elasticities.For example, the high price and low operating cost scenario indicates thatthe effects of standards would be to decrease return-on-equity for refrigerator,refrigerator-freezer and freezer manufacturers by nearly 1.5 percent andnearly 2.0 percent for freezers. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 7.17 and 7.18. While thesescenarios are theoretically possible, the Department expects that the originalanalysis will be the likely outcome.For consumers, standard level 3 would cause price increases that wouldrange from a low of $22.62 for an automatic defrost, upright freezer, toa high of $39.36 for an automatic defrost, side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.The corresponding range of price increases at standard level 4 would bea low of $48.13 for a manual defrost, chest freezer and a high of $96.70for an automatic defrost, side-by-side refrigerator-freezer. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.31-3.40.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value.</T3> The LCC analysis indicatesthat for each possible standard level the increase in purchase price wouldbe offset by savings in operating expenses. Standard level 4 generallycorresponds to the minimum for each of the life-cycle cost curves. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Figures 3.13-3.22. This indicatesthat the standard level would not cause any economic burden on the averageconsumer. DOE examined the effect of different discount rates, 5, 7 and10 percent, on the LCC curves and generally found little impact; however,the Department did not consider higher discount rates. Similarly, DOE didnot consider different energy prices, including regional prices, or differentusage rates in the LCC analysis.The LBL-REM employs national average energy prices and usage rates. Theappropriateness of this approach depends on the relationship between energyprices and consumer choice of efficiency levels and the relationship betweenconsumers' expected usage and choice of energy efficiency level. If thoseconsumers who face higher energy costs and/or expect to use their refrigeratorsmore intensively, are on average, more likely to buy higher efficiencyrefrigerators, then a modeling approach that assumes that national averageenergy prices and usage rates apply to all consumers will yield resultsthat overstate the net benefits that could be expected. The Departmentrequests comments on the effects of energy prices and expected usage rateson consumer's choice of efficiency level as well as the potential biasesthat may be introduced by using national average energy prices and usagerates.The net present value (NPV) analysis indicates that if a standard wereadopted at level 3, there would be a net present value of $12.2 billionfrom energy savings over the period 1992-2015. At level 1, the correspondingNPV would be $8.5 billion, at level 2, $11.0 billion and at level 4, thecorresponding NPV would be $13.9 billion. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.14. If, as discussed above,the NPV were calculated based on a 15 percent discount rate, the NPV atlevel 3 would be $2.5 billion; significantly less than calculated at sevenpercent.C. <T3>Energy Savings.</T3> As discussed above, DOE proposes that standards,at each candidate standard level, would result in a significant savingof energy. The Department conducted several sensitivity cases, one of whichwas to assume that after 1990, the market would produce refrigerators ofan efficiency that increases more than the standards would otherwise require.The base case projects that there will be no increases in the SWEF of refrigeratorsafter 1990, i.e., that the private sector will not continue to improvethe efficiency of these appliances beyond the mandated levels. The sensitivitycase assumes that after the 1990 standards are in place, the base caseefficiency growth, instead of being flat or zero, will occur at some positiverate. The Department believes that the maximum improvement in market-inducedrefrigerator energy efficiency after 1990 would be that amount that wouldbe characterized by the historical improvement in such efficiency. It wouldnot be reasonable to assume that energy efficiency would improve at a greaterthan historical rate.Therefore, the Department believes that the range of market-induced efficienciesthat would occur after 1990 in the absence of additional Federal standardswould be from a low or no improvement to a high of an historical averagegrowth rate.It is important to note that the energy savings results for refrigeratorstandards may overstate the results that would otherwise obtain. For example,as indicated above, the maximum savings attributable to standards on refrigeratorswould be 11.6 Quads of electricity. This level would require the use ofevacuated panels in place of foam insulation. If, however, base case efficiencygrowth were to occur at its historical average rate, the LBL-REM projectsthat savings from standards would be reduced by as much as 4.09 Quads,i.e., 11.6 Quads minus 7.51 Quads over the 1992-2015 period. See Table3.3. Similarly, the energy savings could be affected if a regional analysis,including regional energy prices and varying usage rates, were used. DOEdid not perform this analysis because the Department does not have datato indicate that regional values would have an effect on energy savingsdue to standards.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s150,10,10,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Table </T4>3-3._<T4>Sensitivity Analysis: Cumulative Energy Consumption of Refrigerators,Refrigerator-Freezers, and Freezers in the Period </T4>1992-2015 <T4>(Quadrillion Btu, Primary) </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[High efficiency sensitivity case]</ITAG><H1>Base case </H1><H1>Standard </H1><H2>Level 3 </H2><H2>Level 4 </H2><H2>Level 5 </H2><H1>Difference </H1><H2>Level 3 </H2><H2>Level 4 </H2><H2>Level 5</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">41.64 <D>39.41 </D><D>37.52 </D><D>34.13 </D><D>2.23 </D><D>4.12 </D><D>7.51</D></ITAG></ITAG>D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products. </T3>As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceof refrigerators. However, there is no assurance that future utility orperformance of refrigerators would not be lessened as a result of disincentivescaused by standards to investments in energy-using new features or as aresult of redesign brought about by EPA's regulations affecting CFC production.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition. </T3>Since standards generally wouldresult in greater industry profitability, and since historically in thisindustry mergers have resulted during periods of low profitability, oneresult of standards could be to reduce the rate of industry consolidation,therby leading to more competition than is likely under the less profitablebase case. DOE concludes from the results of the LBL-MIM that standardscould lead to a reduction in the rate of consolidation; therefore, standardswould not lessen competition. However, this conclusion is based on DOE'sforecast of increased ROE. DOE requests comments on the impact of standards,both legislated and possibly amended, on competition.F. <T3>Need to Save Energy. </T3>Refrigerators use electricity as their energysource. Nearly seven percent of the nation's total electricity (which requiredsource energy of 27.6 Quads in 1987) powers refrigerators, and nearly 13percent of that seven percent would be saved by standards for this productat level 3, while almost 18 percent of that seven percent would be savedat level 4. Levels 1 and 2 would save 8 and 11 percent respectively. Thesensitivity analysis on the LBL-REM indicates that even if market improvementsand consumer awareness of appliance efficiency continues, the projectedsavings at level 3 would be nearly 5.5 percent of that seven percent, whilethe savings at level 4 would be nearly ten percent of that seven percent.G. <T3>Other Factors. </T3>In the Design Option discussion above, it was explainedthat many design options considered by DOE require the use of additionalamounts of CFC, either CFC-11 or CFC-12. Both of these refrigerants aresubject to an EPA rulemaking that would place restrictions on the manufactureof certain CFCs. As noted above, the use of CFC's in the manufacture of refrigerators currentlyaccounts for approximately two percent of the restricted CFC's. The 50percent reduction in CFC manufacture prescribed by EPA, will likely resultin the use of CFC's in refrigerators to exceed five percent of U.S. consumption.This increase in the percentage of CFC consumption accounted for refrigeratorswould be a result of the CFC production restriction along with increasedCFC use to meet the legislated 1990 standards, and increased sale of theseproducts. Presently, DOE is unaware of any currently available alternativesto CFC-11 or CFC-12 that have been demonstrated as acceptable replacementsto the affected CFC's. However, likely alternatives have been identified,but have not been subjected to complete evaluation, including toxicologytests. Based upon the comments on the advance notice, DOE assumed thatsuitable alternatives will be developed; however, the schedule by whichthese alternatives will become available in sufficient quantities is unknownat this time. DOE believes that most of the increase in CFC usage willbe made in order to meet the 1990 NAECA standards. Of the design optionsconsidered to meet standard levels 1 through 3, only the addition of foamdoors for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers (level 1) would requiresignificant amounts of the affected CFC's. However, in order to meet the1990 NAECA standards, manufacturers could consider the adoption of designoptions not included in DOE's baseline unit, including thicker walls. Ifmanufacturers were to adopt this approach, substantially more CFC's wouldbe required than the Department assumes. Furthermore, under this scenario,the supply of CFC's may not meet the demand at any standard level includingthe 1990 NAECA level. The impacts of the EPA rulemaking on CFCs are notspecifically reflected in the LBL-MIM. DOE solicits comments on this issue,especially concerning the baseline unit and manufacturers' ability to meetthe 1990 NAECA standards. DOE is particularly interested in receiving commentsfrom small manufacturers of refrigerators.<T3>Conclusion. </T3>After careful consideration of the analysis, the Departmentis proposing a revision of the refrigerator standards from a range of standardsthat includes continuing the 1990 NAECA standards to standard level 3.The Department proposes that each candidate standard level for refrigeratorssaves a significant amount of energy, and is economically justified. However,because of the analytical and policy questions discussed above, the Departmentis not proposing specific standard levels within the above range. Rather,DOE is presenting the results of the analysis and is soliciting additionalcomment and information to be considered in promulgating the final rule.The final rule will specify a specific level for refrigerators; the levelselected could include no change to the 1990 NAECA standards.As discussed above, DOE's analysis indicates that there would be substantialenergy savings at each candidate standard level of efficiency. During theperiod 1992-2015, these savings would be nearly six Quads of primary electricityper year compared to the base case for level 3, five Quads for level 2and nearly four Quads for level 1.Although these standards would cause some increase in the initial priceto the consumer, each standard is calculated to reduce substantially thetypical consumer's life-cycle costs. In addition, of the standard levelsanalyzed, level 3 was the most stringent level that satisfied the rebuttablepresumption test, i.e., that had a value of energy savings that repaidthe initial purchase price increase to the average consumer in less thanthree years.The technologies that may be necessary to meet each standard, level 1-3,will likely be available by 1993. These include compressors of near 5.3EER. For manufacturers, level 3 standards are expected to produce long-runincreases in their net income and return on equity of 18.2 percent and11.0 percent, respectively. Levels 1 and 2 will result in similar increases.Each standard level may involve the use of additional amounts of ozone-depletingCFC's; however, DOE believes this additional amount will come at the expenseof other products that presently use the needed CFC's. If, however, EPAwere to halt the production of CFC's, manufacturers would have to findalternatives to both CFC-11 and CFC-12. It has not been conclusively demonstratedto what extent, if any, alternatives would penalize the energy efficiencyperformance of refrigerators. Furthermore, if the standards were to berevised and it were to be shown that the CFC alternatives did have an efficiencypenalty, DOE would not be able to adjust the standard downward.In the base case (1990 NAECA standards), DOE believes the analysis likelyunderestimates the impacts of the 1990 NAECA standards. As discussed above,the Department believes that the LBL-REM overestimates energy consumptionby forecasting no increases in refrigerator SWEF. Also, the characterizationof the prototypical manufacturer in the LBL-MIM does not account for thepossible impacts of the EPA's regulations concerning CFC manufacture, sincethe Department assumed that sufficient quantities will exist after theregulations go into effect.In addition, not amending the 1990 NAECA standards would allow manufacturerstime to adjust to the standards; would not increase refrigerator CFC use;and would allow time for research on alternative, lower CFC-using technologies.For standard level 3, the Department proposes that there will be a significantconservation of energy and that the standards are projected to have littleeconomic impact on manufacturers. Standards at this level would likelybe met with existing technology and would reduce consumer life cycle costs.However, standards at this level would require the use of more CFC's andwould increase prices to consumers. Furthermore, as discussed above, theLBL-REM forecast of energy savings is likely to be overestimated. The standardsanalysis may also underestimate the impact on manufacturers, since manyare already involved in retooling to meet the 1990 NAECA standards andthe EPA's CFC restrictions.For standard level 2, the Department proposes that there will be a significantconservation of energy and that the standards will cause little increasein price to consumers. In addition, the analysis projects little economicimpact on manufacturers and a substantial reduction in consumer life cyclecosts. However, standards at this level will require the use of more CFC's.Also, the analysis may underestimate the economic impacts on manufacturersas discussed above and it likely overestimates energy savings.For level 1, the Department proposes that there will be a significant conservationof energy and that the standards would likely have little economic impacton manufacturers and consumers. In addition, the standards would substantiallydecrease consumer life cycle costs compared to the 1990 unit. However,significant improvements in efficiency are technologically feasible. Also,standards at this level would result in some increase in CFC use in refrigerators,and the impacts on manufacturers and energy savings estimates may be incorrectas described above.The results of the analysis, including those for levels 1, 2, and 3 discussedabove, could change if a different discount rate were used, energy pricesdrop, or if the use of national average energy prices and appliance usagerates introduces a bias. Furthermore, if amendments to the appliance labelingprogram are finalized by FTC, it could improve the effectiveness of theprogram, thereby reducing any benefits of standards. 53 FR 22106, June13, 1988. DOE believes that programs such as the labeling program are preferableto standards since they result in the least amount of intervention in themarketplace and do not preclude products that may be the optimum for certainconsumers.More stringent standard levels were examined and rejected for the followingreasons: First, the level 5 standard, the maximum technologically feasibleoption, involved the use of evacuated panels. While evacuated panels haveexisted for some time, and were previously even used in some Japanese refrigerators,the technology has not yet proven to be a reliable and durable one, andone suitable for mass production. Furthermore, even though one domesticmanufacturer has patented an evacuated panel technology, there are no reasonableassurances that a reliable and durable evacuated panel design will be availablewhen this standard is to be effective. Therefore, the Department has rejectedthis standard level. Moreover, in most cases this point is beyond the minimumlife-cycle cost point which would prevent some consumers from being ableto purchase the most cost-effective units for them.Level 4 standards would involve a substantial increase in the initial consumerprice of refrigerators; in fact, the improvements necessary to reach thatlevel of efficiency are estimated to be so costly that the rebuttable presumptionconsideration is not satisfied for the most prevalent class. In addition,results of the engineering analysis and the life-cycle cost analysis indicatethat while there is a substantial increase in the price of refrigeratorsbetween level 3 and 4, the corresponding decrease in operating costs resultsin a negligible life-cycle cost difference between these levels. Furthermore,this standard level assumes the use of more ozone-depleting CFC than thelevel 3 standard.b. Small Gas Furnaces<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Classes</ITAG>Two classes of small gas furnaces,\17\<NOTE/> weatherized (outdoor) and non-weatherized (indoor), werespecified in the advance notice.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The Act requires the Department to establish minimumenergy conservation standards for gas furnaces (other than furnaces designedsolely for installation in mobile homes) having an input of less than 45,000Btu per hour. The Department interprets this provision to be applicableonly to gas, forced-air furnaces.These classes are distinguished by their ability, or inability, to be installedoutdoors, a performance-related feature that affects utility and efficiency.The weatherized (outdoor) furnace provides the owner with the utility ofsaving indoor space. The weatherized furnace typically is less energy efficientthan a comparable nonweatherized (or, indoor) furnace because the ``jacket''energy losses of a weatherized furnace will usually exceed the infiltrationenergy losses of an indoor furnace. The test procedures for furnaces recognizethese differences and prescribe different efficiency calculation methodsfor these two types of furnaces.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Design Options</ITAG>The Engineering Analysis identifies individual or combinations of designoptions with a potential for improving energy efficiency. Design optionsthat are on the market, or that will be on the market by the time standardsare effective, were considered. The following is a list of design optionsthat were examined:(A) Increased heat exchanger surface area.(B) Intermittent ignition device (IID).(C) Power burner or power vent.(D) Increased insulation.(E) Additional improvement of steady-state efficiency.(F) Two-stage and modulating burners.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Comments from the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) suggested that in evaluatingthe small furnace standard (between 71 and 78 percent AFUE), the Departmentconsider the base case not to be the no regulation case, but rather the78 percent case. In addition, EEI suggested that the Department examine71 percent AFUE, 78 percent AFUE (as the base case), and two levels higherthan 78 percent. (EEI, No. 20, at 3-4).The Department rejects the idea of a base case at 78 percent AFUE sincethat would preclude the ability to show any energy savings at 71 percentAFUE and, therefore, it would <T3>a priori </T3>exclude the 71 percent AFUE case from consideration.As to EEI's other suggestion, DOE believes it would serve no purpose inthis proceeding to examine two standards cases of efficiencies greaterthan 78 percent AFUE since the Act precludes DOE from setting a standardgreater than 78 percent AFUE.The American Gas Association (AGA) and Alabama Gas Association (AlG) maintainedthat the use of life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis is inappropriate in thesmall gas furnace market since much of the decision-making on new purchasesis made by builders and contractors whose purchase decisions are influencedprincipally by initial price considerations. (AGA, No. 24, at 1; and, A1G,No. 8, at 3 and 6). Conversely, CEC suggested that the Department developLCC curves for each product. (CEC, No. 35, at 6).Indeed, while much of the small furnace market demand comes from buildersand contractors, consumer life-cycle cost analysis is still appropriatesince section 325(1)(2)(B)(i)(II) of the Act requires DOE, in determiningwhether a new or amended standard is economically justified, to ``determinewhether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatestextent practicable, considering the savings in operating costs throughoutthe estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for,or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to resultfrom the imposition of the standard.''The AGA stated that the LBL-REM model disregards regional variations inhousing unit growth rates (AGA, No. 24, at 15). The AGA is incorrect, sincethe inputs to LBL-REM include forecasts of regional housing starts. Specifically,LBL-REM's updated housing submodel includes several features:(1) The model uses population projections, which are more stable than projectionsof housing completions because of the comparatively larger influence ofeconomics, e.g., the stage of the business cycle, interest rates, and soon, on housing completions. In the long run, the number of housing unitsavailable is expected to agree with the need for housing units, which isdetermined by the size and composition of the population.(2) The updated method utilizes population projections for states by housetype. This feature, combined with climate data, permits estimation of thefraction of households with heat loads that could be met by small gas furnaces.(3) Projections of the numbers of people in each age group in future yearsare used to project changes in the distribution of house types.Lastly, with regard to the utility impact analysis, Lone Star Gas Company(LSG) and EEI suggested that the utility analysis examine the impact ongas, as well as electric, utilities. (LSG, No. 11, at 6; EEI, No. 20, at6).No direct analysis of gas utilities was performed, but impacts on residentialgas sales were estimated. The Department believes that this is adequateto assess the gas utility impacts from standards on small gas furnacesthat are intended for residential use, since the bulk of these impactsshould be on future gas utility residential sales. Nevertheless, the Departmentwelcomes detailed information and data from persons or organizations whobelieve that DOE has underestimated the likely impacts on gas utilities.Also, two utilities suggested that results obtained for a region may differgreatly from results obtained for each separate utility system within aregion. (Allegheny Power System (APS), No. 13, at 2; and, LSG, No. 11,at 6).For the small gas furnace analysis, it was the Department's intention tocapture as much of the regional variations as possible. LBL-REM used regionaldisaggregation in modeling space conditioning choice in new homes. Whileresource limitations prevented any further disaggregation of the marektplace,DOE is interested in receiving information and data on any specific regionalproblems that were overlooked.Several gas distribution companies and gas suppliers, and the SouthernGas Association (SGA) and AGA endorsed the 71 percent AFUE furnace standardover the 78 percent AFUE. They cited various reasons for their preferencefor the lower efficiency, the predominant one being the impact on gas utilitiesof reduced load that would result from a 78 percent standard.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Comments in favor of the 78 percent AFUE were received fromthe Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association and the Edison Electric Institute.(GAMA, No. 23, at 1); (EEI, No. 20, at 2). Three comments encouraging athorough analysis of all factors before a decision is made were submittedby the Natural Resources Defense Council, the New York State Energy Office,and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

(PING, No. 3,at 3; Peo.G., No. 6, at 1; FNGA, No. 14, at 1; ENTEX, No. 15, at 2; AGA,No. 24, at 7; and SGA, No. 26, at 2).Comments requesting consideration of a range of efficiencies between 71and 78 percent were received from Southern Company Services Inc. (SCS).(SCS, No. 7, at 1).While the Department still believes that 71 percent and 78 percent AFUEare the meaningful candidate levels, an analysis at 74 percent AFUE wasalso conducted.The Edison Electric Institute suggested that the 78 percent AFUE levelshould be the base case or ``default level'' unless DOE justifies reducingit to 71 percent. (EEI, No. 20, at 3). The New York State Energy Officestated that DOE is required to investigate maximum technical feasibilityefficiency levels for small furnaces and that while pulse combustion andheat exchangers are not on the list of design options to be examined, theyshould be. (NYSEO, No. 32, at 7-8).The ``max-tech'' level of efficiency for small furnaces is 96 percent AFUE;therefore, it cannot be a candidate standard level for this rulemaking,because it falls outside of the range for consideration set by section325(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.Only one comment addressed test procedure issues. York International (York)pointed out that ``the measure of efficiency for furnaces under the FTCappliance labeling requirements is the annual fuel utilization efficiency(AFUE) and not the Energy Factor.'' (York, No. 1, at 1). The Act is explicitunder the definition of ``efficiency descriptor'' stating ``for furnacesand direct heating equipment, (it is) annual fuel utilization efficiency.''Section 321 (a)(22)(A). The confusion in this matter has reference to sectionIII of DOE's advance notice, in which outputs of the engineering analysisare listed as Energy Efficiency (expressed as the DOE energy factor) witha footnote stating ``the energy factor is a measure of energy efficiencyderived from the DOE test procedure for that product.'' The problem isthat the DOE test procedure for furnaces includes an additional efficiencydescriptor called Energy Factor which includes the electric energy in thecalculation. This potential misinterpretation, that energy efficiency refersto the ``Energy Factor,'' is being clarified by stating that energy efficiencyrefers to AFUE.<T3>Maintenance Expense. </T3>Several gas companies referenced the needto consider higher maintenance expense for the 78 percent AFUE furnacestandard. (A1G, No. 8, at 6; LSG, No. 11, at 4andamp;8; FNGA, No. 14, at4; VANG, No. 16, at 7; ALG, No. 26, at 2; and NG Co., No. 37, at 2). Sincethis efficiency level would require the use of a fan motor and its associatedcontrols for induced draft, the maintenance expense was included in theEngineering Analysis.<T3>Higher First Costs/Installation Costs. </T3>Several of the gas companiesand associations cited increased installation expenses due to special ventingrequirements as being necessary to consider in the engineering and economicanalyses for the 78 percent AFUE standard for induced draft type furnaces.(OKNG, No. 2, at 2; ETNG, No. 9, at 4 and 5; LSG; No. 11, at 8; ANR, No.12, at 2; FNGA, No. 14, at 2; VANG, No. 16, at 5; AGA, No. 24, at 12; SGA,No. 25, at 4; UCG, No. 27, at 3; SCEandamp;G, No. 28, at 3; and NG Co., No.37, at 2). Generally, these comments addressed problems that would arisewhen a furnace and a water heater are installed with a common vent system.These additional expenditures were cited as needed since a separate ventmay be required to vent an induced draft type furnace. Also, the existingvent used for the water heater would then be oversized and possibly requirea revised water heater vent or insulation of the vent to prevent condensation.Particular problems were cited for multifamily structures and accessibilityto the existing venting for retrofit. GAMA disagreed, stating that ventingof induced draft gas furnaces in multifamily housing would cost less, notmore, than the atmospheric type of vent systems. (GAMA, No. 23, at 4).GAMA also encouraged DOE to examine further this comparative cost issue.This issue had not been addressed explicitly by LBL and additional analysisis planned before DOE will issue a final rule.<T3>Regional Analysis. </T3>Several gas companies and their associationssubmitted comments suggesting that a regional analysis be included thataccounts for the reduced heat load and energy savings that would prevailfor the higher efficiency, i.e., 78 percent AFUE, in milder climates. (PING,No. 3, at 2; Peo.G., No. 6, at 2; A1G, No. 8, at 3andamp;7; FNGA, No. 14,at 4; AGA, No. 24, at 14; SGA, No. 26, at 2; and SCEandamp;G, No. 28, at2).A national estimate was made using LBL-REM. DOE recognizes that there areregional differences in climate. LBL-REM includes a heat load calculationfor new houses in each state that is used for projecting market sharesof small gas furnaces. The average unit energy consumption of small gasfurnaces reflects the average climate where small gas furnaces are located,not a national population-based climate.In addition, DOE performed a sensitivity analysis on the LCC analysis usingregional energy prices and usage rates. <T3>See Technical Support Document,</T3> section 6.2. Because of the impactthat usage and prices can have on the results, DOE requests comments onthis issue.<T3>Vent Installation_Ability to Use Common Venting.</T3> Many of the gascompanies and their associations contended that a major issue to be consideredin the 78 percent AFUE furnace (an induced draft type system) are coderequirements which would prohibit the installation of this type furnacein a common vent with an atmospheric type burner system. This would beparticularly important in the replacement market. (PING, No. 3, at 3; OKNG,No. 2, at 2; Peo.G, No. 6, at 2; A1G, No. 8, at 4; FNGA, No. 14, at 3;VANG, No. 16, at 7; SGA, No. 25, at 3; ALG, No. 26, at 2; NIGAS, No. 36,at 2).The National Fuel Gas Code (ANSI Standard Z223.1), which is the major installationcode for gas-fueled furnaces, addresses mechanical draft systems as follows:``Vent connection serving equipment vented by natural draft shall not beconnected into any portion of mechanical draft systems operating underpositive pressure.'' This would prohibit an installation of a gas waterheater and a gas furnace in a common chimney venting arrangement. The operativewords in the code are ``systems operating under positive pressure.''GAMA stated that ``over 90 percent of the non-condensing induced draftfurnaces and boilers certified by the American Gas Association can be safelycommon vented with conventional atmospheric type gas appliances.'' (GAMA,No. 23, at 3). GAMA cited a September 1985 ``White Paper'' prepared bythe American Gas Association Laboratories, entitled ``Common Vent Studyof Power and Non Power Vented Appliances,'' to substantiate its statementand which GAMA believes directly contradicts the testimony of AGA and SGA.GAMA also submitted a list of engineering reports published by the AGALaboratories in the July 1987 issue of the AGA Laboratories Directory ofCertified Appliances. GAMA stated that the purpose of these reports isto identify specific induced draft non-condensing furnaces that can becommon vented with conventional combustion system equipment. GAMA furtherstated that AGA's White Paper concluded that before allowing common ventingof fan or blown assisted combustion system appliances with draft hood equippedappliances, code authorities are requiring engineering data to show satisfactoryperformance.Based on this information, DOE believes that draft induced appliances canbe used safely in a common vent system with atmospheric type (draft hoodequipped) water heaters. However, there remains a question of the degreeof acceptability by local code officials of draft-induced furnaces usinga common vent with an atmospheric type water heater. DOE will examine theseissues before issuing a final rule for the small furnace standard. DOEinvites comments on these issues, especially with respect to the acceptancewithin each State or local jurisdiction regarding the special testing requirementsand AGA engineering reports that are being used. Several Comments also suggested that a variety of housing types and climatesbe investigated. SCEandamp;G cited the need for specialized cases to examinepayback and economic analysis for mild climates, such as those with lessthan 2500 degree days (SCEandamp;G, No. 28, at 2). <T3>Utility Impact Analysis_Fuel Switching Impact. </T3>Several gas utilitycompanies commented that the utility analysis should include costs of allutilities, not only electric utilities. (OKNG, No. 2, at 3; Peo.G, No.6, at 2; SCS, No. 7, at 1; A1G, No. 8, at 3 and 7; ETNG, No. 9, at 6; ANR,No. 12, at 3; FNGA, No. 14, at 3 and 4; ENTEX, No. 15, at 2; VANG, No.16, at 6; ALG, No. 18, at 2; AGA, No. 24, at 4-7 and 12; SGA, No. 25, at3; UCG, No. 27, at 4; SCEandamp;G, No. 28, at 3; NIGAS, No. 36, at 2; andNGCo., No. 37, at 2).These companies believe that probable shifts of gas utility load to electricitygeneration should be included in the analysis when considering the higher78 percent AFUE levels for small gas furnaces. For example, gas utilitiescould suffer a decreased market share resulting in an increased cost ofgas per unit sold. (LSG, No. 11, at 6). Several of these companies alsopointed out that when load is lost to electric resistance heat_particularlybaseboard radiant heat_that future conversion to gas would be cost prohibitive.Gas utilities also contended that a switch to electric resistance heatwith its attendant higher cost of operation will hurt the elderly and lowerincome customers. AGA stated that the proposed methodology should not considerload loss to heat pumps in assessing the potential load loss from gas utilitieswhen evaluating the shift of gas heating to electric resistance heat, asrequired by the Act. (AGA, No. 24, at 4). In considering candidate standard levels, the Department will calculatethe potential load loss of gas utilities to electric resistance heat, andto other heating choices, e.g., heat pumps.The South Carolina Electric Company (SCEandamp;G), which supplies both gasand electricity to its customers, favors the lower 71 percent AFUE standardfor small furnaces. SCEandamp;G stated that fuel switching will produce agreater demand for electricity on the company's electric system, but thiswill not cause a corresponding increase in KWh sales because of the utility'sclimate area. (SCEandamp;G, No. 28, at 3). Alabama Gas Corp. (A1G, No. 8, at 4) stated what many other gas utilitycompanies also implied_that when a gas furnace is not selected, a gas waterheater often will not be selected. Specific comments that cited statisticsor estimates included the following: ``Seventy-eight percent AFUE wouldlose 20-25 percent of the market to electric resistance''_(OKNG, No. 2,at 3); ``forty percent of new homes in Florida install electric resistanceheat,'' (FNGA, No. 14, at 3); ``although less than 10 percent of dwellingunits priced above $120,000 use electric resistance heat, roughly one-thirdof the units priced less than $60,000 use electric resistance heat. AGAprojections of load loss to gas utilities between the years 1993 and 2000could be as high as 600 BCF if the 78 percent AFUE level is prescribed.''(NG Co., No. 37, at 3).Conversely, EEI stated that DOE's analysis should consider only those householdsthat are both candidates to purchase gas furnaces and candidates to purchasegas supply, since the decision of a builder to choose electric space conditioningmay be based on the availability, cost or convenience of electricity andgas. EEI also commented that DOE should modify the utility analysis toinclude the benefits that will occur from improved gas energy efficiencycausing an extension of future gas reserves. (EEI, No. 20, at 5). Whileimprovement in energy efficiency in small gas furnaces would seem to extendfuture gas reserves, the Department believes that the private individuals'values for those reserves, as expressed in the marketplace, captures fullythe benefits to society of any extension of the reserves' lifetimes. Therefore,no additional benefits to society will be calculated for this potentialeffect. Sierra Pacific Power (SPC) stated that the analysis should also includegas utilities which would be impacted by: Reduction in fossil fuel usage;input to environmental assessment; change in investment; change in revenuerequirements; change in facilities, and change in residential load factors.(SPC, No. 33, at 1). NRDC contended that the furnace standard analysis should consider the likelihoodof the Department's implementation of ASHRAE Special Project 53, whichwould require greater thermal integrity in homes that are heated by electricresistance heat than for those that are heated by gas. The contention wasthat since this would raise the first-cost of electric resistance heatingrelative to gas heating, it would ``reduce or eliminate fuel switchingto electric resistance resulting from furnace standards by reducing thedifferential costs_both first cost and operating cost_of gas and electricresistance houses.'' (NRDC, No. 19, at 8-9). The Department accepts this point; however, DOE has no authority to implementa mandatory program, incorporating provisions of ASHRAE Special Project53, that would apply to non-Federal construction. NRDC also suggested that consideration of the small gas furnace standardbe done in the context of manufacturers having retooled to meet a 78 percentAFUE standard for gas furnaces greater than 45,000 Btu. Therefore, to producea 71 percent AFUE unit would require setting up a separate production linewhich, because of the relatively small numbers of small furnaces produced,could result in higher unit cost than would a 78 percent standard for smallfurnaces. (NRDC, No. 19, at 6).The Department's analysis evaluated the impacts of standards on small gasfurnaces in the context of a 78 percent standard in effect on all furnacesgreater than 45,00 Btu/hour input. The NRDC contended, in advocating a 78 percent AFUE small gas furnace standard,that those consumers who are already willing and institutionally able totrade off higher first costs in return for lower operating costs will buya small gas furnace, even at 71 percent efficiency. NRDC maintained,<ITAG tagnum="21">It would seem anomalous if a family that was willing to accept, say,a five-year payback on going from resistance heat to gas would not be willingto accept a similar or shorter payback with respect to increasing the efficiencyof the gas furnace. We believe the model should reflect this syllogism.(NRDC, No. 19, at 7).</ITAG>This comment contains implicit assumptions that are not necessarily valid.The payback on the higher efficiency furnace would be similar or shorteronly if it had a less than proportional price increase to reach the higherefficiency. If the price increase for the higher efficiency unit were proportionatelymore expensive than the value of additional energy saved, then the paybackperiod would, in fact, be longer. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy testified that claimsabout shifts in markets should be avoided unless supported by empiricalevidence. (ACEEE, Testimony).<T3>Future Market. </T3>Several gas utilities and associations commentedthat the future market for gas furnaces of less than 45,000 Btu/h inputis considerably greater than may be projected by the LBL-REM. (A1G, No.8, at 3-5; VANG, No. 16, at 6; AGA, No. 24, at 9, 11, and 15; SGA, No.25, at 3; and ANR, No. 34, at 2). The major reasons given to support this assertion were: Thermal integrityof buildings is improving due to either retrofit or to recent changes inmodel building codes; historical oversizing of gas furnaces has now beenrecognized and oversizing practices are being moderated (in some casesas a result of building codes); and, there are increased numbers of multifamilyhousing units with their smaller sizes and lower heating requirements.AGA provided data from its Space Heating Efficiency Improvement Program(SHEIP) showing that furnaces are typically 2\1/2\ times oversized, andall new and existing multifamily units could be served by less than 45,000Btu/h furnaces. (AGA, No. 24, at 10). AGA also commented that the assumption in the proposed methodology thatthe market for a small gas furnace is the single family house which isundefined by size, heat loss, geographic region, or socioeconomic groupis questionable for existing construction, and is an incorrect assumptionfor new housing built from 1992 and beyond. (AGA, No. 24, at 9). ``AGA statistics indicate that average gas consumption for house heatingcustomers declined 27.4 percent from 1973 baseline consumption levels,while the number of house heating customers increased 17 percent.'' AGAalso comments that master meter prohibitions and rehabilitation of existingbuildings are greatly expanding the market for the small gas furnace. (AGA,No. 24, at 10). <T3>Impact of Builder and Developer Decisions. </T3>Several of the gasutility companies and their associations stated that DOE's methodologyshould evaluate builder decision-making regarding type of heating fuelselected. (PING, No. 3, at 3; OKNG, No. 5, at 2; A1G, No. 8, at 4 and 6;FNGA, No. 14, at 2; ENTEX, No. 15, at 2; VANG, No. 2, at 4 and 5; AGA,No. 24, at 11 and 12; SGA, No. 25, at 6; UCG, No. 27, at 3; and ANR, Nos.12 and 34, at 3). ANR cited an opinion survey that concluded that buildersare the decision-makers in selecting a heating system for single familyresidences. The objective of these comments was to show that builders'decisions were based on first cost, and that builders will switch to electricresistance because of the increased cost for the 78 percent AFUE furnace.(ANR, No. 34, at 3). NRDC contends that no further switch to electric islikely as a result of the small gas furnace standard going from 71 to 78percent AFUE, since first cost is already significant for gas at 71 percentversus electric. EEI stated that if a builder decides not to purchase gasit may be for reasons other than whether the furnace is 71 percent or 78percent AFUE, namely, reasons such as individual metering requirements,interruptible rate requirements, etc. (EEI, No. 20, at 5). Florida NaturalGas has stated that 40 percent of new homes in Florida are presently installedwith electric resistance heat. (FNGA, No. 14, at 3). Comments on future market share have an overlapping consequence to thisanalysis if the future market share for small gas furnaces is as greatas some have predicted. As a result of more thermally efficient homes,and, with less oversizing of furnaces, the principal market share thatotherwise would have been 78 percent AFUE (the NAECA standard for furnacesgreater than 45,000 Btu/h) would become 71 percent AFUE if the smallerfurnace is predominant. One basis of setting standards for furnaces waspredicated on the fact that builders determine the type of equipment tobe installed and do so on first cost. If the 71 percent AFUE furnace isavailable, and attains a large share of the future market for small gasfurnaces, the less efficient furnace may be used in structures where agreater than 45,000 Btu/h furnace (of 78 percent AFUE) would otherwisehave been used. In other words, the purpose of an energy efficiency standard as specifiedby the Act for the typical gas furnace at 78 percent AFUE would be circumventedby the availability to the builder market of a 71 percent AFUE furnaceat lower cost. The more thermally efficient home, coupled with less oversizing,could lead to more small gas furnaces. The builder model that would otherwisehave been a somewhat larger than 45,000 Btu/h, 78 percent AFUE furnacecould become the less expensive 45,000 Btu/h, 71 percent furnace, in astructure that, because of improved construction (with lower heat loss),could then use the smaller furnace. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efficiency Levels Analyzed</ITAG>Table 3.4 presents the efficiency levels selected for analysis for 1992.Alternate levels were selected to generate a range of impacts for analysis.The initial level selected, level 3, corresponds to the highest efficiencylevel provided for in the Act. Standards above 78 percent AFUE were excludedfrom consideration because the Act specifies that such a standard may notbe greater than 78 percent AFUE. Levels 1 and 2 correspond to efficiencieslower than level 3, with level 1 being the lowest level provided for inthe Act. Levels 1 and 2 were analyzed discretely in the Engineering Analysis.Level 3, 78 percent AFUE, was based on engineering level 3, having an intermittentignition device and induced draft. In addition, the engineering analysisconsidered design options that would result in furnace efficiencies asgreat as 92 percent AFUE. These more efficient designs, as mentioned above,were not considered for potential standards, but rather were used as inputto the LBL-REM in order that the energy forecasting analysis would havea complete set of data upon which to make projections. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8</C><T4>Table 3-4.

Table 3.5 presents the payback period for theefficiency levels analyzed. For both classes, level 1 is the only energyconservation standard level in which the additional cost of purchasinga product at this efficiency level will be less than three times the valueof the energy savings the consumer will receive during the first year.The payback period for units that meet level 1 efficiency ranges from 2.3years for a warm air indoor gas furnace to 2.5 years for a warm air outdoorgas furnace. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document Tables 3.41 and 3.42.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,10,10</C><T4>Table </T4>3-5. <T4>Payback Periods of Design Options Years for Gas Furnaces </T4>(<T4>less than </T4>45,000 <T4>Btu/hr.</T4>)<H1/><T3>Standard level</T3><H1>Payback periods</H1><H2>Warm air indoor</H2><H2>Warm air outdoor</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>2.3</D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>14.4</D><D>15.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>5.1</D><D>6.4</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>Significance of Energy Savings</T3>. By the year 2015, the weightedaverage energy efficiency of new small gas furnaces sold in the absenceof standards is projected to be 80.3 percent AFUE. Standards, at standardlevels 1 and 3, are expected to increase the average shipment weightedefficiency of small gas furnaces to between 81.6 and 84.3 percent AFUE,respectively. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.16. However, the aggregateannual energy consumption of small gas furnaces is projected to increaseslightly. This increase in gas consumption for small gas furnaces comesat the expense of larger gas furnaces, heat pumps, and central electricalfurnaces. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.18. While standards increasethe efficiency and cost of small gas furnaces, the market for small furnacesis projected to increase at the same time. When energy conservation standardsare imposed, the LBL-REM projects that over the period 1992-2015, the followingincrease in energy consumption of small gas furnaces would occur:<ITAG tagnum="25">Level 1_0.01 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 2_0.03 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 3_0.05 Quads</ITAG><T3>Economic Justification</T3>_A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers</T3>. The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 3 efficiency ranges from $64 foran indoor gas furnace to $88 for an outdoor gas furnace. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.24 and 3.25. At that level of efficiency, the price to the consumer increases $215.10for indoor gas furnaces and $257.60 for outdoor gas furnaces at level 3.<T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.41 and 3.42.The LBL-REM results indicate that standards at level 3 will result in nearlya five percent improvement in average shipment weighted efficiency whencompared to standard level 1. This would result in a negligible drop inlife cycle costs. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.16 and Figures 3.11 and3.12.In the LBL-MIM results for small gas furnaces, it was found that standardswould cause manufacturers to lose even more money on these furnaces thanthey are projected to lose in the base or no-standards case. In the basecase, manufacturers' returns on equity (ROE) are expected to be ^2.02 percentfor small furnaces, compared to a base case ROE of a ^2.13 percent understandard level 3.Small gas furnaces tend to have very low profit margins and thus they contributelittle or nothing to a gas furnace manufacturer's profitability. DOE believesthis is because of marketing considerations, in that manufacturers findit important for marketing purposes to carry a complete line of furnacecapacities. Thus, manufacturers tend to carry small gas furnaces in theirproduct lines, although many of these firms carry only one or two models.LBL-MIM projects that a standard of either 71, 74, or 78 percent AFUE forsmall gas furnaces would result in slightly fewer shipments, higher productprices, and lower net income and ROE than would occur in the absence ofstandards.The LBL-MIM predicts at level 3 that a prototypical furnace manufacturerwould experience a .001 percent decrease in ROE. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 7.23. The sensitivity analysis,however, indicates the gas furnace industry results are sensitive to consumerprice elasticities and unit variable cost increases. For example, the sensitivityanalysis indicates that the effects of standards could be to decrease return-on-equityfor small gas furnace manufacturers by nearly 1.2 percent or to raise itby nearly the same amount. However, there is only a one percent chanceof either of these sensitivity results occurring. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 7.25.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value</T3>. The LCC analysis indicatesthat at each possible standard level the increase in purchase price wouldbe offset by savings in operating expenses. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.41 and 3.42. Also, ofthe three candidate standard levels, level 3 had the lowest consumer life-cyclecost. This indicates that the standard level would not cause any economicburden on the average consumer because of the decreasing life cycle costs.The NPV analysis indicates that if a standard were adopted at level 3,there would be a net present value of a negative $17 million to consumers.This negative value is due principally to the increase in furnace shipmentsand a corresponding increase in total gas consumption in the standardscases. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.37.C. <T3>Energy Savings</T3>. As indicated above, standards will result in anincrease of gas consumption for small gas furnaces. If, however, the marketplacecontinues to demand changes in efficiency at the same rate as historically,the LBL-REM projects that there would be no savings from standards overthe 1992-2015 period. This result occurs because in the base case, theefficiency or SWEF of all new small gas furnaces is projected to exceedthe 78 percent AFUE standard by the time it would come into effect. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.30, Reference 10.D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products</T3>. As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility for performanceof small gas furnaces.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition</T3>. The determination of this factormust be made by the Attorney General.F. <T3>Need to Save Energy</T3>. Small gas furnaces use natural gas as theirenergy source. Nearly seven percent of the nation's natural gas consumptionis used to operate small gas furnaces, and nearly five percent of thatseven percent would be saved by standards for this product at level 3.However, the sensitivity analysis on the LBL-REM indicates that if consumerawareness of and concern with appliance efficiency continues the projectedsavings would be the same as with level 3 standards.<T3>Conclusion</T3>. The Department is proposing a 78 percent AFUE standardon small gas furnaces. A 78 percent AFUE standard for small gas furnaceswould result in a significant conservation of energy, and although thepayback is greater than three years, the standard level was found to beeconomically justified.In addition to producing the maximum unit energy savings of the candidatestandards, this standard is beneficial to consumers and manufacturers alike.For consumers, the 78 percent AFUE standard produces the lowest consumerlife-cycle cost of the candidate levels. In addition, the initial purchaseprice increase may be lower than that which has been estimated. This resultis possible because the 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnacesis the same level of efficiency that the Act imposes on larger gas furnaces,which presently comprise more than 95 percent of furnance sales. Therefore,to the extent that manufacturers can produce these small units on the sameproduction lines, with the same design options that will be used for thelarger furnaces, there may be economics of scale in the production of theseunits.Small gas furnace manufacturers have strongly supported the 78 percentAFUE standard on their products. The analysis indicates that such a standardshould have relatively little economic impact on them. The uniformity ofa 78 percent AFUE standard on small furnaces and on larger units may makethe production process simpler for the manufacturers. This occurs becauseas mentioned above, a uniform standard for all gas furnaces could resultin fewer production lines.In comments on the advance notice, several gas utilities contended thata 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces would cause them to losemarket share to electric utilities. This analysis, however, indicates thatsuch a loss of market share is not a likely result from a 78 percent AFUEstandard. The LBL-REM projects that market share for small gas furnacesis likely to increase as a result of the level 3 standard.One small drawback to the 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnacesis that it would eliminate units that may be, in some circumstances, themost cost-effective for some consumers. This is a result that could possiblyoccur in some Southern-tier States, where the most cost-effective smallgas furnace could be one that is less efficient and whose first cost isless than the minimum LCC unit. This less efficient unit could cost theconsumer less to operate, on a LCC basis, if the usage rate is extremelylow. With low usage it is possible that any increase in purchase pricemay not be matched by reductions in annual operating costs. Nevertheless,while this is a possible outcome for some purchasers in some areas, theDepartment believes that such effects, should they occur at all, wouldbe limited.c. Television Sets<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Classes</ITAG>In accordance with the Act, the Department is considering the establishmentof an energy conservation standard for television sets, to become effectiveno earlier than January 1, 1992. The advance notice proposed two classesof television sets, color and monochrome (black and white) to be evaluatedfor separate levels of efficiency. DOE identified eight design optionsand requested data on power demand characteristics.The two classes are distinguished by the ability of one to reproduce imagesin color, a performance-related feature that affects utility and efficiency.Color television sets usually consume more energy than comparable monochrometelevision sets, because of the use of multiple electron guns. For thisreason, energy efficiency levels achieved by monochrome television setsare not achievable in color television sets. Since color television setsand monochrome television sets offer distinct differences in utility tothe consumer, DOE is specifying separate classes for color and monochrometelevision sets. Certain features on television sets, such as remote control and stereocomponents, provide utility to the consumer and may affect energy consumption.Although such characteristics typically would require the establishmentof separate classes for television sets with such features, the Departmentwas unable to analyze these features separately and, hence, is not establishingseparate classes for them.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Design Options</ITAG>The following is a list of design options that were examined for both colorand black and white television sets:(A) Remote control.(B) Electronic tuning.(C) Automatic color control.(D) Vertical interval reference.(E) Brightness sensor.(F) Voltage regulating power source.(G) Display device.(H) One-gun tube.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Three comments addressed specifically the issue of standards for televisionsets; these were offered by one manufacturer, one manufacturers' association,and one conservation group. Thompson Consumer Electronics, Inc. (Thompson),manufacturer-marketing company for Radio Corporation of America (RCA) andGeneral Electric (GE) brand television sets, opposed the establishmentof energy standards for television sets. Thompson claimed that the technologicaladvancement of solid state electronics in replacing tubes had extensivelyincreased the energy efficiency of television sets. (Thompson, No. 4, at2). The company stated further that its research revealed an incrementalimprovement of only 5-48 kilowatt hours (Kwh) per year based on the standardoperating time of 2200 hours per year. (Thompson, No. 4, at 3). These claimswere supported by the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic IndustriesAssociation (EIA), an industry trade association representing televisionmanufacturers. (EIA, No. 21, at 2).Additional comments contended that manufacturers prefer to decrease energyuse because of the adverse effects on reliability and performance thatcan be caused by the excess heat generated by inefficient electronics.(Thompson, No. 4, at 3; and EIA, No. 21, at 3).NRDC supported the establishment of standards for television sets and maintainedthat a significant conservation potential exists for this product. (NRDC,No. 19, at 3). NRDC suggested that the list of design options be left opento allow for new and cost-effective energy efficient technologies. Oneof those recommended was based on the observed variation in power requirementbetween a 40-inch color set of 190 watts and a four inch monochrome portableof 3.6 watts. It was suggested that even allowing for color versus blackand white difference, the 10-fold decrease in size inferred some technologyof portability which could be employed in larger sets. (NRDC, No. 19, at4). DOE has reviewed this comment and does not find a basis for the improvementpotential suggested by NRDC. Therefore, the Department rejects NRDC's inferenceof improvement potential.NRDC expressed the expectation that the Department would issue a standardfor television sets as long as at least one of the design options analyzedhas a favorable life cycle cost and meets the other impact criteria underwhich DOE is operating. (NRDC, No. 19, at 5).EIA submitted that television sets no longer use significant amounts ofenergy and are ``covered products'' because of historical data obtainedwhen tubes were used primarily in the circuits. (EIA, No. 21, at 2). EIAalso commented that television sets are not similar to any other coveredproduct. In addition, EIA claimed that standards could retard developmentof new television set designs. Specifically, EIA stated that standardswould cause manufacturers to reallocate funds presently being used to supportresearch on high-definition television (HDTV), research that is being coordinatedby the Federal Communications Commission. (EIA, No. 21, at 3).EIA and Thompson discussed the eight proposed design options.1. <T3>Remote control </T3>is seen as a consumer utility using five wattsor less. Statistics were provided showing that 68 percent of color setssold in 1987 included remote control (EIA, No. 21, at 4). It was also notedthat not all remote controls have the same features, thereby affectingpower requirements (Thompson, No. 4, at 6). Furthermore, EIA indicatedthat while manufacturers are moving toward use of more energy consumptiveremote control devices, such devices will result in a more efficient televisionset in the playing mode. EIA did not provide a specific example of howthis condition could occur. (EIA, No. 21, at 4).2. <T3>Electronic tuning </T3>is considered to have negligible power requirements.(EIA, No. 4, at 6).3. <T3>Automatic color control </T3>is described as a feature which does notuse energy and is a component of the picture stabilization system. (Thompson,No. 4, at 6; and EIA, No. 21, at 5).4. <T3>Vertical Internal Reference </T3>(VIR) is no longer in production accordingto these comments. (Thompson, No. 4, at 6; and EIA, No. 21, at 5).5. <T3>Brightness sensor </T3>is seen as an energy saver by EIA, while Thompsonpoints out that this device performs the same function available to theconsumer using the picture controls. Both comments agree that this deviceuses no power. (EIA, No. 21, at 5; and Thompson, No. 4, at 6).6. <T3>Voltage regulating power source </T3>contributes measurably to theenergy consumption of television sets depending on the type of power supply.(Thompson, No. 4, at 7). It was noted by EIA that transformers have becomeobsolete with the advent of solid-state voltage regulators. The abilityto increase the efficiency of the solid-state components shows little potential(EIA, No. 21, at 5).7. <T3>The cathode ray </T3>tube is seen by Thompson and EIA as the only efficientand reliable display device known for use in direct view sets. (Thompson,No. 4 at 7; and EIA, No. 21, at 5). The concept of Liquid Crystal Display(LCD) is functional in small sets but very restrictive and unreliable inlarger sets (EIA, No. 21, at 5).8. <T3>One-gun tube </T3>color television sets have been demonstrated as aprototype; however, its enormous cost and poor quality picture have placedserious limitations on its commercial feasibility, according to EIA. (EIA,No. 21, at 6).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efficiency Levels Analyzed</ITAG>Table 3.6 presents the efficiency levels selected for analysis for 1992.Alternate levels were selected to generate a range of impacts for analysis.The initial level selected, level 3, corresponds to the highest efficiencylevel, i.e., the ``max-tech'' level, identified in the engineering analysis.It was felt that manufacturers could produce products at this efficiency,and that these products would not have any reliability problems. Level2 corresponds to the minimum life-cycle cost point. Level 1 correspondsto efficiency lower than that of level 2. These levels were analyzed discretelyin the Engineering Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,xs36,xs45,r10</C><T4>Table </T4>3-6._Standard Levels Analyzed for Television Sets (<T4>kWh/yr.</T4>)<H1>Standard level</H1><H1>Standard</H1><H2>Monochrome</H2><H2>Color</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>NA </D><D>Standby power no greater than 2 W/h</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>47 </D><D>7.3 S + 38</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>45 </D><D>6.9 S + 42</D><F>S is screen size (diagonal) in inches.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Note that standard level 1 is not a performance standard. DOE's measuresof energy consumption by television sets are receiver energy efficiencyfactor and annual energy consumption, both annual energy use measures.Standby power deals with energy consumption of the unit for that periodwhen the unit is not in operation. Section 321(a)(6)(A) of the Act prescribesthat a performance standard ``prescribes a minimum level of energy efficiencyor a maximum quantity of energy use.'' DOE's analysis assumed that forlevel 1, the baseline unit was unchanged except for the standby power.However, a limitation on standby power does not necessarily have an effecton the energy efficiency or energy consumption as defined by DOE at andSection;430.22. While standby power may be limited, changes to the design of thetelevision set can result in more energy being consumed when the unit ison, thereby resulting in more total energy being used. <T3>Payback Period.</T3> Table 3-7 presents the payback period for theefficiency levels analyzed. For the color class, level 1 is the only energyconservation standard level in which the additional price of purchasinga product at this efficency level will be less than three times the valueof the energy savings the consumer will receive during the first year.No standard level for monochrome televisions pays back in less than 3 years.The payback period for units that meet level 1 efficiency is approximatelythree years for the color class. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,s25,10,10 </C><T4>Table </T4>3-7._<T4>Payback Periods</T4> (<T4>in Years</T4>)<T4> for Two Classes of Television Sets </T4><H1>Standard level </H1><H1>Payback periods </H1><H2>19andmin16;andmin16; to 20andmin16;andmin16; color </H2><H2>13andmin16;andmin16; to 14andmin16;andmin16; monochrome </H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>2.9 </D><D/><T4>na </T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>3.4 </D><D>4.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>3.7 </D><D>11.6 </D></ITAG></ITAG> By the year 2015 the weighted average energy consumption of new televisionsets sold in absence of standards is projected to decline nearly 20 percent,compared to new sets sold in 1987. <T3>Significance of Energy Savings.</T3> With energy conservation standardsimposed, the LBL-REM projects that over the period 1992-2015, the followingsavings would be attributable to standards:<ITAG tagnum="25">Level 1_.66 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 2_.69 Quads</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Level 3_.73 Quads</ITAG><T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.26. On the basis of theabove, DOE believes that the standards considered for television sets wouldresult in a significant conservation of energy.<T3>Economic Justification_</T3>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers.</T3> The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency ranges from $0.33for a 13-inch monochrome set to $2.15 for a 19-20 inch color set. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.29 and 3.30.The purchase price to the consumer increases $4.30 for the 19/20-inch colortelevision set. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 3.43.LBL-MIM projects that television standards would result in ROE essentiallyunchanged, compared to the base case of no-standards. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.27.The sensitivity analysis also indicates that the television set industry'sROE is relatively insensitive to standards. DOE believes this results fromthe proportion of manufacturing costs due to standards that can be passedon to consumers in the form of a higher price and a low consumer demandelasticity with respect to price and operating cost.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value.</T3> The LCC analysis indicatesthat for each possible standard level, except level 3, the increase inpurchase price would be offset by savings in operating expenses. However,the LCC analysis indicates that for color television sets, the savingsover the products' lifetimes would be slight and that for each standardlevel the savings are less than $5.00. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Figure 3.23. For 13 inch to 14inch black and white televisions, the LCC savings over the expected lifetimesof the products are even slighter, as each candidate standard level wouldsave less than $1.00. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Figure 3.24. This indicates thatthe standard level would not cause any economic burden on the average consumer.The NPV analysis indicates that if a standard were adopted at level 1,2, or 3, there would be a net present value of $1 billion from energy savingsover the period 1992-2015. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.29.C. <T3>Energy Savings.</T3> As indicated above, the maximum savings attributableto standards would be .73 Quads of electricity. This level would requirethe reduction of standby power and reduction of screen power, includinga more efficient screen display.D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products.</T3> As indicatedabove, DOE is required to establish classes of products in order to assurethat the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceof the regulated appliance. However, for television sets, the Departmentwas not able to establish classes to assure the utility of the product.Almost every feature present on a television set that provides utilityto the consumer, also affects the product's energy consumption. For example,remote control and stereo sound both provide utility to the consumer andaffect energy consumption. Therefore, separate classes would have to beestablished for each feature, as well as for those products that have bothfeatures and those without either feature, a total of four classes, inorder not to lessen the product's utility. However, because of the existenceof a number of different features that provide utility but for which DOEhas limited data on their energy consumption, the Department was not ableto set separate classes for each. In addition, because the electronicsindustry is changing so rapidly, DOE believes that it is likely that futureutility or performance would be lessened as a result of disincentives causedby standards to investments in energy-using new features.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening Competition. </T3>The determination of this factormust be made by the Attorney General. F. <T3>Need to Save Energy. </T3>Television sets use electricity as theirenergy source. Nearly one percent of the nation's electricity powers televisionsets, nearly 10 percent of that one percent would be saved by standardsfor this product at level 3. However, the sensitivity analysis on the LBL-REMindicates that if consumer awareness of, and concern with, appliance efficiencycontinues, the projected savings would be less than three percent of thatone percent. G. <T3>Other Factors. </T3>Television sets are presently not covered by theFederal Trade Commission (FTC) labeling program. Testing and certificationcould be an unusual burden on manufacturers of this product since testingand certification could result in delays in the rapid introduction of newtechnologies that characterize this industry. For example, a standard fortelevision sets, involving the diversion of research and development moniesto complying with the standard, could have an impact on the developmentof high resolution televisions, which is an effort that is presently beingsupported by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). <T3>Conclusion. </T3>After reviewing the effects that energy conservationstandards on television sets would have, the Department is proposing a``no-standard'' standard. The Department proposes that while energy conservationstandards for television sets would save a significant amount of energy,they are not economically justified. DOE believes standards for television sets would have insignificant impactson consumer life-cycle costs, and could harm manufacturers, especiallyin their ability to introduce new products, i.e., by diverting researchand development funds to complying with energy conservation standards.Any increase in cost to manufacturers due to efficiency testing and certificationreporting will reduce the already small LCC savings. Furthermore, the Departmentis concerned that standards could adversely impact the efforts to develophigh resolution televisions, adversely affecting the future utility ofthe products. For these costs, at standard level 3, the energy savings that the Nationwould experience is approximately three-fourths of a Quad over 24 years,i.e., 1992-2015, which would result in minimal LCC savings, i.e., lessthan $5.00. The individual consumer would save only about one percent ofhis expected life-cycle costs. Because of the relatively small impacts on energy consumption for televisionset consumer life-cycle costs, DOE believes that the manufacturer impactsdescribed above are the most noteworthy. Furthermore, because of limited available data on television sets, thestandards analysis was unable to account for the wide variety of televisionfeatures. Because of that, the Department believes that the establishmentof energy conservation standards on television sets would restrict theutility and performance of new products. Finally, as noted earlier, level 1 standard (standby power no greater than2 watts per hour) was rejected from consideration because it does not meeteither of the Department's two measures of television set energy consumption,namely, receiver energy efficiency factor and annual energy consumption.Standby power could be viewed as either a design standard or efficiencystandard for a component. DOE views section 321(a)(6) of the Act as prohibitingstandby power requirements for television sets. Weighing the anticipated benefits against the potential costs, the Departmentis proposing that energy conservation standards for television sets, ateach standard level considered, are not economically justified. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental, Regulatory Impact, Takings Assessment, Federalismand Regulatory Flexibility Reviews</ITAG>The Department has reviewed today's proposed action in accordance withthe Department's obligations under: andbullet; The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementingthe procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Part 1500 <T3>et seq</T3>.), and the Department's own NEPA regulations (10 CFR Part1021); andbullet; Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) which pertainsto agency review of the impact of Federal regulations; and andbullet; Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) which pertainsto agency consideration of Federal actions that interfere with constitutionallyprotected property rights. andbullet; Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) which pertainsto agency consideration of Federal actions that would have a substantialdirect effect on States, on the relationship between the National Governmentand the States, and on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. andbullet; The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>.) which requires, in part, that an agency prepare an initialregulatory flexibility analysis for any proposed rule unless it determinesthat the rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.'' In the event that such an analysis is not requiredfor a particular rule, the agency must publish a certification and explanationof that determination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.a. Environmental ReviewDOE prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the proposed standardspursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,Pub. L. 91-190, 40 U.S.C. 4221 <T3>et seq</T3>., and the implementing regulations of the Council on EnvironmentalQuality (40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1808). The EA addresses the possibleincremental environmental effects attributable to the application of theproposed standards to the design of three types of covered products: refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers, and freezers; small gas furnaces; and televisionsets. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The FONSI concludes that the proposed standardswould result in no significant environmental impacts and that an environmentalimpact statement is not required. The EA is part of the Technical Support Document and is available at theDOE Freedom of Information Reading Room at the address provided at thebeginning of this notice. b. Regulatory Impact ReviewExecutive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) directs that, inproposing a major rule,\19\<NOTE/> an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysispresents major alternatives to the regulation that could substantiallyachieve the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a descriptionof the costs and benefits (including potential net benefits) of the proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ ``Major rule'' means any regulation that is likely toresult in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.DOE has determined that this proposed rule is a ``major rule.'' Accordingly,a Draft Regulatory Impact Review has been prepared.The Regulatory Analysis is summarized below. This summary focuses on themajor alternatives considered in arriving at the proposed approach to improvingthe energy efficiency of consumer products. The reader is referred to thecomplete draft ``Regulatory Impact Analysis,'' which will be availablefor public comment as indicated at the beginning of this notice. It consistsof: (1) A statement of the problem addressed by this regulation, and themandate for government action; (2) a description and analysis of the feasiblepolicy alternatives to this regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison ofthe impacts of the alternatives; and (4) the economic impact of the proposedstandard.It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives for refrigeratorsand small gas furnaces that were examined saved as much energy as the proposedrule. Also, most of the alternatives would require that enabling legislationbe enacted, since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presentlyexist.Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy ConservationSix major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasiblepolicy alternatives for achieving consumer product energy efficiency. Thesealternatives include:andbullet; No New Regulatory Action.andbullet; Informational Action: _Product labeling. _Consumer education.andbullet; Prescriptive Standards.andbullet; Financial Incentives: _Tax credits. _Rebates.andbullet; Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets.andbullet; The Proposed Approach (Performance Standards).Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achievesignificant energy savings at reasonable costs, and has been compared tothe effectiveness of the proposed regulation.If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would beimplemented for refrigerators, small gas furnaces, or television sets.This is essentially the ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case,between the years 1992 and 2015 there would be expected energy use of 46.94Quads of primary energy, with no energy savings and a zero net presentvalue.Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the headingof informational action. They include consumer product labeling and DOE'spublic education and information program. Both of these alternatives aremandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to estimate theenergy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To model thispossibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates would belowered by five percent for refrigerators and by two percent for purchasersof small gas furnaces. This resulted in no energy savings, with expectedconsumption equal to that of the base case.Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certaindesign options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. Forrefrigerators, this involved assuming a 1.5 inch foam door and 5.0 EERcompressor, and, for small gas furnaces, a power burner. This resultedin energy consumption, between 1992 and 2015, of 43.14 Quads, and savingsof 3.8 Quads. The net present value, in 1987 dollars, was $8.52 billion.Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included taxcredits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers.The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increasedcost of higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while therebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices.The tax credits to consumers showed almost no change from the base case,i.e., this alternative would save less than .01 Quad with a net presentvalue of $20 million. Consumer rebates however, would save .04 Quad witha net present value of $210 million.The consumer rebate program and the tax credit program would return tothe participating consumer exactly the same amount of money. However, itis expected that there will be more participants in the rebate program.Therefore, the rebate program would result in substantially more energysavings than the tax credit program would.The most important difference to the consumer between rebate and tax creditprograms is that a rebate can be obtained quickly, whereas a tax creditis delayed until income taxes are filed or a tax refund is provided bythe Internal Revenue Service. This means that middle and low income purchasers,who generally have little ready cash to purchase more expensive products,are not so likely to take advantage of the program as are upper incomepurchasers. To simulate this impact, DOE has assumed that only 60 percentof consumers would purchase more energy efficient products as a resultof the tax credit program.Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to manufacturersfor the production of energy-efficient refrigerators and small gas furnaces.In this scenario, an investment tax credit (ITC) of 20 percent was assumed.The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect, since the energyconsumption estimates are 46.93 Quads with savings equal to .01 Quad, anda net present value equal to zero.The impact of this scenario is so small because the ITC was applicableonly to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms, i.e., the firms'fixed costs, and most of the design improvements that would likely be adoptedto manufacture more efficient refrigerator and small gas furnaces wouldinvolve purchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligiblefor an ITC.Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined; inthe first one, the proposed energy conservation standards were assumedto be voluntarily adopted by all the relevant manufacturers in five years,and, in the second scenario, the proposed standards were assumed to beadopted in 10 years. In these scenarios, the five year delay would resultin energy consumption by these appliances of 43.01 Quads, energy savingsof 3.93 Quads, and a net present value of $8.41 billion; the 10 year delaywould result in 44.75 Quads of energy being consumed, 2.19 Quads beingsaved, and a net present value of $5.47 billion.These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoptionof the energy conservation standards by the refrigerator and small gasfurnace manufacturers, an assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance.Lastly, all of these alternatives must be gauged against the performancestandards that are being proposed in this notice. Such performance standardswould result in energy consumption of refrigerators, small gas furnaces,and television sets to total an estimated 41.01 Quads of primary energyover the 1992-2015 time period. Savings would be 5.93 Quads, and the netpresent value would be an expected $12.23 billion.As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives thatwere considered for refrigerators and small gas furnaces would save asmuch energy as the proposed rule.c. ``Takings'' Assessment ReviewExecutive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in proposinga regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review isintended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help suchagencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate.For purposes of the Order: <ITAG tagnum="21">``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations,proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments onproposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that,if implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulationsthat propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition requirementsor limitations on private property use, or that require dedications orexactions from owners of private property.</ITAG>It appears that there are three parts of the appliance standards programthat could conceivably be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' Theseare testing and certification requirements, the impacts of standard levels,and possible DOE testing of products for validation.With regard to the first part, namely, testing and certification, the Departmentbelieves that such a requirement, implementing a long-established statutorymandate in a manner calculated to minimize adverse economic impacts doesnot constitute a ``taking'' of private property.Similarly, the Department's possible validation testing does not constitutea ``taking,'' within the limitations described above.Lastly, the impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.''Nevertheless, the Department believes that the fact that while an energyconservation standard may limit some manufacturers in the range of applianceefficiencies that they can produce, such narrowing of the energy efficiencyrange does not constitute a ``taking'' in the sense described above.In short, in none of the three parts of the appliance standards programdoes the Department believe that the provisions of E.O.12630 pertain.d. Federalism ReviewExecutive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulationsor rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on therelationship between the National Government and the States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in alldecisions involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.DOE has identified a substantial direct effect that today's regulation,when finalized, would have on State governments. It would initially preemptinconsistent State regulations. However, DOE has concluded that the initiallypreemptive effect is not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalismassessment for two reasons. First, DOE does not have discretion under theAct to avoid promulgating a preemptive regulation because of a policy preferencefor State regulation as a general matter. Second, the Act provides forsubsequent State petitions for exemption which necessarily means that thedetermination as to whether a State law prevails must be made on a case-by-casebasis using criteria set forth in the Act. When DOE receives such a petition,it will be appropriate to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistentwith the criteria in the Act.e. Regulatory Flexibility ReviewThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354) requires an assessmentof the impact of proposed regulations on small businesses. Small businessesare defined as those firms within an industry that are privately ownedand less dominant in the market.In this rulemaking, three different products and, hence, industries, arebeing addressed. Regulatory flexibility for the television set industry,however, does not need to be considered since this notice is proposingno energy conservation standards on those manufacturers. Regulatory flexibilityissues will be addressed for the two industries for which standards arebeing proposed.First, the energy conservation standard of 78 percent AFUE on those smallgas furnace manufacturers, who could be considered small businesses, willbe discussed. There is no indication that the impact of standards willbe directly related to firm size. Although different size firms have differentcost structures, industry sources indicate that, overall, neither largenor small firms have a cost advantage and that neither large nor smallfirms tend to have a higher proportion of fixed cost. A corollary to thisobservation is that profits are also not correlated to firm size. Somelarge firms are quite profitable, others earn normal profits, while othersare marginally profitable, and the same is true for smaller firms.The Engineering Analysis indicates that the measures necessary to meetthe standards levels under consideration involve using additional purchasedparts. While larger firms may have some slight cost advantage from buyingin larger quantities, the fact that the design options predominantly involvepurchased parts tends to be an equalizing factor among different-sizedfirms.Therefore, the fact that this energy conservation standard on small gasfurnaces is not likely to ``have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities'' suggests that the provisions of section 605(b)of the Regulatory Flexibility Act pertain. These provisions state thatneither an initial nor a final regulatory flexibility analysis need beperformed for a proposed or final rule ``if the head of the agency certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.''Secondly, the proposed energy conservation standards on refrigerator manufacturersneeds to be addressed. It is not at all clear that the standard levelsbeing proposed will ``have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small firms.'' The LBL-MIM indicates through its predictionsof an increase in typical ROE that standards are likely to slow down theconsolidation process temporarily. This would lead to a temporary slowingdown of the continuing decrease in this industry's competitiveness. Howeverthis prediction would be tempered by the observation that if standardswere technologically difficult to meet they could hurt some smaller firmsthe most, since smaller firms tend to have less sophisticated researchand development capabilities. This should not be a serious considerationfor regulatory flexibility since the proposed standard levels on refrigeratorswill not be technologically difficult to meet.Of the eight small refrigerator firms reviewed for this analysis, threemake custom refrigerators, three make compact units (largely for mobilehomes and recreational vehicles), and two make 3-in-1 units with rangetops and sinks.The analysis of combined-unit manufacturers is straightforward. Three-in-oneunits are not covered by the present standards, so these manufacturerswill not be affected.The custom refrigerator manufacturers seem to be fairly well protectedfor two reasons; they are not exposed to either direct foreign competitionor direct competition from major domestic firms, and because they producecustom units they have a greater ability to make design changes comparedto a large manufacturer. These two facts indicate that standards will probablynot hurt the custom manufacturer's control of its market; however, itsmarket may shrink due to price increases. This cannot be estimated withoutengineering data and an estimate of the elasticity of demand in this market.One thing must be remembered when analyzing this problem: standards willincrease the price of standard refrigerators and this will offset (partlyor more than completely) the impact of the price increase of custom refrigerators.The three small manufacturers of compact refrigerators are probably atthe greatest risk, both without standards and from standards. They facestiff foreign competition from large foreign manufacturers. Some anecdotalevidence indicates that part of their current competitive strategy is touse cheaper, less efficient compressors than their foreign competition.Depending on the level of standards, this option could be foreclosed, forcingthem to buy compressors at a higher price than that paid by their largercompetitors who either buy in volume or in some cases manufacture theirown. Still, it would seem that these small manufacturers must have someadvantages from the niche they occupy or they would have already succumbedto their competition. These advantages would need to be accounted for beforea firm conclusion could be drawn.Now consider the truly small firms_those that cater to very specializedniche markets. There are only about a dozen of these and they tend to bevery small compared with the major firms. Because of this, they have littletime to cooperate with data collection efforts and consequently relativelylittle is know about them. Specifically, engineering cost data is not separatelyavailable for small firms nor are demand elasticities available. Smallfirms are generally not members of AHAM. Consequently, most were not includedin information provided by AHAM concerning the Department's analysis and,of the ones that were, only one was included. Because of this no financialdata specific to small firms are available.The foregoing discussion suggests that only three of the eight small manufacturerson whom the effects of standards were evaluated, would possibly sufferfrom the proposed standards on refrigerators. The Department believes thatin this industry, too, the provisions of section 605(b) are applicable,since there is no certainty that the proposed rule will ``have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
