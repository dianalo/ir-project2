Otis expects to sign a contract &quot;in a few months,&quot; a spokesman for the unit said. He added that about one-fourth of the contract's value represents civil engineering work, which Otis won't handle.    The shuttle will be built by Nippon-Otis, a joint venture of Otis, which owns 55%; Sumitomo Bank, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The project will take about 1 1/2 years to complete.    In 1987, Otis posted about $2.5 billion of United Technologies' $17.17 billion in revenue. United, of Hartford, Conn., makes jet engines, helicopters, elevators and defense and industrial products. </TEXT></DOC>
