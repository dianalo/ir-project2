Announcement of the auctions was postponed from late July because of Congress's delay in raising the federal debt limit.    The auctions will bring the Treasury's net market borrowing in this quarter to $23.6 billion. The Treasury projects its total market borrowing for the quarter at $27.4 billion, assuming a $40 billion cash balance Sept. 30.    The Treasury said it plans to meet the remaining $3.8 billion financing needed for the quarter through its regular weekly and monthly bill auctions, and a sale of two-year notes with a settlement date of Aug. 31, five-year notes for settlement early in September and two-year and four-year notes with a settlement date of Sept. 30.    The issues in this week's offering are:    --$9.75 billion of three-year notes due Aug. 15, 1990, to be sold today.    --$9.25 billion of 10-year notes due Aug. 15, 1997, to be sold tomorrow.    --$9 billion of 30-year bonds due Aug. 15, 2017, to be sold Thursday.    The Treasury said it currently estimates its net borrowing need for the fourth quarter at $45 billion to $50 billion, assuming a $15 billion cash balance Dec. 31. The balance was $40.072 billion June 30.    All three securities will be issued Monday. The three-year notes will be dated Aug. 17. The 10-year notes and the bonds will be dated Aug. 15. Bids must be received by 1 p.m. EDT on the date of the auction at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches. The three-year notes will be sold in minimum denominations of $5,000. The 10-year notes and the bonds will be sold in minimum denominations of $1,000.    Interest and principal payments on the longer-term notes and the bonds may be traded separately under the Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities program, known as Strips. </TEXT></DOC>
