I've gotthe biggest and fastest hard drive around, and my monitorwould put NASA's to shame. In short, I'm a power user, andproud of it.   But I'm not a supreme nerd out of hubris. I believe thatcomputers are going to change the face of American businessin the 21st century, and I plan to be there. In the century,that is. And, hopefully, in business, too.</LP><TEXT>   But one thing rankles: If we are going to transform theworkplace substantially, it is pretty clear that the softwarewe have at our disposal will have to be rethought. What wehave so far just isn't up to the task.   Fortunately, word has just reached my busy electronicmailbox of a host of software notions now in development.Together, they could fulfill business's needs to exploit whatmay be the most important tool for enterprise since theinvention of credit. Following are a few early indications ofsoftware that will be developed if the computer industry isserious about serving its most serious customers -- us:                                                                                                          OUTTAHERE                                                                                                          This is a unique piece of merchandise: a cellular wristpager, operated from your host computer, to aid in the escapefrom unwanted meetings. Just load Outtahere into your desk orlaptop, set it for the moment you would like to be &quot;calledaway,&quot; and sure enough, at that hour your wrist will give offa squeal that would shame a pig giving birth. No one woulddoubt the need for your immediate exit, not with that racket.A must for CEOs]                                                                                                          VERBOSE                                                                                                          This new word-processor package from a group of Whartondropouts is tailor-made for the corporate client. In itsbasic format, it functions much as any word-processorprogram. But punch the Control-T keys and the package whipsinto Turbodrive, adding needless expressions and pompousterminology until the outcome suits the level of grandiositynecessary in your company. (Select Level One forentrepreneurial firms, Level Five for multinationalconglomerates.)   Just type the sentence, We'll get back to you on thatafter further study, press the Turbo combo, and, like magic,this automatically appears: Pursuant to subsequent detaileddeliberation and inquiry, we will report back to pertinentbodies in your organization with final assessment ofpotential action. No serious corporate communicator will wantto be without this.                                                                                                          DO LUNCH]                                                                                                          Sometimes it's the small duties performed by ourelectronic friends that mean the most. This package is thequintessential meal-management program for executives whodon't have time to think about it. Simply enter your friendsand associates, their income levels, titles, dietary habitsand, most important, what you hope they can do for you, andDo Lunch] spits out your optimal meal schedule for thequarter. &quot;We do it all but eat for you]&quot; says the motto onthe front of the box. And they do, too.

Enter this program, the thought-shapingpackage for the '90s.   Dereg-It provides interest groups with the draft lettersand data bases necessary to forge a highly visible andaggressive lobbying effort. Just fill in the space marked&quot;Your Essential National Business Here&quot; and letters,postcards and position papers flow forth like debt fromArgentina. It blankets congressmen with computerized pitches,unwanted faxes and unsolicited voice mail, and recommends,based on statistical probabilities, which ones are mostlikely to accept help with their personal-banking needs.                                                                                                          OPTIMIST                                                                                                          This numbers massager and spreadsheet-design package isperfect for businesses dealing with the challenges ofoperating in the 1990s. Connected by dynamic data linkagewith its sister program, Flack Graphics, this program canmake anybody's financial results look taut and frisky. Forinstance, this typical financial picture: (see accompanyingillustration -- WSJ May 20, 1991) is immediately transformedinto this, with Optimist and Flack Graphics at the helm: (seeaccompanying illustration -- WSJ May 20, 1991).                                                                                                          WHATSIS?                                                                                                          Computers tell us what we have already told them to tellus. It's a rare program that can actually bend the truth toserve our purposes. That's why this little number -- alsoknown as &quot;computer-aided disinformation&quot; -- is so valuablefor government officials, corporate executives and anybodyelse who finds the truth sometimes hard to swallow, let alonespit out. In simple, clear language, the user can construct avirtual reality that will appeal to whatever audience he orshe has in mind. The program comes in a brown paper bag.                                                                                                          CUT THAT OUT FOR WINDOWS]                                                                                                          This product is a necessity for all those who havediscovered the games that come with Microsoft Windows 3.0.Once installed on a hard disk, Cut That Out]'s goofing-offsurveillance feature monitors your game playing and, when itbecomes excessive (your boss sets the level of corporatetolerance here), a small but slightly debilitating electricshock is sent to your keyboard. You will recover in less thanfive minutes, but your tendency to play stupid games forself-destructive amounts of time will dramatically abate. Asimilar feature can be hooked up to your color menus,forbidding you from spending hours tinkering with the hue anddesign of your background &quot;wallpaper.&quot;                                                                                                          -- Other items on the agenda, though even further fromcommercial release, are: Draw and Quarter, anemployee-dismemberment and excision package from DynamicExecutive Solutions, the idea people; The Video Broaster withoptional microwave, which produces 256 colors at very highresolution and cooks a nice little snack in no time at all;BrainPlus, the personal RAM that can be implanted directlyinto the soft tissue just south of your hairline; andFriendmaker, which helps the shy or socially inept, plan andexecute human relationships as never before.   These are just the tip of the iceberg. The computerindustry is always hard at work thinking of new ways themachine can think for you, plan for you, wash up after you,and dance at your wedding. It's up to us to take advantage ofthat. So grab that mouse by the tail and get to work]   ---   Gil Schwartz is a writer and business executive in NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
