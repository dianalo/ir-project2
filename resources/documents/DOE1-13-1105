In collecting theheat at a constant load temperature, the hybrid system is most effectivelyoperated at a temperature between the optimum temperatures of both collectorsseparately operated. The effect is increased as the cost of parabolictrough type becomes higher than that of the plate type. The energy costis possible to be reduced by 50% at the largest. In the hybrid systemoperated at the optimum constant temperature depending upon the compositionratio of both collectors, the energy cost can be reduced only by 10%or less because the collector temperature can be freely set. In the hybridcollector requiring backup heat source, the efficiency of the hybridcollector system is considerably low. (3 refs, 6 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
