In blunt, salty language, Mr. Regan portrayed a White House in confusion as the operation unraveled last November and the diversion of arms sales profits to Nicaraguan insurgents was discovered. The late Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey was reluctant to make the diversion public even then, said Mr. Regan, who described being called urgently to CIA headquarters within hours of meeting with President Reagan on the matter Nov. 24.    &quot;You're gonna blow the whole Iranian thing and possibly blow the lives of these hostages,'&quot; Mr. Regan recalled Mr. Casey telling him. &quot;I said, 'Be that as it may, how . . . can we sit on this stuff for any longer? I mean the whole thing is an absolute disgrace that we haven't put it out yet.'&quot;    Like the testimony of Secretary of State George Shultz last week, Mr. Regan's account -- accompanied by the release of confidential White House notes -- offers a rare inside portrait of the administration and the White House where he served as chief of staff for two years. His testimony backs up the president's account of the diversion, but no proponent of the arms sales has been so graphic in condemning the results.    Appearing before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Regan admitted he had been drawn in himself by the goal of freeing the hostages but insisted he was uninformed of major elements in the operation.    As the scandal began unfolding last fall, he said he warned the president that something was &quot;screwy,&quot; but pressure from former National Security Adviser John Poindexter played on Mr. Reagan's emotional concern for the Americans held captive in Lebanon.    Discovery of the diversion broke &quot;the dam&quot; Mr. Regan said, but to the end, the admiral never admitted in his conversations with the chief of staff or the president that he had authorized the secret transfer of funds.    Mr. Regan himself resigned in March as a result of the controversy. Even as Mr. Casey seemed to be subtly pressuring to keep the diversion quiet, the president's wife Nancy was on the phone with the chief of staff demanding personnel changes.    &quot;There would have to be a housecleaning of people that had let Ronnie down,&quot; Mr. Regan told the committees in a deposition read aloud yesterday. &quot;I seemed to have the impression that mine was one of the heads that would have to roll.&quot;    A veteran of the Marines and Wall Street, the former chairman of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. laced his remarks with references to both theaters. &quot;I fought a different war,&quot; he said, attempting to distance himself from the modern weapons sold to Iran, and he used market shorthand to describe deals that he mistakenly thought were to be &quot;NPH . . . No Profit Here.&quot;    His relaxed manner, which was in striking contrast with his stern image at the White House, disguised the evident embarrassment as he portrayed himself as knowing little of the policy around him. A 1985 finding authorizing the CIA's role in an early shipment of arms to Tehran through Israel was signed without the chief of staff's knowing it. Mr. Regan also said he had unwittingly assisted a scheme by conservative activists to use the White House to raise money to buy arms for the Nicaraguan insurgents.    &quot;That's a real embarrassment,&quot; Mr. Regan said of disclosures that a former presidential aide, David Fischer, was paid a retainer to arrange meetings between contributors and the president, including a January 1986 session that the chief of staff endorsed.    From among the estimated 20 people attending the meeting, committee investigators have identified approximately $4.5 million in contributions over the next six months, including $1.9 million that was funneled through a Cayman Islands corporation to the Nicaraguan insurgents and a covert arms network overseen from the National Security Council staff.    Mr. Fischer is estimated to have received $292,400 from a Washington public relations firm that served as a main conduit for the funds. A friend and second former White House aide, Martin Artiano, received $305,000, according to the same record.    Mr. Regan said Adm. Poindexter and his predecessor, Robert McFarlane, had direct access to the president. And though included in security council meetings, the chief of staff said he didn't have access to all of the NSC documents passed to Mr. Reagan and never saw a complete organizational chart or budget for the staff.    His proximity to the Oval Office made him a witness to the president's reaction to crucial events, but Mr. Regan's testimony indicates the president didn't tell his chief of key decisions, much as he appears to have done with Mr. Shultz.    Mr. Regan said the president was surprised and &quot;distressed&quot; to learn of the diversion Nov. 24. A day after, however, notes released by the committees appear to show the president making a qualified defense of those who carried out the operation.    On questions involving Israel, Mr. McFarlane has testified that arms sales to Iran through Israel in 1985 were done with the president's approval. But Mr. Regan said yesterday that the president was &quot;quite upset later that his hand was being forced&quot; by the Jerusalem government.    The same tensions with Israel surface in notes Mr. Regan took of a White House meeting last Nov. 10 as the president's top advisers and cabinet sought to deal with the building controversy. Mr. Shultz is described as saying that Israel &quot;suckered&quot; the U.S. into the deals &quot;so we can't complain of their sales,&quot; the notes read. Next to Vice President George Bush's name is a notation: &quot;Israel may try to squeeze us.&quot;    Mr. Regan shifted his own position on the arms sales at a critical juncture -- opposing the policy in December 1985 but then supporting a plan to go forward in January 1986. According to his testimony, this shift was owing to Adm. Poindexter's optimism that a better channel could be opened to Iran. But in fact, few of the players had changed, and critics say Mr. Regan simply was reluctant to oppose his president.    In May 1986, Mr. Regan said, he was alarmed when Mr. Shultz informed him of a report that British financier Roland 'Tiny' Rowland was linked to middlemen dealing with the U.S. His response, however, wasn't to go to Mr. Reagan but instead to urge the secretary to take it up with Adm. Poindexter. Mr. Regan also admitted that despite deep misgivings in the summer of 1986, he offered no opposition to release further weapons promised to the Iranians after the freeing of an American hostage.    &quot;I think people were upset, very disgusted with what was going on,&quot; he said. &quot;The bait was still there, though, that we could save a life here, a life there. . . . That was the bait to get arms.&quot;    Though he regularly attended morning briefings of the president by the NSC, Mr. Regan's testimony indicates little follow-up on important issues. &quot;He will do anything he can to drive that government out of there,&quot; Mr. Regan said of the president's opposition to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, and Mr. Casey, in letters sometimes signed &quot;God save America,&quot; lobbied the chief of staff on the issue as well.    Yet Mr. Regan testified that he made &quot;no inquiries&quot; as to how the Nicaraguan insurgents were sustaining themselves during a two-year ban on U.S. military aid, even though briefing notes show the president last year was being given a running account of the supplies available to the rebels. The arms-sales initiative wasn't &quot;very high on the screen&quot; as well, he testified, and no procedure was established to review it despite a record of being &quot;snookered&quot; and his characterization of it as the &quot;rug merchant type of stuff.&quot;    When the sales became public last November, Mr. Regan said he sought to reassert himself, and his suspicions increased when Adm. Poindexter sought to take back a chronology of events prepared by the NSC.    Prior testimony has established that these chronologies went through numerous revisions as aides sought to disguise the U.S. involvement. Mr. Regan also said that Adm. Poindexter's oblique guidance during a briefing session &quot;confused the presidential mind&quot; and generally represented a &quot;grave disservice&quot; to President Reagan as he went before the nation and press. </TEXT></DOC>
