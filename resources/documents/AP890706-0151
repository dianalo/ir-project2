But the loser said a low voter turnout reflects apathy toward thegovernment.   ``We have given ZANU (PF) a big fright. The low poll shows ZANU(PF) has no support. People are disenchanted,'' businessman FibionMutikori, candidate of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, told reportersafter results were announced.   Herbert Ushewokunze, election director for Mugabe's ZimbabweAfrican National Union (Patriotic Front), said his party's victory``was a vote against disunity and destabilization.''   Harare city councilor Ephraim Masawi, 39, polled 7,254 votesagainst 3,125 for Mutikori in Dzivaresekwa, a sprawling constituencystretching east from suburban Harare to peasant and commercialfarmlands.   There were 500 spoiled ballots.   Only 16 percent of the 64,000 registered voters took part in theTuesday and Wednesday poll, compared to 80 percent at the lastelections in 1985, election officials said.   Mutikori, 34, described the results as an encouraging test forthe Zimbabwe Unity Movement, which fought its first election on ananti-corruption ticket.   The new party wants to keep this southern African nation amultiparty democracy. Mugabe says he will make it a one-party state.   ``We are only 67 days old. We have not been allowed to campaignbut we still captured 28 percent of the vote,'' Mutikori said.   In the 1985 elections, Mugabe's party polled more than 90 percentof votes in Dzivaresekwa.   The Zimbabwe Unity Movement was formed on April 30 by renegadepolitician Edgar Tekere, the former secretary-general of Mugabe'sparty who was No. 3 in the governing party hierarchy.   Tekere has accused the government of intimidating his partyofficials and cites the arrests of several party workers forsuspected subversion as evidence of state interference in theelection.   In May, Tekere said police invoked public order laws to ban apolitical rally in Harare, the capital.   On June 11, the new party canceled a second rally when it founditself locked out of a stadium where the meeting was to take place.   Tekere, 52, was fired last October from the party he helped foundafter he denounced official corruption and criticized Mugabe's aimto establish a one-party state.   This week's by-election was to fill a seat in the 100-memberHouse of Assembly held by the late Maurice Nyagumbo, a seniorCabinet minister who committed suicide after he was named in ajudicial inquiry investigating corruption.   Four other ministers resigned their seats after it was found theyused their influence to buy cars from a state-assembly plant andresold them at inflated prices.   New cars are in short supply in Zimbabwe and can fetch up to fourtimes the price fixed by the state.   Mugabe's party last year merged with the main opposition party,Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (Patriotic Front),giving the new combined ruling party all but one of the seats in theNational Assembly. The lone opponent is a member of the exiled Rev.Ndabaningi Sithole's Zimbabwe African National Union.</TEXT></DOC>
