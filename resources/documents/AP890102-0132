The ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday in Amatique Bay,said Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, second-in-command at the PuertoBarrios naval base.   He said the 22-year-old captain, Juan Pablo Ezquibel, wasarrested after authorities determined that 120 people were aboardthe 30-ton ferry, although the manifest listed 40.   The vessel was authorized to carry 90 people, he reported.   Navy divers found no bodies inside the wreck, he said.   Giron Arreola said the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-milerun across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios, and sank aftera naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.   Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios,said authorities who interviewed survivors believe the crew failedto take adequate precautions while preparing to be towed.   Giron Arreola said passengers ran to one side of the ferry whileit was under tow and the ferry sank.   The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City said a 40-year-oldSpaniard, Vicente Daudi, was among the dead. It said his wife, RosaMaria Arnal, and a son survived, but two daughters were missing.   Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economicdevelopment mission in Guatemala, the embassy said.   A morgue official said 13 bodies were identified. Aside fromDaudi, the nationalities of victims were not known.   Navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and other private craftsearched for the missing Monday.
