There I goviolating Dickens's look and feel again.andP;  Rather than continue to flirt withthe law, let's get right to COMPUTER LANGUAGE'S Best and Worst List for 1990.andM;Best software we thought we'd hate: Asymetrix's Toolbook.andP;  Toolbook waspresented as a Hypercard for the PC.andP;  The run-time version that comes withWindows quickly became shelfware and we didn't bother taking a good look atthe software until mid-fall ...andP;  at which time our jaws fell.andP;  Toolbook has agoodly number of problems: it's irritatingly slow on anything less than a2OMHZ 80386, the script editor is hideous, and the syntax can befrustratingly obtuse.andP;  But its ability to create Windows -and (recentlyannounced) Presentation Manager-front ends is unmatched, and you can easilycall dynamic link libraries for back-end speed and functionality.andP;  WithToolbook and Raima Corp.'s db-Vista Ill DLL, I've been able to port myaddress database into Windows with no apparent performance hit once thesystem has gone through its admittedly lengthy initialization (since I caniconize the system, this is often avoided).andP;  If Asymetrix chooses to producea version of Toolbook with more programmer-oriented features  I'd like strongtyping or at least enforced declaration of variables, more control over thepage size, better memory management, and some equivalents to indispensabletools such as grep, xref, and pretty-printers), I can imagine it being theonly tool you'd need for GUI front ends.andM;Jake Geller's Spellcode.andP;  Who would think you'd need a spell-checker for yourcode? We didn't, but Spellcode has made believers out of us.andP;  Not only docsthis spell-checker understand C, BASLC, Pascal, DBASE, and a slew of otherlanguages, it's a very fast, very good spell-checker for text files.andP;  Don'twrite a help screen without it.andM;Set Laboratories' PC-metric.andP;  Software metrics have always struck us as toolsfor managers, not programmers; a blunt tool for producing meaningless piecharts of relative productivity and for justifying smaller pay raises.andP;  ButSet Laboratories has produced a tool that, while undoubtedly valuable tomanagers, produces output Programmers can actually appreciate: estimateddevelopment hours, purity ratios, cyclomatic complexity.andP;  If you can trainyourself to think of these numbers as just as important a reflection of yourprogramming ability as code size and execution speed, you may find yourmaintenance hacking introduces far fewer ripples throughout your application.andO;Worst software we thought we'd love: Programmer's Workbench from Microsoft.andO;Great concept.andP;  Great tools.andP;  Great compiler at the back end.andP;  Unfortunately,the PWB that shipped with Microsoft C v. 6.0 was a hog.andP;  It seemed like daysbetween the command line disappearing and the environment showing up.andO;Shelling out to DOS was torture.andP;  We heard stories of developers rebootingtheir ATs, thinking they were hung.andP;  Despite recent upgrades to the PWB fromMicrosoft, developers are &quot;once burned, twice shy,&quot; and the acceptance ofMicrosoft's new C compiler has definitely suffered because of its associationwith the PWB.andM;Best computer-related book for nonprogrammers: The Cuckoo's Egg by CliffStoll.andP;  If you haven't already read this surprise bestseller about a Berkeleysystem administrator who tracked down a German-based cracker on the basis ofa 75-cent accounting discrepancy, rush out and buy the paperback.andP;  Not onlydo you get a fascinating spy story and sobering data on computer security (orlack thereof), you get a recipe for fantastic chocolate-chip cookies.andP;  Novadid an episode on the story, but the book is excellent.andM;Best book on software development: Object-Oriented Design with Applicationsby Grady Booch (Benjamin-Cummings).andP;  Clear, filled with examples, andcomplete, this book's greatest asset is its third section, which has casehistories of five applications written in five different languages(Smalltalk, C++, Common LISP, Ada, and Object Pascal).andP;  It's absolutelyfascinating reading.andM;Worst book on software development: My First Book about BASIC by Luca Novelli(Microsoft Press).andP;  Although Bill does learn early on that &quot;it's no usegetting mad at your computer,&quot; Wendy and Field the Dog's programs are filledwith GOTOs.andM;Best not-so-new language suddenly blossoming: C++.andP;  Is anyone still doubtingthat C++ is going to dominate the hybrid object-oriented language field? TheANSI committee, Borland's popular Turbo C++, Zortech's aggressive portingstrategy, and the proliferation of translators and compilers for practicallyany platform have meant a year that must have been very gratifying for BjarneStroustrup, C++ seems destined to make a strong bid at systems-levelprogramming language of choice for the 1990s.andP;  Skeptics expect a strongbacklash when minimally trained programmers use all those rope objects tohang themselves.andM;Best not-so-new language withering on the vine: Modula-2.andP;  You can't sayenough about Modula-2.andP;  At least, you can't say enough about it to convincepeople to use it.andP;  Despite fantastic compilers, friendly environments, and atleast as many support libraries as C++ can boast, Modula-2 can't seem tobreak into the big leagues of professional programming.andP;  Sure, you hearlarge-scale Modula-2 success stories, but for whatever reason, Modula-2 hasnever caught the eye of the programming community.andP;  Maybe Modula-3, with itsobject capabilities, will get the well-deserved attention this languagefamily deserves.andM;Green Award for environmental concern: The people at PC Connection in Marlow,N.H.andP;  PC Connection has printed its latest bulk-mailed catalog on mostlyrecycled paper and devoted a few pages to explaining some corporate recyclingand waste-reduction strategies.andP;  Although recycled paper is still notappropriate for a magazine with the production requirements of COMPUTERLANGUAGE, we'd also like to be a little self-congratulatory about MillerFreeman Publications' own corporate recycling, waste reduction, and communityoutreach programs.andP;  Who says high-tech people necessarily lose touch withbasic values?andM;- Larry O'BrienandM;- Editor</TEXT></DOC>
