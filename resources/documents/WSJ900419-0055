LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp., buffeted by lowerearnings in nearly all of its businesses, said operatingresults for the first quarter fell 17.5%, but a $61.5 millionwindfall boosted net income by 64%.   The gain, which came from the settlement of an antitrustlawsuit with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., lifted netincome to $123.7 million, or $2.97 a share. A year earlier,the company earned $75.4 million, or $1.81 a share. Revenuerose 5% to $2.49 billion from $2.36 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp.'s firstquarter net income soared to $96 million, or $2.04 a share,from $9.7 million, or 21 cents a share. Earnings for thelatest period included $67.1 million from the sale ofNorthrop's corporate headquarters complex.   Northrop's operating earnings also increased sharply,rising threefold as the company recovered from a year-agowritedown in its electronics segment. Sales were flat at$1.28 billion.   In some ways, though, the tales of these two arms makersshowed how misleading quarterly figures can be in trying topredict the future. Northrop, for example, turned in arelatively impressive operating performance in part becauseof stepped up production on the B-2 Stealth bomber. But thatprograms seems, over the long term, to be in a particularlyprecarious position with Washington budget-cutters.   By contrast, General Dynamics is incurring squeezed profitmargins at its F-16 fighter factory because it is &quot;staggeringunder the work load&quot; of trying to churn out several versionsof the plane simultaneously, James Cunnane, chief financialofficer, said in an interview here. He added that &quot;there isconstant pressure&quot; also being applied to meet schedules ontwo other aircraft programs, the A-12 for the Navy and theAdvanced Tactical Fighter for the Air Force.   At the same time, Mr. Cunnane pointed out, GeneralDynamics is spending development dollars on the Atlas rocket,but it won't begin to record income on the program until thefirst launch, which is set for the third quarter.   &quot;We're suffering from the inefficiencies of expansion,&quot; hesaid. &quot;I expect that we're going to be in this mode for awhile.&quot;   Northrop's real estate sale also helped it reduce debt to$881 million from $1.12 billion at the end of 1989. Thebalance of its after-tax gain, $22.8 million, will bedeferred and amortized into income over the 10-year lease ofthe space in the building Northrop now occupies.   Operating margins in this year's first quarter includedthe recognition of $10.7 million in pension income, ascompared with $3.2 million in pension costs a year before.   Profits in the aircraft group at Northrop slumped to $56.8million from $79.3 million, which was in step with a declinein F/A-18 fighter sales to prime contractor McDonnell DouglasCorp. and 747 component sales to Boeing Co. Earnings on theelectronics side improved, however, to $8.4 million from a$13.7 million loss last year when the company made a $26million provision in connection with research expenses on asystem for the F-15 fighter.   The biggest winner at General Dynamics was its Cessnaunit, which manufactures small planes. Earnings there leapedto $16.5 million from $4.3 million.   But, in the current environment, it would be incorrect todescribe any defense contractor as being in enviable shape.&quot;General Dynamics is just a microcosm of the defense budget,&quot;said George Shapiro, aerospace analyst at Salomon BrothersInc. &quot;They're going to feel a steady deterioration in theirprofit margins.&quot;   He noted that in the first quarter, the companyexperienced such problems on the Trident submarine. On top ofthat, margins were tighter on the Standard, Phalanx andTomahawk missiles, where General Dynamics's role slipped tothat of a second-source supplier. The company once enjoyedthe lead on all of those projects.</TEXT></DOC>
