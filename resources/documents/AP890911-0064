At least six people were missing, and three others apparentlydrowned.   ``People shouldn't be out there,'' said Jarred Randall, aNarragansett, R.I., police sergeant who rescued two teen-agers fromthe water Saturday night. ``It's just so majestic and inviting, butit isn't safe.''   Though hundreds of miles from land, Gabrielle's silent, windlesssurges stirred waters along the Northeast over the weekend.Officials attributed the deaths to the sea swells, undertow andwaves that reached 15 feet, even on rivers.   By late Sunday, Gabrielle's highest sustained wind had decreasedto 65 mph, below the 74 mph threshhold for hurricanes, the NationalHurricane Center in Florida said. Gabrielle had reached 135 mph atits height last week.   At 6 a.m. EDT today, its center was located near latitude 38.8north, longitude 62.5 west, or about 375 miles south southwest ofSable Island, Nova Scotia.   Gabrielle had remained almost stationary for more than a day andwas expected to weaken further because it was over water too cold toprovide energy for its circulation.   Meanwhile, another tropical depression formed and appeared headedfor storm status, forecasters said today. Its center was nearlatitude 13.0 north and longitude 25.7 west, or about 150 milessouth-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde islands of Africa. Itwas moving west at about 17 mph with wind estimated at 35 mph.   ``This is the peak of the tropical storm season and thesetropical waves are moving off the coast of Africa every three orfour days like clockwork,'' said hurricane specialist Max Mayfieldat the hurricane center in Coral Gables.   Gabrielle has been churning in the Atlantic since Aug. 31. Itsvastness and power has prompted comparisons with last year'sHurricane Gilbert, which devastated Jamaica.   Jeff Waldstreicher, a meteorologist at the National WeatherService in Boston, said the waves and undertow were fierce up anddown the coast.   ``You have these strong, 100-plus mile an hour winds thatgenerate all these waves and long after the waves have crested youhave all this energy, moving the water from east to west,''Waldstreicher said.   A 19-year-old Cushing, Maine, woman apparently fell into the surfwhile walking with her brother and cousin Saturday night along therocky shore at the fishing village of Tenants Harbor, the CoastGuard said.   The two men went into the water after her and also were quicklyswept away from shore. A fishing boat picked them up. Despite aCoast Guard search, the woman remained missing Sunday.   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in troubleoff New Hampshire on Sunday. At the time, the chopper was heading toSalisbury Beach, Mass., to search for a missing swimmer, said CoastGuard Quartermaster 1st Class David Jersey in Boston.   No one was found, Jersey said.   And north of Boston, an Ipswich police patrol boat searched for a25-year-old man who vanished in the rough waters of the IpswichRiver north of Cape Ann. The man was with two other men and a babysailing in an 18-foot motor boat Saturday when the vessel capsized,the Coast Guard said. The others were rescued by a passing vessel.   Off New York, divers searched the Atlantic for a 37-year-old manmissing after a houseboat capsized two miles out.   Authorities recovered the body of a 58-year-old woman who was onthe houseboat when it capsized. She apparently drowned.   Two fishermen in their 30s were swept off a New York City jettySaturday afternoon by a large wave. Searchers could not find the men.   In New Jersey, a man died after being pulled unconscious fromheavy surf Sunday at Barnegat Light, said police. A woman who waspulled out with him was revived and under intensive care at ahospital.   A man drowned at Normandy Beach, but no other details wereavailable, Dover Township police said.</TEXT></DOC>
