A nearly identical decontrol bill gained easy approval by theHouse last month.   At a Senate Energy Committee hearing Monday, some members raisedquestions about the effects of decontrol on natural gas prices andsupplies, but a majority hailed the legislation as a key toimproving national energy supplies.   ``Passage of this legislation will help ensure ... that naturalgas can live up to its potential as a clean-burning, abundant anddomestically available fuel for America's future,'' said Sen. J.Bennett Johnston, D.-La., the bill's sponsor.   The legislation would complete a price decontrol process thatbegan in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed pricelimits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozencategories of gas, each with a ceiling price.   About one-third of U.S. natural gas currently is subject tofederal price controls. Because most of the controlled gas isselling at prices below the federal ceilings, the lifting ofcontrols is not expected to have much short-term effect.   Looming over the decontrol debate is a growing consensus amongexperts that the industry's failure over the past two decades tofully replace its production with new discoveries will lead to asupply squeeze and price jump in the 1990s.   The natural gas trade organizations' main argument in favor ofdecontrol is that it would help stimulate more drilling, thusaverting a crisis. But critics say that argument is weakened byuncertainty about decontrol's effects on prices. If prices don'trise, exploration generally would not be expected to increase.   J. Allen Wampler, an assistant energy secretary, told Monday'shearing that for at least the next year natural gas prices are morelikely to fall than rise, even if controls were ended.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a critic of past efforts to deregulatenatural gas, said the proposal would give the major gas producersfreedom to raise prices without improving the nation's long-termsupply outlook.   ``We know that big oil ripped us off on the gasoline pricehikes, and now we are opening up yet another avenue for them toline their pockets at consumers' expense,'' the Ohio Democrat said.He noted that Amoco Oil Co. is now the nation's largest natural gasproducer, and that other oil giants are close behind.   A committee vote on the bill is not expected before mid-month.Despite the issues raised at the hearing, eventual passage by thefull Senate is expected.   ``It's likely it'll go through,'' Edwin Rothschild, a vocalopponent, said after the hearing. He is assistant director of theCitizen-Labor Energy Coalition, which has joined with otherconsumer organizations in trying to kill the bill.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said that while he was not opposed inprinciple to ending the price controls, he would not supportJohnston's bill until the committee agreed to an amendment toredress what he called a ``serious injustice'' in his state.   Bumpers said many Arkansas landowners who signed royaltycontracts with natural gas producers years ago were shortchanged byfine print in the contracts that paid them far less than the goingrate. He said he would try to stop the bill from leaving thecommittee until the contract problem was corrected.   Also, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said he would try to stall thebill until he received explicit assurances that decontrol would nothurt the federally subsidized Great Plains project near Beulah,N.D., that makes natural gas from coal.   The ending of federal controls on natural gas prices is one ofthe Bush adminstration's top energy priorities.</TEXT></DOC>
