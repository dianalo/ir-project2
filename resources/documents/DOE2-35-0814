It is possible to estimate the probability of a causal relationshipbased on data and models that have been inferred from group statistics.Two types of information are needed to make these probability calculations:natural cancer incidence rates and risks of cancer induction from ionizingradiation. Cancer incidence rates for the United States are availablein the report of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)program of the National Cancer Institute. Estimates of the risk of cancerinduction from ionizing radiation have been published by the AdvisoryCommittee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) of theNational Academy of Sciences, the United Nations Scientific Committeeon the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), and the International Commissionon Radiological Protection (ICRP). Using the parameters discussed above,the probability of causation formulation estimates the probability thata person who develops a particular cancer after a known quantifiableradiation exposure has the cancer as a result of the exposure. In 1985,the National Institutes of Health, responding to a U.S. Congressionalmandate, published radioepidemiologic tables using the probability-of-causationmethod.</TEXT></DOC>
