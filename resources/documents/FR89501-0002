It is a threshold rule,that is, it only becomes operative when Federal credit unions decide toinvest in excess of 5 percent of shares and retained earnings in fixedassets. This revision primarily addresses the definitions area in thatit clarifies the definitions of lease payments and investments in a partnershipor corporation holding any fixed assets for the Federal credit union.The rule retains provisions for prior NCUA approval of fixed asset commitmentsin excess of 5 percent, limitations on property purchased for expansion,prohibited transactions with designated insiders, and the maximum timelimitations on NCUA acting on a credit union's request. There has beenno change in the asset threshold that triggers the applicability of theregulation and, therefore, the scope of application of this regulationhas not been expanded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>National Credit Union Administration Board, 1776 G Street,NW., Washington, DC 20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>D.

This rule requires submission of suchreports and statements as may be required by the NCUA Regional Directorin support of the request. In October 1988, as part of its regulatory review,the NCUA Board issued a proposed revision to the sections of the rule containingthe definitions of terms, prohibited transactions, and deleting some obsoletematerial pertaining to fixed asset purchase commitments made prior to December1984. In addition, the NCUA Board sought comments and recommendations concerningapplicability of the existing regulation to corporate credit unions. Thecomment period on the proposal ended on January 23, 1989. (See 53 FR 42953,10/25/88).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>A total of twenty comment letters were received in response to the NCUABoard's proposed regulatory revision to Section 701.36. Fifteen of thetwenty comments were from Federal credit unions and five were from creditunion trade associations. The comments received are addressed in the followingsection-by-section analysis of the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 701.36(a)This section states that a Federal credit union's investment in fixed assetsshall be limited as described in this chapter. This section remains unchangedas proposed.Section 701.36(b), DefinitionsThe following paragraphs of andSection; 701.36 remain unchanged as proposed:(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), and (b)(8). These sectionsset forth the definitions of premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment,fixed assets, abandoned premises, immediate family members, shares, andsenior management officials.Paragraph (b)(4) of this section, which defines investments in fixed assets,is comprised of five sections of which (i), (ii), and (v), addressing investmentin real property for use as a premises, leasehold improvement, and investmentin furniture, fixtures, and equipment remain unchanged as proposed.The proposed changes to andSection; 701.36(b)(4)(iii) received the largestnumber of comments. The majority of these comments supported the proposedclarification of this section. However, it was evident that there was ageneral misconception in that the commenters perceived this as a changeinstead of a clarification of the existing rule concerning the inclusionof capital and operating lease payments as fixed assets.The preamble to the existing regulation issued on December 28, 1984 states,``It is the Agency's position that these (capital and operating lease payments)should be included in the computation for determining compliance with the5 percent limitation * * *''. (See 49 FR 50365.) The Agency has alwaysconsidered both types of leases as fixed assets subject to this regulation.Several commenters suggested the distinction between the types of leases,capital and operating, be made on the basis of Generally Accepted AccountingPractices (GAAP). GAAP establishes the proper accounting for leases, e.g.,a capital lease has certain characteristics and must be considered a fixedasset while all leases (those not having the specified characteristics)are treated as operating leases and not recorded as fixed assets. WhileGAAP draws a distinction between these lease types, it only pertains tothe proper method of accounting for leases and not whether or not theseare to be considered as fixed assets under this rule. This determinationrests with the NCUA Board.This section, as defined by NCUA, states that aggregate lease paymentspursuant to a lease agreement on fixed assets are covered by the rule.Many of the comments mentioned the use of leases in connection with dataprocessing of credit union records. Using this example, a credit unionhas some options: an outright purchase or a lease of the hardware and software(there may even be variations of these two options). All would agree thatthe purchase of hardware and software represent an obvious investment infixed assets. In the second option, the use of the lease, usually longterm, represents a substantial future commitment of credit union fundsand it is used in lieu of purchasing the items. The use of the lease isactually the equivalent of the purchase. This is particularly evident whenthe cost to purchase is equal to or less than the lease payments. Whilewe are aware that there are many other fees paid under a data processinglease, it is impossible to view these payments as independent since allare usually tied, directly or indirectly, to hardware and/or software use.It would be difficult, if not impossible, to segregate portions of thesefees as non-fixed assets due to the dependence on the entire system toproduce the product.While the NCUA Board is mindful of the differences of opinion in this area,the purpose of the regulation is to provide some control on the potentialrisk of excess investment and/or commitment to invest substantial sumsin fixed assets. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined not to changethe existing regulation in this area. Clarification in this section iswarranted and, therefore, the reference to capital and operating leasesis added to the regulation.The definition in andSection; 701.36(b)(4)(iv) has been clarified by listingthe inclusion of any entity described in andSection; 701.27, Credit UnionService Organization (CUSO) as proposed. The wording previously used didinclude CUSOs since most, if not all, are partnerships or corporations.The CUSO's investment in fixed assets, as defined in this regulation, willbe considered in the credit union's total of fixed assets for the purposeof applying this regulation. In the case of multiple owners, each ownerwill consider a prorated share of the CUSO's fixed assets as part of itsown fixed assets. This proration will be in direct proportion to the creditunion's ownership of the CUSO. The commenters were supportive of this clarificationand, therefore, this section is amended to reflect this change.Section 701.36(c), (d), and (e)The following paragraphs of andSection; 701.36 remain unchanged as proposed:(c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4). Paragraph (c)(5) of this section isdeleted as proposed since it contains out-of-date material.Section 701.36, paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) remain unchanged as proposed.Section 701.36, paragraph (e)(1), parts (i), (ii), and (iii) have beenmodified to eliminate the word official in (i) as proposed, and the wordunion from credit union committee in (ii) and (iii). Paragraphs (e)(2)and (e)(3) remain unchanged.This regulation, as amended, continues to apply to corporate Federal creditunions. The majority of all commenters indicated that corporate Federalcredit unions need to be covered by this rule or another rule. However,many did not believe that the use of 5 percent of shares and retained earningsis an appropriate measure due to the volatility of a corporate credit union'sshare base. Several commenters indicated that the limitation on corporatecredit unions should be based on a percentage of reserves, a less volatilepart of the corporate's balance sheet. While there was no definite consensusof opinion on how to establish this limitation, it is clear to the NCUABoard that some form of change regarding corporate credit unions is warranted.Section 704 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations pertains to corporate creditunions. It does not presently contain a section on fixed assets. The NCUABoard believes that this is the appropriate section for any regulationof corporate credit unions in the area of the purchase of fixed assets.This regulation will be reviewed and the inclusion of a fixed asset limitationwill be proposed as the NCUA Board deems appropriate. In the interim, Section701.36 will continue to apply. However, each corporate's commitment offunds to fixed assets will be reviewed on the basis of safety and soundnessconcerns on a continuous basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board certifies that the rule does not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small credit unions because it applies onlyto credit unions with assets of at least $1 million. Accordingly, the Boardhas determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule makes no changes to collection requirements, therefore, it neednot be sent to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.Executive Order 12612The rule does not affect state regulation of state-chartered credit unions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit union, Fixed assets.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on April 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends 12 CFR Part 701 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
