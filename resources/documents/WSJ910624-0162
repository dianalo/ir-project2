In the good old corrupt days, the union's convention was aglitzy blend of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;The Godfather.&quot; At the lastone, held in Las Vegas in 1986, 300-pound president JackiePresser, who had been indicted on charges of embezzling unionfunds a few days earlier, was carried into the Caesars Palaceballroom on a golden sedan chair by four wrestlers dressed asRoman centurions amid musical fanfare, colored floodlightsand cheering Teamsters. One union official threw anotherparty reputed to cost $600,000.</LP><TEXT>   This year's convention will be more like &quot;Mickey MouseMeets Elliott Ness.&quot; It's a whole different world -- DisneyWorld, to be exact -- at the Dolphin Hotel near the EpcotCenter.   Because top Teamsters signed a government consent decreein 1989, the feds are running the show -- from the mechanicsof the union's first democratic election of officersinvolving the rank and file right down to convention detailssuch as the menu (chicken with fettuccine, cold soup andcheesecake) for a &quot;women's lunch&quot; for 3,000 Teamstersmembers' spouses on Wednesday.   This isn't exactly the stuff that made the Teamstersinfamous. &quot;There's a lot of grumbling&quot; about the government'srole, says union general counsel James Grady. &quot;This is notour union,&quot; adds Walter Shea, a Teamsters executive boardmember and candidate for union president.   Tensions started rising last week as union members andtheir federal overseers began gathering. At the hotel'srestaurant, Teamsters people and the feds ate at separatetables, nervously eying each other, says Don Sweitzer, Mr.Shea's campaign manager. &quot;There will be lots of dramaticmoments, with the feds looking over everybody's shoulder,&quot; hepredicts.   The government got involved in running the union after theJustice Department filed a 1988 civil racketeering suitcharging that Teamsters leaders had made a &quot;devil's pact&quot;with the Mob. Organized crime, the suit alleged, had&quot;deprived Teamster members of their rights through a patternof racketeering that includes 20 murders, shootings,bombings, beatings, a campaign of fear, extortion and theft.&quot;Former Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa disappeared in 1975, andis believed to have been killed by mobster enemies. Of theseven Teamsters presidents preceding the current one, fourwere indicted, three convicted and two imprisoned.   The Teamsters, in short, have not exactly been Snow White.With that in mind, the government is keeping a tight rein onthis week's convention. Federal officials have ruled on mediaaccess to the convention, the length of nominating speeches,and whether Teamsters brochures are acceptable. The feds mustapprove &quot;every penny we spend,&quot; says Victor Kamber, whosepublic relations firm, the Kamber Group, is staging theconvention.   During the convention itself, the government's presencewill be clear and heavy. Fully 65 federal and court officialsare checked into the Dolphin, at the Teamsters' expense. Mostof them work for Michael Holland, the court-appointedelection officer who has been running the locals' ballotingfor delegates.   Mr. Holland and his minions will handle the nominatingprocess and secret balloting for nominees &quot;from beginning toend,&quot; he says. The actual rank-and-file secret voting forofficers won't come until December. In the past, localofficers nominated and elected international officers in openfloor voting at the convention, with little doubt of theoutcome.   Mr. Holland will be at or near the speaker's podium duringthe nominations. Frederick Lacey, the court-named Teamstersadministrator, will be in and around the convention hall,deciding disputes and ruling on issues, as he has been doingfor more than two years. A nearby hearing room has been setup to handle any disputes that arise; the feds have authorityto halt the convention and hold a hearing if necessary. JudgeDavid Edelstein, the 81-year-old federal judge overseeing theTeamsters in New York, has even moved his court to Orlando,where he'll be available to rule on any appeals of Mr.Lacey's decisions.   Many Teamsters are chafing at what they consider theMickey Mouse rules of the government decree. The 1,900 votingdelegates can discuss and even vote on rules changes. Infact, the feds expect the delegates to vote solidly againstthe decree itself, and then vote for major weakening changesin it and in the union's constitution. But the major ruleswon't be changed, the feds say.   Furthermore, if Teamsters executive board members plumpfor such changes on the floor, bad-mouthing the consentdecree, they'll be subject to contempt of court charges, thefeds warn. It is, some Teamsters officials charge, agovernment-run &quot;fascist convention to impose democracy.&quot;Grouses Christopher Scott, campaign manager for R. V. Durham,a board member and vice president from North Carolina: &quot;Hereare people who got elected as delegates the way thegovernment wants them elected, and they're told they can'texercise their rights.&quot;   The delegates won't be angry at just the government.&quot;You'll see corrupt local officials on floor mikes denouncingcorrupt board members for signing the decree and allowing thegovernment to intervene,&quot; says Steve Kindred, an organizerfor Teamsters for a Democratic Union. TDU is backing a rebelcandidate for president, Ron Carey, head of a big New Yorklocal of United Parcel Service workers.   At this convention, unlike the last one, big union partieswith free-flowing booze and golden sedan chairs will be out.Indeed, in Disney country, this convention is expected to bemore of a family affair and not a mob family this time. &quot;It'salmost antiseptic, it's so family-oriented,&quot; says the union'sMr. Grady, quickly adding that it'll be &quot;a refreshingimprovement.&quot;   To further ensure a clean image, the government's Mr.Lacey has banned about 50 Teamsters, some of them former topofficials, from the Dolphin convention. This is mostlybecause they have proven or alleged ties to organized crime,or allowed such links. The banished include Chuckie O'Brien,Mr. Hoffa's adopted son, whom the feds have accused ofembezzlement and organized-crime ties. Mr. O'Brien says theembezzlement allegations are unfounded -- that he didn'tpersonally gain, and is paying the money back anyway, andthat whoever he associates with, no one can show he hascommitted any crime himself.</TEXT></DOC>
