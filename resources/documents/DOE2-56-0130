The effects on plants and animals arealso impossible to predict due to the lack of detail in climatologicalmodels. Ecologists and biologists are attempting to predict the possibleeffects on habitats, communities and individual species. Forecasts ofchanges in Arctic, tundra and tropical rain forest regions are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
