(MBS) of Braintree, Mass., which offers amicrowave product company officials say can connect remote LANs at low costand maintain the 10-megabit/sec speed of Ethernet.andM;Now, I've no particular ax to grind, pro or con, about using microwave forshorthaul data connectivity over rough or difficult terrain.andP;  Although it hasweaknesses in security and under adverse weather conditions microwavetechnology can be efficient and cost-effective under the right conditions.andO;But for bridging LANs?andM;Typically, most non-microwave LAN-to-LAN solutions involve interLAN bridgesor gateways -- devices that pass data traffic from one LAN to the other overpublic or private telephone lines.andM;The problem with these devices is that they're too costly, too slow, or both.andO;It's not that the bridging hardware itself is so expensive.andP;  But theinstallation costs for crossing a city street or river with a dedicated56-kilobit/sec or 1.544-megabit/sec line can be prohibitive.andP;  Users also mustdeal with monthly charges which, like death and taxes, will never go away.andM;As for speed, well, who wants to give up full Ethernet throughput for acostly dedicated 56-kilobit/sec connection, or a faster but still costly T1circuit?andM;MBS president David S. Theodore said his product solves the LAN-to-LANcost/speed conundrum because it was designed with the needs of Ethernet usersin mind.andM;He said the problem with most microwave manufacturers is that they are out oftune with LAN technology.andP;  Having dismissed Ethernet as a &quot;special&quot;application, they mainly have focused on T1 or 56-kilobit/sec channels as asolution for all data requirements.andM;MBS focuses solely on extending the range of a LAN via a microwave bridge.andO;Using an MBS turnkey microwave system, you ought to be able to link yourcross-campus or crosstown Ethernet LANs at 10 megabits/sec as effectively asif you were using an Ethernet coaxial cable within a single building.andM;MBS has developed an ethernet-to-microwave interface, the Etherwavetransceiver.andP;  This is a LAN-microwave interface, which, combined with MBS'LAN-Link 1000 Bridge, delviers 10-megabit/sec speed between multivendorEthernets for distance of up to five miles without a repeater or 14 mileswith a microwave repeater.andM;Because the MBS LAN-Link 100 bridge operates at the data link level, it isprotocol independent.andP;  Therefore it can handle virtually all popularprotocols, such as XNS, DECnet and the military-standard TCP/IP protocol,without external software and without losing any of the Ethernet speed.andM;The cost for the entire MBS package, which includes a 23-gigahertz widebandmicrowave radio with two- or four-foot parabolic antennas and two EtherwaveTransceivers and Media Access Control-level bridges for both ends, runs under$45,000, and includes installation, FCC licensing and customer training.andM;One user, with needs presumably similar to those of federal agency users, isthe New England Academic Research Network (NEARnet) a network that linksBoston University, Harvard University, the Massachusets Institute ofTechnology, Digital equipment Corp.andP;  and Mitre Corp. to the National ScienceFoundation's supercomputer network and is itself linked to the Internet viathe John von Neumann Supercomputer Center in Princeton, N.J.andM;Kent England, Boston University's director of network systems who isresponsible for the NEARnet link, said the MBS microwave network link runsflawlessly in all weather conditions at 10 megabits/sec, making it &quot;thefastest metropolitan wide-area area system in the [Boston] area.&quot;andM;J.B.andP;  Miles writes about networking and wide area communications from SanFrancisco.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
