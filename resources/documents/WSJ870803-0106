But some financial advisers worry that investors are buying the glitter and aren't reading the fine print. &quot;People forget they are investing in a full operating business in head-to-head combat,&quot; says Jackie Coyne, first vice president at Financial Network Investment Corp., a Torrance, Calif., investment firm.    For the first half of the year, sales of public hotel partnerships rose about 35% to $231.3 million from $171.6 million a year earlier. &quot;I've never seen so many hotel deals on the market before,&quot; says Fuhrman Nettles, vice president at Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., company that tracks partnership sales. And more packages are being readied for sale, syndicators say.    Investors have a big selection to choose from. Some, like Motel 6 L.P. -- a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based national budget motel chain -- are master limited partnerships (MLPs) that already trade on stock exchanges. Others like Growth Hotel Investors II -- an investment in 18 Hampton Inns sponsored by Fox Group Inc., a Foster City, Calif., real-estate company -- are sold through brokers and financial planners and have little liquidity. Investors usually get their capital back only after the hotels are refinanced or sold, about seven to 12 years later.    The investments' structures also vary widely. Many guarantee cash distributions of 10% to 12% a year for several years with the possibility of a big payout later when the hotels are refinanced. Many use complicated procedures and subordination provisions to assure that high return.    The big selling point for hotel partnerships these days is that they are &quot;a superior inflation hedge,&quot; says W. Michael Murphy, executive vice president of Fox Group. &quot;Hotels can raise room rates overnight if inflation hits. It takes longer to raise office building leases or apartment rents.&quot;    Michael G. Mueller, a security analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, says hotel master limited partnerships are an attractive buy now because most prices have fallen significantly since they were first issued. &quot;Prices fell because investors don't understand MLPs and because of fears that Congress may tax MLPs like corporations,&quot; he says. (He and others doubt that Congress will tax the partnerships. Even if it does, Mr. Mueller says, ones already operating would probably be exempt.)    Hotel master limited partnerships &quot;have similar yields to bonds but they offer inflation protection, growth in yield and growth in underlying assets,&quot; Mr. Mueller says. And the cash distributions are partially tax-sheltered because depreciation on the hotels passes through to the limited partnership investors.    William G. Brennan, publisher of a Valley Forge, Pa., investment strategy newsletter, notes, however, that despite those attractions the investments have &quot;sizable operating risks.&quot; A big challenge, he says, is controlling expenses and keeping room occupancy rates high in areas where hotels are overbuilt.    J. Keith Fowler, a vice president at Wheat First Securities, a Richmond, Va.-based regional brokerage concern, says his company is taking a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach to the hotel master limited partnerships. &quot;We don't think real estate is meant to be traded like a stock,&quot; he says.    The major danger for investors, Mr. Fowler says, is that &quot;they'll get caught up in the sexy gloss of the hotel partnerships and fail to ask the big questions like: Who is the operator? What's his track record? And if he bought the hotels, how much did he pay per room?&quot;    Many partnerships are so new that track records aren't available, says Ms. Coyne, the Financial Network Investment executive. But if the hotels are operating, investors can find out how much cash flow they have delivered in the past and how that squares with future projections.    Ms. Coyne isn't impressed with the hotel partnerships' guarantees for cash distributions for a number of years. &quot;Sometimes companies load up front-end fees from the limited partners to the general partner and then loan back the investor's own money,&quot; she says. &quot;The investor often pays for the guarantee.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
