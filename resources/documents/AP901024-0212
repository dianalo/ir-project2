What do Poles think of the contest between Lech Walesa and PrimeMinister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in their first popular vote for thepresidency?   Some call it Cham vs. Hamlet. Cham, pronounced ``ham,'' isPolish for bumpkin.   Others have asked: Will Mazowiecki declare his candidacy beforeor after the election?   Then there's the story of a problem Walesa had when he wanted toreserve a burial site in Jerusalem next to Jesus Christ.   He found the cost was $150,000, it goes, and said to his topaide: ``I don't know, Krzysiek. Is it worth it for only threedays?''   The duel between Eastern Europe's first non-Communist head ofgovernment and the man who gave him the job has rekindled interestin politics after months of hand-wringing by commentators overpost-Communist apathy.   Nearly all conversations turn sooner or later to the question ofwhich one will occupy Belweder Palace, seat of Polish presidents.   A man was even killed in a drunken dispute with his son-in-lawover who would be the better president, the state news agencyreported.   Poland held parliamentary elections in June 1989 that werelargely free and democratic local elections in May, but this is thefirst real contest because Solidarity candidates swept the earliervotes.   Surveys indicate the two former Solidarity allies are runningabout even.   Other candidates have ventured into the ring, including RomanBartoszcze of the Peasant Party and Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz of theSocial Democrats, formerly the Communists, but only Walesa andMazowiecki are given a real chance.   If neither gets 50 percent of the votes Nov. 25, a runoff willbe held Dec. 9.   Part of the fascination stems from their contrasting styles.   Walesa is electric, speaking rapidly, seeming to bob and weavethrough questions thrown at him from the crowd.   Mazowiecki is ``grey on grey'' in the words of one newspaper,shy and ponderous in speech but exuding character and moralauthority.   Walesa declared early and began an aggressive campaignimmediately with meetings at factories, where he is strong, andwith academics, Mazowiecki's turf.   In the first three weeks of October, Walesa visited nine cities,saw more than 100,000 people and was seen by millions more ontelevision. Local Solidarity chapters organize his Western-stylerallies, held outdoors or in large arenas with banners, brass bandsand deafening loudspeakers.   Mazowiecki made his first campaign appearance Oct. 14, two weeksafter Walesa, in the Krakow Philharmonic Hall, which seats only 800people. Instead of direct questions from the crowd, he took writtenones that were rephrased by his campaign spokesman.   The prime minister seems hesitant about contact with strangers.Hundreds of people waited outside the hall in Krakow for two hoursand Mazowiecki rewarded them with only a few minutes on thebalcony, his stilted words of thanks barely audible through abullhorn.   His dedication to his job, evident in his tired, carewornappearance, earns sympathy even from people who say they will votefor Walesa.   After becoming prime minister in August 1989, Mazowiecki set aconsidered, pragmatic course that won respect abroad and gave Polesa sense of security against the sudden shocks of revolutionarychange.   To many, however, Mazowiecki's government has seemed to drag itsfeet, allowing former secret police to destroy records and keepingCommunist ministers in the government half a year after the partydissolved.   In his campaign, Walesa advocates faster change and has beenquoted as intending to use a ``sharp axe'' to chop away vestiges ofthe old system.   He and Mazowiecki also appear to disagree about policy towardthe Communist leadership. When he took office, the prime ministerspoke of drawing a line between present and past, but Walesa hassaid he wants to ``settle accounts'' with those who have injuredPoland or stolen from it.   If Walesa becomes president, Mazowiecki says, he will join theopposition. Walesa replies that he already has five othercandidates for prime minister.   Critics accuse Walesa of currying favor with the mob, promisingeasy solutions he cannot deliver and becoming a demagogue who couldabuse the still-fragile democracy and frighten off Westerninvestors.   ``I'll vote for Mazowiecki because, under his presidency, I cansleep peacefully,'' Adam Michnik, a former Walesa adviser, told arally. ``If someone knocks at my door at 5 in the morning, it canonly be the milkman.''   ``Walesa is as suitable to be president as I am to be a radioannouncer,'' Michnik, now editor of Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland'sleading daily newspaper, said in a recent broadcast.   Michnik spoke with his usual stutter.   Walesa wished him luck in radio.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs Nov 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
