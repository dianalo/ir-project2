The unit, Reading andamp; Bates Petroleum Co., had 1987 operating revenue of about $25 million, the parent said. At year end, the unit's proved reserves totaled 5.7 million barrels of oil and 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas.    The sale is part of a major restructuring plan, the company said.    The move to Houston will allow the consolidation of corporate offices with the concern's drilling company there. The company said the move will result in an immediate reduction of 30 positions in Tulsa, with 15 management staffers moving to Houston over the next several months. A total of about 100 corporate positions will be phased out over the next several months, Reading andamp; Bates said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Reading andamp; Bates stock closed at $1.375, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
