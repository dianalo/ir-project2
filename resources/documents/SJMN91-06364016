They playedtheir way out of a 10-0 hole Saturday against the Saints in their wild-cardplayoff game and went on to win 27-20.;   &quot;We had faith all the way through,&quot;defensive back Deion Sanders said. &quot;If we doubted ourselves one minute, that'sthe sign of a loser. And, besides, we're too legit to quit.&quot;;   &quot;Too Legit toQuit,&quot; of course, is the title song of Hammer's new disc. Not to mention theFalcons' slogan.;   That slogan haunted the Saints on Saturday in much thesame way it haunted the 49ers in two dramatic losses to Atlanta this season.Michael Haynes, who caught the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass that sealed the 49ers' fateNov. 3, caught two second-half touchdown passes from Chris Miller against NewOrleans, including the winner on a 61-yard pass-and-run play late in thefourth quarter.;   Just as the Hammer seemed to turn his back on his nativeBay Area by aligning with Atlanta, Haynes has turned his back on his nativeNew Orleans, where he grew up playing trumpet, not football, at Clark HighSchool.;   Miller, who completed 18 of 30 passes for 291 yards, also passed toAndre Rison for a 24-yard touchdown, and Norm Johnson kicked field goals of 45and 36 yards for the Falcons.;   The Saints had their moments. They dominatedthe first half, scoring on two of their first three possessions for a 10-0lead. Bobby Hebert completed nine passes in a row in one stretch of the firstquarter, including a 26-yarder touchdown to Floyd Turner to finish an 11-playdrive on the first series. The Saints nearly extended the lead to 17-0, butJohn Tice dropped a pass from Hebert in the end zone. Two plays later, Sandersmade an interception in the end zone.;   Although the Falcons dominated therest of the game, the Saints led 20-17 after a a 19-play, 80-yard drive thatconsumed 10 minutes, 49 seconds of the third quarter and leaked over into thefourth quarter and ended with running back Dalton Hilliard bulling over fromthe 1.;   The Falcons began their turnaround by putting together an 11-play,80-yard drive in the second quarter that was capped by the 24-yard touchdownreception by Rison.;   Atlanta received a critical break from the officials ona second-and-10 play at the Saints' 22. Falcons running back Mike Rozierfumbled the ball after getting hit at the line of scrimmage. Officials ruledthat Rozier's forward progress had been stopped before the fumble.;   TheFalcons tied the score 10-10 on a 44-yard field goal by Johnson with 37seconds to go in the half. Morten Andersen's second 45-yard field goal gaveNew Orleans a 13-10 halftime lead.;   Atlanta finally took the lead on Haynes'first touchdown catch, a 20-yarder in the right corner of the end zone with9:59 to play in the third quarter.;   On the game-winner, Haynes beat Saintscornerback Milton Mack, who had been activated from the practice squad afterthe first three Saints cornerbacks went down with injuries.;   Mack saidlinebacker Sam Mills knocked him off the tackle after Haynes' reception. Itwas a blitz, and he had Haynes one-on-one, Mack said.;   &quot;I gave the guy alittle too much respect,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a gamble, and I got in a badposition.&quot;; Falcons 27, Saints 20; (box) THE HERO: Falcons receiver MichaelHaynes, who looked like Jerry Rice on his two TD receptions.; (box) THE GOAT:The Saints' John Tice. Had he not dropped a pass that would have put NewOrleans ahead 17-0, the Saints would have been tough to overtake.; (box) KEYPLAY: Haynes' 61-yard game-winning touchdown. He caught a 20-yard pass, evadeddefender Milton Mack and loped to the touchdown.; Atlanta     010710--27; NewOrleans 7 60 7--20; SCORING BY QUARTERS; 1;      NO--Turner 26 pass fromHebert (Andersen kick) at 8:57.; 2;      NO--FG Andersen 45 at 11:37.;     Atl--Rison 24 pass from Miller (Johnson kick) at 5:26.;      Atl--FG Johnson45 at 0:37.;      NO--FG Andersen 35 at 0:03.; 3;      Atl--Haynes 20 passfrom Miller (Johnson kick) at 9:59.; 4;      NO--Hilliard 1 run (Andersenkick) at 14:10.;      Atl--FG Johnson 36 at 7:43.;      Atl--Haynes 61 passfrom Miller (Johnson kick) at 2:41.;       A--68,794.;      ------;STATISTICS; FALCONS                 SAINTS; First downs              20     23; 20   First downs             23; Rushes-yards          22-79   22-65;22-79Rushes-yards         22-65; Passing                 255     265; 255 Passing                265; Return Yards             53       0; 53   ReturnYards             0; Comp-Att-Int        18-30-1 26-44-2;18-30Completions-attempts26-44; 1    Had intercepted         2; Sacked-YardsLost      5-36     1-8; 5-36 Sacked                1-8; Punts                 1-42    3-54; 1-42 Punts                 3-54; Fumbles-Lost            3-1    2-1; 3-1  Fumbles-Lost           2-1; Penalties-Yards        6-48    5-49;6-48 Penalties-Yards       5-49; 0    Missed field goals      0; Time ofPossession    26:52   33:08; 26:52Possession time     33:08; FALCONS RUSHING;Rozier 7-35, Pegram 11-26, Miller 4-18.;    SAINTS RUSHING; McAfee 14-49,Hebert 1-9, Hilliard 4-5, Jordan 3-2.;    FALCONS PASSING; Miller18-30-1-291.;    SAINTS PASSING; Hebert 26-44-2-273.;    FALCONS RECEIVING;Haynes 6-144, Pritchard 5-63, Rison 4-56, Thomas 1-19, Pegram 1-5, Dixon 1-4.;   SAINTS RECEIVING; E.Martin 7-83, Turner 5-75, Early 5-41, Hilliard 5-33,Carroll 2-23, Tice 1-13, Jordan 1-5.; ATTENDANCE -- 68,794.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New Orleans  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911229  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,014  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 29, 199100364016,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
