At 17, she is one of London's army of homeless youths whosenumbers, critics of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher claim, arebeing swollen by the Conservative government's radical shakeup ofthe welfare system.   The government is determined to wean Britons off what it calls``the dependency culture.'' To do this, it is paying 16- and17-year-old high school dropouts $50-$60 a week to become jobtrainees and cutting off welfare payments to those who don't sign up.   More than 400,000 now work for their benefits each year and gainjob experience in the process. But those who don't register for aone- or two-year ``YTS,'' or Youth Training Scheme, have been barredsince Sept. 12 from ``signing on'' for $33 a week in state aid.   Exemptions are available to youths who suffer ``severe hardship''such as disability or a violent home, and of 4,500 applications forhardship status, nearly 3,000 have been accepted.   But critics, including some members of Mrs. Thatcher's ownConservative Party, have forced an acknowledgment from SocialSecurity Minister Nicholas Scott that the reform is causingproblems, and he has hinted he will broaden his discretionary powersto help those worst hit.   Conservative lawmaker Robin Squire supports this Thatcheriteconcept of ``workfare,'' but opposes cutting welfare payments.   ``People who have no real home should be properly looked afteruntil they are able to get a job or a YTS course,'' he says.   Their only alternatives are to ``either resort to crime or tobegging gifts or to prostitution,'' he said in an interview.   Some see the issue as a test of how far Mrs. Thatcher's crusadecan go in revamping the 43-year-old welfare system.   Tony Morgan, who runs the New Horizon day hostel near CoventGarden in the heart of London, said young homeless often regard jobtraining as ``slave labor. They don't think they should be forced todo it.''   Many come from unemployment-stricken northern England, or arefleeing broken homes, and cannot afford accommodation. The YTS has135,000 unfilled places, yet some youngsters have difficulty findingthe right slot, and others get fired because they don't get on withtheir employers.   ``There's no transition,'' Morgan said. ``Either it works or itdoesn't work ... Any other way you can think of to make money, theydo it. Most cope very well. Of course, some go under.''   Austin, stepping out of the rain to meet friends in the hostel'sdingy pool room, said she left home in September because ``me and medad didn't get on.''   She say she has since slept in doorways, under railroad bridgesand on sidewalks in the so-called ``cardboard city'' along theThames. Lately, she has found shelter in an abandoned house inCamden, north London.   She says she gave up a trainee mechanic job after four daysbecause ``it was too underpaid and it wasn't worth it.'' She saysshe can earn up to $50 a day begging in subway stations.   ``I'm better off how I am now than I was when I was living athome,'' Austin said, her voice wavering. ``There ain't no onetelling me what I should do.'' Her eyes are unsteady; her faceflashes a smile, then becomes a grimace.   ``People who are homeless now are all like brother and sister,''she said. ``All they're worried about is when is their next moneygoing to come to buy food, if they've got enough blankets, if it'sgoing to rain tonight.''   Drugs and violence are endemic. Illnesses such as scurvy, scabiesand tuberculosis are common. The government says London has 23,000homeless, but welfare groups say the total is closer to 40,000 andgrowing.   Last year, the government ended housing subsidies for nearly 1million poor. Grants for buying stoves and beds were changed tointerest-free loans. Unemployed people under age 25 now are allowedonly two to six weeks welfare if they remain in the same region.   The government allocated $36 million last summer to help Londonauthorities renovate empty public housing and pay for homelesshostels. New Horizon still must raise $128,000 in voluntary aid thisyear.   ``We're professional beggars,'' jokes Morgan.   Sam Hughes, 17, from Manchester, said he was forced off the doleinto becoming a trainee decorator, but his job consisted mainly ofrunning errands. He quit in frustration.   ``You try to sleep in toilets or park benches,'' he said.``There's nowhere warm. You're shaking all night and all the nextday you're shaking. Your stomach's empty. You feel dead weak.''   He now earns $182 a week working in a grocery store, and ismoving into a working men's club where the weekly rent is $107.   ``Mrs. Thatcher did me good really _ she made me find work,''said Hughes, a gaunt figure with spiked hair.   ``People who've got something in them, they're going to benefitout of this,'' he said. ``But for every one person that does get ajob, 10 people will go homeless and go on the streets.''</TEXT></DOC>
