WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, ready to claim the Democraticpresidential nomination, pledged today ``a campaign that will reachout to literally millions'' and include rival Jesse Jackson as wellsome of his campaign staff.   Dukakis, who canceled his morning schedule to meet for more thantwo hours with Jackson, emerged predicting party unity while saying``there's no deal and there's no fine print'' between the twocandidates.   The meeting was their first since Dukakis passed over Jackson inselecting a running mate. Dukakis said negotiations over platformdifferences would resume between the two campaigns.   He said he wanted Jackson campaigning for the ticket and somemembers of his staff included into the Dukakis organization.   ``He will be doing everything he possibly can and I want him todo everything he can,'' Dukakis said. ``We'll be campaigningtogether, we'll be campaigning separately _ but he'll be a very,very important part of this team.''   ``It will be a campaign that will reach out to literallymillions and millions and millions of Americans and say to them,`this is your country, this is your government,''' Dukakis said.   Dukakis planned a late lunch in the afternoon with Jimmy Carterat the former president's library in Atlanta.   The apparent nominee relaxed with his family and running mate ata cousin's swank restaurant Sunday night and suggested conciliationwith Jackson, his last remaining rival, is within reach. ``We'regoing to need Jesse'' in the fall, Dukakis said.   In order to hold the personal session with Jackson and try tonegotiate an end to their campaign tensions, Dukakis scrapped avisit to a General Motors plant aimed at underscoring his themes ofjobs and economic opportunity. Spokesman Dayton Duncan said Dukakisset up the meeting in a 15-minute late-night call.   Dukakis aides said privately that there were sticking points,including whether Dukakis or the party would sponsor Jackson's fallcampaign effort and travel for the prospective Democratic nominee.But they held out hope agreement could be reached in theface-to-face session.   After signing legislation to settle Massachusetts' budgetproblems, Dukakis left Boston for this sweltering city where hewill be nominated Wednesday.   But first there was time out for a family celebration. Dukakisand his wife, Kitty, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and his wife, BerylAnn, spent part of the evening at 103 West, a swank continentalrestaurant that is one of several owned by Dukakis' second cousinPano Karatassos. They dined on a six-course meal that includedlobster and red snapper ragout in sauterne sauce.   Other Democratic leaders were there in separate parties,including Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, Hawaii Sen. DanielInouye, and Pennsylvania Rep. William Gray.   Upon his arrival in Atlanta, Dukakis praised Jackson, who hasrefused to concede him the nomination or endorse his selection of arunning mate. But Dukakis predicted the convention would produce aunified party to mount a winning campaign in the fall.   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to need your help,'' Dukakissaid at a reception for selected Democrats. ``We're going to needJesse. We're going to need all of the delegates at thisconvention.''   Before leaving Boston, Dukakis expressed confidence that Jacksonwill be a member of his team but emphasized that it will have onlyone quarterback _ the presidential nominee.   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' he said. ``On the otherhand, every team has to have terrific players in the backfield, upon the line. That's the way you win and that's the way we're goingto win.''   He rejected talk of convention tension as ``the stuff ofpolitics.''   Dukakis stopped in Washington on his way down to pick upBentsen, the Texas senator he selected last week to be his vicepresidential candidate.   Both appeared relaxed and buoyant as they entered the city andarrived at a reception hosted by television entrepreneur Ted Turnerin the spacious atrium of the CNN Center next door to The Omni,where the convention opens Monday evening.   Dukakis stood on the stage in front of a glittering, giantAmerican flag and shook hands with Carter, and later greeted formerHouse Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill outside.   Sharing the stage also were Georgia's two Democratic senators,Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler, Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, head ofthe committee that wrote a Dukakis-approved platform, and Turner,owner of the Cable News Network and Atlanta professional sportsteams.   ``For the past 17 months I've had Georgia on my mind,'' Dukakisdeclared.</TEXT></DOC>
