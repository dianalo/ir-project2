Though all the candidates are paying court to such themes as child care, childhood health and education and family leave, those issues aren't at the top of their political agendas.    &quot;When I listen to a two-hour debate on TV and children aren't mentioned once, what it says to me is we're not taking it seriously,&quot; says David Liederman, director of the Child Welfare League of America. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who has championed these themes in Congress, says the candidates are &quot;not addresssing the work-and-family issues and the modern family and why it's under stress.&quot;    There were many reasons to believe that family issues might loom larger this year. Nationally, the percentage of American married couples with wives in the paid labor force more than doubled to 54% in 1987 from 26% in 1956, and nearly half of the nation's 52 million married-couple families have children under age 18. A poll by Peter Hart Research Associates for the political action committee Kidspac found that 47% of voters said a presidential candidate who emphasized children's issues would appeal to them &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a bit.&quot;    Moreover, many of the men running for president this year aren't generationally too far removed from the Baby Boomers, whose real-life struggles with child care and sick parents invest these issues with genuine appeal. And many of the candidates have experienced in their own families the same dual-career demographic revolution that has shaken up the American family: Hattie Babbitt and Jeanne Simon are attorneys; Kitty Dukakis directs a program at Harvard University; Elizabeth Dole was transportation secretary; Elise du Pont is a former Agency for International Development official.    But observers say more pragmatic political reasons argue against emphasizing family issues. For one thing, Mr. Liederman says that &quot;most of the problems cry out for a major federal policy&quot; probably requiring more federal dollars -- and in an era of massive deficits, candidates don't want to be saddled with big-spender charges. In addition, in a time of strong talk on defense, crime and other issues, &quot;there is still a pervasive need to be tough,&quot; speculates Jeffrey Hallett, an analyst of social and political trends. &quot;They don't want to appear namby-pamby.&quot;    Democrats and Republicans also approach the &quot;family&quot; theme in very different terms. For instance, Ethel Klein, a feminist author and adviser to Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt's campaign, dreams about a &quot;holistic family policy&quot; addressing such problems as care for children, the elderly and handicapped, child poverty, teen pregnancy, and tax changes affecting mothers who work at home.    But while Gary Bauer, assistant to President Reagan for policy development, urges GOP candidates to talk about issues like parental involvement in education and teaching family values, he says: &quot;Of course I hope the Republican candidates avoid getting sucked into a bidding war with Democrats on things like child-care programs.&quot;    All the candidates talk passionately of links between children and the nation's ability to compete, and links between family stability and the productivity of the work force. Almost all promote education reform as a major solution. And almost all would continue or expand government education, health care and nutrition programs for poor children.    Few, though, offer specific ideas about how to fulfill that rhetoric. One who does is Democrat Bruce Babbitt. As governor of Arizona, he once devoted an entire State of the State speech to children's issues, and pushed several programs through a Republican-dominated legislature. As president, he says he would support a national child-care voucher program funded jointly by federal and state money, tax incentives for businesses to establish day-care centers and expansion of the Head Start program. He also backs a federal law giving parents time off from their jobs for childbirth or serious childhood illness.    Another Democrat forceful on these themes is Mr. Gephardt. His campaign has a 40-page &quot;white paper&quot; on family issues and a work and family task force; in Iowa, he recently delivered a moving speech on children that touched on the time when his son Matt, now healthy, was stricken with cancer as a child. Mr. Gephardt would expand prenatal and child health care and nutrition programs, improve education, push for a national family-leave bill, and improve day care. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis favors a national program, patterned on his state's, providing child-care aid and other assistance to welfare mothers seeking jobs.    The other Democrats have ambitious ideas, but generally they've been less visible on these issues. Most support expanded child-care efforts, increased aid to childhood health and nutrition programs and programs for disadvantaged children like Head Start, and a national family-leave law.    Like the Democrats, most GOP candidates support federal aid to nutrition and education programs for disadvantaged children. Not surprisingly, however, the Republicans advocate less-expansive federal roles than do the Democrats. The GOP contenders say there is much that the federal government can do without sharply expanding its role or spending. Vice President George Bush, for example, doesn't want the federal government to provide day-care services or impose standards, but says it can provide leadership to determine &quot;what constitutes a good day-care environment.&quot;    It's debatable which party has more credibility on the themes of family and children. Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who conducted a study on children's issues, thinks they are &quot;largely a Democratic message&quot; that will gain prominence during the general-election campaign. But Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, says that &quot;if the Republicans come out with a series of very reasonable positions, they neutralize the Democrats to some extent.&quot;    The one thing the GOP can't afford to do, Mr. Phillips cautions, is to ignore the issue. &quot;If the conservatives don't touch this at all,&quot; he says, &quot;it becomes a no-lose proposal for the Democrats.&quot;    ---          Where the Candidates Stand on Child Care   Democrats   Bruce Babbitt -- Proposes a national child care voucher program scaled to family income and funded jointly by federal and state money, tax incentives to spur businesses to establish day-care centers, and efforts to help states set up day-care programs before and after school.
