Several other executives of the Phoenix, Ariz.,thrift-holding company also are targeted in the case, saidthe individuals, who didn't identify the other officials. Itisn't clear when the SEC will bring the civil case, althoughindividuals with knowledge of the investigation said none ofthe parties has agreed to settle charges.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC charges focus on the sale of about $250 million ofsecurities in the lobbies of Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation branches in California, the individuals said. TheSEC apparently believes that the thrift sold junk bonds toinvestors under the guise of government-backed securities.Those securities were used to fund operations of AmericanContinental, which was Lincoln's parent. The commission alsohas authorized fraud charges concerning AmericanContinental's financial statements and the way they reflectreal estate transactions of the company, the individualssaid.   SEC officials declined to comment on whether they plan tobring charges. But people close to the agency said thecommission voted to press forward with formal charges in thecase about three weeks ago.   The SEC charges would be the latest in a series of legalproblems for Mr. Keating, whose Lincoln Sandamp;L has become asymbol of the nation's thrift mess. Seven federal and stategovernment agencies are investigating or have charged Mr.Keating in connection with violations of securities laws andfraud. Two former Lincoln associates are cooperating withfederal and state investigators in their cases against Mr.Keating.   &quot;We expected to vigorously contest all charges,&quot; saidStephen Neal, a lawyer for Mr. Keating. Mr. Neal, who said hehadn't heard from the SEC since January, added: &quot;We've had nodiscussions, nor do I expect to have any discussions withthem regarding a settlement.&quot;   Mr. Neal criticized the SEC as being &quot;just one more agencyjumping on the bandwagon&quot; against Mr. Keating. He said theagency has been investigating his client since 1986. &quot;In thistime when we have massive deficits, there is more publicmoney pursuing this man over and over and over, when the coreissues are the same.&quot;   Lincoln Sandamp;L has become the costliest thrift collapse inhistory, with taxpayers footing a bill of about $2.6 billionfor the seizure and liquidation of the thrift, which wasbased in Irvine, Calif. This month, federal regulatorsapproved the sale of Lincoln's branches and deposits to GreatWestern Bank. American Continental has filed for protectionfrom its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal BankruptcyCode.   The SEC charges would be another major step in theagency's program of attacking securities-law violations atmajor financial institutions. SEC Chairman Richard Breeden,who has experience in banking and thrift law, set as anagency priority the cleaning up of public disclosure onfinancial institutions. A task force of about 20 enforcementattorneys and accountants are poring over the records offinancial institutions.   The agency recently brought charges against Bank of NewEngland Corp. for allegedly filing false financial disclosureforms prior to selling millions of dollars of securities.   The Keating charges on financial disclosure would focus onone of the SEC's prime areas of investigation: how companiescommunicate with shareholders. In recent years, the SEC hasbrought a large number of cases centering on misleadingfilings.   The agency doesn't as frequently bring cases that focus onsales practices, although the commission boasts that itspenny-stock task force has been widely successful in stoppingsales abuses in that area.</TEXT></DOC>
