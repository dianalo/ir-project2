The following threemajor aims were set up for PMK through a decision process in Parliamentand the Swedish Government. The overall programme design is based onthem: - to monitor long-term and large-scale changes in the environmentand in that way identify problems; - to collect data about environmentalconditions in relatively unaffected tracts to permit well-founded assessmentsof the situation in more heavily impacted areas; - to illuminate howpollutants are transported. The evaluation of PMK made by an internationalPanel of experts has clearly shown this Programme generally to be ofhigh quality and well under way to become ideally adapted to its aims.It is also our impression that PMK even in its present form yields veryhigh value for the relatively small amounts of money it spends. We thinkPMK should be regarded as an asset both nationally and in an internationalperspective. The Panel concentrated most of its plenary discussions onPMK as a whole; several matters raised in connection with a special projector subprogramme were also found to be of a more general nature. Specialattention is given in the report to conditions considered by us to beeither excellent or less satisfactory, whereas conditions merely regardedas satisfactory are mentioned only briefly or not at all.</TEXT></DOC>
