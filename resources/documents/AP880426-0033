Dr. William M. Bennett said Monday that three medical centersnow are testing the use of fish oil to smooth out the harsh sideeffects of cyclosporine, a drug taken by transplant patients toprevent organ rejection.   The beneficial effects of cyclosporine have made it possible forthousands to receive kidney, heart and liver transplants. Theprimary action of the drug is to supress the body's immune response.   Side effects of the drug, however, can be very serious forpatients already in delicate health.   Bennett, speaking at a National Kidney Foundation seminar, saidvirtually every patient who takes cyclosprine suffers some changein kidney function, probably as the result of constricted flowthrough blood vessels of the kidney.   At least one heart transplant patient, he said, has survived thetransplant operation only to suffer complete kidney failure due tothe toxic effects of cyclosporine.   Bennett, a professor at the Oregon Health Sciences University inPortland, said he and other researchers determined in laboratorystudies that by mixing cyclosporine with a fish oil high in omega-3fatty acid its bad side effects can be reduced without blocking thegood results.   Oil from fishes such as salmon and other cold water fish, saidBennett, are known to reduce the formation of thromboxanes, aprotein that causes blood vessels to constrict. In laboratoryanimals, he said, this effect of fish oil seems to counter kidneydamage caused by cyclosporine.   A limited number of patients now are receiving the fish oil andcyclosporine at clinics in Portland, Ore. and Boston, he said.   Bennett said if the toxic effects of cyclosporine can becountered successfully, then there may be expanded uses for thedrug. Use of cyclosporine has been suggested in such auto immunediseases as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of diabetes.   Another researcher at the National Kidney Foundation seminarsaid extensive clinical trials are under way on a newgenetically-engineered hormone that will counter anemia amongpatients who must depend on artificial kidneys.   Dr. Joseph W. Eschbach, a professor at the University ofWashington in Seattle, said more than 100,000 Americans with failedkidneys are receiving dialysis, a procedure that cleans the bloodof impurities normally filtered out by the kidneys.   Up to 75,000 of these patients suffer from anemia, characterizedby a shortage in their blood of red cells, which carry oxygen tothe cells. For about 25,000, the problem is so serious that theymust receive blood transfusions.   Because of the anemia, Eschbach said that only about a third ofthe dialysis patients are able to return to work and many ``becomepart of the couch. All they can do is just lie there.''   The federal government spends about $2 billion a year caring fordialysis patients, he said, and some of this money could be savedif more patients were able to correct their anemia.   Eschbach said research has shown that the reason for this anemiais that the failed kidneys no longer produce a hormone callederythropoietin. In normal function, the kidneys secrete thishormone when red cells are reduced in the blood. The hormone goesto the bone marrow and causes blood formation tissue there to makemore red blood cells.   Scientists have now isolated the human gene that makes thehormone. This gene has been inserted into the nucleus of Chinesehamster ovary cells which now are producing large amounts oferythropoietin.   Dialysis patients who have received erythropoietin injections,said Eschbach, have recovered from their anemia and many havereturned to work.   Some have improved to the point that they have been able toreceive kidney transplants and are no longer on dialysis, he said.   The hormone now is in clinical trials and is expected to beavailable for general use by next spring.</TEXT></DOC>
