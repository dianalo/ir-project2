The Bush administration, eager to promote the peaceconference that began this week in Madrid and seeking to prodPersian Gulf states to carry out internal political changes,has suspended virtually all arms sales to the Arab world. ButFrance and Britain, whose defense companies are much moredependent on foreign orders than their U.S. counterparts, areshowing no such restraint. Instead, senior government andindustry officials from both countries have stepped upmarketing efforts substantially.</LP><TEXT>   They can claim significant successes.   British Aerospace PLC, for instance, is close to landingwhat could be at least a $5 billion deal to sell the Saudis48 Tornado jet fighters, 60 Hawk trainer aircraft and otherequipment. Just a few months ago, Saudi and U.S. officialsconfidently predicted that business would go primarily toU.S. suppliers; but since then, Saudi leaders privately haveexpressed uncertainty about the U.S. government's willingnessto support arms transactions with Arab states.   French companies, meanwhile, are pushing hard to snare abig chunk of the nearly $5 billion Kuwait has earmarked tobeef up its military over the next few years. France also isclose to a preliminary agreement to supply hundreds of itstop-of-the-line Leclerc tanks to the United Arab Emirates,industry and Pentagon officials say. In October, FrenchDefense Minister Pierre Joxe signed a sweepingmilitary-cooperation agreement with the UAE that is believedto permit the first field tests ever of the next-generationFrench tanks in that country.   &quot;The Europeans are seeking Middle Eastern sales moreaggressively than ever,&quot; says Richard Grimmett, who studiesthe issue for the Congressional Research Service.&quot;Competition and market forces are likely to be moreimportant than political pressure from the U.S.&quot; in shapingfuture arms transactions, he asserts.   &quot;The volume of U.S. sales we saw in the region during the1970s and 1980s just isn't going to reoccur,&quot; frets BrianPolcari, a top executive of a Washington-based company thatprovides housing and other services for employees of U.S.weapons-makers in Saudi Arabia.   The appetite in Arab countries for sophisticated Westernarms increased substantially after Iraq's invasion of Kuwaitlast year. Initially, that was encouraged by the U.S.Administration officials haven't talked publicly about theirchange of heart, but privately they confirm that Secretary ofState James Baker and others in Mr. Bush's inner circle worrythat arms sales would complicate peace efforts.   &quot;The unilateral U.S. embargo on arms sales won't changeuntil the public sees demonstrable evidence that foreigncompetitors are rolling up major sales at our expense,&quot; saysretired Army Gen. Howard Fish, chairman of the AmericanLeague For Exports and Security Assistance, which representsthe largest U.S. defense companies.   When the shooting stopped in the Persian Gulf, fewexpected the U.S. would be the underdog in the Middle Eastarms arena. U.S. business and government leaders anticipatedunprecedented influence and a steady stream of contractsthroughout the Middle East. There was talk of well over $20billion in immediate military business from the Saudis alone.And Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his aides predictedthat the U.S. would work closely with Arab governments toencourage sweeping internal reforms, while building up andtraining their military forces.   The Pentagon also had hopes of leaving behind in SaudiArabia enough tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and otherequipment and ammunition to supply an entire U.S. armoreddivision in case of another crisis. With Arab and Americanforces sharing the same equipment and tactics, U.S. officialsbelieved, it was only a matter of time before the U.S. shareof the region's arms market would increase.   But now, those plans have been dashed. Saudi leaders,seeking to shore up domestic support among fundamentalistreligious groups, have balked at signing the so-called&quot;pre-position&quot; agreements. As a result, nearly all of theU.S. hardware is headed back to Europe or the U.S. Expandedtraining exercises with Saudi units, access to airfields andports, and other joint military efforts also have been put onhold.   &quot;The Saudis are not being very helpful right now,&quot; HouseArmed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) toldreporters recently. &quot;The notion of a cohesive alliance&quot;between the U.S. and the kingdoms in the Persian Gulf, heacknowledged, &quot;probably was hopeless&quot; from the beginning.   Some senior administration officials have sought to holdoff weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulfstates until they carry out internal political changes andsign long-promised military cooperation treaties withWashington. But the availability of British and Frenchsuppliers may have enabled the Middle East leaders to stymiereform proposals despite the pressure from Washington.   In the case of war-ravaged Kuwait, the Pentagon for monthsquietly blocked even preliminary discussion of weapons salesunless new people were brought into the military and otherreforms were carried out. But Mr. Bush apparently didn'tpress the point during a 20-minute session with the Emir ofKuwait several weeks ago. Mr. Cheney subsequently authorizeda study that officials say eventually could lead to U.S. armsdeliveries without any Kuwaiti concessions.   Meanwhile, the French and British have floated separate,tough-sounding proposals recently to clamp down on armsproliferation in the region. But there is widespreadagreement that whatever arms-control regime eventuallyemerges is bound to have loopholes permitting continuedshipment of conventional weapons. U.S. officials worry thatover the long run, China will be most willing to sell itemssuch as long-range missiles, which pose the greatest threatto Israel.   But in the short run, the fiercest arms-selling involvesthe Europeans. For instance, four times more Britishcontractors than U.S. companies have signed up to participatein the international air show scheduled to begin in Dubainext week. Joel Johnson, who tracks foreign sales for theAerospace Industries Association here, says that until thelast few days, Pentagon officials balked at industry requestssimply to park a handful of U.S. warplanes on the tarmac as asymbol of continued U.S. interest in the Arab market.</TEXT></DOC>
