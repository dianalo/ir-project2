According to the first 1992 campaign poll,the leader is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.   The mid-January ABC News survey, which an ABC polling analysttermed ``just a fun read on what people think,'' underscored theMassachusetts senator's standing as the most familiar name amongDemocrats.   ``As my family keeps reminding me, I've been elected president 73times in the past 20 years in polls like this,'' quipped the senator.   Kennedy emerged as the top 1992 presidential choice amongDemocrats or independents leaning Democratic.   ``You're kidding,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the GallupOrganization, when told of the poll.   ``At this point, premature understates the case by a lot,'' saidKohut.   Kelly Hanley, a polling analyst at ABC News, said the survey was``just a fun read on what people think and we found Ted Kennedy atthe top, which we've found in the past never turns out to be true.''   Kennedy is familiar with the role of early front-runner.   In July 1985, Kennedy held a 15-point lead over Gary Hart in aGallup poll measuring Democrats' preferences for the 1988presidential nomination. Kennedy remained the front-runner throughDec. 19, 1985, the day he announced he would not run for president.   In the new survey, Kennedy was the choice of 26 percent of peopleshown a list of seven prominent Democrats and asked ``which of thefollowing persons do you think would be the best candidate for theDemocrats to run in 1992.''   Ms. Hanley said the survey was done because ``we were interestedin seeing what type of support Michael Dukakis had at the moment.''   The 1988 Democratic presidential nominee has announced he willnot seek another term as governor of Massachusetts, but has refusedto rule out a 1992 presidential run.   The ABC poll had him tied for third place with Jesse Jackson. Insecond place was Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.   The top four finishers in the survey were bona fide Democraticliberals, a political species supposedly headed for the endangeredlist after landslide defeats in the last three presidentialelections.   Trailing the four leaders were Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennesseeand Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.   ABC polled 781 people who described themselves as Democrats orindependents who lean toward favoring Democrats. They were contactedbetween Jan. 12 and 16 and the results had a 4-point margin oferror, meaning they could be off as much as four percentage pointsup or down.   Kennedy was the first choice of 26 percent and Cuomo of 19percent. Dukakis and Jackson were named by 15 percent each, whileGore had 6 percent, Bradley 5 and Gephardt 4.   One prominent Democrat not included on the ABC list was TexasSen. Lloyd Bentsen who received highly favorable reviews as theparty's vice presidential candidate in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
