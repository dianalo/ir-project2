Police helicopters were placed on alert and additional guardswere sent to Bolivia's northern border with Brazil, police said.   Gonzalo Torrico, the official responsible for drug interdiction,said the government was concerned Colombia's war against cocainewill ``generate a stampede of traffickers looking for refuge inareas they have contacts.''   There are dozens of cocaine processing labs in northern Bolivia'sBeni jungle region. From there, cocaine is flown to Colombia thendistributed to the United States or Europe.   This impoverished nation of 7 million people produces the rawmaterial for at least one-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. andEuropean markets, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said.   ``The violence and corruption that exists in Colombia could betransferred to Bolivia, especially because of the offensive by theColombian government,'' said Bolivia Sen. Daniel Cabezas, head ofthe Senate committee on drugs.   In June, two Colombian drug traffickers were captured when policeraided the town of Santa Ana de Yacuma, home to some of Bolivia'stop cocaine traffickers. There have been several killings in SantaCruz, 450 miles east of La Paz, involving Colombian drug runners,police have said.   ``Our problem in controlling the flow of traffickers fromColombia is that we do not have the resources to control our airspace,'' Cabezas said.   Police said the border patrols were reinforced and policehelicopters placed on alert.   At least 350,000 Bolivians make their livings growing cocaleaves. The leaves are processed into cocaine paste, which isrefined into cocaine.</TEXT></DOC>
