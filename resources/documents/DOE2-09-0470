However, the optimizationof read-out gradient strengths for specific clinical applications isnot well documented. The authors compared image quality (in terms ofS/N, tissue contrast and boundary definition) in 20 patients with brainlesions and 20 patients with head and neck lesions. All patients werescanned on a 1-T system using gradient strengths of 11.56 mT/cm and 0.78mT/cm. The authors found improved S/N and increased contrast in the lowbandwidth images of the CNS. Chemical shift effects were negligible inthese images but were increased and significantly degraded in the headand neck examination. Therefore, the authors recommend a choice of twobandwidths for &quot;neuroradiologic&quot; examinations: low for CNS studies andhigh for head and neck studies.</TEXT></DOC>
