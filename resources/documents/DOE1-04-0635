The previouslyproposed yrast scheme below {approx_equal}3 MeV has been verified andeight further transitions placed in the level scheme. Mean lives of the6/sup +/, 8/sup +/ and (10/sup +/) states at 1355, 1476 and 1834 keVhave been measured at 1.1 (3), 24.6 (3) and 0.8 (2) ns respectively.Shell model calculations using effective interactions were used to interpretthe observed scheme. A synthesis of all available theoretical and experimentalevidence allows the tau/sub m/ = 65 s isomer to be identified clearlyas the 18/sup +/ level arising primarily from the {pi}(h/sup 2//sub 9/2/)* {nu}(g/sub 9/2/i/sub 11/2/) configuration.</TEXT></DOC>
