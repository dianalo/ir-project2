In the experimentalfacility used for obtaining the data, air and triethylene glycol circulatecountercurrently outside staggered copper tubes which are the fillingof an absorption tower. Water flows inside the copper tubes, thus coolingthe whole system and increasing the mass transfer potential for dryingair. The methodology for calculating the mass transfer coefficient isbased on the Merkel integral approach, taking into account the loweringof the water vapor pressure in equilibrium with the water glycol solution.</TEXT></DOC>
