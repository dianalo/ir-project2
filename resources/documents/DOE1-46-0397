Here the authorsshow that mast cell degranulating (MCD) peptide from bee venom inhibitsthe binding of {sup 125}I-labeled {beta}-Butx to chick and rat brainmembranes with apparent K/sub i/ values of 180 nM and 1100 nM, respectively.The mechanisms of inhibition of MCD peptide is noncompetitive, as isinhibition of {sup 125}I-{beta}-Butx binding by the protease inhibitorhomologue from mamba venom, toxin I. {beta}-Butx and its binding antagoniststhus bind to different sites of the same membrane protein. Removal ofCa{sup 2+} by ethylene glycol bis({beta}-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraaceticacid inhibits the binding of {sup 125}I-{beta}-Butx by lowering its affinityto brain membranes.</TEXT></DOC>
