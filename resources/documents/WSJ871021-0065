As Treasury Secretary James Baker returned from Europe to crisis meetings here yesterday, the West German central bank cut short-term interest rates for the first time in months. That was a move the U.S. has long favored, and it resulted from the understanding Mr. Baker worked out Monday in a meeting with top West German officials.    A senior administration official confirmed that Mr. Baker and his West German counterparts agreed to alter the eight-month old Louvre accord on exchange-rate stability to tolerate a somewhat lower exchange rate for the dollar against the mark, and to commit West Germany to a somewhat more stimulative monetary policy. In return, the U.S. agreed to join in defending the dollar at the new levels.    The dollar rose sharply yesterday against both the West German mark and Japanese yen, as the markets gained confidence that the seven-nation Louvre pact is still alive.    But Mr. Baker still faces criticism here and abroad that his public campaign of pressing Bonn to cut rates, featuring threats to let the dollar fall, was ill-timed. Critics complained the campaign rattled investors just when the stock markets were beginning their fall late last week, and thus exacerbated the crash.    The senior administration official rebutted these criticisms yesterday, saying the Baker campaign had been necessary to reverse a high-interest rate psychology building in the bond markets as a result of West German increases. He said that Mr. Baker's statements had been expected mainly to affect the bond and currency markets, not the stock markets.    President Reagan, in a televised statement late yesterday, stressed that the major countries are working together on economic policy. He declared that &quot;the United States remains committed to the Louvre agreement.&quot;    Mr. Reagan said that Monday, &quot;Secretary Baker and his German counterpart reaffirmed our agreement with the Germans to coordinate our economic policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates.&quot; And he added that he personally had been assured by Japan's prime minister-designate, Noboru Takeshita, &quot;that his top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States.&quot;    While markets were pleased with the results of Mr. Baker's talks with the West Germans, there was continued criticism of the U.S. Treasury secretary's public pressure tactics, which were more typical of U.S. politics than the discreet methods of finance ministers.    &quot;I understand what he was trying to do, and it looks like it worked with the Germans,&quot; said Robert Hormats, a former Reagan administration economic official now with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;But it was a mistake to do it publicly. You can't do these things publicly without upsetting markets.&quot;    A senior European economic official added: &quot;If you are sitting on a situation that is as unstable as that of the U.S., you have to be doubly careful with market confidence. But the U.S., in what it did, was doubly uncareful.&quot;    Mr. Baker launched his campaign against West German interest rate increases last Thursday during a White House briefing that otherwise was devoted to soothing descriptions of stability and prosperity.    The Treasury secretary, concerned that the West German rate rises had caused markets to believe interest rates would rise in the U.S., blasted the West German policy. He warned that the Federal Reserve wouldn't follow with rate rises of its own, and hinted that the officially supported range for the dollar's value against the mark, embodied in the Louvre pact, might be altered to reflect that fact. That suggested that the dollar might be allowed to fall further against the mark.    Mr. Baker's remarks were made after he had privately scheduled Monday's meeting in West Germany, and after the tumble in the market had begun. But he apparently was hoping to build pressure on Bonn, and he repeated similar remarks in three television interviews over the weekend, pausing only to deny a New York Times story that the U.S. already had adopted a lower dollar rate against the mark.    The senior administration official defended the strategy, saying critics were exhibiting &quot;very good 20-20 hindsight.&quot; He conceded that Mr. Baker's statements &quot;might have had some impact on the stock markets&quot; Monday, but declared, &quot;I don't think that anybody knows what causes a 500-point drop.&quot;    &quot;When you talk about the Louvre agreement, about exchange rates and interest rates, you normally are impacting only the bond markets and the foreign exchange markets, not the stock markets,&quot; he said. &quot;Those markets have been doing what we hoped they would.&quot;    While the stock markets started dropping last week, the official said the administration couldn't have forecast that the drop would turn into a crash. If the administration had known the market was about to crash, he said, it wouldn't have risked exacerbating the plunge to carry out Mr. Baker's strategy for West German rate reductions.    The Louvre accord system, which was designed to govern exchange rates and coordinate economic policy among the seven countries, is likely to face continued tests both from markets and member governments, as the governments struggle to reconcile conflicting economic priorities.    In the U.S., the government's ability to keep the dollar stable will depend on its success in keeping the budget deficit dropping while chipping away at the trade deficit, avoiding inflation and still maintaining growth. Yesterday, the president announced new negotiations with Congress on ways to cut the budget deficit.    In Japan, to win the confidence of the markets, the new prime minister will have to show continued willingness to stimulate domestic demand and pull back on exports without setting off inflation.    The West German government, which has been split on both fiscal and monetary policy, will have to continue to show sensitivity to U.S. demands for stimulus without raising domestic fears of inflation. The next test in West Germany will come tomorrow, when the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, is scheduled to hold a governing council meeting. In attendance will be Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, who has squabbled recently with Bank President Karl Otto Poehl over fiscal policy.    In Bonn yesterday, Mr. Stoltenberg said at a news conference that he and Mr. Baker &quot;have agreed to continue our successful cooperation in the field of economic policy.&quot; Clearly seeking to build confidence, he called such cooperation &quot;very important&quot; at a time of &quot;irrational&quot; behavior in stock markets around the globe.    &quot;I see the first positive responses (to the meeting) in the . . . improvement of the dollar and in the lowering of interest rates in the U.S. and now in Europe,&quot; Mr. Stoltenberg asserted. After the briefing, he added confidently: &quot;My meeting with Jim Baker had a good effect.&quot;    Although Mr. Stoltenberg wouldn't elaborate on the talks, the U.S. Treasury secretary clearly won West German assurances to change course on domestic interest rates. Yesterday, the Bundesbank wasted no time acting on its promise.    The West German central bank controls liquidity in the banking system through its repurchase agreements, which are similar to the Federal Reserve Board's open market transactions. Yesterday, the Bundesbank chose to fix the rate it charges on repurchase agreements at 3.8%, lower than the 3.85% fee at which funds were offered last week.    The central bank had been raising interest rates since July through its repurchase agreements because of fears that continued strong growth in the West German money supply could fuel inflation.    Those fears still exist. But even Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's vice president and the most outspoken proponent of tight credit policies, appears resigned to higher monetary growth for now. Mr. Schlesinger said in a speech yesterday that the overshooting of money supply targets can be condoned -- temporarily -- during &quot;crisis&quot; situations.    ---   Thomas F.
