 The California-based company has cobbledtogether a PostScript printing system based on two discontinue components: aCanon CX engine (the one used in the original Hewlett-Packard LaserJet) and aQMS PostScript controller board.andM;It Seems that Federal Express made a big investment (and a big mistake) witha worldwide fax-mail system in which the printing component was based onCanon laser printers marketed under the NEC label.andP;  When the project fellthrough, The Printer Works bought the old laser printers, refurbished them,and paired them with older-generation PostScript controller boards.andP;  The netresult may not be state of the art, but it performs 300 dot-per-inchPostScript printing for $995--a previously unheard-of price.andM;There's nothing flashy or fancy about the printer--no liquid crystaldisplays, no push-botton menu controls, and no cartridge slots.andP;  It has fivelights (Ready, Paper Out, Paper Jam, and two repair indicators), a test printbutton, an image density (contrast) dial, and a power switch.andP;  It's bulky asthe original HP LaserJet, taking up a space measuring 20 by 24 by 12 inchesand weighing in at 60 pounds, and shows none of the aerodynamic styling ofthe new laser printers.andP;  The printer doesn't contain any memory, but that'sbecause the QMS JetScript controller card it comes with the 3MB of it.andM;Installation is relatively painless.andP;  You have to open up your computer toinsert the controller board, which functions as a second parallel port andcomes with all jumpers set for LPT2.andP;  You then open the printer to insert theEP toner cartridge (rated for 3,000 pages).andP;  Finally, you install a four-diskset of programs onto your hard drive, which will automatically load font andother PostScript code into the 3MB of RAM on the controller.andM;One major caveat: Your applications programs must have a PostScript printerdriverandgt; otherwise you're out of luck.andP;  There are no Hp or Epsonemulations--it's a PostScript-ony printer.andP;  If you need to, you can buy autility program to convert your PostScript file to another type.andP;  PSFX ($85)by Legend Communications, Inc., of Ontario, Canada, translates the date soyou can use a PostScript printer with Epson FX drivers.andP;  (PSFX is availablefrom The Printer Works.)andM;For PostScript output, the manual that comes with the JetScript controllerrecommends the QMS PS 800, QMS PS 810, Apple LaserWriter Plus, or genericPostScript drivers.andP;  I opted for the QMS PS 810 driver and had no problemschurning out text or graphics.andP;  Lines and large, solid blocks are jet black,with little streaking and good density.andP;  The fonts are sharp no matter whatthe typeface, size, or angle.andP;  On the graphics front, the printer competentlypresents 300-dpi images in stark contrast to the page and does a superb jobof printing gradations flowing from black to white.andM;If you have any problems with the printer, the Printer Work' technicians arehelpful, knowledgeable, andd willing to take time to explain features,functions, and maintenance procedures.andP;  If they are busy (and that happenedonce), they will take a mesage and call you back-- in my case, within a halfhour.andM;Of course, if you don't need PostScript, you don't need to invest $995 in anolder technology laser printer when you get an HP IIP for the same price, orthe new III for about $1,700.andP;  But the JetScript CX beats in installing aPostScript controller in certain printers (one for the Okidata 820 will setyou back $1,895, although the card for the IBM 4019 costs only $900) and canbe a viable alternative to getting a PostScript cartridge (HP's cartridge forthe HP IIP and III laser printers lists for $695).andM;All in all, there's still a lot of life in these refurbished printers.andP;  ThePrinter Works says most of the refurbished lasers have printed about 2,000 to5,000 pages.andP;  Canon rates engine life at 100,000 pages, so you should have alot of leeway.andP;  The JetScript C-X offers good solid PostScript printing at anattractive price.q</TEXT></DOC>
