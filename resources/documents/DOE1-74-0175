Total costs for all largediagnostic and therapeutic appliances are typically less than 1% of annualexpenditure on health care. CT, DSA, MRI, interventional radiology, ESWL,US, mammography, computers in radiology and PACS may save 10-80% of totalcost for diagnosis and treatment of disease. Expenditure on high technologyis in general vastly overestimated. Because of its medical utility, aslower deployment cannot be desirable. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
