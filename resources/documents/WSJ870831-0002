Terms weren't disclosed.    KaiserTech said it would post a gain on the sale this quarter, but it wouldn't be more specific. The acquisition includes a 185,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Indiana, some production equipment from a plant in California, and a small specialty manufacturing operation in Illinois. These operations accounted for about $60 million of Kaiser's 1986 sales of $2.22 billion.    Packaging Corp., which owns and operates Ekco Packaging, said it will manage the Kaiser facilities as part of its Disposable Packaging Group.    KaiserTech, a holding company, called the sale part of its plan to focus on lines that offer &quot;significant competitive advantage.&quot; The aluminum and chemical concern said the operations sold are profitable and employ about 150 workers. It recently said that, to reduce debt, it had put its industrial and specialty chemicals business up for sale, and is considering the sale of certain aluminum operations, or their participation in joint ventures. </TEXT></DOC>
