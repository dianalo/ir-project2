Loring Wyllie, a San Francisco structural engineer and co-leaderof an American team of experts that surveyed the Soviet earthquakesite, said most of the buildings that collapsed were poorlyconstructed, built from a common design and of concrete thatcollapsed ``like a stack of cards.''   ``We would have a lot less loss of life due to the diversity ofour construction,'' Wyllie said at a news conference.   He said the Soviet buildings were constructed from blueprintsdeveloped in Moscow for use throughout the Soviet Union. Most of thedestroyed buildings had been were built in recent years usingprefabricated concrete parts ``not at all of the quality you wouldfind here in the United States,'' he said.   ``If that kind of construction happened on a job here in theUnited Stastes, the inspector would have rejected it and thecontractor would have to redo it,'' said Wyllie.   He said concrete used in the Soviet construction was ``frequentlyfilled with rock pockets'' that weakened the material, and thatconcrete beams were often joined together in a haphazard fashion.   As a result, when the earthquake struck, buildings up to 10stories high collapsed very quickly, he said.   Fred Krimgold, an expert from the Virginia Polytechnic Instituteand a member of an American search and resuce team that arrived inArmenia four days after the earthquake, said the building design wasa prime factor in the high number of deaths.   ``The floor system of these buildings is made up of (concrete)planks,'' he said. ``When these floors collapsed, we got very tight,compact rubble'' with few voids where people might have survived.   ``As a result, this was one of the most deadly earthquakes we'veseen,'' said Krimgold. ``Typically, the ratio of injury to fatalityis on the order of three or four to one. In this earthquake, it wasthe reverse.''   Krimgold said that though the official death toll of theearthquake has been placed at about 24,000, he believes the exactnumber will never be well-documented. Some Soviet officials, hesaid, estimated that there were more than 100,000 unregisteredpeople living in the area and that thousands of bodies buried in therubble will never be recovered.   The rubble of many buildings that were thought to contain people,said Krimgold, now are simply being bulldozed level with no effortto recover bodies.   ``There have been 24,000 bodies recovered,'' he said. ``But don'tmistake the number of bodies found with the actual number of dead.... Fifty to sixty thousand, probably 60, is a reasonable estimate.''   Krimgold, who has participated in rescue efforts followingearthquakes in Mexico and Central America, said more people survivedin those disasters because the buildings collapsed in large pieces.These large pieces left hollows or pockets within the rubble wheretrapped people could survive until they were rescued.   Delays in reaching trapped Soviet victims also cost many lives,he said.   ``We uncovered a number of people who unfortunately had died onlyrecently before we got to them. They were not dead at the time ofthe collapse,'' said Krimgold. ``Many people died of exposuretrapped in the buildings. The nighttime temperature was belowfreezing.''   The Armenian earthquake struck around 11:40 a.m. on Dec. 7. Themain shock measured 6.8 on the Richter scale, which is considered astrong quake. It was followed a few minutes later by an after-shockthat measured 5.8.   About 80 percent of buildings in Leninakan, a town of 250,000,were leveled, and a number of smaller towns nearby were destroyed.   John Filson, a U.S. Geological Survey expert and a co-leader ofthe American team, said after-shocks continue in the area with onemeasuring 5.0 occurring as recently as Saturday.   Filson and Wyllie headed an 18-member team of specialistsorganized by the USGS, the National Academy of Sciences and theNational Science Foundation at the request of Soviet authorities.The group spent two weeks in the Armenian earthquake area gatheringscientific and engineering information in collaboration with Sovietexperts.   Filson said the information will be analyzed and sharedinternationally in an effort to better understand earthquakes andhow to construct safer buildings in areas of seismic activity.</TEXT></DOC>
