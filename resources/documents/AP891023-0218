Soon, they would be using the weapon in a conflictthat is almost 70 years old _ the Kurds' fight for an independenthomeland in Iran.   The Iraqi-backed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran has in recentweeks stepped up its attacks on Iranian military bases and economictargets.   Guerrilla chieftains at the KDP base camp here in the Iraqimountains said the youngsters will go into action, as their fathersand grandfathers have before them, in the mountains of northwesternIran.   ``They get three months' training in weapons, explosives andguerrilla tactics, then join units inside Iran to carry outhit-and-run attacks,'' said the camp commander, who would identifyhimself only as Salam.   It is a war that has largely been overshadowed by Kurdishcampaigns in neighboring Turkey and in Iraq itself. In southeasternTurkey, the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party has been fighting aguerrilla war for five years to establish a separate Marxist state.   About 20 million Kurds _ Sunni Moslems of Aryan stock _ live inan overlapping area where the borders of Soviet Armenia, Iran,Iraq, Syria and Turkey converge, a region once known as Kurdistan.   Iraq, Iran and Turkey all have faced rebellions by their Kurdishminorities. But Iraq is nonetheless backing the Iranian Kurds in anextension of its decades-old rivalry with Iran.   Iran backed Iraqi Kurds in their war against the government inBaghdad during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. Syria aids Kurdishfighters in Turkey.   The KDP fighters, clearly with Iraqi consent, stepped up theirattacks after their veteran leader, Abdul-Rahman Qassemlou, wasassassinated July 13 in Vienna, Austria.   His successor, Sa'eed Badal, said Qassemlou went to Vienna inresponse to an offer from Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani tonegotiate an end to the Kurdish rebellion.   Badal said he believes Qassemlou was killed by agents of radicalIranian factions in an attempt to torpedo Rafsanjani's efforts toend the mountain war, a move that would have strengthened hiscredibility as a pragmatist.   Sa'eed said the KDP has turned down an Iranian proposal toresume negotiations because ``we no longer trust them.''   The guerrillas, known as Peshmergas, or ``those who facedeath,'' say hundreds of young Iranian Kurds have joined them inrecent months.   Kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claimthey are pinning down some 200,000 Iranians. Diplomatic sources inBaghdad estimated that as many as 2,500 KDP guerrillas are in Iraq,with thousands more operating inside Iran.   ``Everybody in my village said the Peshmergas are working for abetter future for the Kurdish nation, so I decided to join them,''said Farouk Hassan Pour, 14, who trekked across the mountains forseven days until the guerrillas found him.   About 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in thiscamp high in the northern Iraqi mountains overlooking the Iranianborder.   In the camp are about 1,000 guerrillas, dressed in theirdistinctive baggy trousers and turbans. Several thousand Kurdishwomen and children live in villages in the surrounding valleys.   The KDP runs the camp, but the area is under Iraqi militarycontrol. The guerrillas are not allowed to leave without Iraqipermission.   The Kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in thelush uplands. The Iraqis provide flour, rice and fuel oil.   A rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp forguerrillas who have lost limbs. Among the 30 undergoing therapy isIsmail Muradi, 23, who lost an arm in a recent raid.   ``I don't care if I have to live in this camp, deprived of thegood things of life, for 50 years, so long as the next generationof Kurds can live as free human beings,'' said Muradi, who joinedthe guerrillas last year.   A five-member French medical team from two relief agencies,Medecins Sans Frontieres and International Medical Aid, operates amakeshift hospital in the base. The team alternates with others whospend three-month tours in the mountains.   ``Conditions are pretty primitive,'' said Dr. Jean Breveau, asurgeon from Paris who is on his third tour. ``We've eliminatedserious diseases, but there's a lot of malnutrition and back pains,which are common among mountain people.''   Breveau, who also has worked in Africa and with Tamil rebels inSri Lanka off southern India, said he misses life in Paris and hisfamily.   ``But these people need my help more than the people of Paris,''he said. ``There's a great satisfaction when you save someone whowould have died if there had been no surgeon.''   The Kurds were promised an independent state in the Treaty ofSevres of 1920. But the great powers sliced up Kurdistan amongIran, Iraq and Turkey.   Since then, the Kurds have been in a constant state of revoltagainst one or more of these states. The Kurdish revolt in Persia,which later became known as Iran, began in 1920.   Kurdish hopes of self-rule have been hampered by internalrivalries that have prevented a unified strategy.   Nonetheless, morale among the Iranian Kurds in Iraq appears high.   Qader Agha Ibrahimi, an 83-year-old former Iranian army officer,joined the rebels 43 years ago when the Soviets seized part ofnorthern Iran in 1945 and set up the short-lived Kurdish Mahabadrepublic.   It lasted only about a year before the Iranians reclaimed theterritory. It's the closest the Kurds anywhere have ever come tohaving an independent state.   ``I've spent half my life fighting for freedom and Kurdistan,''said Ibrahimi, now frail and going deaf. ``They've been hard,difficult years. But I still believe that one day we will win.''   One of his sons was killed fighting the Iranians. Three othersare in Iran.   ``I've never laid down my gun,'' the grizzled old warrior said,patting his AK-47 assault rifle.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
