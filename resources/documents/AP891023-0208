The arid plains of southern Afghanistan are quiet again, thesound of warplanes and exploding artillery shells replaced by therustle of the hot desert wind through the grapevines.   Atop the shattered mud villages, above the tents pitched bynomads and in the fields where camels graze, the black and whiteand red and green flags of the Moslem resistance flutter in thebreeze.   An undeclared truce exists between the soldiers defending thegovernment in Kabul and the mujahedeen guerrillas who rule thecountryside around Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city andthe cradle of its now-deposed monarchy.   Despite the uncertainty of its durability, the peace is luringthousands of refugees like Ghulam home.   ``I could have stayed in Pakistan where I know my family wouldbe safe,'' said Ghulam. ``But believe me, I love this destroyedcountry a thousand times more. I could never be happy anywhereelse.''   In August 1983, Soviet tanks rumbled into Shawl-i-Court andunleashed a fierce barrage lasting nearly 30 hours to routsuspected guerrillas hiding inside the mud-walled compound.   Ghulam, his family and a few of the other 1,000 families whosurvived the barrage fled 120 miles to Pakistan, where they livedwith 170,000 other refugees in a camp near the desert town ofChaman.   Nearly 6 million Afghans are living in refugee camps in Pakistanand Iran, the bases of the resistance groups trying to overthrowthe government of President Najib.   Most Afghan refugees are anxious to return to a country wherewar has been raging for 11 years. Even though the struggle shows noapparent signs of ending, some like Ghulam have become impatient atthe lack of military victory or negotiated settlement and are goinghome.   International relief agencies and government officials estimateabout 100,000 Afghans have returned since the Soviet troops left inFebruary. But they acknowledge they cannot accurately gauge theflow because of the country's porous borders and lack of anycentral authority.   ``I was born here,'' said Ghulam, a 33-year-old farmer, finallyback home. ``My father and grandfather were born here. This is homeand I want it to be my children's home. Why shouldn't we come back?The Soviets are gone and God willing, peace will come soon.''   It was before dawn when Ghulam, his wife and their two children,his father, aunt, uncle and three cousins packed their belongingsand piled into a battered blue pickup truck, said goodbye to thosestaying behind at the Chaman camp and headed for the border.   Ghulam seemed apprehensive at first, wondering whether Pakistaniborder guards would force them to turn back or demand steep priceshe could not pay.   When the border guards waved them by and they plowed through thesandy plain, the excitement on Ghulam's wizened face became asinfectious as a child's joy on Christmas morning.   ``This is really Afghanistan. One day we'll all be back,'' hesaid as the group headed toward Spin Buldak, the border postcaptured by the guerrillas in November.   ``Welcome to Free Aghanistan.'' The sign was spray-painted onthe side of a building on which a white flag had been planted.   Beyond lay the remains of a once-bustling tourist informationcenter, a crumbling reminder of the Western hippy trail of theearly 1970s.   A few guerrillas, their rifles strapped over their shoulders,sat by a campfire in the center of the shattered buildings andcaptured Soviet tanks. As Ghulam and his family chugged down theroad, weaving from side to side to avoid the huge potholes left byyears of neglect, his thoughts frequently turned to his two sons,among the 700,000 Afghan children born in exile.   ``All their lives they have seen mujahedeen coming in and out ofthe house and they have idealized Afghanistan,'' he said. ``Forthem, this is supposed to be the most beautiful country in theworld. I fear they may hate me for the deception.''   Along the road cutting across what was once one of Afghanistan'smost densely populated provinces, there is now only destruction andthe tattered flags marking the graves of some of the 1.5 millionAfghans who have died in the struggle against the Marxistgovernment that seized power in April 1978.   They passed through a guerrilla checkpoint and then turned downa narrow dirt path, bouncing along the rocky, barren terrain,weaving between the ox carts, the Land Rovers and huge trucks withtheir cargoes concealed under burlap covers.   They reached another potholed road lined with burned and rustingshells of more than 100 Soviet tanks, armored personnel carriersand rocket launchers. The destruction along the road was startling_ a huge silo built by the Soviet lay in ruins and houses andbuildings lay in ruins. And in the midst of vast destruction, theblue-domed masoleum of an Afghan king stood unscratched.   Then, the 10-hour journey was over; they were home and it wasmealtime.   The family sat cross-legged in the ruined house of an old friendand guerrilla commander. All ate from the same plates _ their firstmeal in ``Free Afghanistan.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
