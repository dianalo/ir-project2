Four models for the implementation of telecommuting are theprogrammatic division model, in which management targets aparticular area of the company for telecommuting; the corporatepolicy model, under which individual employees company-wide cannegotiate telecommuting arrangements with supervisors; the ad hocmodel, in which local supervisors privately approve employeerequests to work at home without formal company support; and theindependent contractor model.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TelecommutingPersonnel ManagementManagement of EDPProductivityData CommunicationsBusiness PlanningWork at Home.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   12 tips for making telecommuting work. (table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Remote Control TELECOMMUTING--SUBSTITUTING THE computer for the commute--hasbeen hailed as a solution to all kinds of problems related to office work.andM;For workers, it promises freedom from the office, less time wasted intraffic, and help with child-care conflicts.andP;  For management, telecommutinghelps keep high performers on board, minimizes tardiness and absenteeism byeliminating commutes, allows periods of solitude for high-concentrationtasks, and provides scheduling flexibility.andP;  In some areas, such as SouthernCalifornia and Seattle, local governments are encouraging companies to starttelecommuting programs in order to reduce rush-hour congestion and improveair quality.andM;But these benefits don't come easily.andP;  Making a telecommuting program workrequires careful planning and an understanding of the differences betweentelecommuting realities and popular images.andM;Many workers are seduced by rosy illusions of life as a telecommuter.andP;  Acomputer programmer from New York City moves to the tranquil Adirondacks andstays in contact with her Manhattan office via computer.andP;  A manager comesinto the office three days a week and works at home the other two.andP;  Anaccountant stays home to care for her sick child; she hooks up her modem anddoes office work between calls to the doctor.andM;These are powerful images, but they are limited reflections of reality.andM;Telecommuting workers soon learn that it's almost impossible to concentrateon work and care for a young child at the same time.andP;  Before a certain age,children simply cannot recognize, much less respect, the necessary boundariesbetween work and family.andP;  Additional child care is necessary if the parentintends to get any work done.andM;Management, too, must separate the myth from the reality.andP;  For one thing,although the media has paid a great deal of attention to computer-driventelecommuting, in most cases it is an employee's situation, not theavailability of technology, that precipitates a telecommuting arrangement.andM;That's partly why, despite the widespread press coverage, the number ofcompanies with work-at-home programs or policy guidelines remains small.andP;  Idirected a 1988 telecommuting survey of large corporations for The ConferenceBoard, a New York--based research organization, and New Ways to Work, a smallSan Francisco--based advocacy group.andP;  Out of 521 large corporations thatresponded, only 29 firms made such an arrangement available to employeesoutside the sales divisions, and in 18 of these firms only 5 or feweremployees participated.andM;Of course, counting only companies with official telecommuting policiesunderestimates the full extent of work-at-home arrangements.andP;  Interviews withcorporate personnel made it clear that many employees arrange private,unofficial deals with their supervisors that allow them to work at home for acertain number of days a week.andM;Official ReluctanceandM;Although they may allow informal arrangements, many companies are reluctantto institutionalize telecommuting.andP;  One reason for this resistance is thatmost managers want to see their employees at work.andP;  The unstated assumptionis that if employees are visible, they're working.andP;  The longer they'revisible during the course of a day, the greater their productivity must be.andM;Telecommuting violates this assumption.andP;  When employees work at home,managers aren't able to keep tabs on them.andP;  If workers can't be seen, theymight not be working.andM;So, if companies are reluctant to let employees out of their sight, how aregrowing numbers of employees managing to negotiate such arrangements?andM;As long as things are running smoothly in terms of staffing and production,managers see little advantage in considering telecommuting or otheralternative work schedules.andP;  But as commutes lengthen, labor markets tightenup, and demands for flexibility from two-career families increase, companiesface increased pressure to recruit and retain top talent.andM;Telecommuting can provide a viable way to keep high performers contributingto the company.andP;  If, for example, a spouse relocates to another city, or if awoman returns from maternity leave but can't be away from home all day,telecommuting makes it possible for the relationship between company andemployee to continue.andM;Management can also use telecommuting as a lifestyle perk or in addition to asalary increase to entice high performers to stay with the firm.andP;  Theflattening of the corporate hierarchy means fewer middle managementpromotions for the baby-boom generation, and telecommuting lets some valuedemployees opt for work schedules that enhance their lifestyle preferences--ineffect, trading job advancement for quality of life.andP;  Properly instituted,telecommuting can expand employees' work-family options and increase the sizeand richness of the labor pool.andM;Just as important, telecommuting may actually boost productivity.andP;  Informallynegotiated telecommuting arrangements work well for high-level employees whoneed a quiet environment in which to complete high-concentration tasks.andM;Ways and MeansandM;Companies can institute telecommuting in four basic ways: programmaticdivision, company-wide policy guidelines, ad hoc arrangements with localsupervisors, and independent contractor arrangements.andP;  Each has its benefitsand drawbacks.andM;THE PROGRAMMATIC DIVISION MODEL: This style of telecommuting carves out aprogrammatic area of the company--such as telephone sales or data entry--andtargets it for telecommuting.andM;Under this arrangement, telecommuting can actually save capital costs:permanently switching a percentage of the work force off-site reduces theneed for new facilities.andM;On the downside, the program can lose its value as a morale-enhancer if thecompany fails to make the eligibility criteria explicit.andP;  Other divisions maywonder why the telecommuters were singled out for special treatment.andO;Management must make it clear to the entire company that the nature of thedivision's work makes telecommuting necessary.andM;J.andP;  C. Penney Company, owner of the large department store chain, hassuccessfully used the programmatic approach.andP;  In 1981, in order to handlesurges of incoming calls at its telephone sales centers in Atlanta,Milwaukee, and Columbus, Ohio, the company selected about a half-dozentelephone sales associates to work at home in each of the three cities.andM;Today, eight of J. C. Penney's 16 telemarketing centers have telecommutingprograms, with a total of 206 telecommuters working at home.andP;  To make surehome-based employees are up to speed on catalogs and sales procedures, thecompany requires them to have at least one year of experience at the in-housephone center.andP;  Each telecommuter is equipped with a computer terminal and twotelephone lines--one for voice communications and one for data.andM;A company representative visits home-based employees to ensure that they haveappropriate work spaces in their homes--measuring about 35 square feet andoff the beaten path of home traffic.andP;  In terms of salary, benefits, andpromotions, the telecommuters have the same opportunities as the company'sphone-center associates.andM;A centralized call-forwarding system routes customer calls to home-basedassociates.andP;  This makes it possible for the company to respond quickly tosudden surges in demand.andP;  If necessary, J. C. Penney can get a telecommuterto cover a phone within five minutes, whereas it might take hours for thatperson to get to a phone center.andM;Individual productivity has stayed constant or even increased, and home-basedassociates report feeling a closer relationship with customers than they feelin a phone center.andP;  Associates feel more responsible because they are ontheir own, not lost amid the clamor of a 300-person office.andM;THE CORPORATE POLICY MODEL: A fes companies have taken the concept oftelecommunicating even further, establishing policies that allow employeesthroughout the company to negotiate telecommuting arrangements with theirsupervisors.andM;Creating a corporate-wide telecommuting policy opens up eligibility acrossdivisions, reducing divisional rivalries and enhancing the authority of localsupervisors.andP;  On the other hand, even a fabulous corporate policy can beshort-circuited by local supervisors who are threatened by the concept.andP;  Anappeal process is necessary to ensure even implementation.andM;Pacific Bell in California is one company with a corporate telecommutingphilosophy.andP;  In 1985, when PacBell instituted an 18-month pilot telecommutingprogram for 100 workers, its position was simple and direct: in order for anemployee to work at home, it must be demonstrated that the arrangement willsuit the needs of the company and the needs of the employee.andM;The corporate philosophy legitimzes te option for supervisors and workers.andO;Before the recent San Francisco earthquake, an estimated 500 to 1,000 PacBellemployees were telecommuting on any given day.andP;  Even more employees tookadvantage of the policy in the days following the quake.andM;The PacBEll approach covers management and employees in a wide range ofpositions, including computer analysts, programmers, engineers, systemsanalysts, PR people, and accounting personnel.andP;  All are paid exactly as theywould be if they worked in the office, including health and pension benefits.andO;The company pays for all necessary equipment and telephone costs.andP;  PacificBell advises telecommuters to work at the office at least once a week inorder to maintain some presence there.andM;While PacBell doesn't expect telecommuting to be a regular solution tochild-care conflicts, the program can relieve short-term problems, such asallowing a parent to work at home when a child is too sick to go to schoolbut not so sick that he needs constant attention.andP;  Other companies may tailortheir guidelines to create work-family options.andP;  IBM's telecommuting program,for example, is designed primarily for women returning from maternity leave.andM;THE AD HOC MODEL: In ad hoc telecommuting arragements, localsupervisors--without formal support from the company--privately approveemployee requests to work at home.andP;  These arrangements generally cover alimited number of days a week, typically run for a finite period of time, andoften correspond to a project deadline or a family need.andP;  Most employeesworking at home today are likely to be doing so under such an informal plan.andM;Ad hoc arrangements have a number of advantages.andP;  They allow flexibleresponses to problems or crises with a minimum of paperwork.andP;  High performerscan earn special treatment from their local supervisors.andP;  And because thearrangements are unofficial, employees who feel left out can't complain aboutany specific company policy.andM;Of course, with no formal rules, supervisors can easily abuse their power.andO;Employees and supervisors who are involved in ad hoc arrangements can becomeprime targets for whispering campaigns by disgruntled colleagues.andM;THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MODEL: In the first three models, companies usetelecommuting to attract and retain valuable workers, reduce absenteeism, andperhaps cut overhead costs.andP;  All three models are designed to meet the needsof both the employer and employee; all are win-win models.andM;The fourth model, which entails turning employees into self-employedindependent contractors when they move from office to home, can create awin-lose situation in which management wins at the expense of workers.andM;For some companies, the major impetus for telecommuting is to cut laborcosts: a company can save 30 to 40 percent on each employee-turned-contractorbecause contractors are not entitled to regular benefits.andP;  Furthermore,independent contractors are hired only as needed, which increases staffingflexibility for the employer.andM;The price for the short-term cost savings is a long-term erosion of loyaltyand morale.andP;  In addition, switching employees to independent contractorstatus may leave companies vulnerable to legal challenges from the IRS andstate courts.andM;Of course, picking the right model isn't enough.andP;  Telecommuting is not aviable alternative for all companies, even those that have the necessarytechnology already in place.andP;  To decide whether telecommuting is right forthem, companies must weigh their goals against the personalities, skills, andneeds of their employees.andM;Dr.andP;
