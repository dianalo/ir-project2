All arrangements have beenworked out,'' said the source, who spoke Friday evening oncondition of anonymity.   He said the hostages probably would be freed in the vicinity ofthe seaside Summerland Hotel in Moslem west Beirut's Jnah district,where former French hostages Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandinwere released last November.   The hotel is close to south Beirut's Shiite slums, where many ofthe 22 foreigners missing in Lebanon are believed held. It also isclose to Beirut airport.   A chartered Swissair executive jet flew to Beirut from Larnaca,Cyprus, and a Lebanese security source said it brought Syrianhostage negotiator Omran Adham.   But the Lebanese police later denied that Adham was in Beirutand said he was not aboard the executive jet.   The plane's pilot said after returning to Larnaca, ``We went toget the hostages but there were no hostages ready. So we came backto spend the night here.''   The pilot said he would fly to Beirut again early Saturdaymorning. He declined to be identified.   The Beirut weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa said earlier Friday thatcontacts were under way between France and Iran for the release ofthree Frenchmen held hostage in Lebanon.   They are French diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine andjournalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. The three were kidnapped in 1985 bythe pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.   A fourth Frenchman, Michel Seurat, a scientific researcher, waskidnapped May 22, 1985. The Islamic Jihad claimed it killed himMarch 5, 1986.   Although no body has been found, Seurat's wife, Marie, said in abook she published last month that French officials have confirmedto her that her husband died in captivity.   The magazine said Paris and Tehran had agreed on the release oftwo French hostages in Lebanon in return for ``the release ofIranian assets frozen in France in addition to a $1 billioncompensation to Iran.''   It is believed the magazine referred to full repayment of a $1billion loan made by the late Shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,to France and disputed interest that could amount to an additional$1 billion.   ``Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine said.   It indicated that France's insistance on the release of a thirdFrench hostage held up implementation of the deal.   The April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airways jetliner by another groupof Shiite extremists also apparently delayed negotiations.   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke thestory of secret U.S. Arms sales to Iran in an atempt to free U.S.hostages.   In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners aremissing in Beirut. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a WestGerman, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentifiedforeign men.</TEXT></DOC>
