(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crazy Eddie Inc. founder Eddie Antar andformer top management of the electronics chain that advertised``insane'' prices were charged Wednesday with insider trading andsystematically altering financial books to inflate earnings.   Antar directed a ``massive financial fraud'' that artificallyboosted pre-tax income by $29 million from 1985 to 1987, theSecurities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint filed infederal court here. The alleged scheme included exaggeratinginventory and falsely reducing bills to suppliers, the agency said.   Antar, a high-school dropout who built the chain to 43 outletsfrom a single store in Brooklyn, N.Y., sold 5.6 million shares ofcompany stock for $60 million while knowing that the stock price wasbased on exaggerated information, the SEC said.   The agency seeks the return of ill-gotten trading profits,penalties and injunctions against further violations.   Six other ex-officials were named, including Antar's brotherMitchell Antar, and cousins Sam E. Antar and Eddie Gindi. Mitchelland Sam E. Antar and defendant David Panoff were also charged withinsider trading for selling stock and falsifying financial records.SEC attorney Richard Simpson said the proceeds from their stocksales totaled less than $1 million.   Gindi and former employees Isaac Kairey and Kathleen Morinsettled the falsifying records charge without denying or admittingit. They were not accused of insider trading, and the company wasnot charged.   Justin Feldman, a lawyer for Eddie Antar in a shareholder lawsuitagainst the former executive, said he had not seen the SEC's papersand could not comment. In the shareholder case, Antar deniedartificially inflating the company's figures.   Antar, 41, dropped from sight in 1987, refusing to speak toreporters or analysts.   ``We're trying to track him down,'' said SEC attorney RichardSimpson. Antar's last known address was on Manhattan's East Side,the complaint said.   Mitchell Antar's attorney, Marvin Gersten, called the charges``totally false.''   ``We intend to vigorously defend this,'' said Gersten, who notedhis client left the company in May 1987 and supported dissidentshareholders in a fight to oust Eddie Antar. Attorneys for Sam E.Antar and Panoff declined comment.   The U.S. attorney's office here is conducting a parallel criminalprobe.   The first major indication of Edison-based Crazy Eddie's presenttroubles came shortly after the dissident stockholders assumedcontrol in late 1987. New management announced it had discovered``phantom'' inventory of $65 million.   The company allegedly used a variety of methods, from addingzeros on numbers in product lists to inflating prices on the booksto fabricating product returns to manufacturers.   Rather than a ``substantial loss'' in 1987, Crazy Eddie reportedpre-tax income of $20.6 million; in 1985, its reported income of$12.6 million was inflated by $2 million; and in 1986, reportedincome of $26.5 million was overstated by $6.7 million, thecomplaint said.   The SEC complaint is the latest blow to the company known for itsraucous commercials featuring actor Jerry Carroll waving his armsand shouting about insanely low prices.   The ad campaign and a boom in consumer demand for video-cassetterecorders, answering machines and other electronics helped makeCrazy Eddie one of the leading electronics retail chains in theNortheast. At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in New York, NewJersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, 1,500 employees and sales of$260 million.   In June, the company filed for protection from its creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.</TEXT></DOC>
