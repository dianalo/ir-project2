He defended the action that precipitated the crisis: Israel'sabduction of a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsoredShiite Moslem group believed responsible for the kidnappings ofWesterners in Lebanon.   Shamir said Israel had the right to act on its own to rescue itscaptured soldiers whether the rest of the world agrees or not.Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and otherLebanese Shiite prisoners for three Israeli soldiers and Westernhostages held in Lebanon.   The prime minister and other top officials consulted on aresponse to the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which suspendedits plans to kill an American hostage Thursday night and made newdemands on Israel.   He said Israel was ``waiting for proposals'' from the captors ofJoseph Cicippio, who issued a statement saying they would provide alist of ``Palestinian and Lebanese'' prisoners to be released.   ``We hope we will get some proposals and it will be the end ofthe crisis,'' Shamir said.   Israel radio said Israeli leaders had hoped to receive aresponse within hours, but now are convinced it will take muchlonger.   ``A prisoners exchange with Hezbollah is a complicated affair,and it would last for a long time before a solution is found,'' itquoted Finance Minister Shimon Peres as saying.   On Monday, three days after commandos abducted Obeid from hishome in south Lebanon, a group of kidnappers calling themselves theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth said they had hanged Lt. ColWilliam R. Higgins in retaliation.   They released a poor-quality videotape of a man who appeared tobe the U.S. Marine colonel hanging from a gallows, but there was noway of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have saidHiggins, kidnapped in February 1988 while on U.N. duty in southLebanon, had been killed months ago.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's new president, was quoted as sayingFriday the first step toward ending the crisis would be for theUnited States to ask Israel to free Obeid. Israel claims Obeidplanned guerrilla attacks against it and directed Higgins'kidnapping.   Israeli analysts said the developments indicate a willingness byShiite radicals to consider releasing hostages, and that vindicatesIsrael's decision to kidnap Obeid.   ``Israel put the issue of hostages back on the internationalagenda,'' said Shlomo Avineri, a former Foreign Ministrydirector-general.   Until the current crisis, ``the West accepted people beingcaptured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be doneabout it,'' he said.   Shlomo Gazit, a former military intelligence chief, said theabduction triggered a new willingness by Hezbollah to considertrading hostages.   Without it, ``nothing would have happened and all the existinghostages would be in the same hopeless situation as before.'' Gazitsaid it also ``put the Israeli hostages on the agenda and that wasthe exact purpose.''   A government official said privately he doubted Israel wouldfree Obeid without something in return, and did not believe theUnited States would ask that.   ``If it's only freeing Obeid, what do the Americans get out ofit; what do we get out of it?'' he said.   The statement from Cicippio's kidnappers repeated Obeid must bereleased and added the demand for ``a number of'' Palestinians andLebanese. It did not say what would happen to Cicippio if theIsraelis refuse.   More than 8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprisingagainst Israeli occupation began 20 months ago in the West Bank andGaza Strip. Israel also has more than 60 Lebanese Shiite prisonersand its allied militiamen in south Lebanon are believed to hold 300more.   While Israel has proposed an exchange of Shiite captives for theIsraeli soldiers and 16 Western hostages, eight of them Americans,Israeli officials continue emphasizing that the first objective isfreeing the soldiers.   On Israel radio, Shamir was quoted as saying he believednegotiations on freeing the soldiers were closer. Asked aboutfreedom for the foreigners, he replied: ``If it will happen we willbe very happy.''   The radio quoted officials as saying Israel would leave it tothe United States to ensure the safety of the American and otherhostages.   In his defense of Obeid's abduction, Shamir said in a speech tothe United Jewish Appeal that Jewish tradition requires Israel'sunrelenting efforts to free its captured soldiers.   ``We have no alternative but to apply pressure'' on the ``mostsensitive nerves'' of those holding them.   ``Of course, we would prefer to have the civilized worldparticipating actively with us,'' the prime minister said. ``In anycase, we will stay our course.''</TEXT></DOC>
