L. 100-690, approvedNovember 18, 1988). The program would authorize HUD to make grants to publichousing agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) for use ineliminating drug-related crime in public housing projects. To receive fundingunder this program, PHAs and IHAs would be required to develop a plan foraddressing drug-related crime, and to indicate how assisted activitieswould further the plan. Grant funds may be used for a number of activitiesdesigned to eliminate drug-related crime, including: (1) Employment ofsecurity personnel and investigators; (2) reimbursement of local law enforcementagencies for the cost of providing additional security and protective services;(3) physical improvements designed to enhance security in public housingprojects; (4) support of public housing tenant patrols acting in cooperationwith local law enforcement agencies; (5) innovative programs to reducedrug use in and around public housing projects; and (6) funding of ResidentManagement Corporations (RMCs) and Resident Councils (RCs) to develop securityand drug abuse prevention programs involving site residents.

Background</ITAG>Congress authorized the Public Housing Drug Elimination Pilot Program underChapter 2, Subtitle C, Title V of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-690, approved November 19, 1988) (``the Act''). The program authorizesHUD to make grants to public housing agencies (PHAs) and Indian HousingAuthorities (IHAs) to eliminate drug-related crime in selected public housingprojects.At the present time, no funding has been appropriated for this program.In the event that funding for the program becomes available before finalregulations can be issued, the Department will publish a separate Noticeof Fund Availability (NOFA) to allocate these funds. No applications underthis program may be submitted until a NOFA is published.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Implementation of the Program</ITAG>The program provides grant funds to PHAs and IHAs for a number of eligibleactivities designed to reduce the incidence of drug-related crime in publichousing projects.A. <T3>Entities eligible to participate.</T3> In general, a PHA or IHA mayundertake any of the eligible activities under Part 961 or it may contractwith a qualified third party, including Resident Management Corporations(RMCs) and Resident Councils (RCs).An RMC or RC under this part must comply with the requirements of 24 CFRPart 964 (as amended on September 7, 1988, see 53 FR 34676). In the caseof an IHA, the RMC or RC must meet the requirements of andSection; 961.5.However, to facilitate the ability of PHAs to combat drug-related criminalactivity in their projects, RCs as well as RMCs will be permitted to undertakeany of the management functions specified in Part 961 (including any ofthe eligible activities at andSection; 961.10) notwithstanding the otherwiseapplicable requirements of 24 CFR Part 964.B. <T3>Eligible activities</T3>. Grant amounts may only be used for the followingactivities:1. <T3>Security personnel</T3>. Security personnel may be employed under Part961 to patrol public housing projects and to carry out security functions.While ``drug-related crime'' is defined by statute to mean, ``the illegalmanufacture, sale, distribution, use, or possession with intent to manufacture,sell, distribute, or use, of a controlled substance'', HUD anticipatesthat there may be instances in which a security officer may be called uponto deal with a crime that is not ``drug-related'', as defined in the Act.Security personnel employed with assistance under Part 961 may respondto crimes that are not drug-related if they become aware of the crimesin the course of carrying out their drug-related crime duties.2. <T3>Additional security and protective services</T3>. Grant funds may beused to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for the cost of providingadditional security and protective services for public housing projectsunder this program. The Department construes ``additional'' to mean thatFederal grant funds may not be used to supplant existing funding levelsfor security services to a project. Consequently, the security and protectiveservices under this provision must be either:(i) A service that no local law enforcement agency (or agencies) providedfor public housing projects administered by the grantee immediately beforethe applicable Notice of Fund Availability under Part 961 was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register;</T4> or(ii) A quantifiable increase in the level of an ongoing service above thatwhich the local law enforcement agency (or agencies) provided for publichousing projects administered by the grantee immediately before the applicableNotice of Fund Availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.An example of a service that might be encompassed under this provisionis the reimbursement of local law enforcement agencies for extra patrolsof a project.Services to be provided with grant funds should be over and above thosefor which the local government is already contractually obligated underits Cooperation Agreement with the PHA. This requirement stems from thelocality's obligation under the Cooperation Agreement to furnish to thePHA public services and facilities that are comparable to those providedat no cost or at a comparable cost to the general community. The executionof this Cooperation Agreement between the governing body and the PHA constitutesa condition for initial approval for project development and the Federalassistance commitments under the Annual Contributions Contract. (<T3>See</T3> 24 CFR 941.201(c) and the definition of ``Cooperation Agreement''under 24 CFR 941.103.)Consequently, applications for grants under this program must address theissue of whether the local governing body is meeting its obligations underthe Cooperation Agreement, particularly as to law enforcement. While dueconsideration will be given to special circumstances, the Department willassess this factor in determining whether a locality supports the PHA'santi-drug related crime efforts. (See andSection; 961.25(b)(4).)3. <T3>Physical improvements designed to enhance security</T3>. The programauthorizes the use of grant funds for physical improvements specificallydesigned to enhance security in public housing projects. These improvementsmight include (but are not limited to) the installation of lighting systems,bolts, or locks inside, or on the grounds of, selected projects, or thereconfiguration of common areas to discourage drug-related crime. Suchimprovements may not involve the demolition of any public housing units.A PHA may not use grant funds under this part for any physical improvementsthat would result in the displacement of persons.It should be noted that under section 12 of the United States Housing Actof 1937, the employment of certain workers in connection with physicalimprovements relating to the development of a public housing project, orthe employment of certain workers in connection with carrying out non-routinemaintenance in a project, requires the PHA to pay certain prevailing wagerates. Section 961.40(a) of the proposed rule should be consulted for furtherguidance on these requirements.4. <T3>Employment of investigators</T3>. Under Part 961, a PHA may employindividuals to investigate drug-related crime on or about the real propertycomprising the public housing project and to provide evidence relatingto such crimes in any administrative or judicial proceedings.5. <T3>Public housing tenant patrols</T3>. A PHA may use grant funds underPart 961 to provide training, communications equipment, and other relatedequipment (including uniforms), for use by voluntary public housing tenantpatrols acting in cooperation with officials of local law enforcement agencies.6. <T3>Innovative programs to reduce the use of drugs</T3>. Section 5124(6)of the Act provides for the use of grant funds for ``innovative programs''to reduce the use of drugs in and around public housing projects. The Departmentwould construe the term ``innovative'' to mean that the program uses anew or creative approach to accomplish this statutory objective. In additionto law enforcement activities, a PHA, RMC or RC may use grant funds underthis section to develop and operate, or to contract for services to provide,innovative drug education and treatment, counseling, referral, and outreachefforts. Grant funds may also be used for innovative strategies to preventdrug-related crime, including recreational, vocational, educational andother constructive alternatives for youth.7. <T3>Resident Management Corporations and Resident Councils</T3>. Grantfunds may be provided by a grantee under Part 961 to RMCs and RCs to developsecurity and drug abuse prevention programs involving site residents. Theseprograms may include (but are not limited to) the development of law enforcementstrategies, drug education and treatment, counseling, referral, leadershiptraining, security patrols, and outreach efforts.IHAs that seek funding for this category of eligible activities must havein place an RMC or RC that meets the requirements specified at andSection;961.5 (see definitions of ``Resident Management Corporation'' and ``ResidentCouncil''). An RMC or RC established under this provision is cognizableonly for purposes of funding under Part 961. Furthermore, the requirementsestablished under this rule will be superseded by the final Indian tenantparticipation guidelines that HUD intends to publish.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Requirement of a Plan</ITAG>As a condition of funding, section 5125(a) of the Act requires PHAs andIHAs to submit a grant application to HUD that includes a plan addressingthe problem of drug-related crime on the premises of projects proposedfor assistance under Part 961. (See andSection; 961.15.)While this plan is not intended to be an exhaustive document, it must addresseach of the following elements: (1) An assessment of the nature and extentof the problem of drug-related crime, and the problems associated withdrug-related crime; (2) the current activities being undertaken by thePHA or IHA, the State or local government, and RMCs and RCs to addressthe drug-related crime problem; and (3) a realistic strategy for respondingto the problem of drug-related crime.It should be noted that while the Act refers to ``drug-related crime''under the plan provision at section 5125(a), and simply to ``crime'' underthe selection criteria at section 5125(b) (1), (2) and (4), the Departmentbelieves that Congress intended to limit the scope of the program to drug-relatedcrime. As a result, the proposed rule generally reflects this interpretation.One exception is that the plan asks for an assessment not only of the problemof drug-related crime, but also of the problems associated with drug-relatedcrime. Such ``associated'' problems might include homicides, muggings,burglaries, and incidents of vandalism resulting from drug-related crimein the projects. The Department believes that this information is vitalto obtaining an accurate assessment of the drug-related crime problem inthe projects proposed for assistance under this part.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Rating Factors</ITAG>To qualify for a grant under Part 961, PHAs and IHAs must submit an applicationthat meets the requirements of andSection; 961.20 (including the plan underandSection; 961.15). Applications will be evaluated on the basis of the selectiverating criteria at andSection; 961.25(b). These criteria include: (1) Theextent of the drug-related crime problem in the applicant's targeted projects;(2) the quality of the plan under andSection; 961.15 (for PHA applicants,this criterion will also include an evaluation of the extent of RMC orRC involvement in the development of the grant application, and the extentto which an RMC or RC will have substantial management responsibilitiesunder the PHA's plan); (3) the applicant's capability to carry out itsplan; and (4) the extent to which the local government and local communitysupport the applicant's anti-drug-related crime activities.With respect to the third rating criterion, HUD will determine an applicant'scapability to carry out its plan on the basis of several factors, includingits administrative capability to manage its projects. Administrative capabilitywill be determined in accordance with the requirements of the Annual ContributionsContract executed between HUD and the PHA or IHA, and the relevant programregulations (see 24 CFR Parts 905 and 941).The second rating criterion assesses the quality of the applicant's planbased upon the extent to which the information provided by the applicantis accurate and complete, and the plan strategy is realistic and attainable.For PHA applicants, the Department will provide additional points underthis criterion (see andSection; 961.25(b)(2)(B)) based upon the extent ofRMC or RC involvement in the development of the grant application, andthe extent to which an RMC or RC will assume substantial management responsibilitiesunder the PHA's plan. Since IHAs are not covered by the Department's existingtenant participation and management regulations (24 CFR Part 964), thisadditional criterion will not be applied to IHAs.Until HUD issues final guidance on Indian tenant participation, the selectionprocess under Part 961 will be as follows:PHAs that submit grant applications under Part 961 would be evaluated onthe four rating criteria of andSection; 961.25(b), with each rating factorassigned up to a maximum of 25 points. A PHA applicant could obtain upto an additional 15 points under andSection; 961.25(b)(2)(B) based upon theextent of RMC or RC involvement in the development of the grant application,and the extent to which an RMC or RC will assume substantial managementresponsibilities under the PHA's plan. Applicants would then be rankedbased upon their total selective rating score.IHAs would be evaluated on the four rating criteria of andSection; 961.25(b),with each rating factor assigned up to a maximum of 25 points. However,an IHA would not be rated on the RMC/RC participation element under andSection;961.25(b)(2)(B). IHA applicants would be separately ranked based upon theirtotal selective rating scores.Grant awards would be made to the highest-ranked applicants, but underandSection; 961.25(c) HUD may use its discretion to ensure an equitable distributionof grant funds among both pools of highest-ranking PHA and IHA applicants.In exercising its discretion under this section, HUD shall take into accountthe overall ratio of PHAs to IHAs; the ratio of fundable applicants submittedby PHAs and IHAs; and the extent of available grant funds under Part 961.The Department may also exercise its discretion under andSection; 961.25(d)to substitute one or more highly rated applications if the highest-rankedapplications under the selection criteria do not ensure equitable geographicaldistribution, or distribution among PHAs and IHAs of varying sizes.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Encouragement of Resident Management Corporations and ResidentCouncils</ITAG>While this program is intended to provide grants to PHAs and IHAs, theDepartment strongly encourages the participation of RMCs and RCs in theeffort to combat drug-related crime. Specifically, andSection; 961.25(b)(2)(B)of the proposed rule provides maximum rating points to a PHA that establishesthat its grant application, including its plan, was prepared in cooperationwith its RMC or RC, and that an RMC or RC will have substantial programmanagement responsibilities under the PHA's plan.The participation of RMCs and RCs is especially critical in implementingcertain aspects of the program, including development of the security anddrug abuse prevention programs under andSection; 961.10(g), and implementationof the voluntary tenant patrols under andSection; 961.10(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Environmental Review</ITAG>This rule proposes to amend 24 CFR Part 50 by adding a new categoricalexclusion for grants under Part 961 from review under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321). This exclusion would not eliminatereview under related environmental authorities, such as the National HistoricPreservation Act of 1966. The exclusion is premised on the fact that drugelimination grants typically would not involve a potential for significantimpact to the physical environment. To the extent that grant funds areused for physical improvements to enhance security under andSection; 961.10(c),that section provides that the improvements may not involve the demolitionof any dwelling units in a project.As a condition of grant approval, HUD will perform an environmental reviewunder andSection; 961.25(e) of this rule to the extent required under NEPAand applicable related authorities at 24 CFR Part 50.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50 implementingsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at theOffice of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street SW., Room 10276, Washington,DC 20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin Section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued onFebruary 17, 1989. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not: (1)Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule would provide grantsto PHAs and IHAs to eliminate drug-related crime in selected lower incomehousing projects. In certain instances, the PHA can provide grant fundsunder the program to nonprofit Resident Management Corporations and ResidentCouncils for certain eligible program activities. Although small entitiescould participate in the program, the rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on them.<T3>Family Impact.</T3> The General Counsel, as the Designated Officialfor Executive Order 12606, <T3>the Family,</T3> has determined that the provisions of this rule havethe potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance andgeneral well-being within the meaning of the Order. The proposed rule wouldimplement a program that would encourage PHAs and IHAs to develop a planfor addressing the problem of drug-related crime, and to make availablegrants to help PHAs and IHAs to carry out this plan. As such, the programis intended to improve the quality of life of public housing project residentsby reducing the incidence of drug-related crime and should have a strongpositive effect on family formation, maintenance and general well-beingfor PHAs and IHAs selected for funding. Further review under the Orderis not necessary, however, since the rule essentially tracks the authorizinglegislation and involves little exercise of HUD discretion.<T3>Federalism Impact.</T3> The General Counsel, as the Designated Officialunder section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, <T3>Federalism,</T3> has determined that the provisions of this rule have``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The rule wouldimplement a program that would encourage PHAs and IHAs to develop a planfor addressing the problem of drug-related crime, and to make availablegrants to PHAs and IHAs to help them carry out their plans. As such, theprogram would help PHAs and IHAs combat serious drug-related crime problemsin their projects, thereby strengthening their role as instrumentalitiesof the States. Further review under the Order is unnecessary, however,since the rule generally tracks the statute and involves little implementingdiscretion. The rule's most significant exercise of discretion involvesthe establishment of selection preferences based upon the extent of RMCor RC involvement in the development of the grant application, and theextent to which RMCs and RCs have substantial management responsibilitiesunder the plan. The involvement of these resident organizations shouldgreatly increase the success of the anti-drug-related crime efforts and,therefore, should have positive effects on the PHAs.This proposed rule was listed as Sequence No. 1020 in the Department'sSemiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708,16714) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Public Housing Drug Elimination Program is not listed in the Catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance.The collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rulehave been submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. Certain sections of this rule have been determinedby the Department to contain collection of information requirements.

Thepurposes of the program are to: (a) Encourage public housing agencies (PHAs)and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) to develop a plan for addressingthe problem of drug-related crime on the premises of the public and Indianhousing projects proposed for funding under this part; and (b) Make availableFederal grants to help PHAs and IHAs carry out their plans. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 961.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Resident Management Corporations and Resident Councils. </ITAG>(a) The elimination of drug-related crime in public housing projects requiresthe active involvement and commitment of public housing residents and theirorganizations. To facilitate the ability of PHAs to combat drug-relatedcriminal activity in their projects, Resident Councils (RCs) and ResidentManagement Corporations (RMCs) will be permitted to undertake managementfunctions specified in this part, notwithstanding the otherwise applicablerequirements of 24 CFR Part 964. The Department encourages PHAs to makeResident Management Corporations (RMCs) and Resident Councils (RCs) fullpartners in this effort. Areas in which this partnership can be particularlysignificant include (but are not limited to) the planning and executionof strategies and activities to eliminate drug-related crime in publichousing projects, the funding of RMCs/RCs to carry out voluntary tenantpatrols (andSection; 961.10(e)), and to develop security and drug-abuse preventionprograms involving site residents (andSection; 961.10(g)). RMCs and RCs canalso carry out eligible activities under andSection; 961.10 on the grantee'sbehalf. To emphasize the importance that the Department attaches to fullRMC/RC participation in activities assisted under this part, andSection;961.18 requires applicants to: (1) Give these organizations (as well asthe residents of the targeted projects) a reasonable opportunity to commenton the application; and (2) Give serious consideration to these commentsin developing the application. (b) In addition, points will be awarded in the application selection processto PHA's (as provided by andSection; 961.25(b)(2)(B)) based upon the extentof RMC or RC involvement in the development of the grant application, andthe extent to which an RMC or RC will have substantial program managementresponsibilities under the PHA's plan. (This rating criterion will notbe applied to IHA applicants, since IHAs are not covered by the Department'sexisting tentant participation and management regulations (24 CFR Part964) and, hence, would be competitively disadvantaged. Until HUD promulgatesfinal regulations on Indian tenant participation, applicants under thispart will be selected in accordance with the requirements of andSection;961.25(a)). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 961.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG><T3>Applicant</T3> means a PHA or IHA that applies for a grant under thispart. <T3>Chief executive officer</T3> (CED) of a State or a unit of generallocal government means the elected official or the legally designated official,or his or her designee, who has the primary responsibility for the conductof the entity's governmental affairs.
