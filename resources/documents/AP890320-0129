WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The latest polls show voters favor aleft-of-center coalition over Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservativegovernment, and a Cabinet shakeup is in the works to arrest hisparty's tumble in popularity.   Kohl is on his annual slimming down cure at a spa in Austria, buthe announced before his departure from the capital on Friday that hewould spend his two-week Easter break considering changes in hiscoalition government.   In his absence, West German media and prominent politicians havebeen speculating on the impending reorganization and some want theembattled chancellor to cut down his own portfolio by resigning asparty leader.   An atmosphere of political crisis has marred Kohl's ChristianDemocratic Union for more than a week and called into questionwhether the CDU can stay in power after the next federal ballotingin December 1990.   The prospect of a liberal coalition governing in Bonn portends amajor policy shift in West Germany, an important U.S. ally, where aleftist and pacifist trend has been gaining ground for more than ayear.   Major newspapers on Monday continued to give the politicalturmoil top priority, as they did over the weekend when new opinionpolls were released showing a further slide in support for Kohl'sCDU and the centrist Free Democratic Party with which it is aligned.   A survey conducted by the respected Emnid Institute indicatesmore interest among West Germans for an alliance between the liberalSocial Democrats and the environmentalist Greens party. TheHamburg-based weekly Welt am Sonntag reported the poll shows amajority of voters would back a liberal alliance, but it did notprovide specific figures.</TEXT><NOTE>Following embargoed until 4:30 p.m. EST</NOTE><TEXT>   A poll of 1,018 West Germans conducted by the Voter ResearchGroup of Mannheim showed only 30 percent support Kohl's policies.When the same questions were put to respondents a year ago, 83percent supported Kohl, according to the ZDF television network thatcommissioned the poll.   Both opinion surveys showed the CDU trailing the SocialDemocrats, as have similar polls over the past month.</TEXT><NOTE>End embargoed material</NOTE><TEXT>   Kohl's popularity and that of the CDU have suffered from ascandal over West German companies' involvement with a Libyanchemical weapons plant and Bonn's foot-dragging over whether tosupport NATO plans to replace some aging Lance missiles withlonger-range rockets.   Domestic issues, such as the unpopular reform that made healthcare more expensive, have also contributed to CDU troubles.   The CDU's problems have rubbed off on its coalition partner, theFree Democrats, who have also been losing ground in recent electionsand opinion polls.   The Christian Democrats have been losing ground in stateelections since Kohl was re-elected in 1987, most recently in Hessestate balloting where the party lost control of the Frankfurt citygovernment and other important industrial centers.   The Hesse setbacks followed a surprising loss Jan. 29 inelections to the Berlin legislature in which the left and far rightposted gains. The city-state that had been controlled by the CDU formore than a decade is now being governed by a coalition of SocialDemocrats and an umbrella group of leftists known as the AlternativeList.   In an effort to invigorate the CDU and boost its appeal tovoters, Kohl is weighing calls from his party and the Free Democratsto cast off unpopular Cabinet members like Defense Minister RupertScholz and Health Minister Ursula Lehr.</TEXT></DOC>
