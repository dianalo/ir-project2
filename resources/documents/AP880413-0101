Violent protests persisted for a second day in the Gaza Strip,which was home to five of the eight Palestinians whom Israeldeported to Lebanon on Monday. Hospital and relief officials saidat least 21 Arabs were injured.   Israel says the deportees incited much of the violence in theoccupied lands that has claimed the lives of 143 Palestinians, oneIsraeli soldier and a tenn-age Jewish settler since it began Dec. 8.   Before dawn today, soldiers on a routine patrol spotted thethree guerrillas just north of the Kfar Yuval collective farm,chased them and opened fire, the army said in a statement.   The military communique did not give the affiliation of theguerrillas who carried out today's raid but said they were armedwith M-16 rifles, four rockets and hand grenades. It said they wereon a ``hostage-taking mission'' but gave no other details.   It was the second attempted infiltration in nine days at thesame location and the 10th across Israel's borders since November.An April 5 attempt was claimed by two factions of Yasser Arafat'sPalestine Liberation Organization.   Israeli officials have linked past guerrilla raids to the4-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, whichIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East war.   In the Gaza Strip, United Nations relief workers and Arabhospital officials said soldiers opened fire today at protestersoutside a school in Jabaliya refugee camp, wounding 14-year-oldDiah Ahmed Jaber in the left thigh.   Twenty other Palestinians were injured by tear gas and rubberbullets, said Dr. Ahmed Yassih of Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, wheresome of the injured were treated.   In the Deir el Balah refugee camp, soldiers today confiscatedidentification documents from most of the men in the camp and toldthem they would have to pay their electricity and water billsbefore they would be returned, said U.N. official Eric Peterson, anadministrator of the camps.   The Israeli military command said it was checking the reports.   The army said one Arab died, 25 were hurt and one soldier wasinjured Tuesday in fighting in the West Bank and Gaza.   In another development today, an Israeli newspaper said an armyinquiry into the killing of a Jewish settler girl in the West Bankvillage of Beita last week indirectly would blame the shooting onthe Jewish guard Roman Aldubi, who was knocked out by a rock duringthe melee and remains hospitalized.   A preliminary army probe determined that 15-year-old Tirza Poratdied from a bullet fired by Aldubi's M-16 rifle. Settlers claim shewas shot either by an Arab who took the rifle or by an Arab withanother weapon. Israeli officers have said they believe Aldubiaccidentally fired the fatal shot in panic.   The Hadashot newspaper said the final army report shows Arabswrested the rifle from Aldubi, but did not fire it. The paper saidthe inquiry implies that Aldubi accidentally shot the girl beforehe was knocked unconscious.   The controversy over the shooting caused a stormy session ofParliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesdayduring which the Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron accused Jewishsettlers of trying to manipulate public opinion against the army'sfindings.   ``I hope and pray we don't reach the stage in which we have tohave recourse to a polygraph test,'' the Jerusalem Post quoted himas saying.   Shomron has called the April 6 clash, which occurred as theteen-age settlers and two armed guards were on a holiday hike, amisunderstanding and said residents of Beita had sought to aid andprotect the Israeli youths.   The Post also said Shomron indicated the army razed 16 Arabhomes in Beita before the investigation was concluded because itbelieved swift action was needed to prevent reprisals by settlers.   Left-wing legislator Yossi Sarid accused the settlers ofpressuring the army into taking the punitive measures even thoughit was not yet clear if any Arabs were involved in killing theJewish girl, the newspaper said.   Ehud Olmert of the right-wing Likud bloc criticized the army forleaking findings on the shooting to the Israeli media.   ``I recommend that army officers not make media appearances andthen they won't be dragged into political debates,' Olmertreportedly said.</TEXT></DOC>
