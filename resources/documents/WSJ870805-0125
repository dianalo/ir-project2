But the sweetened $31.7 million bid by Los Angeles-based G Acquisition Corp. came only after the furniture rental and sales concern granted the group an option that permits it to take control of the company even if a majority of holders decline to tender their shares.    Previously, Orion Capital Corp., which holds a 39.2% stake in GranTree, urged the company's directors to reject any sweetening of the bid to $10.75 a share, calling the figure inadequate.    While officials of Orion couldn't be reached yesterday, they criticized on Monday the proposed $10.75-a-share price as too low. Orion, a New York-based insurance holding company, has been gradually boosting its GranTree stake for weeks.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, GranTree shares closed at $10.375, unchanged.    As previously reported, G Acquisition last month made the $10-a-share, or $29.5 million, offer. Despite a management endorsement, only about 41% of the company's shares outstanding had been tendered when the latest of two extensions expired at 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday.    The revised bid expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Aug. 18. Shares tendered under the lower offer will be paid at the higher rate, and don't need to be tendered again.    In connection with the higher offer, GranTree granted the group an option to buy as many as 797,487 newly issued GranTree common shares for $10.75 each -- representing a 20% stake on a fully diluted basis. The option, which expires if not used by Sept. 3, is exercisable only after the offer ends and the group has purchased all shares tendered.    To exercise the option, the buy-out group also must hold enough shares so that it will own a majority of GranTree's shares outstanding if it buys the new shares. That would allow the group to take control if only 39% of current shares outstanding are tendered, GranTree said.    If the buy-out succeeds, GranTree's management will retain an undisclosed stake in the company.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
