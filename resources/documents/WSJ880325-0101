The guilty plea and documents filed yesterday by the government in U.S. District Court in Dallas spell out how bogus minutes of directors' meetings were used to justify questionable loans, and how prostitutes were provided to some directors and officers &quot;in connection with their service&quot; to the Dallas-based thrift.    Law enforcement officials have said they also are investigating whether Vernon officials provided prostitutes to certain large borrowers, customers and even some regulators over the years.    The guilty plea by former Vice President John Hill to a one-count felony information indicates that a grand jury investigation of Vernon's collapse is accelerating, and now is aimed squarely at several former top officials.    Mr. Hill, the second former Vernon official to plead guilty since early last month to criminal charges, faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.    Vernon was closed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in November at an initial cost of $1.3 billion, the costliest thrift closing to date.    Vernon, once known as one of Texas' highest-flying Sandamp;Ls, had a fancy private air fleet, a posh California beach house, and a loan portfolio of which 96% was bad when the thrift was seized by regulators last year. In a 1987 civil suit, which named Mr. Hill along with other former Vernon officials, the government accused the officials of inflating the thrift's net worth in order to pay millions of dollars in bonuses, dividends and assorted personal expenses, much of them for the benefit of Vernon's chief owner, Don Dixon, and a company he controlled.    A lawyer for Mr. Dixon, who has asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination when questioned by government investigators, couldn't be reached for comment.    The expanding criminal investigation, according to law enforcement officials, includes the activities of others named in the civil suit: former Chairman Woody Lemons; former Executive Vice President Richard Little; Pat Malone, former head of the thrift's Dallas operations; and Patrick King, former president and chief operating officer.    The documents filed in connection with the guilty plea indicate that Mr. Hill conspired with an unnamed Vernon official to make a total of more than $5,000 in illegal campaign contributions in 1986 to Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.), Rep. Martin Frost (D., Texas) and then-Rep. Thomas Loeffler (R., Texas). The government said illegal contributions also were made to local politicians.    The government didn't allege that any of the candidates knew that the contributions came from the thrift, rather than personally from Mr. Hill. Nor did the government allege that they knew the contributions were illegal.    A spokesman for Rep. Kemp said neither the congressman nor his campaign aides &quot;had any knowledge that the contribution was illegal.&quot; Mr. Loeffler and spokesmen for Rep. Frost couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Hill also conspired with others in 1985, according to the court papers, to create false minutes of directors' meetings indicating that the board approved the renewal and extension of certain commercial loans.    The government's papers also allege that Mr. Hill, along with others, arranged for paid female companionship for Vernon officers and directors in June 1985, during a three-day board meeting near San Diego.    Mr. Hill, according to the court filing, also falsified, at the direction of an unidentified Vernon official, documents justifying $100,000 paid to a consultant in connection with a loan issued by the thrift. </TEXT></DOC>
