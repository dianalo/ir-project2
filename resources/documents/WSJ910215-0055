On a current-cost basis, an accounting method that stripsout gains or losses on oil inventories, the British oilcompany said that profit after taxes -- but beforeextraordinary items -- rose to #456 million ($904 million),from #345 million in the year-ago quarter.</LP><TEXT>   The results, which were in line with analysts'expectations, benefited partly from the world-wide surge incrude-oil prices late last year when oil markets wereanxiously waiting to see whether there would be war in thePersian Gulf. In the fourth quarter, the price for thecompany's key, North Sea Brent oil averaged $32.63 a barrel,up from $19.18 a year earlier.   But since the fighting actually began Jan. 16, oil priceshave tumbled back to the $20-a-barrel range. The companywarned that &quot;prices will remain volatile&quot; during the war --and even afterwards oil supply and demand &quot;appearsuncertain.&quot; The company added that if prices stay at currentlevels, it will incur &quot;substantial&quot; paper losses on the valueof its oil inventories in the current quarter. One Londonanalyst, Mark Dixson of UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew Ltd., estimatedthe potential loss on the inventories this quarter at #175million.   The company's warnings prompted several London analysts toforecast a drop in BP profit for 1991. On a current-costbasis, analyst David Gray of James Capel andamp; Co. forecast netincome of #1.15 billion this year, down from the #1.20billion for 1990 that the company reported yesterday.   Using current-cost accounting, under which inventories arevalued at what it would cost to replace them today ratherthan what was paid for them originally, BP got its biggestprofit gains in the quarter from its oil-exploration andproduction business. Because of surging oil prices, its oilfields around the world managed to more than double theiroperating profits to #661 million. That came despite a slightsag in oil production, to 1.39 million barrels a day from1.45 million a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
