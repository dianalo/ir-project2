White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked by reporterswhether Bush had second thoughts about refusing to invoke theRailway Labor Act to stop the strike, said: ``We have no indicationof any change.''   But Fitzwater also said Bush was receiving ``daily briefings'' onthe situation and said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner hadmet with the president on the situation Sunday night.   Skinner said today that he and Bush were pleased that the strikeby Eastern's Machinists union had not spread to other airlines andto railroads. The union called off plans for secondary picketingafter a New York federal judge ordered employees of other airlinesnot to honor any Machinists picket lines.   ``We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing hasoccurred,'' Skinner said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``That's an actof responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are veryappreciative.''   Fitzwater said Bush still firmly believes that the labor disputecan best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations,rather than through direct government intervention.   But the Eastern strike looms as the second major confrontationthis week between Bush and a Democratic Congress already battlingover John Tower's nomination as defense secretary.   The aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works Committeewill hold a hearing Tuesday on Bush's refusal to intervene hoursbefore 8,500 striking Machinists union members with support frompilots and flight attendants virtually shut down the nation'sseventh largest airline.   Bush on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediatorsand 33 senators to appoint an emergency board and order a 60-daycooling-off period that would have forestalled the strike.Administration officials said Bush would not allow unions to wage``economic blackmail.''   That decision _ which had been sought by the management ofEastern and the head of its parent company, Texas Air Chairman FrankLorenzo _ was the first time in the 63-year history of the NationalMediation Board that a president has rejected its advice.   Anticipating Bush's decision, Reps. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., andJames Oberstar, D-Minn., respectively chairmen of the Public WorksCommittee and its aviation subcommittee, introduced a bill lastThursday directing the president to empanel an emergency board andorder the strikers back to work.   ``I think the president got bad advice and his organization justmisjudged the circumstances,'' Oberstar said Sunday. ``Some outsideforce needs to be brought to bear to resolve this. The Machinistswould be constrained to accept the recommendation of even a GeorgeBush board.''   Instead, Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner saidthe administration would ask Congress to outlaw secondary boycottsin the transportation industry if Machinists put up picket lines atother airlines and railroads to cripple them as well.   Skinner said the administration is opposed to congressionallyimposed contract settlements. The last time Congress did was twoyears ago when track maintenance workers threatened to expand astrike against the Maine Central railroad into a nationwide walkout.   President Reagan twice asked Congress to outlaw secondary laborboycotts at airlines and railroads _ they already are illegal inother industries under the 1947 Taft-Hartley law _ but on bothoccasions, the legislation was never even considered by theDemocratic-controlled Congress.   Buoyed by their success in allowing fewer than 100 of Eastern's1,000 scheduled flights to take place on the first day of thestrike, the Machinists said they would not try to spread the walkoutto railroads and other airlines on Monday. But they did not rule outsecondary boycotts later.   Meanwhile, more than 37,000 union pilots at other airlines havevowed to launch a work-to-the-rule slowdown on Tuesday in support ofthe Eastern Machinists. Skinner said that could ``inconveniencemillions and millions of people.''   Oberstar said Democratic congressional leaders have decided tolet the House take the lead in opposing Bush's stance in the Easternstrike while the Senate maintains a second battle front on Tower.   ``The Senate is really waiting to see what the House does;they're waiting for us to move,'' he said.   Tower on Sunday repeated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmedby the Senate as secretary of defense but said he saw no reason todo so otherwise and accused his detractors of ``hypocrisy.''   He also said he would relish a chance to appear on the Senatefloor this week to defend himself, as suggested by the SenateRepublican leader, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, has not responded to Dole's suggestion.   Appearing Sunday on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With DavidBrinkley,'' Dole promised ``a lot more debate,'' indicating a finalconfirmation vote might not come for another week.   Congress will continue hearings Tuesday through Friday on Bush'sproposal to bail out depositors in savings and loan associations whosought federally insured high interest rates under deregulation fromnow insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   The Congressional Budget Office last week put the 10-year cost totaxpayers of Bush's Sandamp;L plan at $84 billion to $110 billion,compared to the $1.5 billion government stake in bailing out theChrysler Corp. in 1980.   However, unlike the federal loan guarantees that were repaid byChrysler when it again turned profitable, no one ever expects thegovernment to recoup the money that Bush is asking taxpayers toshell out for the Sandamp;L depositors.   Another skirmish between the administration and Congress willoccur Wednesday when the Senate Labor Committee is scheduled towrite a new bill to raise the minimum wage from its current $3.35 anhour to $4.65 over three years.   The bill is identical to one proposed last year by thecommittee's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that failedlast summer in the face of a Republican filibuster.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole _ the wife of the SenateRepublican leader _ said Friday that Bush would support annualraises of 30 cents an hour to a $4.25 minimum wage in three years,but only if employers can keep paying new hires a sub-minimum $3.35the first six months they are on their payrolls.</TEXT></DOC>
