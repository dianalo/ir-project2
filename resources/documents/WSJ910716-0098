The House Government Operations Committee, which last yearheld hearings into Northrop's activities, noted that whilethe company's Precision Products division has been barredfrom receiving new government work since July 1989, it hasstill managed to receive at least five prime contracts fromthe Defense Department during that period.</LP><TEXT>   The Pentagon has explained that, in some cases, it has nochoice but to turn to the division for guidance equipmentbecause Northrop is the only manufacturer of the gear. Still,the committee blasted the Air Force and Navy for failing todevelop &quot;viable alternative&quot; sources for the components.   In addition, the committee reported, the PrecisionProducts division has received at least 161 subcontractswhile under suspension.   &quot;Such massive end runs have to be stopped,&quot; said Rep. JohnConyers, (D., Mich.), the committee's chairman. He pledged totake action &quot;against a procurement system where regulatoryloopholes allow a suspended or debarred corporation tocontinue to take in . . . taxpayer dollars simply by actingas a subcontractor instead of a prime contractor.&quot;   In February 1990, as part of a criminal settlement,Northrop admitted to falsifying test results on theair-launched cruise missile and Harrier jet, and paid $17million in penalties. Last month, the company agreed tosettle a related civil suit, and the Justice Departmentindicated in court papers that the Air Force was soonexpected to reinstate the Precision Products division.   But the committee's harsh language illustrates just howmuch Northrop's reputation continues to suffer. AlthoughChairman Kent Kresa has gone out of his way to show thatNorthrop has embarked on a new era of responsibility, thecompany remains haunted by its misdeeds of the 1980s. It is afactor that may prove significant as Northrop, builder of thecostly B-2 Stealth bomber, tries to win new governmentcontracts.   In Los Angeles, a Northrop spokesman said the company has&quot;taken numerous steps to implement corrective actions&quot; at thePrecision Products division. He also pointed out thatNorthrop has supplied spare parts for the Harrier jet at nocost to the government, and has agreed to fix a flaw in theair-launched cruise missile.   The criticism from the committee comes on the heels of aJune 24 inspector general report that blasts Northrop forfailing to implement basic quality standards on TacitRainbow, a missile program that earlier this year wascanceled by the Pentagon. The inspector general's remarkswere first reported by Defense Week, a trade publication.   The House committee's 273-page report also criticizes theJustice Department for sealing the settlement agreement itreached with Northrop in February 1990. The pact, in whichthe government agreed to drop a number of criminalinvestigations involving Northrop, was eventually unsealed atthe request of the Los Angeles Times and The Wall StreetJournal.</TEXT></DOC>
