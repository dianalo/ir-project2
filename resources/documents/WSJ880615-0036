Mr. Baker announced yesterday that he is stepping down in order to spend more time with his ailing wife in Tennessee. The 44-year-old Mr. Duberstein, who has served as deputy chief of staff for the past 15 months, was named to succeed him.    Mr. Duberstein, who was chief congressional lobbyist for the White House earlier in the Reagan administration, is a moderate who lacks the political prestige of Mr. Baker, the former Senate GOP leader. However, he brings more political energy and managerial acumen to the job, and may be marginally more helpful to Vice President Bush, whose political fortunes depend in part on White House strategy in the last months of Mr. Reagan's final term.    But the change won't have much impact on policy. &quot;It's too late to start anything new,&quot; observes former White House political director Mitch Daniels. &quot;There are a few things to tie up and they're mainly congressional. That's Ken's long suit.&quot;    Mr. Duberstein, a hockey fanatic and pretzel lover who recently lost more than 20 pounds by drinking vast quantities of water every day, is a veteran Washington operator. An aide to the late Sen. Jacob Javits (R., N.Y.), Mr. Duberstein worked in the White House's congressional liaison office during Mr. Reagan's first term and was a lobbyist for the Washington-based firm of Timmons andamp; Co. from 1983 until Mr. Baker tapped him in March 1987 as his deputy chief of staff.    It was also announced yesterday that White House communications director Thomas Griscom, 38, who began working with Mr. Baker in the Senate 10 years ago, will be leaving his post soon.    The fact that Mr. Baker feels he can leave the White House before the end of the term &quot;should be taken as a good sign,&quot; observed Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.). &quot;His sense of duty . . . is such that he would never leave were it not possible to continue without him.&quot;    Friends say the 62-year-old Mr. Baker, who was highly regarded as the Senate Republican leader before he succeeded Donald Regan in the White House, has wrapped up the agenda he set for himself there.    Mr. Baker feels that he helped stabilize the White House, guide the president through the Iran-Contra scandal and hammer out a budget deficit agreement with Congress, these associates say. He also took satisfaction in the recent signing of the intermediate forces reduction treaty with the Soviets, they say. He concluded that a fourth priority -- the Nicaragua problem -- wasn't likely to be resolved during this administration.    The timing of Mr. Baker's departure came as a surprise; he'd vowed earlier to &quot;turn out the lights&quot; for Mr. Reagan. His decision was influenced by the worsening health of his stepmother and of his wife, Joy, who both have been hospitalized recently. The senator's wife suffers from severe back pain and emphysema, according to family friends.    Mr. Baker is expected to join the Knoxville law firm of Baker, Worthington, Crossley, Stansberry andamp; Woolf. Friends say he would be willing to run for vice president on the GOP ticket but doesn't believe he will be asked. While original conservative opposition to his presidential candidacy has abated during his tenure in the White House, he would have difficulty campaigning because of his wife's illness, these friends say.    President Reagan has had four totally different chiefs of staff during his two terms: James Baker, the wealthy Houston lawyer, now Treasury Secretary; Donald Regan, the self-made Wall Street millionaire; Tennessean Howard Baker, the Senate insider; and now Kenneth Duberstein, the tough-talking New Yorker. </TEXT></DOC>
