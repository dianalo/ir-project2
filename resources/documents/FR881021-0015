Authority</ITAG>EPA is promulgating this rule pursuant to section 8(a) of the Toxic SubstancesControl Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2607(a). Section 8(a) authorizes the Administratorto promulgate rules which require each person, (other than a small manufactureror processor) who manufactures, imports, or processes or who proposes tomanufacture, import, or process a chemical substance, to submit such reportsas the Administrator may reasonably require.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>This rule was proposed on April 29, 1988 (53 FR 15428). EPA's Office ofToxic Substances (OTS) initiated assessment of the health risks from EDTMPAexposure in response to a TSCA section 8(e) notice reporting osteosarcomasin male rats orally dosed with the substance. A Chemical Hazard InformationProfile on EDTMPA was prepared that identified the substance's use to preventprecipitation of calcium salts as the major potential source of exposure.Subsequent evaluation in the OTS Existing Chemicals Program confirmed thehazard concern.EPA requires the information to be submitted in response to this rule becauseEDTMPA has potentially serious hazards to human health. Overall, the availableinformation on EDTMPA suggests that humans exposed to the substance maybe at risk of developing bone cancer, non-neoplastic bone disease, metabolicdisturbances, or blood dyscrasias. Although EDTMPA appears to be used inlimited quantities in cooling water treatment and electroplating and availableexposure information indicates that current potential exposure is low,EPA's analysis indicates that quantities and uses do have risk associatedwith them. Also, EPA is not satisfied that this information on currentuses is complete. EPA needs the requested information to confirm the actualcurrent uses of EDTMPA and its salts to assess exposures and potentialrisks. In addition, EPA needs to know if expanded or new uses with higherexposure replace old uses so that EPA can take appropriate action.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments</ITAG>A commenter suggested that EPA exclude from reporting the manufacture orimport of EDTMPA and its salts for research and development (Randamp;D) purposes,as a by-product, as an impurity, and as a non-isolated intermediate. Exemptionsfrom TSCA section 8(a) reporting for the manufacture or import for Randamp;Dpurposes, as a by-product, and as an impurity are already codified at 40CFR 704.5. Thus, those persons who manufacture or import EDTMPA strictlyfor Randamp;D purposes, as a by-product, or as in impurity, are exempt fromthe reporting requirements of this rule. EPA recognizes the commenter'sconcern with regard to the non-isolated intermediate exemption. AlthoughEPA is not promulgating a non-isolated intermediate exemption in this rulemaking,such an exemption is actively being considered as part of the ComprehensiveAssessment Information Rule (CAIR).The commenter also suggested a small quantity exemption of 50,000 poundsfor both initial and follow-up reporting. EPA does not believe that suchan exemption should be established. A purpose of this rule is to give EPAthe information it needs to anticipate changes in production and use beforethey lead to significant changes in exposure, and assess potential risksbefore they are significant. The assessment may take considerable time(1 or 2 years), and EPA believes that a change in production or a plantincreasing its production to over 50,000 pounds per year may in 1 or 2years time lead to significant exposure. This is especially true becausein this time production may increase to well over 50,000 pounds per year,or multiple companies will produce up to the 50,000 pound limit. The purposeof this rule is not to find major changes in exposure as suggested by thecommenter, but rather to help EPA anticipate major changes in exposure.The reporting burden/costs for this rule are relatively low, and the numberof affected companies small. Only 1 company is expected to report. In lightof this and the fact that EPA is interested in anticipating changes inexposure, a small quantity exemption is not established for this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

Follow-upreporting is required when a person manufactures or imports a substancein a quantity 50 percent greater than the quantity reported in the mostrecently submitted report, and/or when the person manufactures or importsa substance for a use not previously reported. Because of the potentiallylarge number of substances analogous to the EDTMPA anion, EPA is announcingits intent to add such analogous substances to this rule through noticeand comment rulemaking. However, the data received from this rule may allowEPA to make a class judgement as to hazard potential of the analogous substancesand obviate the need to gather additional data by amending the rule toadd substances.EPA is aware that duplicative reporting with the Inventory Update Rule(40 CFR Part 710, Subpart B) is a possibility. However, if a report forthis section 8(a) rule is submitted within the year preceding the startof a reporting period under the Inventory Update Rule (IUR), the submitterwill not be required by the IUR to report the same information again forthat reporting period. The details of this exemption are set forth in 40CFR 710.35. For example, the next recurring reporting period under theIUR is from August 25, 1990 to December 23, 1990 for any person who manufacturedfor commercial purposes 10,000 pounds (4,540 kilograms) or more of a chemicalsubstance at any site owned or controlled by that person at any time duringthe person's latest complete corporate fiscal year before August 25, 1990.Thus, if a person has reported for this section 8(a) rule within the yearpreceding the start of the IUR reporting period just described, such personis exempt from reporting under the IUR.There are separate reports for each listed substance. Initial reports requiredunder this rule include the following information:1. Name and Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number of the substancefor which the report is submitted.2. Company name and headquarters address.3. Name, address, and telephone number of the principal technical contact. 4. The total quantity (by weight in pounds) of the substance manufacturedor imported for the most recently completed corporate fiscal year.  5. A description of the commercial uses of the substance during the mostrecently corporate fiscal year, including the production volume for eachuse.  6. The estimated quantity (by weight in pounds) of the substance proposedto be manufactured or imported in the current corporate fiscal year.  7. A description of the intended commercial uses of the substance duringthe current corporate fiscal year, including the production volume foreach use.   Follow-up reports required under this rule include the following information:1. Name and Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number of the substancefor which the report is submitted.  2. Company name and headquarters address.  3. Name, address, and telephone number of the principal technical contact. 4. The estimated quantity (by weight in pounds) of the substance proposedto be manufactured or imported in the current corporate fiscal year.  5. A description of the intended commercial uses of the substance duringthe current corporate fiscal year, including the production volume foreach use.  Reports must be submitted by January 3, 1989 to the following address:Document Processing Center (TS-790), Office of Toxic Substances, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, ATTN: EDTMPA Reporting. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Confidentiality  </ITAG>The procedures for submitting a notice with a confidentiality claim areset forth in 40 CFR 704.7. A person submitting a claim of confidentialityattests, among other things, that: my company has taken measures to protectthe confidentiality of the information, and we intend to continue to takesuch measures; the information is not, and has not been, reasonably obtainableby other persons (other than government bodies) without our consent; theinformation is not publicly available elsewhere; and the disclosure wouldcause substantial harm to the company's competitive position.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Rulemaking Record  </ITAG>The following documents constitute the record for this rule (docket controlnumber OPTS-82032A). All documents, including the index to this record,are available to the public in the TSCA Public Docket Office from 8 a.m.to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The TSCA PublicDocket Office is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. NE-G004, 401 M St., SW.,Washington, DC. The docket includes the following information consideredby the Agency in developing this rule:  1. The proposed rule (53 FR 15428, April 29, 1988).  2. Written comment received in response to the proposed rule.  3. A chemical hazard information profile for EDTMPA.  4. The TSCA section 8(e) notice (8EHQ-0683-0483<T3>S</T3>) on EDTMPA (submitted July 15, 1983).  5. Reporting and recordkeeping requirements (40 CFR Part 704).  6. Economic analysis of this final rule.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements    </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291  Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore requires a regulatory impact analysis. EPA has determinedthat this rule is not ``major'' because it does not have an effect of $100million or more on the economy. EPA also anticipates that this rule willnot have a significant effect on competition, costs, or prices.  This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291.  B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. EPA expects only one company to report underthis rule, well within Regulatory Flexibility Act guidelines. In addition,the rule exempts ``small manufacturers'' (as defined in 40 CFR 704.3) fromreporting on these substances. Therefore, in accordance with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.  C. Paperwork Reduction Act  The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by OMB under the provisions of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and have been assigned OMB control number (2070-0067). Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 4 to 20.5 hours per response, with an average of 12.25 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information.  Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention Desk Officer for EPA.''  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 704  </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous materials, Imports, Recordkeepingand reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 7, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
