But the bull market in stocks and index futures is likely to continue, analysts said, citing the substantial premiums investors are still willing to pay for futures compared with the underlying stock indexes.    &quot;I'd continue to ride this market but jump at the first sign of hesitation&quot; in the advance, Courtney Smith, head of futures trading and research at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York, said.    He said many arbitragers spent most of Wednesday &quot;beating the bushes&quot; among clients, trying to raise more money to invest in arbitrage-related program trades in stock-index futures and stocks. Yesterday morning, they sold off their relatively overpriced futures and bought the correspondingly underpriced stocks, adding to the stock-market rally.    But with the new funds spent and clients fully invested in the market, there wasn't much arbitrage-related money to support the rally by yesterday afternoon, Mr. Smith said.    He said the narrow blue-chip nature of the current stock-market rally was reflected in the fact that the Major Market Index future, based on 20 blue-chip stocks, rose yesterday while the broader Sandamp;P 500 index future declined.    Stock-index futures also rallied early on strength in Treasury bond futures and a firmer dollar, J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Commodity Corp., said. He predicted that rising bond futures prices and a stronger dollar will continue to encourage foreign investment in U.S. markets.    Mr. Fredericks said index futures may stall temporarily as the Dow Jones Industrial Average meets resistance near the 2400 level from technical traders using price charts. But the rally in stocks and futures should continue, he said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COCOA: Futures prices slipped, with the May contract closing $29 lower at $1,891 a metric ton. Analysts cited worries among traders that the two-week-long International Cocoa Agreement talks scheduled to end today might fail to produce an agreement on buffer stock buying. Sandra Kaul, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said several points have been agreed upon and that delegates at the talks are under considerable pressure from the countries they represent to reach an accord. &quot;While there is nervousness, there isn't despair,&quot; she said, and this is helping to limit the price declines.    ENERGY: Most oil futures prices rose in thin, uneventful trading, reversing Wednesday's declines and continuing their inability this week to sustain a price trend for more than one day. &quot;The market's been playing flip-flop,&quot; one trader in New York said. Most U.S. prices firmed from the opening after gains in the European market linked to short-term supply tightness. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery rose 16 cents to $18.63 a barrel. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures were mixed. Meanwhile, the spot, or non-contract, market posted gains. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, a major U.S. crude oil, rose 20 cents to $18.65 a barrel, while the April price of the European bellwether North Sea Brent rose five cents a barrel to $18.40 in late trading. Some analysts are expecting a quiet market in the next few days. &quot;The bottom line is that the market doesn't want to sway too far away from present levels until there's a change in fundamental news,&quot; Richard Marose, an analyst at Stotler andamp; Co., Chicago, said.    SUGAR: Futures prices traded on both sides of their previous close before ending the session slightly higher. World demand for sugar has picked up in recent days, stimulating sugar futures, analysts said. The Soviet Union, Turkey, India, South Korea and possibly Egypt and Japan have been mentioned as buyers, with orders believed to total 300,000 to 400,000 metric tons. But if the latest purchases don't spur more buying in the cash market, the futures market won't have enough support to advance further, one analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
