According to the final official result, 52.9% votedagainst the shutdown. The Socialists blamed the narrowrejection of the shutdown proposal on an expensive publicitycampaign by the utility industry. The Socialists also notedthat 54.6% approved a related draft constitutional amendmentthat bars construction or licensing of new reactors until theyear 2000.   The Swiss government, which had opposed both initiatives,also voiced satisfaction at the results. It said the voteproved that most Swiss felt the country can't renouncenuclear power.   Environmental activists, noting that Switzerland is a netexporter of electricity, say that increased energy efficiencyand alternative energies would permit a nuclear shutdown.                                                                                                          LATEST SHORTAGE IN CUBA: PAPER                                                                                                          Cuba, blaming shortages in Soviet supplies of newsprintand paper pulp, said it was cutting back its nationalstate-run press by turning two dailies into weeklies andsuspending an armed-forces newspaper. The official newspaperGranma, representing the views of the Communist Party, wouldremain as the only national daily from Monday to Friday, witha Saturday edition for Havana only.                                                                                                          MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA                                                                                                          Foreign investment in China rose for the third consecutivemonth in July after the decline experienced between Januaryand April, according to semi-official news reports. The ChinaNews Service reported the country approved 632 newforeign-investment projects in July with total contractsvalued at around $536 million. Actual investment during themonth totaled $284 million, according to the Ministry ofForeign Economic Relations and Trade.                                                                                                          CAR SLUMP IN SPAIN                                                                                                          Spanish car sales are seen skidding 10% in 1990. In asurvey of car makers conducted by the magazine Economia,industry leaders attributed the drop in sales to Spain'sstrict credit restrictions, a stiff value-added tax and theGulf crisis. &quot;The Persian Gulf crisis has provoked soaringoil prices and concern that we're heading for a recession . .. all of which implies a decline in consumption,&quot; one autoofficial told Economia.                                                                                                          BRITAIN'S POLLUTION                                                                                                          The environmental group Greenpeace termed Britain &quot;TheDirty Man of Europe&quot; and called for policy changes on air,water and waste. Greenpeace said in a report that in the pastyear Britain had made &quot;some green gestures&quot; but that thenation was still the largest manufacturer of ozone-destroyingchlorofluorocarbons in Europe and faced more legal actionsfrom the European Community over water and air pollution thanany other country. The report was called &quot;politicalpollution&quot; by Environment Secretary Chris Patten, who todaywill present a policy document on the environment.                                                                                                          CHILE LIFTS `FIDDLER' BAN                                                                                                          Chile's government lifted a 16-year-old ban on the film&quot;Fiddler on the Roof,&quot; suppressed by the former militaryregime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet for alleged Marxist content.The current civilian government said it lifted the ban&quot;because the nation has started a time of real implementationof the principles of democracy and freedom.&quot;                                                                                                          AUSTRALIA'S ASBESTOS PROBLEM                                                                                                          Health experts say Australia faces a rising tide ofasbestos-related deaths that will not peak until the firstdecade of the next century. The nation already has theworld's highest rate of mesothelioma, a fatal cancer of thelungs, heart and abdomen caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.   James Leigh of the Australian Mesothelioma Register says1,900 people have been diagnosed as having mesothelioma inthe past 10 years, and the incidence of the disease isgrowing rapidly. So far this year, 167 people have alreadyregistered, compared with 214 in the whole of 1988 and 270 in1989.   &quot;It's been quite a big jump from 1988 to 1989 and thecurve of incidence doesn't predict a flattening off until theyear 2010,&quot; Dr. Leigh said.   &quot;Over the years, millions of (Australians) in manyoccupations have been exposed to the asbestos fibers&quot; thatcause mesothelioma, said David Ferguson, one of the country'sleading experts on diseases caused by exposure to asbestos.&quot;Blue asbestos was used in an estimated 3,000 Australianproducts.&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Beijing University gave International Olympic CommitteePresident Juan Antonio Samaranch an honorary professorship.Mr. Samaranch is in Beijing with other committee members toassess the city's suitability as a site for the Olympics inthe year 2000. . . .
