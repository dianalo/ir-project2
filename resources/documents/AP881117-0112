The poachers were killed Wednesday in Tsavo East National Park ina gunbattle with paramilitary police, the Standard reported. Policesought an undisclosed number of other poachers Thursday, it said.   Police were sent to reinforce game rangers in Tsavo East andneighboring Tsavo West national parks, 225 miles south of Nairobi,in August after poachers killed a ranch foreman and a policeman.Nine policemen and rangers were injured.   The government has embarked on a campaign to stop the widespreadslaughter of its elephants. Newspapers say 160 elephants have beenkilled by poachers since May.   Kenya's elephant population has fallen by 15 percent in the past15 years, according to a United Nations study. An aerial survey inFebruary of the Tsavo area found fewer than 5,500 elephants, downfrom 35,000 in 1974.   Experts blame the intensified slaughter on an all-time high ivoryprice, which has climbed steadily since the early 1970s and averages$82 per pound.</TEXT></DOC>
