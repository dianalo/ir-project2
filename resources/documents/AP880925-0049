The Rev. Junipero Serra moved a step toward sainthood when hewas made a ``blessed'' of the Roman Catholic Church along with fiveother people, including a Mexican priest executed by a firing squad.   John Paul beatified the six in an open-air Mass in St. Peter'sSquare before a golden altar flanked by flowers and Swiss guards ingold, blue and red uniforms.   Speaking in English, the pope called Serra, an 18th centuryFranciscan monk, ``a shining example of Christian virtue and themissionary spirit.''   ``His great goal was to bring the Gospel to the native peoplesof America, so that they too might be `consecrated in the truth,'''John Paul told a crowd of 20,000 people.   ``He sowed the seeds of Christian faith amid the momentouschanges wrought by the arrival of European settlers in the NewWorld. It was a field of missionary endeavor that requiredpatience, perserverance and humility, as well as vision andcourage,'' the pontiff said.   Serra founded the first nine missions in what is now California,and his order eventually established 21. During his U.S. visit ayear ago, John Paul stood before Serra's grave at the CarmelMission Basilica and praised the monk for his missionary work amongthe Indians.   Critics say Serra stole the Indians' lands, refused to allowthem to leave the missions, forced them to work in the fields or onconstruction projects and exposed them to European diseases towhich they had no resistance.   A group of nine historians, asked by Bishop Thaddeus Shubsda ofMonterey, Calif., to give their opinions on Serra, said in a reportlast year that there was no evidence to support the charges againsthim.   They concluded Serra was being blamed for a few incidences ofabuse, most of which occurred years after his death in 1784.   Rev. Miguel Agustin Pro, a Jesuit priest executed by Mexicanpolice in 1927, was the only martyr to be beatified Sunday. He diedat the height of the conflict between the Roman Catholic Church andthe anti-clerical party that started the Mexican revolution andstill governs the country.   Pro was accused of taking part in an attempt to kill Mexicanruler Gen. Alvaro Obregon. He was arrested and executed without atrial.   In Mexico on Sunday, church bells rang in Chihuahua tocommemorate the beatification, and Mexicans packed Mexico City'sBasilica of Guadalupe, the country's most sacred shrine, for aspecial Mass.   Late Saturday, about 3,000 Catholics met at a building in MexicoCity where Pro was executed, then marched to the church where he isburied.   Among those at the gathering was Dolores Pro, a niece of thepriest.   ``I don't forget the reasons they killed my uncle,'' she said.``I want a free Mexico, democratic, with an effective vote.''   John Paul praised Pro for organizing secret communion servicesduring ``the years of presecution,'' but some believe Pro also wasa political activist who disguised himself as a laborer and mingledwith the working classes.   Photographs show Pro kneeling in prayer, then standing before agovernment firing squad with his arms open and holding a rosary anda crucifix before collapsing and receiving a final shot from apolice officer.   Just before he died, Pro shouted, ``Christ the king lives.''   The Mexican government has made no official comment about thebeatification. But a leftist magazine, Proceso, called it ``a slapin the face of the revolution.''   Others beatified Sunday were the Cardinal Giuseppe BenedettoDusmet, a 19th century archbishop of the Sicilian city of Cataniawho devoted his life to the poor; and the Rev. Francesco Faa diBruno, a 19th century Italian priest who founded an order of nuns.   The pope also beatified the Rev. Frederic Janssoone Bollengier,a French missionary in the Holy Land and Canada who died in 1916,and Josefa Naval Girbes, a 19th century Spanish woman who openedcatechism schools for young people and adults.</TEXT></DOC>
