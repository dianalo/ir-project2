Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., introduced theconstitutional amendment supported by President Bush and belittledthe idea, championed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden,D-Del., that the way to overcome the decision was a simple statutesatisfying the court's concerns about free speech rights.   ``There is no guarantee that the Biden bill will`constitutionalize' the federal flag desecration statute. ... Wewill have to wait perhaps three to five years for the courts to puttheir stamp of approval or rejection on the statute. That's simplytoo long for the American people to wait,'' Dole said.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., ranking Republican on the Judiciarycommittee, said he thought a constitutional amendment was ``the onlysound and safe way'' to protect the flag.   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honorwinner, said lawmakers were jumping too quickly to pushflag-protection legislation in order to gain political capital.   Kerrey said that while he was ``outraged by the decision,'' hehas come to believe there was no necessity to pass new legislation.Reading the decision, ``I was suprised to discover... (it was)reasonable, understandable and consistent with those values which Ibelieve have made America so wonderful.''   And the dissenting opinion of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, hesaid, might impose a ``functional litmus test of loyalty beforeexpression is permitted.''   ``Today, I declare that I don't support any of the constitutionalamendments which are being offered by my colleagues,'' he said,adding that even passage of new anti-flag burning statutes might be``more patronizing than necessary.''   Kerrey said the constitutional amendments ``create problemsrather than solving them, and Harvard University law professorLaurence Tribe delivered a similar message to the House subcommitteeon constitutional law.   ``There are many patriotic Americans who believe that thetoughest but best way to show respect for the flag _ to show why weare so different from those in Beijing who massacre protesters _ isto protect even the freedom of those who would desecrate this symbolof our freedom,'' he said.   Tribe said that could be accomplished through a statute likeBiden's, which would make it a federal crime, punishable by a fineof up to $1,000 and a year's imprisonment _ or both _ for someone toknowingly deface the flag.   The statute would remove all references in the existing federalflag burning statute to ``ideas communicated'' in the process offlag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself.   The Supreme Court held in its 5-4 ruling in the Texas case thatdesecrating the flag was protected under the Constitution's FirstAmendment guarantee of free speech insofar as the act of destroyingthe flag amounted to communicating a political point of view.   Tribe urged the lawmakers to ``count votes'' on the Supreme Courtlike they do in Congress, assuring them that changing a properlydrafted statute would win over a majority of the Court and as manyas seven justices.   ``I submit that's the response that best protects the flag,'' hesaid, without running the risk that an amendment could ``rip theheart out of the First Amendment.   Walter Dellinger of Duke University urged Congress not to touchthe Constitution because of the Texas flag-burning case of GregoryJohnson.   Johnson ``will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of hisfetid imagination'' if Congress reacts so strongly.   ``He will have succeeded in making the greatest nation on earth,if we give him this amendment, look just a little silly, a littleless brave and a little less free,'' he said.   But Republicans on the subcommittee expressed increasingimpatience with those resisting a constitutional amendment.   ``What's the reticence about amending the U.S. Constitution?''asked Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif. ``In my opinion, the flag isnot a light or idle cause.''   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., criticized ``all this hoopla about weshouldn't amend the constitution'' when, he said, the court itselfregularly amended it.   Paul Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation, said he believedthe court ruled incorrectly but now a constitutional amendment wasthe only way to proceed. He said that could be done without hurtingFirst Amendment rights.   ``The proposed amendment, properly understood, is not anamendment to the first amendment but merely overturns the court'sjudicial amendment to the constitution,'' he said. It would simplyput ``the law back where it was the day before the decision wasrendered.''   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., plans to bring to thefull House an anti-flag-burning statute, possibly before the Augustrecess, but has not scheduled any action on a constitutionalamendment. In the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell hasscheduled action in October on both approaches.</TEXT></DOC>
