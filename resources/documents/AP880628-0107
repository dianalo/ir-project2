Kirkpatrick would be ``one of the featured speakers'' atthe GOP convention in August.   Meanwhile, George Bush, the likely Republican presidentialnominee, was traveling to California today to visit a NASA researchcenter and a neighborhood safety program. Democrat Michael Dukakiswas touting his Massachusetts record on housing issues beforefocusing again on the search for a running mate.   The Republicans announced the convention role for Ms.Kirkpatrick, a favorite of conservatives, after the Democrats saidthey had chosen Texas State Treasurer Richards, a fiery populistorator, to deliver the keynote speech and ``set the tone'' for theDemocratic National Convention in Atlanta next month.   Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat, gave a widely publicizedspeech attacking the Democrats at the 1984 Republican convention.Republican Party chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said theannouncement of the keynote speaker for the New Orleans meetingwould probably come in the next ten days.   Ms. Richards, 54, will be the second woman in party history todeliver the convention-opening address.   Today, in an interview on CBS-TV, she mentioned fellow TexanBarbara Jordan's keynote speech in 1976 and added, ``That year theDemocrats went to the White House so maybe they saw my selection,having another female, as a good omen.''   Ms. Richards said she would consult with advisers to JesseJackson as well as Dukakis before preparing her speech. ``I welcomeany help and any advice that I get,'' she said.   Jackson, meanwhile, says he is weighing which of a dozen issuesleft out of the party platform to bring up at convention. Hiscomments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver and Washingtonover the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul ofparty rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.   Jackson was part of the sellout crowd of 21,785 in AtlanticCity, N.J., who watched Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks in thefirst round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown.   Dukakis will travel on Wednesday to Washington to meet withseveral dozen senators, including some who have been mentioned aspossible running mates.   Among them is Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, although he said Monday hewas not providing the Dukakis campaign with background andfinancial information it has requested of prospective running mates.   Nunn said he had told Dukakis and campaign chairman PaulBrountas that a spot on the Democratic ticket is ``not on myagenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for a running mate.   Another prominent senator, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, last weeksaid he had informed Dukakis that he did not want to be considered.And the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today, citingunidentified sources, that House Majority Leader Tom Foley, who hassaid frequently that he doesn't want to be vice president, hadchosen not to have Dukakis' aides examine his personal backgroundand finances.   Those under consideration, according to sources, includeJackson, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Nunn, John Glenn of Ohio, andLloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Reps. Foley of Washington and LeeHamilton of Indiana.   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardtalso reportedly have been asked to provide information to Brountas.   Aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing thechoice for he second spot on the ticket.   Jackson has continued to talk about his own qualifications as arunning mate for Dukakis. And although he says he's happy withparts of the platform, he is indicating that some points ofdisagreement will be brought up at the convention.   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in theplatform,'' Jackson said Monday. But he noted that his forces had``protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues inAtlanta.''   One of those issues might be a call for the creation of aPalestinian homeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusionin the platform.   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienateanyone,'' Jackson said in Rosemont, Ill.   In announcing the selection of Ms. Richards as the keynotespeaker for the Democrats, party chief Paul G. Kirk said she would``set the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and... draw thedistinctions between the party of the working American people andthe party of the establishment.''   In Texas, Ms. Richards, the divorced mother of four grownchildren, said: ``I probably will be talking very much aboutAmerican families. I think that's what I know the most about, otherthan my professional job.''   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for theconvention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta ofCalifornia, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.   Bush met Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin inWashington amid more bad news in the polls.</TEXT></DOC>
