(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle managers met Thursdayfor two days of discussions to select a launch date for spaceshuttle Discovery.   An announcement is expected Friday afternoon.   NASA officials said Wednesday the launch of Discovery and itsfive astronauts would be delayed until at least March 11 because ofa crushed electrical part on one of the shuttle's three main engines.   Until then, the space agency had been targeting March 9 forliftoff but that date became questionable Monday when the Air Forceannounced that it planned to launch a high-priority military rocketon that date and could not support a shuttle flight with itstracking facilities until the 11th.   The electrical part problem apparently resolved that potentialconflict. However, a delay in the military flight could affect theshuttle launch on a day-by-day basis.   The Air Force mission, believed to be a satellite launch for theStrategic Defense Initiative, has priority for national securityreasons.   During a readiness test of Discovery's three main engines, acontrol mechanism on engine No. 1 shut down prematurely, NASA said.The problem was traced to a crushed solenoid, a coil of wire thatacts like a bar magnet when carrying an electrical current.   Officials believe the solenoid was damaged when hit by equipmentbeing used to install a new turbopump in the engine.   A replacement part was flown here and installed late Wednesday.The installation and checkout meant a slip of at least two days inthe shuttle launch, NASA said.   During five days in orbit, Discovery's astronauts are to deploy alarge communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
