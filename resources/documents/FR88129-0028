(hereinafter ``the rule''). The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment of genetically engineered tomatoplants that are designed to be tolerant to the herbicide bromoxynil. Inthe course of reviewing the application, APHIS assessed the impact to theenvironment of releasing the tomato plants under the conditions describedin the Calgene application. APHIS concluded that the field testing willnot present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and willalso not cause any significant impact on the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene for herbicide tolerance has been inserted into a chromosome ofthese tomato plants. In nature, genetic material contained on the chromosomesof tomato plants can only be transferred to other compatible plants bycross-pollination. In this field test, the introduced gene cannot spreadto other plants by cross-pollination for the following reasons: (1) Thefield test pilot is located a sufficient distance from any compatible plantswith which the genetically engineered tomato plants might cross-pollinate;(2) no pollen will be produced since the tops of the plants will be removedupon flower initiation; and (3) the field test will be conducted at a timeof year when tomatoes are rarely grown.2. Neither the herbicide tolerance gene itself, nor its gene product conferson the tomato plant any plant pest characteristics. Traits that lead toweediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannot be conferred by addinga single herbicide tolerance gene.3. The bacterium from which the herbicide gene was isolated is not a plantpest and is widely distributed in the soil.4. The herbicide tolerance gene does not provide the transformed tomatoplants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomatoplants in their ability to be disseminated or to become established inthe environment. 5. The vector used to transfer the herbicide tolerance gene to tomato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant pathogenicity havebeen removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to benonpathogenic to plants. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vector DNAand the herbicide tolerance gene into the plant cell, has been shown tohave been eliminated and no longer associated with the transformed tomatoplants. 7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome where it is inserted intothe plant chromosomal DNA, and the remaining vector material degrades.The vector does not survive in the plant. No mechanism exists in natureto move the inserted gene from the plant to other organisms. 8. Bromoxynil is one of the new herbicides that is rapidly degraded inthe environment. It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than manyherbicides commonly used. 9. The size of the test plot is very small (96 feet wide by 750 feet long)and is biologically isolated from many species of wild plants and animalsby a surrounding area of cultivated land. 10. The plot has good physical security. Physical isolation will be ensuredand incursion by large animals and humans will be prevented by a chain-linkedfence surrounding the plot. The occupants of a nearby farm house will provideadditional security. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274). <ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 25th day of January, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
