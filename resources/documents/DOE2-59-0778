Geneticmethods of control that specifically aim to reduce pest abundance byaltering the genetic makeup of individuals in field populations are viewedas one important alternative or adjunct approach to chemical control.There is a tendency to classify methods of pest control according tothe predominant discipline involved in the development of the technology.This basis for classification can divert attention from the essentiallygenetic dimensions of control measures, such as pesticides, syntheticsex pheromones, sterile insect techniques and genetic manipulation, whetherby classical cytogenetic methods or recombinant-DNA procedures. By wayof contrast, cytoplasmic incompatibility, traditionally viewed as a geneticapproach because such phenomena are usually studied by geneticists, isprobably more a host/parasite phenomenon. The paper attempts to applya genetic perspective to the diverse array of control measures currentlyused by pest managers and examines the prevailing concepts of geneticcontrol of insect pests and whether these have any legitimate claim tobecoming practical tools for controlling major insect pests. A seriouslimitation to the development of genetic methods of pest control hasbeen the absence of sustained genetic studies on important pest species,such as the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) and other pests from theDiptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera orders. The application of classicalcytogenetic and modern molecular biology techniques offers considerablepromise in improving sterile insect techniques and for developing genuinelynovel methods of autocidal control. However, these newer techniques areunlikely to realize their full potential if they are not developed hand-in-handwith the more traditional techniques of physiology, biochemistry, behaviourand ecology. 32 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
