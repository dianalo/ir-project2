Ransom, Marketing OrderAdministration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2525-S,P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456; telephone: (202) 447-5120.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This proposed rule is issued underMarketing Agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR Part 989), both as amended,regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California.The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation No. 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' ruleunder cirteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 23 handlers of raisins who are subject to regulationunder the raisin marketing order and approximately 5,000 producers in theregulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the SmallBusiness Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those having gross annual revenuesfor the last three years of less than $500,000, and small agriculturalservice firms are defined as those whose gross annual receipts are lessthan $3,500,000. The majority of producers and a minority of handlers ofCalifornia raisins may be classified as small entities. This proposed rule invites comments on increasing handler compensationunder the California raisin marketing order. This action would increasethe rates at which handlers are paid for receiving, storing, fumigating,and handling reserve tonnage raisins and also for reserve tonnage raisinsheld by handlers beyond the crop year of acquisition for the account ofthe RAC. Both of these changes were recommended by the RAC. The marketing order authorizes, for the total annual California raisincrop, the establishment of final free and reserve percentages for volumeregulation purposes. Raisins in the reserve percentage category must beheld by handlers in a reserve pool on handlers' premises for the accountof the RAC. Currently, for example, handlers are free to market 70 percentof the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins they receive and must hold30 percent in reserve. This proposed rule would increase the compensationrate for receiving, storing, fumigating, and handling reserve tonnage raisinsacquired by handlers during a particular crop year and held for the accountof the RAC and for reserve tonnage raisins held by handlers beyond thecrop year of acquisition for the account of the RAC. Since August 1, 1983,handlers have been compensated at a rate of $38.75 per ton for providingthese services. Additional payment for reserve tonnage raisins held beyondthe crop year of acquisition has been $1.94 per ton for each month of thethree-month period ending November 30, and $1.00 per ton for each monthof the next nine months. The RAC conducted a survey among handlers on the cost of receiving, storing,fumigating, and handling the 1988-89 raisin reserve pool. The RAC determinedthat costs ranged from approximately $30.00 per ton to approximately $57.00per ton. Therefore, the RAC recommended that the compensation rate be increasedfrom $38.75 per ton to $40.00 per ton to more closely reflect increasesin the costs for handlers to provide services on reserve pool raisins.In addition, the RAC recommended that payment to handlers for reserve heldbeyond the end of the crop year be increased proportionately. Therefore,additional payment for reserve tonnage raisins held beyond the crop yearof acquisition would be increased from $1.94 per ton to $2.00 per ton foreach month of the three-month period ending November 30, and from $1.00per ton to $1.03 per ton for each month of the next nine months. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determinedthat issuance of this proposed rule would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on thisproposal. A 15-day comment period is deemed adequate because the changes,if adopted, should be in effect for the new crop year which begins on August1. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 989 </ITAG>California, Grapes, Marketing agreements and orders, Raisins.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 989 is proposed tobe amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 989_RAISINS PRODUCED FROM GRAPES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA </ITAG>1.
